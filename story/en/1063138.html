That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last 20 years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don’t even know about each other.</p><p>几个世纪以来，西方文化被人类是自私的生物的想法所渗透。在电影和小说，历史书籍和科学研究中宣布了人类的愤世嫉俗形象。但在过去的20年里，发生了非凡的事情。来自世界各地的科学家已经转向了一个更有希望的人类的观点。这种发展仍然如此年轻，不同领域的研究人员甚至不知道彼此。</p><p> When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can’t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups.</p><p> 当我开始写一本关于这种更有希望的观点的书时，我知道有一个故事我必须解决。它在太平洋的某个地方的一个荒岛上进行。飞机刚刚走了。唯一的幸存者是一些英国男生，他们无法相信他们的好运。除了海滩，贝壳和水分为英里。更好，但还没有成长。</p><p> On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group’s leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: 1) Have fun. 2) Survive. 3) Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges – to pinch, to kick, to bite.</p><p> 在第一天，男孩们研究了一种民主的民主。 One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group’s leader.运动，魅力和帅气，他的游戏计划很简单：1）玩得开心。 2）生存。 3）对通过船舶进行烟雾信号。第一是成功。其他？没那么多。男孩们对盛宴和嬉戏比抚育火灾更感兴趣。在长期以来，他们已经开始画画脸。脱掉衣服。而且他们发展了强劲的冲动 - 捏，踢，咬人。</p><p> By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. “I should have thought,” the officer says, “that a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” At this, Ralph bursts into tears. “Ralph wept for the end of innocence,” we read, and for “the darkness of man’s heart”.</p><p> 当英国海军军官到岸时，岛上是一个闷烧的荒地。三个孩子死了。 “我应该想到，”这位官员说：“一包英国男孩将能够提高一个比这更好的表现。”在此，拉尔夫突然泪流满面。 “拉尔夫在纯真的结束时，”我们读到了“人心中的黑暗”。</p><p>  This story never happened. An English schoolmaster,  William Golding, made up this story in 1951 – his novel  Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than 30 languages and hailed as one of the classics of the 20th century. In hindsight, the secret to the book’s success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the 1960s on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us?</p><p>  这个故事从未发生过。 1951年威廉·戈尔登的英语校长 - 他的小说中的苍蝇王将出售数百万份副本，翻译成30多种语言，并作为20世纪的经典之一。在后古，这本书成功的秘诀很清楚。 Golding有一种庞大的能力来描绘人类最黑暗的深度。当然，他在他身边有1960年代的Zeitgeist，当一代新一代询问其父母关于第二次世界大战的暴行。奥斯赫维茨一直是一个异常，他们想知道，还是在我们每个人中都有纳粹隐藏？</p><p> I first read  Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding’s view of human nature. That didn’t happen until years later when I began delving into the author’s life. I learned what an unhappy individual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression; a man who beat his kids. “I have always understood the Nazis,” Golding confessed, “because I am of that sort by nature.” And it was “partly out of that sad self-knowledge” that he wrote  Lord of the Flies.</p><p> 我第一次读过苍蝇的主作为少年。我记得之后感到失望，但不是一秒钟我认为怀疑戈尔明的人性观。直到几年后，我开始钻研作者的生活。我了解了他所渴望的人：酗酒，容易抑郁;一个打败他的孩子的男人。 “我一直懂纳粹，”戈尔登承认“，因为我是那种归功于自然的。”它是“部分摆脱了这种悲惨的自我知识”，他写了苍蝇的王。</p><p> I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared  Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life  Lord of the Flies. After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: “One day, in 1977, six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.”</p><p> 我开始奇怪：如果他们在荒岛上独自发现自己，有没有学过真正的孩子会做什么？我写了一篇关于这个主题的文章，其中我比较了苍蝇的主才能与现代的科学见解，并得出结论，在所有概率中，孩子们都会非常不同。读者蠕动地回应了。我所有的例子都涉及家里的孩子，在学校或夏令营。从而开始我寻求一个真实的苍蝇之王。在网上拖网后，我遇到了一个晦涩的博客，讲述了一个逮捕的故事：“有一天，1977年，六个男孩从田田举行的钓鱼之旅中出现......陷入了巨大的风暴，男孩们被造成巨大的风暴在一个荒岛上。他们做了什么，这个小部落？他们达成协议，从不争吵。“ </p><p>  The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to 1977 turned out to have been a typo. In the 6 October 1966 edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: “Sunday showing for Tongan castaways”. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of ‘Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys’ adventure.</p><p>这篇文章没有提供任何来源。但有时它所需要的只是运气的中风。有一天通过报纸归档，我在那里键入了一年。对1977年的参考文献原来是一个错字。 1966年10月6日，澳大利亚报纸的年龄，一个标题跳出来：“周日为汤加铸造展示”。涉及六个星期的六个男孩在汤加南部的岩石岛屿南部的岩石岛屿南部的岩石岛屿群体。在被澳大利亚队长被淹没在“ATA岛上超过一年多”之后，男孩们已经被救援了。根据这篇文章的说法，船长甚至收到了电视台来电影重新制定男孩的冒险。</p><p> I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain’s name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: “Mates share 50-year bond”. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: “Deep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is 83 years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, 67, was, literally, a child of nature.” Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island.</p><p> 我正在突破问题。男孩还活着吗？我可以找到电视镜头吗？但最重要的是，我有一个领导：船长的名字是彼得华纳。当我搜查他时，我有另一个运气的行程。在澳大利亚Mackay的最近一个小型本地文件中，我遇到了标题：“伙伴们分享50年债券”。旁边打印是两个男人的一小照片，微笑着，一个带着他的手臂围绕着。这篇文章开始：“在Tullera附近的Banana种植园，坐在Lismore附近，坐在一个不太可能的伙伴......老年人是83岁，是一个富裕的工业家的儿子。年轻人，67人，从字面上，是一个自然的孩子。“他们的名字？彼得华纳和Mano Totau。他们在哪里见面？在一个荒岛上。</p><p> My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys 50 years ago, Captain Peter Warner.</p><p> 我的妻子Maartje和我在布里斯班租了一辆车，大约三个小时后到达了我们的目的地，在难以谈论的谷歌地图中间的一个地方。然而，在那里，他坐在一个低矮的房子前面的泥土路上：50年前救出了六个失去的男孩的男子，彼得华纳队长。</p><p>  Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the 1930s, Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country’s radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father’s footsteps. Instead, at the age of 17, he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain’s certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. “What’s easiest?” Peter asked. “Accountancy,” Arthur lied.</p><p>  彼得是亚瑟华纳最小的儿子，曾经是澳大利亚最富有和最强大的男性之一。回到20世纪30年代，亚瑟统治了一个名为电子工业的广大帝国，当时占据了该国的无线电市场。彼得在父亲的脚步上追随着追随者。而是在17岁时，他逃往海上寻找冒险，并在未来几年从香港乘船到上海至圣彼得堡的斯德哥尔摩。当他终于返回五年后，浪子儿子自豪地向他的父亲赠送了瑞典船长的证书。不受欢迎，华纳SR要求他的儿子学习有用的职业。 “什么是最简单的？”彼得问道。 “会计”，“亚瑟撒了。</p><p> Peter went to work for his father’s company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of 1966. On the way home he took a little detour and that’s when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, ‘Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, ‘Ata had been deserted – cursed and forgotten.</p><p> 彼得去为父亲的公司工作，但大海仍然招手，每当他能去塔斯马尼亚岛，他都是他自己的钓鱼舰队。这是它在1966年冬天将他带到汤加。在回家的路上，他花了一点绕道而行，那是他看到它的时候：蔚蓝的海洋中的一个迷人岛，'ATA。岛上曾经居住过一次，直到1863年在1863年的一天，当一个奴隶出现在地平线上并与当地人一起航行。从那时起，'ATA已经荒芜 - 诅咒和遗忘。</p><p>  But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. “In the tropics it’s unusual for fires to start spontaneously,” he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. “My name is Stephen,” he cried in perfect English. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here 15 months.”</p><p>  但彼得注意到奇怪的东西。他穿过他的双筒望远镜，他在绿色悬崖上看到了烧焦的斑块。 “在热带地区，火灾自发地开始是不寻常的，”他告诉我们半个世纪以后。然后他看到了一个男孩。裸。头发到他的肩膀。这种野生生物从悬崖突然跳进水中。突然间，更多的男孩跟着，尖叫着肺部。第一个男孩到达船只并不长时间。 “我的名字是斯蒂芬，”他以完美的英语哭泣。 “我们六个人，我们估计我们已经在这里15个月了。”</p><p> The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku‘alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku‘alofa. “I’ve got six kids here,” he told the operator. “Stand by,” came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: “You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”</p><p> 男孩们曾经乘坐，声称他们是汤山首都Nuku'alofa寄宿学校的学生。学校饭菜厌倦了，他们决定有一天拿出渔船，只能在风暴中陷入困境。可能的故事，彼得想。使用他的双向收音机，他呼吁Nuku'alofa。 “我在这里有六个孩子，”他告诉经营者。 “立场，”回应。二十分钟挑剔。 （正如彼得告诉这部分故事的那样，他会有点朦胧。）最后，一位非常泪流满面的操作员来到收音机上，并说：“你找到了他们！这些男孩已经被放弃了死亡。举行葬礼。如果是他们，这是一个奇迹！“ </p><p> In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on ‘Ata. Peter’s memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of 90, everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, 15 years old at the time and now pushing 70, who lived just a few hours’ drive from him. The real  Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965. The protagonists were six boys – Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano – all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku‘alofa. The oldest was 16, the youngest 13, and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some 500 miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand.</p><p>在遵循的几个月里，我试图尽可能地重建在ATA上发生的事情。彼得的记忆结果是出色的。即使在90岁时，他讲述的一切都与我最重要的来源达成一致，曼诺在当时15岁，现在推70岁，谁住了几个小时的行车。 Mano告诉我们，迈诺的真正的苍蝇之王，1965年6月开始。主角是六个男孩 -  Sione，斯蒂芬，科罗，大卫，卢克和曼诺 - 在Nuku'alofa的严格天主教寄宿学校的所有瞳孔。最古老的是16，最年轻的13岁，他们有一个共同点：他们很无聊。所以他们提出了一个逃脱的计划：到斐济，远远超过500英里，甚至一直到新西兰。</p><p> There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to “borrow” one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn’t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass.</p><p> 只有一个障碍。他们都没有拥有一条船，所以他们决定“借”一个渔民，他们一直来自Taniela Uhila先生，他们都不喜欢。男孩们花了很少的时间准备航行。两袋香蕉，几件椰子和一个小型燃气燃烧器都是他们包装的所有用品。他们中的任何一个都没有达到地图，更不用说罗盘。</p><p>  No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair; only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. “We drifted for eight days,” Mano told me. “Without food. Without water.” The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening.</p><p>  没有人注意到那个晚上离开港口的小工艺。天空是公平的;只有温和的微风飘向平静的大海。但那天晚上，男孩们犯了一个严重的错误。他们睡着了。几个小时后，他们醒来时醒来的水崩溃了。当时太黑了。他们吊装帆，风会迅速撕成碎片。旁边的旁边是舵。 “我们八天飘了八天，”Mano告诉我。 “没有食物。没有水。“男孩们试过捕鱼。他们设法在镂空的椰子壳中收集一些雨水，并在它们之间平等分享，每次都在早上和晚上啜饮。</p><p> Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, ‘Ata is considered uninhabitable. But “by the time we arrived,” Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, “the boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.” While the boys in  Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year.</p><p> 然后，在第八天，他们在地平线上躲过了一个奇迹。一个小岛屿，精确。不是挥舞着棕榈树和沙滩的热带天堂，而是一个巨大的岩石巨大的岩石，在海洋中伸出了超过一千英尺。这些天，ATA被认为是不可居住的。但是，“当我们到达时，”船长华纳在他的回忆录中写道，“男孩们已经建立了一个小公会与食品花园，镂空的树干，储存雨水，一个有好奇的体育馆，羽毛球场，鸡笔和永久的火，所有来自手工，旧刀片刀片和多样的决心。“虽然苍蝇之王的男孩们来吹过火，但那些真正的版本中的人倾向于他们的火焰，所以它永远不会出去，一年多。</p><p>  The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat – an instrument Peter has kept all these years – and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf.</p><p>  孩子们同意在两支球队中工作，制定一个严格的花园，厨房和保护责任单。有时他们会争吵，但每当发生这种情况时，他们会通过强加一超时解决它。他们的日子开始了歌曲和祷告。 Kolo从一块漂流木，半椰子壳和六条钢丝从失事船上抢购的施工吉他 - 这几年彼得佩特一直保持着 - 并扮演它来帮助提升他们的精神。他们的精神需要提升。整个夏天都很久很难下雨，渴望渴望男孩疯狂。他们试图建造一个木筏，以离开岛屿，但它在撞击冲浪中崩溃了。</p><p> Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. “Don’t worry,” Sione joked. “We’ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa‘ahau Tupou himself!”</p><p> 最糟糕的一天，斯蒂芬有一天滑倒，掉下了一个悬崖并摔断了腿。另一个男孩在他之后挑选了他们的方式，然后帮助他回到顶部。他们用棍子和叶子设置了他的腿。 “别担心，”Sione开玩笑。 “我们会做你的工作，而你躺在那里像国王taufa'au tupou自己！”</p><p> They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat); seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the 100 years since the last Tongans had left).</p><p> 他们最初幸存下来，椰子，驯服鸟类（他们喝了血液以及吃肉）;海鸟鸡蛋被吸干。后来，当他们到达岛上的顶部时，他们发现了一个古老的火山岩火山口，人们以前生活过一个世纪。男孩们发现了野生芋头，香蕉和鸡（自上次汤纳已留下的100年）。 </p><p>  They were finally rescued on Sunday 11 September 1966. The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen’s perfectly healed leg. But this wasn’t the end of the boys’ little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku‘alofa police boarded Peter’s boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had “borrowed” 15 months earlier, was still furious, and he’d decided to press charges.</p><p>他们终于在1966年9月11日星期日获救了。当地医师后来对他们肌肉发达的物质和斯蒂芬完全愈合的腿表示惊人。但这不是男孩们的冒险结束，因为当他们到达Nuku'alofa警察登机彼得船时，逮捕了男孩们，并在监狱里扔了他们。 Taniela Uhila先生，男孩们在早些时候“借用”15个月的帆船，仍然愤怒，他决定按收费。</p><p> Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father’s corporate accountant, Peter managed the company’s film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel 7 in Sydney. “You can have the Australian rights,” he told them. “Give me the world rights.” Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila £150 for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel 7 arrived.</p><p> 幸运的是，为男孩们来说，彼得想出了一个计划。它发生在他的沉船故事是完美的好莱坞材料。作为他父亲的企业会计师，彼得管理了该公司的电影权，并在电视中了解人员。所以从汤加来看，他在悉尼召集了频道7的经理。 “你可以拥有澳大利亚的权利，”他告诉他们。 “给我世界权利。”接下来，彼得为他的旧船支付了Uhila先生150英镑，并让男孩们发布了他们将与电影合作的条件。几天后，来自频道7的团队到达。</p><p> The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Haʻafeva – population 900 – had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. “Thank you for rescuing six of my subjects,” His Royal Highness said. “Now, is there anything I can do for you?” The captain didn’t have to think long. “Yes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.” The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father’s company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat.</p><p> 当男孩们回到汤加的家庭时的心情是欢腾的。几乎整个Ha'afeva  - 人口900岛 - 原来欢迎他们回家。彼得被宣称为一个国家英雄。很快他收到了来自Taufa'auuttupou IV国王的消息，邀请了队长的观众。 “谢谢你救援我的六个科目，”他的皇家殿下说。 “现在，有什么我能为你做的吗？”船长没有思考长。 “是的！我想陷入这些水域的龙虾，并在这里开始一个业务。“国王同意了。彼得回到悉尼，辞去了父亲的公司并委托了一艘新船。然后他有六个男孩带来了一定的事情，并给了他们所开始的东西：有机会看到汤加超越世界。他聘请了他们作为他新渔船的船员。</p><p> While the boys of ‘Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding’s book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. “I read and reread  Lord of the Flies ,” divulged the creator of hit series  Survivor in an interview.</p><p> 虽然'ATA的男孩被犯罪到默默无闻，但Golding的书仍然被广泛阅读。媒体历史学家甚至信用他今天是当今电视上最受欢迎的娱乐类型之一的不知名的发起者：现实电视。 “我读书并重读了苍蝇之王，”在面试中透露了击中系列幸存者的创造者。</p><p> It’s time we told a different kind of story. The real  Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty; one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter’s picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands. His memoirs, he explained, written for his children and grandchildren. I looked down at the first page. “Life has taught me a great deal,” it began, “including the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.”</p><p> 是时候我们讲述了不同的故事。真正的苍蝇之王是友谊和忠诚的故事;说明我们是否可以互相倾斜，我们有多强劲。在我的妻子拿了彼得的照片之后，他转向一个内阁并睁大眼睛，然后拿出一堆沉重的论文，他躺在我手中。他的回忆录，他向他的孩子和孙子写了。我望着第一页。 “生活教会了我很多，”它开始了，“包括你应该总是寻找人们的好和积极的课程。”</p><p> •  This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore.
