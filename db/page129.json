The attackers can also add apps disguised as Netflix and Spotify to encourage users to input login credentials for later malicious use.\n  McAfee originally notified Peloton of the security issue in March. Peloton&#39;s head of global information security, Adrian Stone, said: &#34;We pushed a mandatory update in early June.&#34;\n  This is just the latest headache for Peloton users. Just last month,  Peloton recalled some of its treadmills following reports of over 70 injuries and the death of a 6-year-old child. Around the same time, the company issued an update after another  security company revealed that hackers can snoop on Peloton users and find out their age, gender, location and even workout stats.\n  Pelotons have been one of the biggest fitness success stories of the pandemic. As gyms shuttered their doors and people were stuck at home, Peloton sales soared despite their huge price tag \u2014 stationary Peloton bikes can set you back by about $1,900, and its treadmills can cost upwards of $4,000. Last year, Peloton&#39;s  revenue doubled to $1.8 billion.\n    The latest vulnerability primarily affects bikes in public spaces, but an attacker could interfere with the equipment at any point in the supply chain, from construction to delivery, according to the report.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 11:17:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,problem,peloton", "title": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684Peloton\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9ed1\u5ba2\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e ", "title_en": "A New Peloton Problem: Hackers Can Access Personal Data", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.npr.org/2021/06/16/1007137982/your-pricey-peloton-has-another-problem-for-you-to-sweat-over", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ed1\u5ba2", "problem", "peloton"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066370, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "PowerShell\u548cNushell\u5c06Unix\u7ba1\u9053\u8d85\u51fa\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u6d41\u6216\u952e\u5165\u6570\u636e\u3002\u662f\u5426\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8d1d\u58f3\u822c\u7684bash\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u952e\u5165\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff1f\n \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\uff0c\u6211\uff06\uff0339;

Is it possible to keep a traditional shelllike bash and still get typed pipes?\n I think it is possible, and I&#39;m now surprised noone seems to have done ityet. This is a fairly detailed design for how to do it. I&#39;ve notimplemented it yet. RFC.\n Let&#39;s start with a command called  typed. You can use it in a pipelinelike this:\n  What  typed does is discover the types of the commands to its left and itsright, while communicating the type of the command it runs back to them.Then it checks if the types match, and runs the command, communicating thetype information to it. Pipes are unidirectional, so it may seem hardto discover the type to the right, but I&#39;ll explain how it can be donein a minute.\n Now suppose that foo generates json, and bar filters structured data of avariety of types, and baz consumes csv and pretty-prints a table. Then barwill be informed that its input is supposed to be json, and that its outputshould be csv. If bar didn&#39;t support json,  typed foo and  typed barwould both fail with a type error.\n Writing &#34;typed&#34; in front of everything is annoying. But it can be made ashell alias like &#34;t&#34;. It also possible to wrap programs using  typed:\n  Or program could import a library that uses  typed, so itnatively supports being used in typed pipelines. I&#39;ll explain one way tomake such a library later on, once some more details are clear.\n   If one of the commands is not actually typed, the other ones in the pipe willtreat it as having a raw stream of text as input or output.Which will sometimes result in a type error (yay, I love type errors!),but in other cases can do something useful.\n find | bar | baz# type error, bar expected json or csvfoo | bar | less# less displays csv\n So how does  typed discover the types of the commands to the left andright? That&#39;s the hard part. It has to start by finding the pids to itsleft and right. There is no really good way to do that, but on Linux, itcan be done: Look at what  /proc/self/fd/0 and  /proc/self/fd/1 link to,which contains the unique identifiers of the pipes. Then look at otherprocesses&#39;  fd/0 and  fd/1 to find matching pipe identifiers. (It&#39;s alsopossible to do this on OSX, I believe. I don&#39;t know about BSDs.)\n Searching through all processes would be a bit expensive (around 15 ms withan average number of processes), but there&#39;s a nice optimisation:The shell will have started the processes close together in time, so thepids are probably nearby. So look at the previous pid, and the nextpid, and fan outward. Also, check  isatty to detect the beginning and endof the pipeline and avoid scanning all the processes in those cases.\n To indicate the type of the command it will run,  typed simply opensa file with an extension of &#34;.typed&#34;. The file can be locatedanywhere, and can be an already existing file, or can be created as needed(eg in  /run). Once it discovers the pid at the other end of apipe,  typed first looks at  /proc/$pid/cmdline to see if it&#39;salso running  typed. If it is, it looks at its open file handlesto find the first &#34;.typed&#34; file. It may need to wait for it the file handleto get opened, which is why it needs to verify the pid is running  typed.\n There also needs to be a way for  typed to learn the type of the commandit will run. Reading  /usr/share/typed/$command.typed is one way.Or it can be specified at the command line, which is useful for wrapper scripts:\n  And  typed communicates the type information to the command that it runs.This way a command like  bar can know what format its input should be in,and what format to use as output. This might be done with environmentvariables, eg  INPUT_TYPE=JSON and  OUTPUT_TYPE=CSV\n I think that&#39;s everything  typed needs, except for the syntax of types andhow the type checking works. Which I should probably not try to think upoff the cuff. I used Haskell ADT syntax in the example above, but don&#39;tthink that&#39;s necessarily the right choice.\n Finally, here&#39;s how to make a library that lets a program natively supportbeing used in a typed pipeline. It&#39;s a bit tricky, because it has to run typed, because  typed checks  /proc/$pid/cmdline as detailed above. So,check an environment variable. When not set yet, set it, and exec  typed,passing it the path to the program, which it will re-exec. This shouldbe done before program does anything else.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 10:34:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u952e\u5165,pipes", "title":

\u8c22\u8c22\u4f60\u4eec\u3002 ", "note_en": "Last November at the Haskell eXchange conference, Simon Peyton Jones announced  the Haskell Foundation. This can be understood as many things: an organization dedicated to the hard work of making  Haskell more successful and useful, a touchpoint for different parts of the Haskell community to come together and cooperate, and a focus knob to direct general support (financial and otherwise) for the Haskell community and maximize its impact.\n  I recently decided to become a m  ajor  contributor to the Haskell Foundation, and I\u2019m writing about the reasons behind my decision. I also hope to encourage others who can easily do so (and  only those who can easily do so) to join me in pledging ongoing support for the organization as individuals with passion and love for Haskell and its community. In short, there\u2019s a real opportunity here and we\u2019re always stronger when we act together.\n  I hope this goes without saying, but I will say it anyway. Haskell has, for many years now, been a source of great joy in my life. It has been a way to unwind, whether it\u2019s solving  Project Euler problems, throwing together a  physics demo, or solving a  math problem. It\u2019s been with me when I just need to get away from the stresses of daily life. It has also been my life\u2019s work. Though I\u2019ve yet to be paid to write Haskell, my volunteer work in schools,  teaching children with Haskell, has been my way to give back to the world and accomplish something meaningful with my life.\n But more than that: it has been my community. The first time I attended a Haskell user group, I impulsively jumped on a plane from the U.S. to Cambridge, U.K. on a few days notice, for an event called  AngloHaskell. There, I met so many phenomenal people \u2014 Simon Peyton-Jones, Neil Mitchell, Don Stewart, Simon Marlow, and more \u2014 all in one fantastic weekend! Since then, I\u2019ve continued to be welcomed in this community at  ICFP,  BayHac,  Compose,  The New York Haskell User\u2019s Group,  Atlanta Functional Programming Meetup, and even helped run a couple Haskell events in Atlanta and New York. More importantly, the people I\u2019ve met in this community are some of my closest friends. They\u2019ve been with me through not just technical challenges, but also times of loneliness and struggle as well as times of celebration.\n I know this is not just me. I\u2019ve lost count of the stories I have heard from others about how our community welcomed them when they needed a friend, felt alienated and alone, doubted themselves, or felt like they couldn\u2019t make it in the world. These are people I\u2019ve mentored, and also people who have mentored me. They are close friends, and a few distant acquaintances. We\u2019re all in this together. Not all of these people are able to contribute to Haskell financially, but they are here nevertheless, passing along that kind of support to others. I like to think I\u2019m donating in their name, also.\n Of course, there are lots of great technical arguments for Haskell. That\u2019s why I got involved in the first place, and I wholeheartedly believe in them. At some point, though, I was surprised to discover that isn\u2019t what matters. Haskell isn\u2019t just a programming language. It\u2019s the place where I belong.\n  Now it\u2019s time to remove those rose-colored glasses. As a community, we have challenges. We can be downright embarrassing. We can be frustrating, fractured, and lost.\n As a small language community, we naturally have big gaps: documentation, compatibility, library maintenance, education materials, etc. Let\u2019s face it: most mainstream programming languages operate with big support from big names in the tech industry, like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Mozilla, Sun (R.I.P.), or Apple paying dozens or even hundreds of full-time core language and library contributors. Haskell operates on a fraction of that kind of support. Instead, we have a community of mostly volunteers, who care deeply about what they are doing but often don\u2019t even use Haskell professionally themselves!\n We have our share of communication problems. It wasn\u2019t too long ago that the whole Haskell community felt on the verge of collapse, with separate and competing Haskell language websites set up to vie for some authority and image of official support for their own ideas of the right way to do things. But we  are strong enough to overcome these challenges, to fix these divisions, and to be better for it. We are fortunate to have people of phenomenal character who we all admire and trust \u2014 especially Simon Peyton-Jones, our figurehead and inspiration. His kindness and even-tempered friendly spirit have healed many of these divisions when it seemed beyond all hope! Thanks, Simon. The rest of us are doing better these days, as well. But it\u2019s going to take a sustained long-term effort.\n The Haskell Foundation is  well placed to meet these challenges head on. As an umbrella organization looking after the entire Haskell user experience, it\u2019s set up to recognize the places where our individual projects need help, or fail to meet needs, and make sure users aren\u2019t slipping through the cracks between different projects, visions, and personalities. With  strong leadership across the whole community, it\u2019s also perfectly suited and thoughtfully led to help resolve conflict, build consensus, and find ways forward in the midst of differences of opinion. This is a phenomenal resource for solving some of the great challenges facing our community.\n  Let\u2019s talk about the Haskell community. One of the things that\u2019s always set Haskell\u2019s community apart is that it\u2019s  not a typical programming language community. Haskell has generally maintained strong representation from several very different groups:\n Academics who use Haskell as a testbed to try cutting-edge new ideas and build a better future for programming languages.\n  Professionals who use Haskell, cutting edge innovations and all, to solve so-called \u201creal world\u201d \u2014 that is, business \u2014 problems. (An unfortunate term, indeed, because of course  all of Haskell\u2019s users are part of the real world!)\n Individuals who enjoy how Haskell\u2019s language design leads them on journeys of discovery and learning, helping shape and clarify their ideas and self-expression.\n Early in Haskell\u2019s life, the academic influence was strong, and it took a deliberate effort by the community to remain inclusive to others, including educators and professionals. Lately, the professional side has grown quite strong, and once again the community needs to evaluate where it stands. Both then and now, we\u2019ve seen strong leadership proclaim that Haskell\u2019s identity doesn\u2019t lie in any one group, but in a great meeting of minds, sticking it out on the dirt road rather than taking the easy path and leaving part of the community behind.\n The Haskell community can stand to make some progress, too, in diversity and inclusiveness. We still skew largely white, largely male, largely American and European. (As a white male American, of course, I\u2019m part of that!) Nevertheless, being inclusive to many sources of enthusiasm and interests is a key part of being inclusive to many types of people. It\u2019s difficult to consider diversity in the Haskell community without thinking about  Tidal Cycles and other projects of personal passion and expression that flourish here.\n This brings me to the final reason why I feel the need to personally support the Haskell Foundation. I\u2019m offering this support because as happy as I am to see amazing corporate sponsorship for Haskell, I\u2019m worried that this shouldn\u2019t be the  only financial support the Haskell Foundation receives.\n Industry support is absolutely not the only contribution to Haskell! The contributions of the many academics who support GHC and other Haskell technology with their research and development are priceless. The contributions of passionate individuals who maintain key parts of Haskell\u2019s tooling and ecosystem as enthusiasts are amazing. Nevertheless, I like to think that the Haskell Foundation can look to its own funding and see it also reflect their responsibility to the entire Haskell community, corporate and non-corporate alike.\n  This was a very emotional post for me. Not much like my usual blog posts, I know. But ultimately, I just needed to reach out and tell all of you Haskell programmers, that you are valuable to me. We have something worth keeping here. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to help us keep it.\n  Financially, you can join me in making monthly donations to the Haskell community through the Haskell Foundation. There are other opportunities, as well, to support parts of the Haskell community through Patreon [ 1,  2,  3,  4], GitHub sponsorships [ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8],  Haskell.org donations, etc. But personally, I believe the power of the Haskell Foundation to shine a spotlight and focus visibility and resources on the most critical problems is extremely compelling.\n Technically, please just follow your heart. People acting out of their own passion and excitement are far more valuable than anyone going through the motions doing as they are told. Do cool stuff, and build the things you need to do it. There are a few guidelines that do wonders here. Maybe most of all:  prefer to fix upstream rather than work around downstream.\n Socially, reach out to others with kindness, support, and shared enthusiasm. This really is the backbone of the Haskell community: we all love what we\u2019re doing, believe in it, and will talk your ear off about it if you let us! Whether it\u2019s on  IRC,  Reddit,  mailing lists,  Matrix,  Discourse, a local interest group or gathering at work, etc.\n Either way, no matter how you personally choose to give back to our community, I look fondly on the 15 years I\u2019ve known you all, and look forward eagerly to the many years to come.

The new terms, which Amazon is calling the Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program, will also provide developers with AWS promotional credit in an amount equivalent to 10 percent of the developer\u2019s revenue if they earn less than $1 million in revenue per year. If a developer chooses to use those AWS credits, that brings their total Amazon Appstore revenue share up from 70% to an equivalent of 90%.\n DISCLAIMER: I publish apps in the Amazon Appstore which earn me revenue. I earn less than $1 million per year and will therefore qualify for this program and will financially benefit from this change. For that reason,  my opinions are biased, so I will list only the facts and keep my opinions out of this article.\n Apple  announced last year that it will reduce its App Store\u2019s developer revenue cut from 30% to 15% for developers that earn less than $1 million in revenue per year. This change went into effect at the start of 2021. Earlier this year, Google  announced that it too will reduce the Play Store\u2019s cut form 30% to 15%, but only for the first $1 million in annual revenu earned by all developers. That change will go into effect on July 1st.\n This change by the Amazon Appstore brings its revenue share more closely in line with the new policies of Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play Store. However, if smaller Amazon Appstore developers don\u2019t use the extra 10% in AWS credits, which expire 12 months after being earned, they will not benefit as much from Amazon\u2019s new policy as they would from Apple or Google\u2019s new policies. Conversely, for developers that already spend more than 10% of their annual revenue on AWS fees, the new Amazon Appstore program will be more beneficial than Apple or Google\u2019s program. Developers must link their AWS accounts to their Amazon Appstore accounts, once the new program launches, in order to receive the extra 10% AWS credit.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 09:50:58",

At that time I was just playing around with   Tiddlywiki and using it to collect notes during my  CCNA course. I couldn\u2019t anticipate to which extent  personal knowledge management systems would become famous and trendy. And people nowadays don\u2019t blog anymore: They take care of their  digital gardens. While most of them seem to be just a collection of random notes, there are actually good ones where you can actually read through the thoughts/notes and learn something new. Here are my favourite ones:\n  And what about me? Yes, I still blog but I also have a digital garden available at  brainfck.org. For me blogging and maintaining a public source of inspirations and ideas is not the same. A blog post should be readable and contain full sentences. A collection of ideas/thoughts can be just some bullet points with some random links (for me they\u2019re not random, since I actively set those links in order to inter-connect notes). The idea is that I use my  PKMS to lookup things and generate new content (like this post). That\u2019s for the introduction. Now let\u2019s talk about the importance of having and maintaining a source of notes/thoughts.\n  After all: What\u2019s all the fuzz about \u201cnote taking\u201d? You have them  somewhere, you use them  somehow. Well, there it\u2019s more than that. In my job as a Security Engineer I need to keep up with new technologies and arising attack vectors. Additionally I tend to  read about non-IT topics I\u2019m currentlyinterested in. Each time I want to make sure I don\u2019t have to re-read/review that source again when I think I might use an interesting idea/concept out of it.Making future-proof notes (a terminology used in a   Zettelkasten system) is essential for me also because I use that content to generate new one.\n Not only in a professional context, but also for private purposes it does make sense to  actively read your books/articles. Try to apply some  analytical reading, a concept I\u2019ve read about for the first time in   How to read a book (book). The idea is to interact with the content you\u2019re reading about: Ask questions, try to link ideas in your mind, make notes, lookup complex definitions. The worst thing you can do is to just  passively read something, finish it and then you move on to your next reading. After finishing a book, I always take some time (1-3 hours) to go through my notes, adjust already existing ones or link them to other ones.\n  I\u2019ve spent the last years, trying to find not only the perfect note  taking system but also the most proficient note  storage system. I don\u2019t want to dissapoint you, but there is no perfect solution. You just need one system that fulfills  your needs, is easy to use and will most probably still work in a couple of years.Let\u2019s have a look at my current setup which has envolved over the last 2-3 years and definitely will change whenever I think I can optimize each step individually.\n  For me this is the most important step when dealing with sources of information in general. The process of note taking is supposed to help you to internalize the main concepts and the authors ideas. In this step taking  temporary notes as described by S\u00f6hnke Ahrens in his book \u201cHow to take smart notes\u201d (german:   Das Zettelkasten-Prinzip) will give you a good starting point for storing them in a  permanent manner. But more on this below.\n  This is still my favourite way of writing things down and collecting so called  temporary notes as described by S\u00f6hnke Ahrens in his book \u201cHow to take smart notes\u201d (german:   Das Zettelkasten-Prinzip). All you need is just a piece of paper and something to write. You\u2019re free to use whatever structure you want as long as it doesn\u2019t disturb your reading flow. Add diagrams, bullet points, symbols or everything you think is necessary.\n The downside of this analogue method is the fact your notes could get lost at some point. You have no automated backups in-place and if you lose your \u201cpaper\u201d notes,also your work is gone.\n         Yes, this might surprise you, but I do use my smartphone to take notes, especially when I don\u2019t have a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d with me. The best thoughts will come to your mind when you don\u2019t expect them to do so. And in that case you should be better prepared to write them down.\n  At some point I\u2019ve started using  orgzly which worked fine for   ORG mode in combination with  syncthing for the cross-device synchronization. However, once I\u2019ve came back to   Tiddlywiki I\u2019ve somehow abandoned orgzly in flavour of  miMind.\n   This little (mobile) application has great usability and it does help you to quickly add new notes, structured as a mind map. You can then easily export your map as XML which can then be converted to  ORG format.\n  In the application itself (as shown in the video) you can export your mind map to a XML file which can be converted to  ORG using this small  Golang utility:\n Once you have download all files included in the gist you can run it against your miMind XML file. In my case I had this XML:\n \u276f head Ern\u00e4hrungskompass.xml&lt;Root&gt;&lt;Header  info= &#34;Created with miMind software.&#34;&gt;&lt;/Header&gt;&lt;Content&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Ern\u00e4hrungskompass&#34;&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Kapitel 1&#34;&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Der Eiweisseffekt&#34;&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Tiere sind auf Proteinsuche bis sie ihren Proteinbedarf gedeckt haben&#34;&gt;&lt;/Node&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Zu viele Proteine sind auch nicht gut, da sie den Alterungsprozess beg\u00fcnstigen&#34;&gt;&lt;/Node&gt;&lt;/Node&gt;&lt;Node  Title= &#34;Insektenforscher&#34;&gt;\n   GTD suggests to always   capture what has our attention. Also minizing the number of possible capture locations makes your life even easier. But I also tend to capture my thoughts where it feels most comfortable. If I\u2019m doing some work at my laptop and suddenly some idea comes to my mind, then I\u2019ll capture it on my laptop. In that case I won\u2019t grab a piece of paper, put a label on it (to remember what the thought was about) and then put it aside. I\u2019d rather use tools on my desktop system.\n During the last months 2  input capture systems established and have become part of my note capture routine:\n ORG Capture I\u2019m not using it anymore for storing thoughts, bookmarks, ideas since I\u2019ve moved back to Tiddlywiki\n Tiddlywiki I always have a running (nodeJS) instance in my browser ( here you can view the exported version)\n Whenever I think something should be added to an existing note, I open that tab, search for that specific  tiddler (a page/note in the Tiddlywiki ecosystem) and make the changes\n I also used for storing notes to podcasts, articles I listen/read to/about during the day\n    Contrary to what  Lukas Luhmann was doing with his \u201cslip box\u201d (german: Zettelkasten) I like to have my notes stored digitally. Not only I can easily make multiplebackups and store them at different locations, but I can also apply batch operations (text modification, add/remove tags etc.) using command line tools like  sed,  awk &amp; co. And as with the   Unix philosophy  everything is a file I like to cluster notes (on the same topic) in one single file. This solution is completely software agnostic and files can be modified accordingly to be imported into different note-taking systems.\n  I wrote this post in order to give you some ideas what worked best for  me but it\u2019s up to you to define which requirements you need for a simple, working solution. For me theserequirements were  essential:\n digital solution like I\u2019ve mentioned before I do think digital solutions are the better long-term storage systems\n edit from (almost) everywhere well in theory you should be able to view, modify your notes regardless of the device:\n good looking UI Being a \u201cterminal guy\u201d for many, many years now I didn\u2019t thought I would put this as a requirement\n However, once you can actually \u201cvisualize\u201d your content or more important see the connections between your notes, you\u2019ll definitely start to appreciate  UI\n export content Imagine in 20 years you\u2019ll have to import your notes into some fancy, AI-driven, blockchain-based note system :)\n  You should be able to export  all content to a common format (who knows if JSON will still be around in 20 years)\n If you use tags and extra fields for your content, then it should be easy to use them in the new system\n You should export all content to a readable form and share it online (like a  digital garden)\n  I really recommend taking this whole topic more seriously since it will pay off on many layers. Not only you\u2019ll be able to deep-dive into multiple topics at once, but you\u2019ll have a solidcollection of notes/thoughts for later. Having a solid note eco-system will definitely increase your productivity and overall focus since we already spend to much time  googling stuff. Use your brain for what it was built for: Thinking, cognitive processes and creativity.

It was at one time the largest, most powerful company in the world. Its founding story includes the innovator Thomas Edison and financier J.P. Morgan. Its legendary CEO Jack Welch, who wrote five bestselling books on leadership, became a model for an entire generation of executives. When GE started using Microsoft software in our early days, that gave us a huge boost in the market, because GE was such a bellwether company.\n It turns out that the word \u201cmythic\u201d is the perfect word for GE.  The corporation has come crashing to Earth in one of the greatest downfalls in business history. Its workforce has been hollowed out, from 333,000 employees in 2017 to fewer than 174,000 at the end of last year. Its share price has fallen precipitously. In 2018, GE was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after more than a century in the index.\n GE\u2019s fall is not the result of innovators developing a better jet engine or wind turbine. It\u2019s also not a case of outright fraud, like Enron. It\u2019s a textbook case of mismanagement of an overly complex business.\n Only a few people saw it coming (including one, ironically, from J.P. Morgan\u2019s namesake bank). I wish I could tell you that I was one of them, but I was just as surprised as most people.\n That\u2019s why I was eager to read  Lights Out: Pride, Delusion, and the Fall of General Electric, by the  Wall Street Journal reporters Thomas Gryta and Ted Mann. I wanted to understand what really went wrong and what lessons this story holds for investors, regulators, business leaders, and business students.\n At times, it was a bit hard for me, as a former CEO, to read such harsh criticism of fellow leaders, including people I know and like. But I got a lot out of reading this book. Gryta and Mann gave me the detailed insight I was looking for into the culture, decisions, and accounting that eventually caught up to GE in a gigantic way.\n My first big takeaway is that one of GE\u2019s greatest apparent strengths was actually one of its greatest weaknesses. For many years, investors loved GE\u2019s stock because the GE management team always \u201cmade their numbers\u201d\u2014that is, the company produced earnings per share at least as large as what Wall Street analysts predicted. It turns out that culture of making the numbers at all costs gave rise to \u201csuccess theater\u201d and \u201cchasing earnings.\u201d In Gryta and Mann\u2019s words, \u201cProblems [were] hidden for the sake of preserving performance, thus allowing small problems to become big problems before they were detected.\u201d\n Chapter 14 of  Lights Out details many of the gimmicks GE employed to make the numbers look better than they really were. For example, Gryta and Mann report that GE would sometimes artificially boost quarterly profits by selling an asset (e.g., a diesel train) to a friendly bank, knowing that it could then buy back the asset at a time of GE\u2019s choosing.\n There are a lot of ways a company can end up with a culture that rewards gaming the numbers. Although Steve Ballmer and I made our share of strategic mistakes, we were maniacal about making sure our numbers were rock solid and avoiding incentive systems where people could cram a lot of sales into a quarter in order to look good or meet some quota. Satya Nadella works the same way today.\n In many companies, bad news travels very slowly, while good news travels fast. We tried hard to combat that. A team member might send me mail saying \u201cwe just won a software design competition,\u201d and \u201cisn\u2019t this amazing?\u201d I\u2019d typically respond, \u201cWhy am I hearing about this one? That\u2019s not statistically representative. How many competitions did we lose?\u201d I used the term \u201cmaking bad news travel fast\u201d all the time. I wanted to catch negative trends early, when we could still do something about them.\n My second big takeaway from  Lights Out is that GE didn\u2019t have the right talent and systems to bundle together a dizzying array of unrelated businesses\u2014including moviemaking, insurance, plastics, and nuclear power plants\u2014and manage them well. Investors bought into the notion that the company\u2019s world-renowned training made it better at managing things than anyone else, and that GE could produce consistent profits even in highly cyclical markets. And GE successfully persuaded people that its generalists could avoid the pitfalls that had tripped up big conglomerates in the past.\n In reality, those generalists often didn\u2019t understand the specifics of the industries they had to manage and couldn\u2019t navigate  trends in their industries. For example, the authors make the case that CEO Jeff Immelt didn\u2019t have a good handle on its huge banking unit, GE Capital. \u201cMaking money from [GE Capital] seemed shockingly simple to him at first, as it had to Welch, but the balance sheets were treacherously complex, and deep risks lurked there and were not always easily spotted in the quarterly profits and losses,\u201d write Gryta and Mann. One former GE executive told the authors that \u201cImmelt struggled with basic concepts\u2014the difference between secured and unsecured debt, for instance, which was fundamental to a lending operation like GE Capital.\u201d\n This dynamic was not confined to Immelt. It was rampant throughout the company\u2019s top ranks. As a result, the ability of top executives to understand what was really going on was quite limited. The only people who could actually dig down into the numbers and see what was going on were in finance. And as I mentioned above, the finance people didn\u2019t have much incentive to bring negative news to Welch or Immelt.\n In my role at our foundation, I sometimes hear fellow philanthropists say things like, \u201cI just wish my grantees could operate more like a business.\u201d The story of GE, led by very smart men who cared deeply about their work, should tamp down that kind of talk. The truth is that businesses, even the giants of industry, are just as susceptible to mistakes as any nonprofit.

The bill would mitigate one of the worst elements in California\u2019s morass of anti-growth housing regulations. Parking minimums  constrain development in urban areas, as underground parking garages can  cost tens of thousands of dollars per spot.\n Many California environmentalist groups and affordable-housing activists, however, have  opposed AB 1401. And AB 1401 is far from an isolated case: left-wing interest groups are often the fiercest supporters of housing regulations that impoverish California\u2019s working class while enriching landowners. The reason: complicated, capricious development laws give politically connected groups more opportunities to extort concessions from developers.\n In the case of AB 1401, for instance, a coalition of progressive opponents insisted that the law should be passed only \u201cwith amendments to ensure that parking reductions remain coupled with the density bonus framework for mixed-income housing projects.\u201d This means, essentially, that developers should still be forced to provide more parking unless they rent out much of their properties at below-market rates at their own expense. \u201cDensity bonuses\u201d are a feature of many zoning codes in California and elsewhere, letting developers build more densely than the requirements of the zoning code if some of their units are rented at below market price. Density bonuses create a perverse incentive for advocates of subsidized housing to make the base zoning code stricter, so that any new development project has to use density bonuses to be economically viable. Such policies may produce a few extra subsidized housing units, but they also worsen market-rate housing shortages for everyone not lucky enough to snag a subsidized housing unit.\n Other provisions of California development laws allow for more blatant extortion. The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) allows members of the public to complain about the environmental impacts of development projects and has very broad rules of standing. \u201cCEQA is intentionally designed for broad public enforcement,\u201d  notes one environmentalist group\u2019s summary, \u201cand in general, anyone who has an environmental concern with a project has the standing to bring a lawsuit if the legal violation they are alleging was raised during the administrative process.\u201d CEQA also defines environmental impact broadly: at least in some circumstances, it is  possible to object to a development because it will make parking more difficult. A CEQA lawsuit can force developers to incur years of delay and hundreds of thousands of dollars on additional environmental reviews to a project\u2014enough of an incentive to get developers to do whatever it takes to avoid one.\n It\u2019s no surprise, then, that CEQA lawsuits are widely abused. One analysis by Bay Area attorney Jennifer Hernandez  estimates that 80 percent of CEQA lawsuits are filed against infill projects in already developed areas, belying the law\u2019s ostensible justification of protecting California\u2019s wild areas. One of the biggest abusers: California construction unions, which routinely threaten meritless CEQA lawsuits against projects that don\u2019t use union labor. An  article from 2017 published by the San Francisco-based progressive, pro-housing think tank SPUR noted matter-of-factly that construction unions bore much of the responsibility for scuttling one CEQA reform attempt because \u201cthey rely on CEQA lawsuits to get developers to use union contractors.\u201d The website  Phony Union Tree Huggers provides a large compilation of CEQA complaints filed by union front groups. To take one recent example of many, in 2019, East Bay Residents, which described itself as an \u201cunincorporated association of individuals and labor organizations,\u201d  complained to Oakland\u2019s city government under CEQA about noise and emissions from construction equipment on a planned 37-story residential tower in the city center, 200 yards from a subway stop. Unions have even used CEQA lawsuits to  file complaints against solar energy projects.\n San Francisco has a similar local ordinance under which any citizen can protest a new development anywhere in the city. This was used most infamously by the nonprofit Calle 24, which claims to advocate for the interests of the Latino community in the city\u2019s Mission District. Calle 24 delayed a local laundromat owner\u2019s plan to sell his property to a housing developer with a series of nuisance complaints\u2014arguing, for instance, that the laundromat deserved historic preservation because neighborhood Chicano groups had used it as a meeting site decades earlier. Calle 24 all but admitted that the complaints were largely pretextual: notwithstanding its own complaints about the historic significance of the laundromat, the group even  tried to force the owner to sell to a nonprofit organization that would redevelop the property into below-market housing with government subsidies.\n Perhaps the most charitable explanation for many California progressive organizations\u2019 opposition to reform is that they have grown so accustomed to housing scarcity that they can no longer imagine how substantial reforms might work. Tiny concessions extracted by whatever means necessary are the best that they can do. Fortunately, however, such voices represent only one political faction. Many other progressive activists in the Golden State support AB 1401 and similar laws because they recognize that reforming zoning laws to make them less restrictive could improve affordability. The future of California housing may depend on how quickly the broad progressive movement recognizes that free markets are the way forward.\n      City Journal is a publication of the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research (MI), a leading free-market think tank.

"While a lot of software for creating and managing scale comes out of supercomputing centers, hyperscalers, and the largest public cloud builders, there is still plenty of innovation being done by people who need to tackle scale outside of these upper echelon organizations. Two of them are Mitchell Hashimoto and Armon Dadgar, the co-founders of HashiCorp, and they have spent more than a decade building what is turning out to be the likely commercial alternative to the Kubernetes stack \u2013 which also supports Kubernetes if you really want to do that, too.\n Like many open source projects that have made the leap to commercial success \u2013 and we are not saying that there are many of  those \u2013 the first project in the Hashi Stack, called Vagrant, was a personal project of Hashimoto that created a kind of consistent configuration wrapper around application software that made it easier to package and update. Eventually Engine Yard \u2013 remember  that platform cloud alternative to Red Hat\u2019s original OpenShift and VMware\u2019s Cloud Foundry? \u2013 sponsored Vagrant, which originally ran on Oracle\u2019s VirtualBox hypervisor but which was expanded to include VMware\u2019s ESXi, Red Hat\u2019s KVM, and Microsoft\u2019s Hyper-V hypervisors as well as the custom Xen hypervisor used by Amazon Web Services.\n Hashimoto and Dadgar both got their bachelor\u2019s degrees in computer science from the University of Washington and they also worked together at Kiip, which is a mobile ad tech and data platform provider based in San Francisco and which has Coca-Cola, Kellogg\u2019s, Proctor &amp; Gamble, McDonald\u2019s, and Johnson &amp; Johnson as its marquee customers. The Kiip ad engine was built in Python, Ruby, Bash, and Puppet, and when it was first turned on in 2010 (when Vagrant was a side project for Hashimoto), it could process a measly 1 query per second at 200 milliseconds of average latency, which is right at the impatience limit of the human attention span. And when they founded HashiCorp two years later, that Kiip system they left in the hands of their former employer was revved up to 2,000 queries per second at a 20 millisecond average response time. That\u2019s a 2,000X improvement in throughput and a 10X improvement in latency, which is not too shabby.\n  Which is why the ambitions of the two HashiCorp co-founders were not absurd when they explicitly set out to build a modular software toolbox that could be the kernel of a true software platform, inspired by Unix, not Linux. (We will get to that in a moment.) Well,  maybe a little absurd. But so is co-founding a new IT publication in 2015 to take on the upper echelon of computing architecture. . . .\n The Hashi Stack now has ten core components, and here they are in order of release:\n Serf, released in 2013, a failure detection tool for clusters based on a gossip protocol, just like the small town or neighborhoods that many of us grew up in\n Consul, released in 2014, a service mesh with service discovery and remote procedure calls and event propagation and a distributed key-value store\n Terraform, released in 2014, for provisioning virtual infrastructure across on-premises facilities and public clouds using \u201cinfrastructure as code\u201d techniques\n Vault, released in 2015, is a security tool that does secrets management, identity based access, encryption, and security auditing \u2013 again, just like the small towns and neighborhoods where many of us grew up\n Nomad, also released in 2015, is a container and cluster management tool inspired by Google\u2019s Borg and Omega tools, which are said to have inspired the creation and opening up of Kubernetes.\n Sentinel, released in 2017, which is a policy as code framework that makes policy workflow for infrastructure malleable programmatically just like Terraform does for the provisioning of infrastructure.\n Boundary, released in 2020, is a trusted identity platform for secure remote access to systems\n Waypoint, released in 2020, is an application workflow platform that stages code from build to deploy and through release updates \u2013 the kind of thing HashiCorp needed for itself and now you can use.\n That\u2019s a pretty steady beat of tool additions and a fairly complete stack. And HashiCorp is not trying to do everything, as Dadgar explains to  The Next Platform, but rather do the core things well that others have not and then integrate with the other good tools that are needed to make a true and complete software platform.\n  Timothy Prickett Morgan:  Right off the bat, we have not done a good job covering the rise of HashiCorp, and particularly the Terraform provisioning tool, so we owe you an apology. But for what it is worth, we have been paying attention. The stack that you have built is unique and is as complete as anything else anybody has put together. It is clearly now a platform in its own right.\n My spider sense is going off and sooner or later somebody big is going to want to take control of Terraform. I am surprised it hasn\u2019t happened already, to be honest. Doesn\u2019t someone want to counterbalance Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift and build a big business?\n  TPM:  Cisco Systems is a possible fit, and they have a partnership with you. Hewlett Packard and Dell don\u2019t want to be in the software business, which shows they don\u2019t understand the modern IT business at some level. Microsoft could be a good fit. But we want a reprise of the OpenStack-Mesos-Kubernetes showdown. So maybe the VMware stack versus the IBM Red Hat OpenShift stack versus the Cisco Hashi stack.\n  Armon Dadgar: I think that is a \u201cYes\u201d at this point, but it is more than that.\n When we started, we wanted to build a full portfolio that covers all of these pieces. I think we were intentional about laying out all the components. In the first few years of our life, and really from 2013 through 2016, we just kept expanding until we got to the stack as it\u2019s known today. After that, we really shifted gears, and were super-focused on making this thing the  de facto standard and then building a commercial business on top of that. We really didn\u2019t focus on commercialization up until 2016 in any meaningful way.\n From there, we had a three-pronged strategy, which has got us where we are today. One was relentless open source evangelism. We have a huge developer relations team. Mitchell and I still do a ton of developer evangelism ourselves, and it\u2019s important to build developer love. I think the second piece was engaging all of our tech partners and the ecosystem around about building Terraform integrations. Now we have well over one hundred technology partners, and Terraform has over a thousand integrations through that. And the third prong was when we did start focusing commercially in 2016, we targeted the Global 2000 and we started winning the lighthouse accounts, like knocking over a big bank.\n TPM:  You can\u2019t say \u201cknock over a big bank.\u201d It means you have robbed it!\n  TPM:  Whatever they gave you, it is pocket change they can cover by raising our bank fees.\n Armon Dadgar: JP Morgan Chase is a great example. They gave us their innovation award last year because they\u2019ve standardized how they provision with Terraform. And then they tell all their vendors, such as vendors like Cisco and NetApp and VMware, to build Terraform integrations.\n We have been driven by the bottom-up groundswell of the community, followed by the ecosystem lean in to build out a network effect and then we knocked over a bunch of these Global 2000 customers.\n TPM:  Where are you at today? Give us some metrics about where you are the hockey stick? Are you in that weird place where every time you turn around, there\u2019s like 2X more people working at the company?\n Armon Dadgar: Pretty much. We had around 800 employees last year and that is now pushing up to 1,400 employees. I lose track myself. I think we will end the year at close to 2,000 people depending on how quickly we can keep hiring. We are well north of 1,000 paying enterprise customers, and we have close to 250 of the Global 2000. So we are past the early startup phase that we were in 2016.\n TPM:  This is where any business becomes interesting to me. I like things when they\u2019re first starting and there is the concept and the ambition. It\u2019s fun writing about projects as they emerge and then turn into companies, but then it turns into a blizzard of point releases and we let some time pass before we take a look again on what is happening and how the market is receiving whatever technology they have created.\n Armon Dadgar: In that middle phase, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to sink or swim. I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re past the sink or swim.\n TPM:  We spent a lot of time with CoreOS when we started The Next Platform because we thought that looked important, and the same for Mesos and OpenStack and few other evolving Kubernetes stacks.\n I think it is safe to say that HashiCorp is swimming. I mean, you\u2019re not walking on water yet, but, you know, VMware is not going to be able to do that much longer. VMware can persist for a long time, because of the vast 300,000-strong customer base and its long history of using vSphere. But in the long run, VMware prices have to come down to compete with better and better container platforms.\n Armon Dadgar: I think of CA, which proves you can be around for a long time way after you are irrelevant. Decline can be very slow, gradual.\n TPM:  And weird. How in the hell did Computer Associates end up being acquired by Broadcom?\n   So what do you do now? Just keep doing what you\u2019re already doing? You are growing like crazy, you have raised a fair amount of money. . . .\n Armon Dadgar: Our recent funding was our Series E financing in March 2020 for $175 million. In total, we have raised $349.2 million.\n TPM:  When I start seeing Series F and Series G, that makes me pause except in special circumstances. Series E is normal. Are you trying to go public? You know, there\u2019s probably a SPAC or two that\u2019s desperate for you. . . .\n Armon Dadgar: [Laughter] Our finance team is having to hit delete a lot, going through these things. But seriously, Dave McJannet, our CEO, has talked about going public. We\u2019ve always been of the mind that our opportunity is so big that we want to build a standalone, independent business.\n There\u2019s definitely something to control and total ownership of your destiny \u2013 these are very valuable things.\n  Armon Dadgar: That always becomes the counterbalance. At some point, they want their liquidity. So it\u2019s always a careful balance. Going public helps with employee retention as well over time.\n TPM:  That is, if someone doesn\u2019t try to make you an offer you can\u2019t refuse, like EMC did to VMware way back when. Google? Probably not. Microsoft? Maybe. They are acquisitive.\n Armon Dadgar: I think it\u2019s worth talking about the cloud relationships in that in that respect. The value that HashiCorp brings is that we are that neutral Switzerland. We don\u2019t have a cloud affiliation. We don\u2019t sell you a cloud. I always describe our relationship with the clouds like this: they sell power, we sell power lines. And I think from the customer perspective, that\u2019s valuable because they know they are going to have a relationship with all of them and they don\u2019t want to be deeply wedded to CloudFormation or whatever because then they have no real leverage with the public clouds.\n So I think HashiCorp being owned by a hyperscaler would break that. All of a sudden, we would not really be neutral. It\u2019s almost what happened with Red Hat post the IBM acquisition. . . .\n  Armon Dadgar: Yes, exactly. But with that market, people were so far down the VMware road that it didn\u2019t matter that Dell owned them.\n TPM:  Are you the true and only Switzerland at this point when it comes to platforms? I had a hope for Mesos and OpenStack and was waiting for a Kubernetes stack to emerge. I thought somehow these might glue together in an interesting way, but they didn\u2019t Borg well,  so to speak.\n Armon Dadgar: [Laughter] I think Red Hat may have had the best shot pre-IBM because they still weren\u2019t affiliated with a cloud and they had CoreOS and its Kubernetes implementation. But since they have been part of IBM, they\u2019ve got the Blue Wash effect, and I think that customers view Red Hat like they\u2019re not really neutral.\n TPM:  With the Terraform 1.0 release, are you down to fit and finish and polish? Is this thing ready for prime time, ready for enterprise? That\u2019s what 1.0 normally means.\n Armon Dadgar: HashiCorp has been the most historically conservative vendor of what we call 1.0. And I think we tease ourselves about this because like most companies IPO before we consider a product 1.0. Look at the scope of Terraform. It doesn\u2019t even make sense \u2013 we have well over 100 million downloads, a thousand provider integrations, and well over a thousand enterprise customers, and only  now do we call this a 1.0 product? The bar that we set is very, very high.\n TPM:  I\u2019ve never heard of it. It\u2019s almost legacy software at this point. This is like your 4.0 release.\n Armon Dadgar: We joke in the community that we were off by a decimal place and this is really release 10.0. [Laughter]\n Look at all of our products. None of them have done it in less than five years. Our view is this: Until the products are broadly deployed with production hardening time, it should not be a release 1.0. Some of these projects we see come out of the Linux Foundation, it\u2019s like the first code commit and the last code commit were five minutes ago and the project is 6.0 release. How can it be at 6.0? There\u2019s no user running it in production and you\u2019re calling this thing a 6.0? Give me a break.\n TPM:  How complicated is this stack? Is it as complex as OpenStack, as big as OpenStack. As you know, OpenStack had everything in there but a blender and the kitchen sink. . . .\n  TPM:  OK, OK, I\u2019m trying to get a comparison. So let\u2019s use a Linux or Windows operating system, which has tens of millions of lines of code depending on how you count it and cut it.\n  What is more important is what we call the Tao of HashiCorp, our design ethos. And I think a key piece of that design ethos was like the Unix philosophy: We want each tool to be simple, focused on a single thing, but then we make them composable. We could build the Hashi Platform, which might be a monolithic, OpenStack kind of play, but we want to be super-conscious to do the exact opposite.\n Each of these tools will do one thing and do it really well \u2013 and then compose with the others. So if I look at Terraform. it\u2019s still very, very focused on just the provisioning. Give me an infrastructure as code definition of what you want it to look like, Terraform will figure out how to get there \u2013 and it will do the provisioning and lifecycle engine, but it stops there. It\u2019s not going to do image management. It doesn\u2019t do patching. It doesn\u2019t do app deploy. If you want an image management tool, we have Packer. You want service discovery and network automation, we have Consul. You have app deploy? Use Kubernetes or Nomad. We didn\u2019t want the OpenStack effect that this is monolithic, big bang code base \u2013 all in or all out. These are very narrowly focused, do one thing and do it elegantly rather than try to boil the ocean.\n There are four layers that we care about: provisioning, security, networking, and app deploy. And there\u2019s layers that we think other people do really well, like observability and telemetry. Go use DataDog or Splunk or whatever. And we\u2019re also not really in preproduction world. So it\u2019s a great let\u2019s compose a very tightly with GitHub and GitLab and Artifactory and the CI/CD vendors.\n TPM:  You\u2019re not messing in the hypervisor. You\u2019re not messing in firmware management for servers. You\u2019re not messing in configuration of switches or any of that stuff.\n Armon Dadgar: Or even configuration management. We integrate tightly with Ansible, Chef, and Puppet. Use Terraform for the provisioning, and then let\u2019s integrate tightly with these. We deeply integrate with Kubernetes across the stack, but we have our Nomad alternative, which is our container and application scheduler.\n   TPM:  I assume you believe that or you wouldn\u2019t bother. So then what is it that you\u2019re doing with Nomad that is better than Kubernetes?\n Armon Dadgar: For me, it comes down to three really simple things. One is just the elegance of experience. Kubernetes is OpenStack 2.0. It\u2019s just as complicated. It\u2019s just as vendor controlled. It\u2019s just as foundation led.\n TPM:  It\u2019s Seven of Nine. . . . Or Six of One and A Half A Dozen Of Another.\n  To me, I also find it so disingenuous the way they talk about Kubernetes. It\u2019s the successor to Borg and Google took everything they learned from it. If that\u2019s true, then why does everything still run on Borg inside of Google?\n   Armon Dadgar: Let\u2019s ignore the usability of Kubernetes, which is a mess. Let\u2019s talk about its actual operational scalability. It\u2019s also a joke. Borg runs on 10 million nodes, Kubernetes falls over if you have a few hundred. And so in what sense did Google learn from Borg when Kubernetes only scales to 1/1000th of what Borg does?\n Only a few weeks ago, we published a two million container benchmark, which we did in partnership with Amazon Web Services. We had 100,000 CPU cores and 10,000 nodes and we deployed two million containers across it. In 2017, we did a million container version of this.\n Nomad actually operates at size and scale, it\u2019s actually based off of the Borg and Omega papers from Google. Ours is actually a  true implementation of Borg as opposed to  an implementation of Borg. And the user experience is just much simpler, more elegant.\n TPM:  What is the nerd equivalent of a mic drop? A laptop drop test?

The size of a shipping container, these Compact Molten Salt Reactors will be rapidly mass-manufactured in their thousands, then placed on floating barges to be deployed worldwide \u2013 on timelines that will smash paradigms in the energy industry.\n Like other molten salt reactors, which have been around since the 1950s, they&#39;re designed to minimize the consequences of accidents, with a pair of very neat passive safety measures the company claims can greatly change the safety equation at the heart of any nuclear power investment.\n Firstly, they use nuclear fuel that&#39;s mixed into fluoride salts. The combination is liquid above 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F), allowing it to flow through the reactor, which operates at near-atmospheric pressures. This liquid salt functions as a coolant for the nuclear fuel, replacing the high-pressure water cooling in older reactor designs. But if this fuel is exposed to air, instead of venting explosively as steam, it acts like lava and solidifies into rock.\n Yes, the rock is radioactive, and you shouldn&#39;t go have a picnic on it, but it&#39;s not a cloud of radioactive gas that can blow across the continent; it&#39;s solid rock that can be cleaned up by safety teams with Geiger counters. It also has very low solubility in water, so it&#39;s comparatively safe even if it falls into the sea.\n  Secondly, if temperature starts getting out of control for some reason, a &#34;frozen salt&#34; plug at the bottom of the reactor is the first thing that&#39;ll melt, and this will immediately drain the reactor core into a series of cooled drainage tanks underneath.\n This pair of simple measures, says Seaborg Technologies co-founder and CEO Troels Sch\u00f6nefeldt, radically re-focuses the nuclear safety question away from total accident prevention with four layers of redundancy at every point of failure, to much simpler consequence mitigation, and it&#39;ll have a huge impact on the cost of nuclear power.\n &#34;We take a different approach,&#34; he  told Radio Spectrum in an interview. &#34;We\u2019re not reducing the likelihood of an accident to zero, there will be accidents. We should avoid them as much as we can, but there will be accidents. Hopefully, there will be a lot of accidents because we will have a lot of these reactors. What we do, instead of reducing the likelihood, is reduce the consequence of even the worst disasters. Or even acts of war where you actually bomb the reactor. The consequence there is that this fluoride salt will flow out of the reactor, or explode out of the reactor, and lie on the field. It\u2019ll solidify. And now you shouldn\u2019t go onto that field. You should actually keep 10 or 20 feet of distance. But you can go there with a Geiger counter and clean it up. It\u2019s wildly expensive, but you can do it. And that changes the fundamental safety profile of the technology. And in doing so, we change the cost, which again, in turn changes the business model.&#34;\n  But perhaps the most impactful change to the business model is Seaborg&#39;s proposal to install these reactors on barges, and float them offshore rather than buying up land to develop nuclear power plants. There are several advantages here. For starters, you can manufacture them in bulk at a single facility. Seaborg is looking at Korean shipyards, which are already closely and efficiently connected to supply chains with enormous production capacity.\n &#34;If you want us to build not one reactor to start with, but a thousand, we could start by building a thousand,&#34; Sch\u00f6nefeldt told Radio Spectrum. &#34;That will take, like, three or four years on these shipyards. So it\u2019s basically unroofed in how fast you can scale it.&#34;\n These barges can be moved just about anywhere on the planet, either moored offshore or on large or small rivers, depending on how big a reactor it is. There&#39;s virtually no site preparation required; it&#39;s fully self-contained and very easy to connect to a power grid. Seaborg estimates it can service 95 percent of the world&#39;s population this way, putting basically no land requirements on a baseload or load-following power station up to a healthy 600 MW, which could supply nearly 100,000 homes.\n  The challenge here, as with all molten salt reactors, is corrosion. Hot molten salt itself is highly corrosive, and this will be a serious challenge to design around for every component that comes into contact with the fuel salt. Float the reactors on barges in salty seawater, and you expose the entire exterior to a powerful corrosive agent as well;  cargo ships are typically designed with a 25-year service life in mind thanks to the effects of life in salt water.\n And it doesn&#39;t stop there for Seaborg. Other molten salt reactors use graphite as a moderator, slowing down the neutrons produced by each fission reaction to maintain the chain reaction. But graphite tends to fracture and weaken when exposed to intense radiation with repeated heating and cooling, eventually resulting in what  Seaborg co-founder and CTO Eirik Eide Pettersen describes to Thomas Thor Associates as &#34;unacceptable hotspots.&#34;\n Seaborg&#39;s solution is to use another molten salt \u2013 sodium hydroxide \u2013 as a liquid moderator. Thus, the core design places the fuel salt tube inside a larger tube filled with sodium hydroxide, creating a first-of-its-kind all-liquid reactor that&#39;s remarkably compact. But sodium hydroxide itself is a powerfully caustic base, often used as oven cleaner or drain cleaner; the Seaborg design has to deal with this added corrosive agent too.\n And on top of all that, there&#39;s the freaky phenomenon of &#34; grain-boundary corrosion&#34; to boot, caused by the presence of tellurium as a fission by-product in the fuel salt stream. Tellurium atoms can merrily penetrate through metals, and swap positions with other elements, leading to embrittlement of the metals at their weakest points.\n The company is well aware of its key challenges here. &#34;Seaborg\u2019s core IP is based on corrosion control in the moderator salt, and applying the lessons learned since the 1950s,&#34; says Pettersen. &#34;But it is not just a question of corrosion, it is also how easy it is to put these things together. Hands-on experience is important. They need to be welded, tested, inspected, maintained. We are working towards having perhaps 20 or 30 test loops in Copenhagen, with the experiments designed, set up and executed. The conceptual design is already done; we are now working on the basic design and in that way we are working up towards a full-scale prototype.&#34;\n  That full-scale prototype is currently scheduled to go online in 2025, at which point it&#39;ll likely be sent to work off an island in Southeast Asia. Having raised some reasonably substantial capital, Seaborg is hiring like mad to work toward that goal. It hopes to achieve regulatory type approval for its design by 2026, and commercial serial production could follow as early as 2027.\n These timelines are &#34;almost insane&#34; in the energy market,  Sch\u00f6nefeldt told the Switch 2020 audience in a presentation earlier this year, and a validation of the mass production strategy and floating barge approaches. Energy industry investors, who are used to dealing with extremely long planning and construction phases, as well as multi-decade return on investment periods, can now put their money into something that&#39;s online incredibly rapidly and paying for itself within 6-10 years.\n The Seaborg reactor is small enough to fit in a shipping container, making it remarkably easy to move around even for ground installations. It&#39;ll run for around 12 years without refueling. Its fuel cannot be used in nuclear weapons. It&#39;s capable of being run on refined, recycled nuclear waste from older reactors \u2013 although there will be some regulatory hurdles there, says Sch\u00f6nefeldt. You can draw heat straight from the reactor even more efficiently than drawing electricity, so it&#39;ll be useful in ways other than just being a power station.\n Next-generation advanced nuclear power is a hot topic at the moment. With global resolve hardening around the target of zero carbon emissions by 2050, coal- and gas-fired power stations are rapidly being retired. Renewable resources like solar and wind energy will provide the bulk of the energy we&#39;ll need moving forward, but nuclear offers a reliable, cheap and green way to bolster the base load and fill in gaps when renewables aren&#39;t generating.\n Despite some extremely high-profile catastrophes,  nuclear is already by far the safest method of power generation, with a &#34;deathprint&#34; 330 times lower than coal-fired electricity. The new generation of advanced nuclear reactors promises to be even safer, and molten salt designs like Seaborg&#39;s can dramatically lower the consequences of those vanishingly rare incidents as well. If this company can solve the corrosion issues as effectively as its investors believe it can, what an enormous game-changer this could be.\n   View gallery - 6 images", "posttime": "2021-06-17

in the past 20 years fell 5.5 million units short of long-term historical levels, according to a new National Association of Realtors report, which is calling for a \u201conce-in-a-generation\u201d policy response.\n  The industry lobbying group said it hopes the report, which was released Wednesday, persuades lawmakers to include housing investments  in any infrastructure package.\n  U.S. builders added 1.225 million new housing units, on average, each year from 2001 to 2020, according to the report, which was prepared for NAR by Rosen Consulting Group LLC. That figure is down from an annual average of 1.5 million new units from 1968 to 2000.\n  Have you tried to buy a house this year? How was your experience? Join the conversation below.\n  The 5.5 million-unit deficit includes about two million single-family homes, 1.1 million units in buildings with two to four units and 2.4 million units in buildings of at least five units, the report says.\n    \u201cThe scale of the problem is so large,\u201d said David Bank, senior vice president of Rosen Consulting Group and one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cWe need affordable [housing], we need market-rate, we need single-family, we need multifamily.\u201d\n  The report also says that from 2010 to 2020, new-home construction fell 6.8 million units short of what was needed to meet household-formation growth and replace units that were aging or destroyed by natural disasters.\n  Limited supply has been a recent driver  of rising housing prices for renters and home buyers, alongside robust demand. The median existing-home price  rose 19% from a year earlier to $341,600 in April, a record high, according to NAR.\n  The supply shortage became especially acute in the past year. Builders slowed construction in some regions last spring and  delayed land purchases because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, low mortgage-interest rates and an increase in remote work led to a surge in demand for single-family housing. And many homeowners delayed or canceled plans to list their homes for sale.\n    The number of existing homes on the market fell to 1.03 million units at the end of January, a record low in data going back to 1982, according to NAR. The existing-home inventory totaled 1.16 million units at the end of April, a 20.5% decline from a year earlier.\n  Housing economists differ in their estimates of the supply-demand balance. In a study earlier this year, mortgage-finance company Freddie Mac estimated that the national deficit of single-family homes  stood at 3.8 million units at the end of 2020.\n  Industry consultant John Burns said by his estimate, the U.S. has a deficit of fewer than a million homes. \u201cOur adult population isn\u2019t growing as fast as it used to,\u201d said Mr. Burns, chief executive of John Burns Real Estate Consulting LLC. Compared with decades before 2000, \u201cwe don\u2019t need to build as much,\u201d he said.\n  New-home construction surged in the early 2000s amid a housing boom. Then building activity slumped during the 2007-09 recession and stayed low for years as builders went out of business and workers left the industry.\n    Builders ramped up the pace in 2020 in response to robust demand. Housing starts, a measure of home-building activity, rose last year to 1.38 million units, the highest rate since 2006. But shortages of labor, ready-to-build land and materials have limited the pace of construction growth, builders say.\n  More than 90% of home builders surveyed by the National Association of Home Builders in May reported shortages of appliances and framing lumber.\n  To shrink the supply deficit, builders would need to exceed the long-term historical average pace of 1.5 million units a year, according to the NAR report. At 2.1 million units a year, near the level reached in 2005, it would take a decade to close a gap of 5.5 million units, the report says.\n  NAR is calling for a suite of policy responses to increase housing supply, including expanding the tax credit program for low-income rental housing, encouraging  renovation of distressed properties and offering incentives to cities and states to reduce regulatory limits on housing density. The association also supports converting commercial buildings for residential use.\n    Expanding new-home construction to more than two million units a year for 10 years would create 2.8 million new jobs and generate more than $400 billion in economic activity, according to the NAR report.\n  News Corp  owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.\n  Appeared in the June 17, 2021, print edition as &#39;Housing Deficit Is Put at 5.5 Million.&#39;", "posttime": "2021-06-17 09:48:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,sa,news,\u62a5\u544a", "title": "WSJ\u65b0\u95fb\u72ec\u5bb6 -

You run the code on some input and get some output. Then when the input changes, you get changes to the output, much faster than recomputing the whole thing from scratch. (And the outputs will be  correct!)\n If you want to learn how it works, start at  docs/why.md and then read  lib/dida/core.zig.\n  Dida is heavily based on  differential dataflow and is informed by experience using differential dataflow as a backend at  materialize.\n  Be  easier to use and understand. (Differential dataflow aims to be as flexible, extensible and composable as possible, which makes sense for a research platform but can make the code very difficult to follow.) Tentatively aim to keep the core under 3kloc. (For comparison timely dataflow and differential dataflow total 14-16kloc depending on which components you count).\n Only implement as much of  timely dataflow as is needed to support the features in differential dataflow.\n Only support timestamps which are products of integers. (Differential dataflow supports timestamps which are arbitary lattices, but I haven&#39;t yet seen any uses that can&#39;t be encoded as products of integers.)\n Use a simpler progress tracking algorithm which doesn&#39;t require path summaries, multiple outputs per node or internal edges within nodes.\n Store all state associated with the dataflow in a single flat structure for easy introspection.\n Better support use as an interpreter backend and for binding to other languages. Split the api into a data-centric runtime-checked core, and a per-binding-language strongly-typed sugar that helps make dataflows correct-by-construction. (The differential dataflow api provides excellent compile-time safety but is hard to map across FFI into a language with a different type system.)\n Don&#39;t rely on specialization for performance, since it requires compilation and also doesn&#39;t work well cross-language. This will require rethinking eg how functions are lifted over batches.\n Support storing data inline in indexes when the size is only known at runtime. (Differential dataflow can support this, but materialize currently stores each row in a separate heap allocation even if the row is all fixed-width types.)\n Support reference-counted values without adding overhead for non-reference-counted values. This is needed for eg pinning javascript objects but also helps reduce memory usage in string-heavy dataflows. (Materialize could reference-count eg strings but would then pay for the row-by-row Drop impl on all data, not just string data.)\n Support being embedded in another event loop. (Differential dataflow can be run a step at a time, but the amount of work per step is not bounded so it can block the event loop for arbitrary amounts of time.)\n Support cpu and memory limits. This makes it much easier to safely support live evaluation eg embedding a query repl in a tracing dashboard.\n Provide interactive graphical debuggers for every component. (Many of the complaints I&#39;ve heard about differential dataflow are about struggling to understand where state is stored, when things happen, how different ways of writing a computation affect performance etc. Debuggers can answer this question directly, but I suspect will also help by teaching useful mental representations.)\n Write a short book that uses the debuggers to explain both the theory of differential dataflow and the details of this implementation.

", "note_en": "A scathing report details how over 2,000 weapons have gone missing from military arsenals in the last decade alone and the data is far from complete.\n  A damning investigative report published by  The Associated Press today details how over 2,000 weapons have gone missing from military arsenals between 2010 and 2019. While the data set was far from complete, what the outlet did obtain shows a worrying pattern of lost and stolen weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of criminals who used them in the commission of violent crimes, while others were even simply discarded in public parks.\n The Associated Press&#39;s  investigation states that, between 2010 and 2019, these weapons went missing or were deliberately taken from a wide variety of locations, including armories, warehouses, firing ranges, Navy vessels, or even while in transit. Reasons cited in the report included unlocked doors, burglary, security personnel falling asleep, or lapses in surveillance and other security systems. 1,504 weapons were reported missing or stolen from the Army, 211 from the Navy, 204 from the Marines, and 39 were categorized as &#34;Other,&#34; which presumably includes the U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Defense security forces like the Pentagon Force Protection Agency.\n While the Marines and Navy offered their own figures about weapons lost or stolen throughout the last decade, the Army and Air Force did not willingly provide  The Associated Press with exact numbers about how many of their weapons were unaccounted for, so the report instead relied on Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for military criminal case files, as well as internal military small arms registries. One of those FOIA requests filed with the Army\u2019s Office of the Provost Marshal General revealed 1,303 lost firearms from the Army alone. The  AP reported the Air Force was less cooperative:\n The Air Force was the only service branch not to release data. It first responded to several Freedom of Information Act requests by saying no records existed. Air Force representatives then said they would not provide details until yet another FOIA request, filed 1.5 years ago, was fully processed.\n   Of these guns and other weapon systems cited in the  AP report, many of which remain unaccounted for, 1,179 were rifles, while another 694 were handguns. A total of 74 machine guns went missing, as did 11 shotguns. Close to 100 more were reported to be grenade launchers, rocket launchers, or mortars.\n The  AP did not specify which specific weapons were stolen or lost in most cases.  M4 rifles are cited in a few incidents, as are  Beretta M9 handguns. In the cases of the other classes of weapons cited in the report, the classes used represent a wide range of weapons with different levels of lethality. Rocket launchers, for example, come in both reloadable and non-reloadable forms. &#34;Machine guns&#34; as a whole also represents a wide variety of weapons, some of which can fire of  thousands of rounds per minute and would be absolutely devastating if used in a criminal or terrorist act.\n Another seven missing weapons were reported as \u201cother.\u201d It is unknown what those may represent, or if they are merely uncategorizable based on a scarcity of data in the reports obtained by  The Associated Press. From the lack of clarity in the dataset, these could be almost anything ranging from a knife to a nuclear weapon.\n The U.S. military has also infamously  lost six of its nuclear weapons due to aircraft crashes or other mishaps. One of those incidents remains classified to this day, but is thought to be related to the  loss of the USS  Scorpion , which sank mysteriously with all hands aboard in the North Atlantic Ocean in May 1968.\n   Even military vehicles get stolen from time to time, such as in 2018 when a Virginia Army National Guardsmen stole  an M577 armored command vehicle and led police on a 60-mile chase. In 1995, an M60A3 Patton tank  was stolen from a National Guard armory in San Diego, after which it was taken on a rampage that left dozens of cars flattened before police were able to take out its driver.\n    \u201cThe military\u2019s weapons are especially vulnerable to corrupt insiders responsible for securing them,\u201d the AP\u2019s report reads. \u201cThey know how to exploit weak points within armories or the military\u2019s enormous supply chains. Often from lower ranks, they may see a chance to make a buck from a military that can afford it.\u201d The  AP cites an NCIS investigation in 2014 which discovered four M4 trigger assemblies went missing from the Navy&#39;s Special Boat Team Twelve, presumably for sale on the black market or even on sites like eBay. These assemblies can be used to convert civilian AR-15 models to fully automatic weapons.\n Earlier this year, an Army trainee fled Fort Jackson with an M4 Carbine which he used to  hijack a schoolbus full of children. Luckily, the assailant left the bus without harming anyone aboard.\n Other reasons cited were improper or insufficient adherence to security protocols, as was the case at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune where &#34;authorities often have an open missing weapons investigation&#34; according to the AP. The AP&#39;s report cites an incident in which a Beretta M9 was stolen from Camp Lejeune, only to later turn up in a drug bust in Baltimore. Another missing M9, taken from an unlocked National Guard armory along with six automatic weapons, a grenade launcher, and four other M9s, was recovered by law enforcement in South Carolina in 2017 during a domestic dispute.\n In 2017, a box containing 32 40mm MK-19 grenade launcher rounds was stolen from an ammunition train while in transit. The box showed up eight months later in an Atlanta suburb tucked behind bushes at a private residence. Only 30 grenades remained in the box. The other two were  never found.\n The  AP also cites  a theft at Fort Irwin in California in which 26 AK-74s were stolen a decade ago and keep turning up in the hands of gang members throughout the state. The Department of Defense (DOD) primarily procures these weapons from friendly third-party nations  for use in Special Operations Command (SOCOM) familiarization training.\n The  AP published a  separate piece the same day as their larger missing weapons report which details how some of the military\u2019s missing weapons stolen from the Lincoln Stoddard Army Reserve Center ended up being found \u201cin a trash bag in a Bronx park near Yankee Stadium.\u201d\n Some of the weapons were lost overseas, such as when a Navy SEAL lost his sidearm in Lebanon during a fight in a restaurant. 65 Beretta M9s were stolen and never recovered in Afghanistan when a padlock was cut off of a fence.\n Prior to 2017, the Pentagon was required to share annual data about stolen or lost weapons with Congress. That requirement lapsed, but some members of Congress want to restore it, especially in light of the  AP&#39;s report. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut called the report \u201cabsolutely blood curdling\u201d in a hearing with Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth held on June 15, the same day the report was published. Wormuth assured Blumenthal that the Army is taking the matter seriously and will look into it. Blumenthal repeatedly pressed Wormuth for an answer on whether or not the Army would commit to regularly reporting lost weapon data to Congress, to which Wormuth replied the Army \u201cwould be open to a reporting requirement.\u201d\n   According to a 2018 estimate  published by the Small Arms Survey, the U.S. military possesses some 4.5 million firearms. Thus, while 2,060 can seem like a small number, the potential damge even one of these weapons could do in the wrong hands makes each one a serious case. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby  told the  AP in an interview that \u201cThough the numbers are small, one is too many,\u201d adding that the military safely accounts for the overwhelming majority of its weapons each year. \u201cWe have a very large inventory of several million of these weapons,\u201d Kirby told the AP. \u201cWe take this very seriously and we think we do a very good job. That doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t losses. It doesn\u2019t mean that there aren\u2019t mistakes made.\u201d\n   The new report about the military&#39;s missing weapons highlights the inherent dangers in storing weapons and other dangerous equipment close to civilian populations. Criminals can break into military bases as well as any other building if proper security measures aren&#39;t in place. Furthermore, service members are human like anyone else, and aren&#39;t infallible when it comes to having lapses in judgment leading to the theft or misuse of weapons. There is a reason for strict security protocols in place at military installations, and the  AP&#39;s investigation reveals there could be more security gaps at domestic military facilities than the Pentagon realizes.\n Above all, the  AP&#39;s latest report should be a call to action for Congress to reenact accountability measures that would require the Pentagon to regularly share data about missing weapons. It should not take a national tragedy for the government and the military to fix these problems, however statistically small they may seem. It&#39;s important to also note that this recent data is only what we know so far, given that the Air Force did not report  any data. Small arms have also been lost  en masse on the battlefield or in combat areas, which could make the number of missing or lost weapons far larger if it is not included already in the data provided to the  Associated Press. So it very well could be that the data in the  AP&#39;s report is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to lost or stolen weapons.\n At the very least, a complete data set over time would certainly help show just how serious the problem actually is.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 09:02:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

The API opens the browser\u2019s animation engine to developers and was designed to underlie implementations of both CSS animations and transitions, leaving the door open to future animation effects. It is one of the most performant ways to animate on the Web, letting the browser make its own internal optimizations without hacks, coercion, or  window.requestAnimationFrame().\n  With the Web Animations API, we can move interactive animations from stylesheets to JavaScript, separating presentation from behavior. We no longer need to rely on DOM-heavy techniques such as writing CSS properties and scoping classes onto elements to control playback direction. And unlike pure, declarative CSS, JavaScript also lets us dynamically set values from properties to durations. For building custom animation libraries and creating interactive animations, the Web Animations API might be the perfect tool for the job. Let\u2019s see what it can do!\n For the rest of this article, I will sometimes refer to the Web Animation API as WAAPI. When searching for resources on the Web Animation API, you might be led astray by searching \u201cWeb Animation API\u201d so, to make it easy to find resources, I feel we should adopt the term WAAPI; tell me what you think in the comments below.\n  @okikio/animate is an animation library for the modern web. It was inspired by  animateplus, and  animejs; it is focused on performance and developer experience, and utilizes the Web Animation API to deliver butter-smooth animations at a small size, weighing in at  ~5.79 KB (minified and gzipped).\n  In 2020, I decided to make a more efficient PJAX library, similar to  Rezo Zero\u2019s \u2013  Starting Blocks project, but with the ease of use of  barbajs. I felt starting blocks was easier to extend with custom functionality, and could be made smoother, faster, and easier to use.\n Note: if you don\u2019t know what a PJAX library is I suggest checking out  MoOx/pjax; in short, PJAX allows for smooth transitions between pages using fetch requests and switching out DOM Elements.\n Over time my intent shifted, and I started noticing how often sites from  awwwards.com used PJAX, but often butchered the natural experience of the site and browser\u2009. Many of the sites looked cool at first glance, but the actual usage often told a different story\u2009\u2014\u2009scrollbars were often overridden, prefetching was often too eager, and a lack of preparation for people without powerful internet connections, CPUs and/or GPUs. So, I decided to  progressively enhance the library I was going to build. I started what I call the \u201cnative initiative\u201d stored in the GitHub repo  okikio/native; a means of introducing all the cool and modern features in a highly performant, compliant, and lightweight way.\n For the native initiative I designed the PJAX library  @okikio/native; while testing on an actual project, I ran into the Web Animation API, and realized there were no libraries that took advantage of it, so, I developed  @okikio/animate, to create a browser compliant animation library. ( Note: this was in 2020, around the same time  use-web-animations by wellyshen was being developed. If you are using react and need some quick animate.css like effects,  use-web-animations is a good fit.) At first, it was supposed to be simple wrapper but, little by little, I built on it and it\u2019s now at  80% feature parity with more mature animation libraries.\n Note: you can read more on the native initiative as well as the @okikio/native library on the  Github repo okikio/native. Also, okikio/native, is a  monorepo with @okikio/native and @okikio/animate being sub-packages within it.\n  The Web Animation API is very open in design. It is functional on its own but it\u2019s not the most developer-friendly or intuitive API, so I developed @okikio/animate to act as a wrapper around the WAAPI and introduce the features you know and love from other more mature animation libraries (with some new features included) to the high-performance nature of the Web Animation API.  Give the project\u2019s README a read for much more context.\n  @okikio/animate creates animations by creating new instances of Animate (a class that acts as a wrapper around the Web Animation API).\n import { Animate } from&#34;@okikio/animate&#34;;new Animate({ target: [/* ... */], duration: 2000, // ... });\n The  Animate class receives a set of targets to animate, it then creates a list of  WAAPI Animation instances, alongside a  main animation (the main animation is a small Animation instance that is set to animate over a non-visible element, it exists as a way of tracking the progress of the animations of the various target elements), the  Animate class then plays each target elements Animation instance, including the main animation, to create smooth animations.\n The main animation is there to ensure accuracy in different browser vendor implementations of WAAPI. The main animation is stored in   Animate.prototype.mainAnimation, while the target element\u2019s Animation instances are stored in a  WeakMap, with the key being its   KeyframeEffect. You can access the animation for a specific target using the   Animate.prototype.getAnimation(el).\n You don\u2018t need to fully understand the prior sentences, but they will aid your understanding of what @okikio/animate does. If you want to learn more about how WAAPI works, check out  MDN, or if you would like to learn more about the @okikio/animate library, I\u2019d suggest checking out the  okikio/native project on GitHub.\n  By default, creating a new instance of Animate is very annoying, so, I created the  animate function, which creates new Animate instances every time it\u2019s called.\n import animate from &#34;@okikio/animate&#34;;// orimport { animate } from &#34;@okikio/animate&#34;;animate({ target: [/* ... */], duration: 2000, // ... });\n  import animate from &#34;@okikio/animate&#34;;// Do this if you installed it via the script tag: const { animate } = window.animate;(async () =&gt; { let [options] = await animate({ target: &#34;.div&#34;, // Units are added automatically for transform CSS properties translateX: [0, 300], duration: 2000, // In milliseconds speed: 2, }); console.log(&#34;The Animation is done...&#34;);})();\n          You can find the source code for this demo in the   animate.ts and   animate.pug files in the GitHub repo. And, yes, the demo uses Pug, and is a fairly complex setup. I highly suggest  looking at the README as a primer for getting started.\n The native initiative uses  Gitpod, so if you want to play with the demo, I recommend clicking the  \u201cOpen in Gitpod\u201d link since the entire environment is already set up for you\u2009\u2014\u2009there\u2019s nothing to configure.\n You can also check out some  more examples in this CodePen collection I put together. For the most part, you can port your code from animejs to @okikio/animate with few-to-no issues.\n I should probably mention that @okikio/animate supports both the  target and  targets keywords for settings animation targets. @okikio/animate will merge both list of targets into one list and use   Sets to remove any repeated targets. @okikio/animate supports functions as animation options, so you can use staggering similar to  animejs. ( Note: the order of arguments are different, read more in the  \u201cAnimation Options &amp; CSS Properties as Methods\u201d section of the README file.)\n  @okikio/animate isn\u2019t perfect; nothing really is, and seeing as the Web Animation API is a living standard constantly being improved, @okikio/animate itself still has lots of space to grow. That said, I am constantly trying to improve it and would love your input so please open a new issue, create a pull request or we can have a discussion  over at the GitHub project.\n The first limitation is that it doesn\u2019t really have a built-in timeline. There are a few reasons for this:\n I ran out of time. I am still only a student and don\u2019t have lots of time to develop all the projects I want to.\n I didn\u2019t think a formal timeline was needed, as async/await programming was supported. Also, I added   timelineOffset as an animation option, should anyone ever need to create something similar to the timeline in animejs.\n  With  group effects and  sequence effects coming soon, I thought it would be best to leave the package small until an actual need comes up. On that note, I highly suggest reading  Daniel C. Wilson\u2019s series on the WAAPI, particularly  the fourth installment that covers group effects and sequence effects.\n Another limitation of @okikio/animate is that it lacks support for custom easings, like spring, elastic, etc. But check out  Jake Archibald\u2019s proposal for an easing worklet. He discusses multiple standards that are currently in discussion. I prefer his proposal, as it\u2019s the easiest to implement, not to mention the most elegant of the bunch. In the meanwhile, I\u2019m taking inspiration from  Kirill Vasiltsov article on  Spring animations with WAAPI and I am planning to build something similar into the library.\n The last limitation is that @okikio/animate only supports automatic units on transform functions e.g.  translateX,  translate,  scale,  skew, etc. This is no longer the case as of @okikio/ [email\u00a0protected], but there are still some limitations on CSS properties that support color. Check the  GitHub release for more detail.\n  animate({ targets: [&#34;.div&#34;, document.querySelectorAll(&#34;.el&#34;)], // By default &#34;px&#34;, will be applied translateX: 300, left: 500, margin: &#34;56 70 8em 70%&#34;, // &#34;deg&#34; will be applied to rotate instead of px rotate: 120, // No units will be auto applied color: &#34;rgb(25, 25, 25)&#34;, &#34;text-shadow&#34;: &#34;25px 5px 15px rgb(25, 25, 25)&#34;});\n  Some future features, like  ScrollTimeline, are right around the corner. I don\u2019t think anyone actually knows when it will release but since the ScrollTimeline in Chrome Canary 92, I think it\u2019s safe to say the chances of a release in the near future look pretty good.\n I built the  timeline animation option into @okikio/animate to future-proof it. Here\u2019s an example:\n  Thanks to Bramus for  the demo inspiration! Also, you may need the Canary version of Chrome or need to turn on Experimental Web Platform features in Chrome Flags to view this demo. It seems to work just fine on Firefox, though, so\u2026 \ud83e\udd23.\n If you want to read more on the ScrollTimeline, Bramus wrote  an excellent article on it. I would also suggest reading the Google Developers  article on Animation Worklets.\n My hope is to make the library smaller. It\u2019s currently  ~5.79 KB which seems high, at least to me. Normally, I would use a  bundlephobia embed but that has trouble bundling the project, so if you want to verify the size, I suggest using  bundle.js.org because it actually bundles the code locally on your browser. I specifically built it for checking the bundle size of @okikio/animate, but note it\u2019s not as accurate as bundlephobia.\n  One of the earlier demos shows polyfills in action. You are going to need   web-animations-next.min.js from web-animations-js to support timelines. Other modern features the  KeyframeEffect constructor is required.\n The polyfill uses JavaScript to test if the  KeyframeEffect is supported and, if it isn\u2019t, the polyfill loads and does its thing. Just avoid adding async/defer to the polyfill, or it will not work the way you expect. You\u2019ll also want to polyfill  Map,  Set, and  Promise.\n &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- Async --&gt; &lt;script src=&#34;https://cdn.polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default,es2015,es2018,Array.prototype.includes,Map,Set,Promise&#34; async&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- NO Async/Defer --&gt; &lt;script src=&#34;./js/webanimation-polyfill.min.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Content --&gt; &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\n And if you\u2019re building for ES6+, I highly recommend using  esbuild for transpiling, bundling, and minifying. For ES5, I suggest using esbuild (with minify off),  Typescript (with target of ES5), and  terser; as of now, this is the fastest setup to transpile to ES5, it\u2019s faster and more reliable than babel. See the  Gulpfile from the demo for more details.\n  @okikio/animate is a wrapper around the Web Animation API (WAAPI) that allows you to use all the features you love from animejs and other animation libraries, in a small and concise package. So, what are your thoughts after reading about it? Is it something you think you\u2019ll reach for when you need to craft complex animations? Or, even more important, is there something that would hold you back from using it?
