Linda Geddes reports.</p><p>利用睡眠剥夺将人们出于严重的抑郁症可能似乎是违反直观的，但对于一些人来说，这是唯一有效的东西。 Linda Geddes报道。</p><p>    The first sign that something is happening is Angelina’s hands. As she chats to the nurse in Italian, she begins to gesticulate, jabbing, moulding and circling the air with her fingers. As the minutes pass and Angelina becomes increasingly animated, I notice a musicality to her voice that I’m sure wasn’t there earlier. The lines in her forehead seem to be softening, and the pursing and stretching of her lips and the crinkling of her eyes tell me as much about her mental state as any interpreter could.</p><p>    事情正在发生的第一个标志是安吉丽娜的手。当她与意大利语的护士聊天时，她开始用手指打手势，刺戳，成型和盘旋空气。随着分钟通行证和安吉丽娜变得越来越动画，我注意到她的声音的音乐性，我肯定的是早先没有那么的。她额头的线条似乎是软化，而且她的嘴唇和伸展的嘴唇和她的眼睛的皱巴兰在任何译员都可以告诉我她的精神状态。</p><p> Angelina is coming to life, precisely as my body is beginning to shut down. It’s 2am, and we’re sat in the brightly lit kitchen of a Milanese psychiatric ward, eating spaghetti. There’s a dull ache behind my eyes, and I keep on zoning out, but Angelina won’t be going to bed for at least another 17 hours, so I’m steeling myself for a long night. In case I doubted her resolve, Angelina removes her glasses, looks directly at me, and uses her thumbs and forefingers to pull open the wrinkled, grey-tinged skin around her eyes. “Occhi aperti,” she says. Eyes open.</p><p> 安吉丽娜正在栩栩如生，正如我的身体开始关闭一样。现在是凌晨2点，我们坐在米兰精神病病房的明亮厨房里，吃意大利面。我的眼睛后面有一个沉闷的疼痛，我继续划出，但安吉丽娜不会再睡觉了至少17个小时，所以我漫长的夜晚。如果我怀疑她的决心，安吉丽娜就会去掉她的眼镜，直接看着我，并用她的拇指和食指拉开皱纹，灰色的灰色皮肤。 “occhi aperti，”她说。睁开眼睛。</p><p> This is the second night in three that Angelina has been deliberately deprived of sleep. For a person with bipolar disorder who has spent the past two years in a deep and crippling depression, it may sound like the last thing she needs, but Angelina – and the doctors treating her – hope it will be her salvation. For two decades, Francesco Benedetti, who heads the psychiatry and clinical psychobiology unit at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, has been investigating so-called wake therapy, in combination with bright light exposure and lithium, as a means of treating depression where drugs have often failed. As a result, psychiatrists in the USA, the UK and other European countries are starting to take notice, launching variations of it in their own clinics. These ‘chronotherapies’ seem to work by kick-starting a sluggish biological clock; in doing so, they’re also shedding new light on the underlying pathology of depression, and on the function of sleep more generally.</p><p> 这是第三个晚上，因为安吉丽娜被故意剥夺睡眠。对于患有近两年的双相情感障碍的人在深层和瘫痪的萧条中，它可能听起来像是她所需要的最后一件事，而是安吉丽娜 - 以及治疗她的医生 - 希望它将成为她的救恩。在二十年中，在米兰的圣拉弗雷医院前往精神病学和临床心理学单位的Francesco Benedetti一直在调查所谓的Wake疗法，与明亮的灯光暴露和锂相结合，作为治疗抑郁症的手段，其中毒品经常失败的。因此，美国的精神科医生，英国和其他欧洲国家开始注意到，在自己的诊所发起了它的变化。这些“计时疗法”似乎通过启动一个缓慢的生物钟来工作;在这样做时，他们还在抑郁症的潜在病理学以及睡眠功能普遍存在的新光线。</p><p> “Sleep deprivation really has opposite effects in healthy people and those with depression,” says Benedetti. If you’re healthy and you don’t sleep, you’ll feel in a bad mood. But if you’re depressed, it can prompt an immediate improvement in mood, and in cognitive abilities. But, Benedetti adds, there’s a catch: once you go to sleep and catch up on those missed hours of sleep, you’ll have a 95 per cent chance of relapse.</p><p> “睡眠剥夺真的对健康的人和抑郁症的效果相反，”Benedetti说。如果你健康，你不睡觉，你会感到难过心情不好。但如果你沮丧，它可以促使心情和认知能力立即改善。但是，Benedetti补充说，有一个抓住：一旦你去睡觉并赶上那些错过的睡眠时间，你将有95％的复发机会。</p><p> The antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation was first published in a report in Germany in 1959. This captured the imagination of a young researcher from Tübingen in Germany, Burkhard Pflug, who investigated the effect in his doctoral thesis and in subsequent studies during the 1970s. By systematically depriving depressed people of sleep, he confirmed that spending a single night awake could jolt them out of depression.</p><p> 睡眠剥夺的抗抑郁效应于1959年在德国的一份报告中发表。这捕获了来自德国Tübingen的年轻研究员的想象力，他在20世纪70年代调查了他的博士论文和随后的研究中的效果。通过系统地剥夺抑郁症的睡眠人们，他证实，花一个夜晚的醒来可能会颠倒它们。</p><p> Benedetti became interested in this idea as a young psychiatrist in the early 1990s. Prozac had been launched just a few years earlier, hailing a revolution in the treatment of depression. But such drugs were rarely tested on people with bipolar disorder. Bitter experience has since taught Benedetti that antidepressants are largely ineffective for people with bipolar depression anyway.</p><p> Benedetti在20世纪90年代初作为一个年轻的精神科医生，对这个想法感兴趣。 Prozac刚刚推出了几年以前推出的，在治疗抑郁症的革命中发表了革命。但这些药物很少对具有双相情感障碍的人进行测试。由于无论如何，抗抑郁药的抗抑郁药对抗抑郁药的抗抑郁药抗抑郁药的抗抑郁症很低。 </p><p> His patients were in desperate need of an alternative, and his supervisor, Enrico Smeraldi, had an idea up his sleeve. Having read some of the early papers on wake therapy, he tested their theories on his own patients, with positive results. “We knew it worked,” says Benedetti. “Patients with these terrible histories were getting well immediately. My task was finding a way of making them stay well.”</p><p>他的患者需要替代方案，他的主管Enrico Smeraldi令人想到他的袖子。在Wake疗法上阅读一些早期纸张，他在自己的患者上测试了他们的理论，具有积极的结果。 “我们知道它的工作，”Benedetti说。 “这些可怕历史的患者立即康复。我的任务正在寻找一种让他们保持健康的方法。“</p><p> So he and his colleagues turned to the scientific literature for ideas. A handful of American studies had suggested that lithium might prolong the effect of sleep deprivation, so they investigated that. They found that 65 per cent of patients taking lithium showed a sustained response to sleep deprivation when assessed after three months, compared to just 10 per cent of those not taking the drug.</p><p> 所以他和他的同事转向科学文学的想法。少数美国研究表明锂可能延长睡眠剥夺的影响，因此他们调查了这一点。他们发现，在三个月后评估时，65％的服用锂患者对睡眠剥夺的持续反应，只有只有10％的那些未服用该药物。</p><p> Since even a short nap could undermine the efficacy of the treatment, they also started searching for new ways of keeping patients awake at night, and drew inspiration from aviation medicine, where bright light was being used to keep pilots alert. This too extended the effects of sleep deprivation, to a similar extent as lithium.</p><p> 由于即使短暂的小睡可能破坏治疗的功效，他们也开始寻找让患者在夜间醒来的新方法，并从航空医学中制作灵感，其中明亮的光线被用来保持飞行员警报。这太延长了睡眠剥夺的影响，以与锂类似的程度。</p><p> “We decided to give them the whole package, and the effect was brilliant,” says Benedetti. By the late 1990s, they were routinely treating patients with triple chronotherapy: sleep deprivation, lithium and light. The sleep deprivations would occur every other night for a week, and bright light exposure for 30 minutes each morning would be continued for a further two weeks – a protocol they continue to use to this day. “We can think of it not as sleep-depriving people, but as modifying or enlarging the period of the sleep–wake cycle from 24 to 48 hours,” says Benedetti. “People go to bed every two nights, but when they go to bed, they can sleep for as long as they want.”</p><p> “我们决定给他们整个包装，效果很棒，”Benedetti说。到20世纪90年代末，他们经常治疗三重计时患者：睡眠剥夺，锂和光。睡眠剥夺将每隔一夜发生一次，每天早上30分钟的明亮曝光将继续进行两周时间 - 这是他们继续使用的协议。 “我们可以认为它不是睡眠剥夺人，而是在24至48小时内修改或扩大睡眠唤醒周期的时期，”Benedetti说。 “人们每两年晚上睡觉，但是当他们上床睡觉时，他们就可以睡个好觉。”</p><p> San Raffaele Hospital first introduced triple chronotherapy in 1996. Since then, it has treated close to a thousand patients with bipolar depression – many of whom had failed to respond to antidepressant drugs. The results speak for themselves: according to the most recent data, 70 per cent of people with drug-resistant bipolar depression responded to triple chronotherapy within the first week, and 55 per cent had a sustained improvement in their depression one month later.</p><p> San Raffaele医院于1996年首次介绍了三重计时疗法。从那时起，它已经治疗了一千名患有双相抑郁症的患者 - 其中许多人未能应对抗抑郁药物。结果为自己说：根据最近的数据，70％的耐药双相抑郁症的人在第一周内回应了三重时间，并且在一个月后，他们的抑郁症持续改善。</p><p> And whereas antidepressants – if they work – can take over a month to have an effect, and can increase the risk of suicide in the meantime, chronotherapy usually produces an immediate and persistent decrease in suicidal thoughts, even after just one night of sleep deprivation.</p><p> 而抗抑郁药 - 如果他们工作 - 可能需要一个月才能产生效果，并且可以在此期间增加自杀的风险，即使只是在睡眠剥夺的一晚之后，计时疗法通常会产生立即和持续的减少。</p><p>  Angelina was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder 30 years ago, when she was in her late 30s. The diagnosis followed a period of intense stress: her husband was facing a tribunal at work, and they were worried about having enough money to support themselves and the kids. Angelina fell into a depression that lasted nearly three years. Since then, her mood has oscillated, but she’s down more often than not. She takes an arsenal of drugs – antidepressants, mood stabilisers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping tablets – which she dislikes because they make her feel like a patient, even though she acknowledges this is what she is.</p><p>  当她30多岁时，安吉丽娜第一次被诊断出患有双相障碍。诊断遵循了一段强烈的压力：她的丈夫在工作中面临着仲裁庭，他们担心有足够的钱支持自己和孩子们。安吉丽娜陷入了持续近三年的萧条。从那时起，她的心情已经振荡，但她的频率低于而不是。她拿走了药物的阿森纳 - 抗抑郁药，情绪稳定剂，抗焦虑毒品和睡眠平板电脑 - 她不喜欢，因为他们让她感觉像病人一样，即使她承认这就是她所在的。 </p><p> If I’d met her three days ago, she says, it’s unlikely I would have recognised her. She didn’t want to do anything, she’d stopped washing her hair or wearing make-up, and she stank. She also felt very pessimistic about the future. After her first night of sleep deprivation, she’d felt more energetic, but this largely subsided after her recovery sleep. Even so, today she felt motivated enough to visit a hairdresser in anticipation of my visit. I compliment her appearance, and she pats her dyed, golden waves, thanking me for noticing.</p><p>如果我三天前见过她，她说，我不太可能认识到她。她不想做任何事情，她停止洗头发或穿着化妆，她蹒跚而行。她也对未来感到非常悲观。在她的第一个睡眠剥夺之后，她感到更精力充沛，但这在她的恢复睡眠之后很大程度上会消退。即便如此，今天她觉得足够有动力，以期待着我的访问来访问美发师。我赞美她的外表，她拍拍了她染色的金色的波浪，感谢我注意到了。</p><p> At 3am, we move to the light room, and entering is like being transported forward to midday. Bright sunlight streams in through the skylights overhead, falling on five armchairs, which are lined up against the wall. This is an illusion, of course – the blue sky and brilliant sun are nothing more than coloured plastic and a very bright light – but the effect is exhilarating nonetheless. I could be sitting on a sun lounger at midday; the only thing missing is the heat.</p><p> 在凌晨3点，我们搬到光线室，进入就像正在向中午运送。通过天窗开销的明亮的阳光流，落在五个扶手椅上，落在墙上。这是一种幻觉，当然 - 蓝天和辉煌的阳光只是彩色塑料和一个非常明亮的光线 - 但效果仍然令人振奋。我可以在中午坐落在阳光下;唯一缺少的是热量。</p><p> When I’d interviewed her seven hours earlier, with the help of an interpreter, Angelina’s face had remained expressionless as she’d replied. Now, at 3.20am, she is smiling, and even beginning to initiate a conversation with me in English, which she’d claimed not to speak. By dawn, Angelina’s telling me about the family history she’s started writing, which she’d like to pick up again, and inviting me to stay with her in Sicily.</p><p> 当我早先采访她七个小时后，在口译员的帮助下，当她回答时，安吉丽娜的脸仍然表达。现在，在3.20am，她微笑着，甚至开始用英语发起对话，她声称不说话。由Dawn，Angelina告诉我她开始写作的家族史，她想再次拿起，并邀请我在西西里岛和她在一起。</p><p> How could something as simple as staying awake overnight bring about such a transformation? Unpicking the mechanism isn’t straightforward: we still don’t fully understand the nature of depression or the function of sleep, both of which involve multiple areas of the brain. But recent studies have started to yield some insights.</p><p> 如何像保持令人醒着过夜带来这样的转型怎么样？解压缩机制并不简单：我们仍然没有完全理解抑郁的性质或睡眠功能，这两者都涉及大脑的多个区域。但最近的研究已经开始产生一些见解。</p><p>  The brain activity of people with depression looks different during sleep and wakefulness than that of healthy people. During the day, wake-promoting signals coming from the circadian system – our internal 24-hour biological clock – are thought to help us resist sleep, with these signals being replaced by sleep-promoting ones at night. Our brain cells work in cycles too, becoming increasingly excitable in response to stimuli during wakefulness, with this excitability dissipating when we sleep. But in people with depression and bipolar disorder, these fluctuations appear dampened or absent.</p><p>  睡眠期间，抑郁症的人们的大脑活动看起来不同于健康人的醒来。在白天，来自昼夜昼夜系统的唤醒信号 - 我们的内部24小时生物钟 - 被认为有助于我们抵抗睡眠，这些信号被夜间睡眠促销升级。我们的脑细胞也在循环中工作，越来越激发，以响应醒来的刺激，当我们睡觉时这种兴奋性消散。但在患有抑郁和双相障碍的人中，这些波动显得抑制或缺席。</p><p> Depression is also associated with altered daily rhythms of hormone secretion and body temperature, and the more severe the illness, the greater the degree of disruption. Like the sleep signals, these rhythms are also driven by the body’s circadian system, which itself is driven by a set of interacting proteins, encoded by ‘clock genes’ that are expressed in a rhythmic pattern throughout the day. They drive hundreds of different cellular processes, enabling them to keep time with one another and turn on and off. A circadian clock ticks in every cell of your body, including your brain cells, and they are coordinated by an area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which responds to light.</p><p> 抑郁症也与激素分泌和体温的日常节奏改变有关，疾病越严重，破坏程度越大。与睡眠信号一样，这些节奏也由身体的昼夜节律系统驱动，该系统本身由一组相互作用的蛋白质驱动，这些蛋白质在整个一天内以有节奏模式表达的“时钟基因”编码。它们驱动数百种不同的蜂窝流程，使它们能够彼此保持时间并打开和关闭。在您的身体的每个细胞中，包括您的脑细胞的昼夜节目刻度，并且它们由称为Suprachiasmatic核的大脑区域协调，这响应了光。</p><p> “When people are seriously depressed, their circadian rhythms tend to be very flat; they don’t get the usual response of melatonin rising in the evening, and the cortisol levels are consistently high rather than falling in the evening and the night,” says Steinn Steingrimsson, a psychiatrist at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden, who is currently running a trial of wake therapy.</p><p> “当人们受到严重沮丧时，他们的昼夜节律往往非常平坦;他们不会在晚上升高褪黑激素的常规反应，皮质醇水平始终如一，而不是在晚上和夜晚落下，“瑞典哥德堡的精神病学家精神科医生Steinn Steingrimsson说目前正在运行唤醒治疗的试验。 </p><p> Recovery from depression is associated with a normalisation of these cycles. “I think depression may be one of the consequences of this basic flattening of circadian rhythms and homeostasis in the brain,” says Benedetti. “When we sleep-deprive depressed people, we restore this cyclical process.”</p><p>从抑郁症恢复与这些循环的正常化相关。 “我认为抑郁症可能是大脑中昼夜节律和稳态的这种基本平整的后果之一，”Benedetti说。 “当我们睡眠沮丧的人时，我们恢复了这个周期性的过程。”</p><p> But how does this restoration come about? One possibility is that depressed people simply need added sleep pressure to jump-start a sluggish system. Sleep pressure – our urge to sleep – is thought to arise because of the gradual release of adenosine in the brain. It builds up throughout the day and attaches to adenosine receptors on neurons, making us feel drowsy. Drugs that trigger these receptors have the same effect, whereas drugs that block them – such as caffeine – make us feel more awake.</p><p> 但这种恢复如何出现？一种可能性是沮丧的人只是需要增加睡眠压力以跳跃开始一个缓慢的系统。睡眠压力 - 我们睡觉的冲动 - 被认为是因为大脑中腺苷逐渐释放出来。它在一天中建立起来，并依附于神经元的腺苷受体，让我们感到昏昏欲睡。引发这些受体的药物具有相同的效果，而阻止它们的药物 - 例如咖啡因 - 让我们感觉更令人醒来。</p><p> To investigate whether this process might underpin the antidepressant effects of prolonged wakefulness, researchers at Tufts University in Massachusetts took mice with depression-like symptoms and administered high doses of a compound that triggers adenosine receptors, mimicking what happens during sleep deprivation. After 12 hours, the mice had improved, measured by how long they spent trying to escape when forced to swim or when suspended by their tails.</p><p> 为了调查该过程是否可能支持长期清醒的抗抑郁作用，马萨诸塞州塔夫茨大学的研究人员用抑郁症状的症状服用小鼠，并施用高剂量的化合物，触发腺苷受体，模仿睡眠剥夺期间发生的事情。 12小时后，小鼠改善了，在被迫游泳或被尾巴悬挂时，他们花了多长时间测量。</p><p> We also know sleep deprivation does other things to the depressed brain. It prompts changes in the balance of neurotransmitters in areas that help to regulate mood, and it restores normal activity in emotion-processing areas of the brain, strengthening connections between them.</p><p> 我们也知道睡眠剥夺为抑郁的大脑做了其他事情。它促使在有助于调节情绪的区域中神经递质的余额的变化，并且它在大脑的情感处理区域恢复正常活动，加强它们之间的联系。</p><p> And as Benedetti and his team discovered, if wake therapy kick-starts a sluggish circadian rhythm, lithium and light therapy seem to help maintain it. Lithium has been used as a mood stabiliser for years without anyone really understanding how it works, but we know it boosts the expression of a protein, called Per2, that drives the molecular clock in cells.</p><p> 随着Benedetti和他的团队发现，如果韦克治疗踢腿 - 开始缓慢的昼夜节律，锂和轻质疗法似乎有助于维护它。锂已被用作情绪稳定剂多年，没有任何人真正了解它是如何工作的，但我们知道它会提高蛋白质的表达，称为彼此的蛋白质，这使得细胞中的分子时钟驱动。</p><p> Bright light, meanwhile, is known to alter the rhythms of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, as well as boosting activity in emotion-processing areas of the brain more directly. Indeed, the American Psychiatric Association states that light therapy is as effective as most antidepressants in treating non-seasonal depression.</p><p> 同时，明亮的光明是众所周知的，可以改变核心核的节奏，以及更直接地提高大脑的情绪处理区域的活动。实际上，美国精神病协会指出，光照疗法是治疗非季节性抑郁症的大多数抗抑郁药。</p><p>  In spite of its promising results against bipolar disorder, wake therapy has been slow to catch on in other countries. “You could be cynical and say it’s because you can’t patent it,” says David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust.</p><p>  尽管其对双相情感障碍的有希望的结果，但在其他国家的捕获疗法缓慢缓慢。 “你可能是愤世嫉俗的，并说是因为你无法专利，”南伦敦南部的顾问精神科医生David Veale说，“莫祖利NHS基金会信任”。 </p><p> Certainly, Benedetti has never been offered pharmaceutical funding to carry out his trials of chronotherapy. Instead, he has – until recently – been reliant on government funding, which is often in short supply. His current research is being funded by the EU. Had he followed the conventional route of accepting industry money to run drug trials with his patients, he quips, he probably wouldn’t be living in a two-bedroom apartment and driving a 1998 Honda Civic.</p><p>当然，Benedetti从未提供制药资金来执行他的计时治疗的试验。相反，他已经 - 直到最近 - 依赖于政府资金，这通常是供应不足的。他目前的研究是由欧盟资助的。他跟着常规接受行业资金的途径与他的患者一起运行药物试验，他可能不会住在一间两卧室公寓和驾驶1998年的公民。</p><p> The bias towards pharmaceutical solutions has kept chronotherapy below the radar for many psychiatrists. “A lot of people just don’t know about it,” says Veale.</p><p> 对药物溶液的偏见使许多精神科医生的雷达低于雷达。 “很多人只是不知道它，”瓦尔斯说。</p><p> It’s also difficult to find a suitable placebo for sleep deprivation or bright light exposure, which means that large, randomised placebo-controlled trials of chronotherapy haven’t been done. Because of this, there’s some scepticism about how well it really works. “While there is increasing interest, I don’t think many treatments based on this approach are yet routinely used – the evidence needs to be better and there are some practical difficulties in implementing things like sleep deprivation,” says John Geddes, a professor of epidemiological psychiatry at the University of Oxford.</p><p> 对于睡眠剥夺或明亮的光线暴露，发现合适的安慰剂也很难，这意味着尚未完成计量的大型随机安慰剂对照试验。因此，关于它真正有效的一些怀疑论。 “虽然正在越来越兴趣，但我认为尚未常规使用基于这种方法的许多治疗 - 证据需要更好，并且在睡眠剥夺等事情方面存在一些实际困难，”John Geddes牛津大学的流行病学精神病学。</p><p> Even so, interest in the processes underpinning chronotherapy is beginning to spread. “Insights into the biology of sleep and circadian systems are now providing promising targets for treatment development,” says Geddes. “It goes beyond pharmaceuticals – targeting sleep with psychological treatments might also help or even prevent mental disorders.”</p><p> 即便如此，对营养过程中的过程的兴趣开始蔓延。 “睡眠生物学和昼夜节约系统的见解现在正在为治疗发展提供有前途的目标，”Geddes说。 “它超越了制药 - 患有心理治疗的睡眠可能也有助于甚至预防精神障碍。”</p><p> In the UK, the USA, Denmark and Sweden, psychiatrists are investigating chronotherapy as a treatment for general depression. “A lot of the studies that have been done so far have been very small,” says Veale, who is currently planning a feasibility study at Maudsley Hospital in London. “We need to demonstrate that it is feasible and that people can adhere to it.”</p><p> 在英国，美国，丹麦和瑞典，精神科医生正在调查计时治疗作为一般抑郁症的治疗。 “到目前为止已经做了很多已经完成的研究已经非常小，”州目前计划在伦敦Maudsley医院的可行性研究。 “我们需要证明它是可行的，人们可以坚持它。”</p><p> So far, what studies there have been have produced mixed results. Klaus Martiny, who researches non-drug methods for treating depression at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, has published two trials looking at the effects of sleep deprivation, together with daily morning bright light and regular bedtimes, on general depression. In the first study, 75 patients were given the antidepressant duloxetine, in combination with either chronotherapy or daily exercise. After the first week, 41 per cent of the chronotherapy group had experienced a halving of their symptoms, compared to 13 per cent of the exercise group. And at 29 weeks, 62 per cent of the wake therapy patients were symptom-free, compared to 38 per cent of those in the exercise group.</p><p> 到目前为止，有什么研究已经产生了混合结果。研究了在丹麦哥本哈根大学治疗抑郁症的非药物方法的Klaus Martiny已发表两项试验，这些试验看着睡眠剥夺的影响，以及日常清晨明亮的光明和定期睡眠。在第一项研究中，将75名患者赋予抗抑郁的Duloxetine，结合时间或每日运动。第一周后，41％的计时疗法组经历了它们的症状，而占锻炼组的13％。在29周内，62％的尾游治疗患者症状无症状，而锻炼组中的38％。</p><p> In Martiny’s second study, severely depressed hospital inpatients who had failed to respond to antidepressant drugs were offered the same chronotherapy package as an add-on to the drugs and psychotherapy they were undergoing. After one week, those in the chronotherapy group improved significantly more than the group receiving standard treatment, although in subsequent weeks the control group caught up.</p><p> 在Martiny的第二次研究中，患有对抗抑郁药物未能应对抗抑郁药的医院住院患者的严重抑郁症住院患者与他们正在进行的药物和心理治疗相同的计时包。一周后，计时组中的那些比接受标准治疗的基团更高，虽然在随后的几周内，对照组赶上了。 </p><p> No one has yet compared wake therapy head-to-head with antidepressants; neither has it been tested against bright light therapy and lithium alone. But even if it’s only effective for a minority, many people with depression – and indeed psychiatrists – may find the idea of a drug-free treatment attractive.</p><p>没有人将Wake治疗头部与抗抑郁剂进行比较;它既不是针对明亮的轻疗法和单独的锂测试。但即使它对少数群体有效，许多患有抑郁症的人 - 和实际上的精神病学家 - 可能会发现吸毒治疗的想法。</p><p> “I’m a pill pusher for a living, and it still appeals to me to do something that doesn’t involve pills,” says Jonathan Stewart, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University in New York, who is currently running a wake therapy trial at New York State Psychiatric Institute.</p><p> “我是一个谋生的药丸，它仍然吸引我做一些不涉及药丸的东西，”纽约哥伦比亚大学临床精神病学教授Jonathan Stewart说，目前正在运行唤醒纽约州精神病学院治疗审判。</p><p> Unlike Benedetti, Stewart only keeps patients awake for one night: “I couldn’t see a lot of people agreeing to stay in hospital for three nights, and it also requires a lot of nursing and resources,” he says. Instead, he uses something called sleep phase advance, where on the days after a night of sleep deprivation, the time the patient goes to sleep and wakes up is systematically brought forward. So far, Stewart has treated around 20 patients with this protocol, and 12 have shown a response – most of them during the first week.</p><p> 与Benedetti不同，斯图尔特只让患者醒来一晚：“我看不到很多人同意留在医院的三个晚上，也需要很多护理和资源，”他说。相反，他使用了叫睡眠阶段进步的东西，在一晚的睡眠剥夺后的日子里，患者睡觉并唤醒的时间被系统地提出。到目前为止，Stewart已经治疗了大约20名患者的这一议定书，12岁患者显示了一个反应 - 在第一周中大多数人。</p><p> It may also work as a prophylactic: recent studies suggest that teenagers whose parents set – and manage to enforce – earlier bedtimes are less at risk of depression and suicidal thinking. Like light therapy and sleep deprivation, the precise mechanism is unclear, but researchers suspect a closer fit between sleep time and the natural light–dark cycle is important.</p><p> 它也可以作为预防性的作用：最近的研究表明，父母集体和实施的青少年 - 早期的睡眠较少有抑郁和自杀思维的风险。像光疗和睡眠剥夺一样，精确的机制尚不清楚，但研究人员怀疑睡眠时间与自然光暗循环之间的贴心很重要。</p><p> But sleep phase advance has so far failed to hit the mainstream. And, Stewart accepts, it’s not for everybody. “For those for whom it works, it’s a miracle cure. But just as Prozac doesn’t get everyone better who takes it, neither does this,” he says. “My problem is that I have no idea ahead of time who it’s going to help.”</p><p> 但睡眠阶段进步到目前为止未能击中主流。而且，斯图尔特接受了，这不是每个人。 “对于那些工作的人来说，这是一个奇迹治愈。但就像Prozac没有让每个人都接受它，也没有这样做，“他说。 “我的问题是，我不会提前想到它会帮助的时间。”</p><p>  Depression can strike anyone, but there’s mounting evidence that genetic variations can disrupt the circadian system to make certain people more vulnerable. Several clock gene variations have been associated with an elevated risk of developing mood disorders.</p><p>  抑郁症可以袭击任何人，但是有证据证明遗传变化可能会破坏昼夜节约系统，使某些人更脆弱。几种时钟基因变化与发展情绪障碍的风险升高有关。</p><p> Stress can then compound the problem. Our response to it is largely mediated through the hormone cortisol, which is under strong circadian control, but cortisol itself also directly influences the timing of our circadian clocks. So if you have a weak clock, the added burden of stress could be enough to tip your system over the edge.</p><p> 然后压力可以复制这个问题。我们对其对其的反应主要通过激素皮质醇介导，该激素皮质醇在强烈的昼夜控制下，但皮质醇本身也直接影响了我们的昼夜节目时钟的时间。因此，如果您有一个弱小的时钟，增加的压力负担可能足以提示您的系统在边缘。 </p><p> Indeed, you can trigger depressive symptoms in mice by repeatedly exposing them to a noxious stimulus, such as an electric shock, from which they can’t escape – a phenomenon called learned helplessness. In the face of this ongoing stress, the animals eventually just give up and exhibit depression-like behaviours. When David Welsh, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego, analysed the brains of mice that had depressive symptoms, he found disrupted circadian rhythms in two critical areas of the brain’s reward circuit – a system that’s strongly implicated in depression.</p><p>实际上，您可以通过反复将它们触发小鼠中的抑郁症状，以一种有害的刺激，例如电击，从中无法逃脱 - 一种称为学习的无助的现象。面对这种持续的压力，动物最终只是放弃并表现出抑郁症的行为。当加州大学的精神科医生大卫威尔士圣地亚哥分析了抑郁症状的老鼠大脑，他发现昼夜节律在大脑奖励电路的两个关键领域 - 一个强烈涉及抑郁的系统。</p><p>  But Welsh has also shown that a disturbed circadian system itself can cause depression-like symptoms. When he took healthy mice and knocked out a key clock gene in the brain’s master clock, they looked just like the depressed mice he’d been studying earlier. “They don’t need to learn to be helpless, they are already helpless,” Welsh says.</p><p>  但威尔士州也表明，令人不安的昼夜节律系统本身可以引起抑郁症状的症状。当他服用健康的小鼠并在大脑的主时钟中敲掉一个关键的时钟基因时，他们看起来就像他早先学习的沮丧的老鼠一样。 “他们不需要学会无助，他们已经无助了，”威尔士说。</p><p> So if disrupted circadian rhythms are a likely cause of depression, what can be done to prevent rather than treat them? Is it possible to strengthen your circadian clock to increase psychological resilience, rather than remedy depressive symptoms by forgoing sleep?</p><p> 所以如果讨论昼夜节律是一个可能的抑郁症的原因，可以采取什么来防止而不是对待它们？是否有可能加强您的昼夜时钟来提高心理恢复力，而不是通过睡眠来增加抑制抑郁症状？</p><p> Martiny thinks so. He is currently testing whether keeping a more regular daily schedule could prevent his depressed inpatients from relapsing once they’ve recovered and are released from the psychiatric ward. “That’s when the trouble usually comes,” he says. “Once they’re discharged their depression gets worse again.”</p><p> Martiny认为是的。他目前正在测试保持更加常规的日程安排是否可以防止他抑郁的住院患者复发，并从精神病病房释放。 “那是麻烦通常来的时候，”他说。 “一旦他们排出，他们的抑郁症再次变得更糟。”</p><p> Peter is a 45-year-old care assistant from Copenhagen who has battled with depression since his early teens.
