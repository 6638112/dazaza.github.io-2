The news came nearly seven years after she and several other prominent investigative journalists launched the company they hoped would provide tough-minded, independent and original reporting, with the help of generous funding from billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.</p><p>  普瓦特拉斯（Poitras）在周四的一封公开信中透露了她离开“初看”的机会。该消息是在她和其他几位杰出的调查记者创办这家公司后近七年的，他们希望这家公司能够在亿万富翁eBay创始人皮埃尔·奥米迪亚（Pierre Omidyar）的慷慨资助下提供坚强，独立和原始的报道。</p><p>  In a statement early Thursday afternoon, First Look described Poitras’s parting from the company as a “natural” decision to not renew her contract after she “decided to step away from her role at the company to pursue her own projects.” The company denied that its decision was based on Poitras talking to the media.</p><p>  在周四下午的一份声明中，First Look将Poitras的离职描述为“决定放弃在公司的职位以继续自己的项目”后不续签合同的“自然”决定。该公司否认其决定是基于Poitras与媒体的谈话。</p><p> Later Thursday, First Look issued another statement that Poitras had “not been active in any capacity with our company for more than two years. This is simply not a tenable situation for us or any company.” Poitras denied this, saying she had been active on several films in production when she was fired as well as making an online security guide for filmmakers.</p><p> 周四晚些时候，First Look发表了另一份声明，称Poitras“两年多来一直没有在我们公司担任任何职务。对于我们或任何公司来说，这简直是不可行的情况。” Poitras否认了这一点，称她在被解雇时一直活跃在制作中的几部电影中，并为电影制作人制作了在线安全指南。</p><p>  Her departure means only one person from First Look’s founding team remains after  years of turmoil and turnover at the organization, during which she says she was repeatedly “raising concerns internally about patterns of discrimination and retaliation.”</p><p>  她的离职意味着，在公司多年的动荡和离职后，First Look的创始团队中只有一个人留下来。在此期间，她说她一直在“内部提出对歧视和报复模式的担忧”。 </p><p>  Poitras, a 2012 MacArthur “genius” grant recipient, came to prominence for her 2013 Pulitzer-winning work with Glenn Greenwald bringing to light the blockbuster disclosures of National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. Greenwald was also one of First Look’s co-founders; he quit in October with a fiery and meandering  resignation letter objecting to what he called censorship of a column he had written about then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p><p>Poitras是2012年麦克阿瑟（MacArthur）“天才”拨款受助人，在与格伦·格林瓦尔德（Glenn Greenwald）一起获得2013年普利策奖的作品中脱颖而出。格林瓦尔德（Greenwald）也是First Look的联合创始人之一；他在十月份辞职，并发出激烈而曲折的辞职信，反对他所谓的对当时的民主党候选人乔·拜登和他的儿子亨特撰写的专栏的审查。</p><p> Now, Jeremy Scahill, a former Nation writer who is close to the Intercept’s editor in chief, Betsy Reed, is the only member of the founding team remaining at the organization.</p><p> 现在，前民族作家杰里米·斯卡希尔（Jeremy Scahill）与Intercept总编辑贝茜·里德（Betsy Reed）十分接近，是该组织中唯一的创始团队成员。</p><p>  The events leading up to Poitras’s departure are ironic given that First Look’s primary concerns at its outset were data privacy and source protections — areas in which the Intercept failed when it came to the case of Reality Winner, a young Air Force veteran and NSA intelligence specialist who in 2017 sent the publication a classified document about Russian hackers accessing U.S. voter registration databases. Even before  the Intercept published the documents, federal investigators traced them back to Winner and arrested her.</p><p>  考虑到First Look最初关注的主要是数据隐私和源保护，导致Poitras离开的事件具有讽刺意味。在这些领域中，Intercept失败了，这是一名年轻的空军资深人士和NSA情报专家Reality Winner的案例。他在2017年向出版物发送了一份有关俄罗斯黑客访问美国选民注册数据库的机密文件。甚至在Intercept发布文件之前，联邦调查人员便将它们追溯到Winner并将其逮捕。</p><p>   First Look conducted two internal reviews of the matter, neither of which have been made public. But in a  statement announcing the conclusion of the first review in 2017, Reed concluded that “our practices fell short of the standards to which we hold ourselves for minimizing the risks of source exposure when handling anonymously provided materials.”</p><p>   First Look对此事进行了两次内部审查，但均未公开。但里德在宣布2017年首次审查结论的声明中得出结论，“我们的做法未达到我们在处理匿名提供的材料时将源头暴露风险降至最低的标准。”</p><p> According to an unsealed affidavit in the Winner case filed by an FBI agent, the  investigation was sparked when Intercept journalists sought to verify the documents she sent and shared them with government officials and a federal contractor before publication.</p><p> 根据FBI特工在Winner案中未开封的誓章，Intercept记者试图核实她发送的文件并在发布前与政府官员和联邦承包商共享，从而引发了调查。</p><p> Poitras, who also won an Academy Award for Snowden documentary “Citizenfour,” transitioned from the Intercept in 2016 to a sister organization within First Look, the Field of Vision production studio. But she was frustrated to see how the matter unfolded — in part because of the Intercept’s carelessness.</p><p> Poitras还因斯诺登的纪录片“ Citizenfour”而获得了奥斯卡奖，他从2016年的Intercept转变为“视野”制作工作室First Look中的姐妹组织。但是她很沮丧地看到事情如何发展，部分原因是Intercept的粗心大意。</p><p>   The story of Winner’s arrest upstaged the story of the NSA documents, robbing it of the chance to make the impact it should have, Poitras says. Winner was also left with no time to strategize with a lawyer before her speedy apprehension, she noted. While Winner’s less-than-cautious handling of the material might have led the NSA to her eventually, Poitras said in an interview that that should not absolve the Intercept of responsibility to handle the information carefully.</p><p>   Poitras说，获胜者被捕的故事比NSA文件的故事要先进，使它失去了应有的影响力。她指出，在获胜者迅速被逮捕之前，她也没有时间与律师进行战略对接。尽管温纳对材料的谨慎处理可能最终导致了国家安全局，但Poitras在一次采访中表示，这不应免除拦截的责任，即要谨慎处理信息。 </p><p> The Winner indictment in 2017 was the first criminal charge filed in a leak investigation during the Trump administration. In 2018 she pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years and three months in federal prison. In December, a federal appeals court affirmed a lower-court ruling denying compassionate release for Winner, even though she had contracted covid-19.</p><p>2017年的获胜者起诉是特朗普政府期间进行泄漏调查的第一项刑事指控。她于2018年认罪，并被判处联邦监狱五年零三个月的监禁。去年12月，联邦上诉法院维持了较低法院的裁决，即使Winner感染了covid-19，也否认对Winner进行同情释放。</p><p> Poitras also objected to how First Look’s internal reviews were conducted, saying they suffered from too much input and oversight from Reed, whom she argues should have kept a distance because of her involvement in the initial story based on the document Winner is accused of leaking.</p><p> Poitras还反对进行First Look的内部审查，称这些审查受到Reed过多的投入和监督，她认为Reed应当保持一定距离，因为她参与了基于Winner被指控泄露的最初故事。</p><p>   Reed said that Poitras’s claim that there was no accountability at the Intercept is wrong, noting that “there were two separate reviews, which were comprehensive and conducted by lawyers with a duty to remain independent and impartial. They both concluded that the errors we made in our handling of the story reflected institutional weaknesses, for which I took responsibility as the editor in chief.”</p><p>   里德（Reed）表示，普瓦特拉（Poitras）的说法是在侦听机不承担任何责任，这是错误的，并指出“有两次单独的审查，是由律师进行的全面审查，有责任保持独立和公正。他们俩都得出结论，我们在处理故事时所犯的错误反映了体制上的弱点，我作为总编辑负责。</p><p> No one involved with the story has been fired or demoted, though the Intercept said it instituted some new newsroom policies. The Intercept has covered Winner’s trial and imprisonment extensively, and First Look covered some of her legal fees.</p><p> 尽管Intercept表示它制定了一些新的新闻编辑室政策，但没有人被解雇或被降职。侦听已广泛涵盖了Winner的审判和监禁，而First Look承担了她的一些法律费用。</p><p>  In September, Poitras shared some of her frustrations with the New York Times, which published  a lengthy story on the Intercept’s handling of the Winner matter. She told the Times that First Look engaged in “a cover-up and betrayal of core values,” and that the lack of accountability for the mistakes inside the organization “promoted a culture of impunity and puts future sources at risk.”</p><p>  九月，普瓦特拉（Poitras）与《纽约时报》分享了她的一些挫败感，《纽约时报》发表了一篇很长的故事，讲述了Intercept对Winner案件的处理。她告诉《泰晤士报》，First Look从事“掩盖和背叛核心价值观”的工作，而对组织内部错误的追究责任不足“助长了有罪不罚的文化，并使未来的来源面临风险。”</p><p>   In a letter published Thursday on the website of her production company, Praxis Films, Poitras revealed for the first time that she was no longer with First Look and the circumstances that led to her departure.</p><p>   在周四在其制作公司Praxis Films的网站上发布的一封信中，Poitras首次表明她已不再拥有First Look以及导致她离开的情况。</p><p> “I was told my firing was effective immediately and without cause, my access to email was shut down, and that the company had no plans to communicate my abrupt termination to the public,” Poitras wrote in her letter.</p><p> “我被告知开除立即生效，没有任何理由，我的电子邮件访问被关闭，而且该公司没有计划将我突然终止的举动向公众传达，” Poitras在信中写道。 </p><p> She also elaborated on her concerns about the Intercept’s internal investigation, alleging that “the so-called ‘independent’ review” was done by the same lawyer who worked on the Winner story. David Bralow, the newsroom lawyer who said he conducted the second review, told The Washington Post that he joined the company after the Winner story was published and had nothing to do with its reporting or editing.</p><p>她还阐述了自己对Intercept内部调查的担忧，声称“所谓的“独立”审查”是由负责Winner故事的同一位律师完成的。新闻编辑室律师戴维•布拉洛（David Bralow）说，他进行了第二次审查。他对《华盛顿邮报》说，他在获胜者的故事发表后就加入了该公司，与其报道或编辑无关。</p><p>   “CEO Michael Bloom and Editor-in-Chief Betsy Reed have demonstrated repeatedly that they consider the whistleblowers and journalists who risk their lives on behalf of the organization as disposable. They demonstrated this by their lack of effort to protect Reality Winner,” Poitras wrote.</p><p>   “首席执行官迈克尔·布卢姆（Michael Bloom）和总编辑贝茜·里德（Betsy Reed）反复证明，他们认为代表该组织冒着生命危险的举报者和新闻记者是一次性的。他们通过缺乏保护“现实赢家”的努力证明了这一点。” Poitras写道。</p><p> She also complained about a decision by Bloom and Reed to cut funding for an archive of Snowden’s NSA documents at the Intercept.</p><p> 她还抱怨布卢姆和里德（Blood and Reed）决定在Intercept削减对斯诺登（Snowden）国家安全局文件存档的资金。</p><p> Snowden tweeted in support of Poitras late Thursday, praising the care she took in protecting his identity when she initially worked on his disclosures and noting that “a single mistake could have sent everyone involved to prison—or worse.”</p><p> 斯诺登（Snowden）周四晚在推特上发表推文，表示支持Poitras，称赞她最初从事披露工作时为保护自己的身份而采取的谨慎态度，并指出“一个错误可能会使所有涉案者入狱，甚至更糟。”</p><p> 8 p.m. This story has been updated with further comments from First Look and Poitras about her work at the company before she left and with a comment from Edward Snowden.</p><p> 晚上8点此故事已更新，其中包括First Look和Poitras对她离开之前在公司工作的进一步评论以及Edward Snowden的评论。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/laura-poitras-fired-intercept-first-look-reality-winner/2021/01/14/478a9c30-55e7-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/poitras/">#poitras</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
