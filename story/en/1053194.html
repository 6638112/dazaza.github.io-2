Funded and planned by the philosopher  Francis Bacon, the performance of what came to be called the Masque of Flowers was an elaborate wedding present for two young nobles. But it was also a dramatization of a new habit that had already begun to change the world. On that wintry wedding day in 1614, Francis Bacon’s guest of honor was a gigantic dancing tobacco pipe.</p><p>在1614年1月6日，在英格兰南部的寒冷园里举行了“光荣和奇怪的美丽”的舞蹈。由哲学家弗朗西斯培根资助和计划，表现出来的鲜花面膜是一个精心制作的婚礼礼物为两个年轻贵族。但这也是一种已经开始改变世界的新习惯的戏剧化。在寒冷的婚礼当天在1614年，Francis Bacon的荣誉客人是巨大的跳舞烟斗。</p><p> Before the pipe could take the stage, the audience was confronted with its dramatic rival in a battle of the vices: Silenus, the Roman god of wine. The actor playing the deity,  described in the masque’s printed stage directions as “an old fat man…mounted upon an artificial ass,” was accompanied by a sergeant at arms carrying a bronze mace engraved with grapes. Given that the performance was part of a lavish wedding during a century when daytime drinking was a nearly universal practice, it’s safe to assume that many members of the audience were devotees of the venerable drunken god at that very moment.</p><p> 在管道可以采取舞台之前，观众面临着在恶魔之战中的戏剧性竞争对手面临着戏剧性的竞争对手：罗马葡萄酒之神的阴影。演员扮演神的印刷舞台方向描述为“一名老胖子...安装在人为屁股”中，伴随着携带葡萄刻的青铜钉的军士。鉴于该表现是一世纪白天饮酒的奢侈婚礼的一部分，当白天饮酒是几乎普遍的做法，安全认为，在那一刻，观众的许多成员都是尊敬的醉酒的上帝的奉献者。</p><p> Next came a more youthful and controversial drug, however—one that Bacon’s patron, King James I of England, had  bitterly attacked as a source of bad breath, smallpox, traitorous thoughts, and demonic influence just a decade earlier.</p><p> 接下来是一个更年轻和争议的药物，然而 - 培根的顾客，英格兰国王詹姆斯的守护者，遭到痛苦地袭击了呼吸不良，天花，叛徒的思想和日之前的恶魔影响。</p><p> Seemingly oblivious to the monarch’s criticisms, the masque’s tobacco-pipe god, Kawasha, appeared onstage (the name was likely a reference to an actual deity of the Algonquian peoples of Virginia that an early English colonist, John White,  called “the idol Kiwasa”). His head was topped with a reddish-gold chimney-shaped cap, and his body was  garlanded with “tobacco-color stuff cut like tobacco leaves.” He promptly joined in a dance battle with the followers of Silenus, roaring that he would make them “all snuffing, puffing, smoke, and fire.” Kawasha’s attendant pranced around him, holding aloft “a great tobacco pipe” the size of a harquebus rifle.</p><p> 似乎对君主的批评感到沮丧，马赛克的烟草管神，卡瓦沙出现在舞台上（这个名字很可能是弗吉尼亚州阿尔诺克人民的实际神灵，即早期的英国殖民主义，John White，称为“偶像kiwasa” ）。他的头顶上有一个红金烟囱形状的帽子，他的身体是用“烟草叶子的烟草颜色的烟草叶子。”他及时加入了一个舞蹈战斗，与粉丝的粉丝，咆哮，他会让他们成为他们“所有的鼻子，喘气，烟和火”。川山的伴侣在他身边腾存，举起altoft“巨大的烟斗”山里枪的大小。</p><p> That’s a pretty big pipe, we can imagine some of the more intoxicated members of the audience thinking.</p><p> 这是一个非常大的管道，我们可以想象一些受众思想的一些陶醉的成员。</p><p> It was an intentionally over-the-top display, part of Bacon’s somewhat manic lifestyle at the time. Weeks earlier, to celebrate his lucrative new post as attorney general of England, Bacon had treated “the whole university of Cambridge” to a Christmas feast of venison, reported one contemporary.</p><p> 它是一个故意过顶展示，培根当时有点躁狂生活方式。早些时候几周，为了庆祝他作为英格兰律师公司的利润丰厚的新帖子，培根已经将“剑桥整个大学”对待鹿肉的圣诞节，报告了一个当代。</p><p>  The 1610s were a key decade in tobacco’s transformation into a new global obsession. Before long, the gift (or curse) of smoking had given rise to one of the world’s most lucrative industries, emerged as a key driver of the Atlantic slave trade, and initiated a global bad habit that humanity still hasn’t kicked more than four hundred years later.</p><p>  1610年代是烟草转变为新的全球痴迷的关键十年。在长期以来之前，吸烟的礼物（或诅咒）引起了世界上最有利可图的产业之一，作为大西洋奴隶贸易的关键驾驶员，并发起了一种全球性的坏习惯，以至于人类仍未踢出超过四个百年后。 </p><p> But smoking was about more than just tobacco pipes in the early modern period; the enormous pipe god of Bacon’s dance performance was part of a more complicated, and far stranger, panorama of smoking technologies and practices. The story of smoking in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is capacious enough to include the distillation apparatus of the alchemist, the water pipe of the cannabis smoker, and even medicinal smoke enemas.</p><p>但吸烟是早期现代时期的烟草管道;培根舞蹈表现的巨大管道是一个更复杂，陌生人，吸烟技术和实践的全景的一部分。第十六个和第十七世纪吸烟的故事足够宽敞，可以包括炼金术师的蒸馏装置，大麻吸烟者的水管，甚至是药用烟雾灌肠。</p><p> This diversity is not what we would expect from the standard history of smoking, which goes something like this.</p><p> 这种多样性并不是我们所期望的吸烟标准历史，这是这样的。</p><p> Before 1492 smoking was widespread among the tobacco-loving peoples of the Americas but unknown across the Atlantic. Then  Christopher Columbus witnessed Taíno men in Cuba puffing on “certain herbs...by which they become benumbed and almost drunk” and, upon further investigation, learned that “they call this  tabaco” (this, at least, is what  Bartolomé de Las Casas claimed Columbus had recorded in his now-lost journal of his 1492 voyage). By the 1560s a growing number of Spanish authorities began advocating that Europeans take up the practice—particularly the Seville physician  Nicolás Monardes, who hailed smoking as a “miraculous” cure for over twenty diseases. And by century’s end tobacco was being grown domestically in areas stretching from Spain to Turkey to Gujarat. Meanwhile, tobacco plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil were emerging as hubs of the Atlantic slave trade. All were in the service of an enormous growth in consumer demand for tobacco that stretched beyond Europe and into Asia and Africa.</p><p> 在1492年之前，吸烟在美洲的烟草爱情人民中普遍存在，但在大西洋上未知。然后，克里斯托弗·哥伦布目睹了古巴的Taíno男人们在“某些草药......他们变得僵住，几乎喝醉了”，并且在进一步调查时，学到了“他们称之为塔巴卡”（这至少是Bartolomédelas卡萨斯声称哥伦布已经在他现在丢失的1492年期刊上录得录得。在1560年代，越来越多的西班牙当局开始倡导欧洲人占据培训 - 特别是塞维利亚医师尼古拉斯蒙德，他被摧毁了20多个疾病的“神奇”治愈。到世纪末端的烟草在国内被从西班牙延伸到土耳其到古吉拉特邦的地区。与此同时，加勒比地区和巴西的烟草种植园被涌现为大西洋奴隶贸易的集线器。所有人都在为消费者需求的巨大增长服务，以超越欧洲和亚洲和非洲的烟草。</p><p> The English followed the Spanish example, led by the polymath Thomas Harriot, author of  A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1588). Harriott, echoing Monardes’ almost monomaniacal devotion to the drug, praised tobacco for its purported ability to open “all the pores and passages of the body” and cure “many grievous diseases.” Within a few decades, even James I was unable to suppress the drug; his passionate  Counterblaste to Tobacco (1604) is remembered as one of history’s most abject drug-policy failures. A decade later, tobacco had become both abundant and cheap throughout Europe, while Harriot lay dying of a painful cancer of the nose that was probably linked to his continued addiction to what James had presciently called a “canker or venime,” or venom.</p><p> 英语遵循西班牙语的例子，由Polymath Thomas Harriot领导，弗吉尼亚州新发现土地的简短和真实报告的作者（1588年）。 Harriott，呼应了天体公园几乎是对药物的单一形式致力，称赞烟草，旨在开放“身体的所有毛孔和通道”并治愈“许多严重疾病”。几十年来，甚至詹姆斯我无法抑制药物;他对烟草（1604年）的热情反击被认为是历史上最卑微的药物政策失败之一。十年后，烟草在整个欧洲都变得丰富而便宜，而哈里奥特·哈里奥斯的鼻子袭击患有痛苦的癌症，可能与他持续的成瘾有关的詹姆斯的詹姆斯叫出了“溃疡或Venime”或毒液。</p><p>  By the 1650s the tobacco pipe was perhaps the most widespread emblem of globalization and European empire. Smoking had gone global.</p><p>  在1650年代，烟草管道也许是全球化和欧洲帝国最广泛的徽标。吸烟走了全球。</p><p> Versions of this account of the globalization of smoking have been told countless times. Broadly speaking, they’re true. But they can also be misleading.</p><p> 这个帐户的全球化的账户的版本已被告知无数次。大致说话，他们是真的。但它们也可能误导。</p><p> Tobacco is indeed native to the Americas, and early modern Europeans, Africans, and Asians did encounter tobacco smoking as a new practice without precedent in ancient texts or preexisting social conventions. But, as archaeologists and anthropologists have been documenting for decades, tobacco was not the only drug that the peoples of the Old World smoked—even before the voyages of Columbus.</p><p> 烟草确实是美洲原产，早期的现代欧洲人，非洲人和亚洲人确实在古代文本或预先出现的社会公约中遇到了没有先例的新练习的烟草吸烟。但是，由于考古学家和人类学家一直在记录数十年，烟草不是唯一一个旧世界的人民吸烟 - 甚至在哥伦布航行之前。 </p><p> While tobacco was becoming a global drug, cannabis was, too—just in a stealthier and far less heralded fashion.  Archaeological evidence points to cannabis smoking in Central and South Asia since at least 1000  , probably linked to the migrations of proto-Indo-Iranian peoples. One apparent offshoot of this ancient practice attracted the notice of the Greek historian  Herodotus, who  wrote that Scythian nomads inhaled cannabis smoke inside their woolen tents: “The Scythians then take the seed of this hemp [ kannabis] and, crawling in under the mats, throw it on the red-hot stones, where it smolders and sends forth such fumes that no Greek vapor bath could surpass it. The Scythians howl in their joy at the vapor bath.” By circa 800 cannabis use had also crossed the Indian Ocean and become part of daily life in parts of sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>虽然烟草正在成为一个全球药物，但大麻也是 - 只是在一个隐秘的悄悄和更少的丑角的时尚。由于至少1000人，考古证据表明大麻在中南部和南亚吸烟，可能与Propo-Indo-eranian人民的迁移有关。这一古老实践的一个明显的分支吸引了希腊历史学家Herodotus的通知，他们在他们的羊毛帐篷内吸入大麻烟雾：“斯文尼斯然后服用这个大麻[kannabis]的种子，爬在垫子下面，把它扔到炽热的石头上，它闻到了它令人闷烧的并且发出这种烟雾，没有希腊蒸汽浴可能超越它。斯派蒂士嚎叫在蒸汽浴中的喜悦。“大约800万大麻使用也越过印度洋，成为撒哈拉以南非洲的一部分日常生活的一部分。</p><p> As European slave traders and merchants reached the cannabis-smoking regions of both South Asia and East and west central Africa, the phenomenon of “intoxicating” cannabis again attracted notice. The Portuguese Jewish physician Garcia da Orta, living in 1550s India,  admitted that cannabis could be “pleasantly intoxicating” but also saw it as a source of “nausea” and “melancholy.” By the seventeenth centuries, however, some European merchants in the Indian Ocean region had become users of the drug themselves, and at least one  brought back samples of the drug to Europe with an eye toward growing the plant locally as a new cash crop, following the model of tobacco.</p><p> 随着欧洲奴隶贸易商和商家达到南亚和西部中非的大麻吸烟区，“醉酒”大麻再次吸引了通知。葡萄牙语犹太医师Garcia da Orta，居住在1550年代印度，承认大麻可能是“令人愉快的”，但也认为它是“恶心”和“忧郁”的来源。然而，到十七世纪，印度洋地区的一些欧洲商人已成为药物本身的用户，至少有一个将药物样品带回欧洲，随着新的现金作物，将植物生长为新的现金作物烟草模型。</p><p> In 1689 the natural philosopher  Robert Hooke gave a  firsthand report on the effects of Indian cannabis to the Royal Society of London: “The patient understands not, nor remembers anything that he sees, hears, or does in that ecstasy, but becomes, as it were, a mere natural, being unable to speak a word of sense; yet is he very merry, and laughs, and sings, and speaks words without any coherence.” Hooke described cannabis as being “chewed or swallowed” but specified the dose only ambiguously, as “about as much as may fill a common tobacco-pipe.” It is still not clear to what extent cannabis smoking, as opposed to edible or drinkable preparations, was practiced in Hooke’s time outside of the cannabis-smoking regions of South Asia and Africa.</p><p> 1689年，自然哲学家罗伯特胡克对印度大麻对伦敦皇家学会的影响进行了第一手报告：“患者不理解，也不会记得他所看到，听到或在这种狂喜中的任何东西，但变得如此只是自然，无法说出一个感觉;然而，他非常快乐，笑，唱歌，讲话，没有任何一致性的话。“胡克将大麻描述为“咀嚼或吞咽”，但仅含糊地将剂量指定，如“大约可能填充普通烟斗”。尚不清楚大麻吸烟的程度，而不是可食用或饮用的准备，在胡克斯的南亚和非洲抽烟地区之外的时间里练习。</p><p> Hooke also never specified if the anonymous “patient” of his report was, in fact, himself. But he did end his address on a decidedly upbeat note. “Here are diverse of the seeds,” Hooke said, presenting them to the Royal Society at their final weekly meeting before Christmas, “which I intend to try this spring, to see if the plant can be here produced.” If he succeeded in this labor, Hooke believed the drug could prove to be “of considerable use for lunatics.” He concluded: “There is no cause of fear, tho’ possibly there may be of laughter.”</p><p> 如果他的报告的匿名“患者”是他自己的匿名“患者”，也从未指定过。但他确实在绝思乐观的乐观上结束了他的地址。 “这里是种子多样化的，”胡克说，在圣诞节前的最后一次会面上展示了他们的皇家社会，“我打算尝试这个春天，看看工厂是否可以在这里制作。”如果他成功地在这个劳动中，胡克认为这种药物可能被证明是“对疯子的相当大。”他得出结论：“没有恐惧的原因，可能有笑声。”</p><p> In other words, if Bacon had been after historical truth rather than an impressive wedding present, he might have paid for another personified figure in the Masque of Flowers: a dancing cannabis plant.</p><p> 换句话说，如果培根在历史真理之后而不是令人印象深刻的婚礼礼物之后，他可能已经为鲜花面鲸的人提供了代理人：跳舞大麻植物。</p><p>  An important clue about the multiple pathways for the global triumph of smoking comes from a strange detail of historical etymology.</p><p>  关于烟熏全球胜利的多途径的重要条例来自历史词源的奇怪细节。</p><p> Whereas the word for “pipe” in virtually every other European language is a cognate of pipe, from the Latin  pipa, the Portuguese word for pipe is a striking outlier:  cachimbo. It derives from one of the Bantu languages of sub-Saharan Africa, perhaps entering Portuguese via the lingo of slave traders in the Zambezi river valley or Congo during the early seventeenth century. At first glance, this makes some sense. After all, the Portuguese were key players in the Atlantic slave trade, and Brazilian-grown tobacco soaked in molasses (the better to disguise the taste of cheap or stale leaf) was a major item of exchange in seventeenth-century Africa.</p><p> 虽然“管道”这个词几乎所有欧洲语言都是管道的同源，来自拉丁皮，管道的葡萄牙语词是一个引人注目的异常值：cachimbo。它源于撒哈拉以南非洲撒哈拉非洲的班拜语言之一，也许通过在十七世纪初的奴隶河谷或刚果的奴隶交易员的Lingo进入葡萄牙语。乍一看，这有一种感觉。毕竟，葡萄牙语是大西洋奴隶贸易的关键参与者，而巴西成长的烟草浸泡在糖蜜（伪装廉价或陈旧叶的味道更好）是十七世纪非洲的主要交换项目。 </p><p> Things get more complicated, however, when we dig into the actual meaning of the term that  cachimbo seems to derive from: the Kimbundu word  kixima, meaning “water well.” This suggests that the Portuguese word for pipe may have originally referred not to the “dry” pipes of tobacco smokers but to a water pipe (also known as a bong). As the geographer Chris S. Duvall noted in his recent book   The African Roots of Marijuana, both water pipes and dry pipes were used extensively to smoke cannabis throughout sub-Saharan Africa long before Columbus’ report of a “a certain herb…they call  tabaco” reached Europe.</p><p>然而，事情变得更加复杂，但是，当我们挖掘Cachimbo似乎派生的术语的实际含义：Kimbundu Word Kixima，意思是“水井”。这表明葡萄牙语管道可能最初是由烟草吸烟者的“干”管道，而是给水管（也称为邦）。随着地理学家克里斯S. Duvall在他最近的一书中注明了大麻的非洲根，水管和干管都在哥伦布的报告中广泛用于在整个撒哈拉以南的撒哈拉·阿拉伯队中使用大麻。他们称之为塔瓦戈“到达欧洲。</p><p>  Even the stuff called tobacco was known to contain far more than just powdered leaves in the early modern era. Throughout the seventeenth century, preparations labeled “tobacco” were often a complex mixture of perfumes and drugs, not just a single substance. The contents could range from alternative species of tobacco, such as the more potent  Nicotiana rustica, to complex preparations of everything from musk, rosewater, and bergamot to the toxic mineral orpiment. One of the most striking examples of a tobacco mixture comes from the Spanish Jesuit José de Acosta’s 1590  account of a “divine food” ( comida divina) prepared by Aztec priests as an offering to the gods. Acosta described it as the ashes of spiders, scorpions, and millipedes mixed with “a great deal of tobacco...and the ground-up seed that they call  oluluchqui [morning glory seed], which the Indians drink to see visions.”</p><p>  即使是叫做烟草的东西也是含有早期现代时代早期的粉状叶子的远远超过粉状叶子。在整个十七世纪，标记为“烟草”的准备工作通常是香水和药物的复杂混合物，而不仅仅是一种单一的物质。内容物可以从烟草的替代品种，例如更有效的尼古拉·鲁西卡，从麝香，玫瑰花和佛手柑到有毒的矿物质复杂的制剂。烟草混合物中最引人注目的例子之一来自西班牙耶稣耶稣会耶稣·乔塞斯·奥斯塔（Acosta）的1590次叙述了阿兹特克牧师制定的“神圣的食物”（Comida Divina）作为向众神的发言。 Acosta将其描述为蜘蛛，蝎子和千足动物的灰烬，与“大量烟草......以及他们称之为oluluchqui [晨荣籽]，印度人饮酒看愿景的蜘蛛。”</p><p>  And then there’s the smoke enemas—a practice that early modern Europeans in particular took up with a surprising degree of enthusiasm. The English physician Thomas Sydenham  explained in 1753 the general idea in his treatment plan for a fever accompanied by “violent gripings”:</p><p>  然后有烟醉灌肠 - 早期现代欧洲人的实践特别是令人惊讶的热情。英国医师托马斯Sydenham在1753年解释了他的治疗计划中的一般想法，伴随着“暴力夹具”：</p><p> Here, therefore, I conceive it most proper to bleed first in the arm, and an hour or two afterwards to throw up a strong purging glyster [enema]; and I know of none so strong and effectual as the smoke of tobacco, forced up through a large bladder into the bowels by an inverted pipe.</p><p> 因此，我认为最适合在臂中首先出血，然后一个小时或两个小时伸出一个强大的吹扫糖精（灌肠）;而且我知道没有如此强大和有效的烟草的烟雾，通过倒管迫使通过一个大膀胱进入肠子。</p><p> The practice of performing smoke enemas to revive unconscious patients in emergencies was later championed by the prominent eighteenth-century British physician Richard Mead, who  wrote that, when trying to resuscitate a drowning victim, “the first step should be to blow up the smoke of tobacco into the intestines.”</p><p> 在紧急情况下恢复无意识患者进行冒险灌肠的做法后来被突出的十八世纪的英国医师理查德米德所支持的，他们写道，当试图复苏溺水的受害者时，“第一步应该是炸毁烟雾烟草进入肠道。“</p><p>  By the 1780s, the practice was so widespread that a charitable foundation, the Royal Humane Society, installed a series of  emergency tobacco-enema kits along the banks of the River Thames.</p><p>  在1780年代，这一实践如此普遍普遍认为，慈善基金会，皇家人道社会，沿着泰晤士河河岸安装了一系列紧急烟草套件。</p><p>  As the powers of smoke spread around the world from multiple geographic points of origin, debuting in multiple drugs with an assortment of goals, early modern alchemists took note. They were specifically curious about the potential of fire as a mode of elemental transformation, especially in the human body.</p><p>  随着来自多种地理位置的烟雾的力量，从多种地理位点传播，在多种药物中首次亮相，具有各种各样的目标，早期的现代化炼金术酵母就是注意到了。它们对火的潜力特别好奇，作为元素转化的模式，特别是在人体中。 </p><p> The key concept underlying the powers of smoke was the idea that the human body was porous, shaped not just by the liquids, food, or drugs that we consume but also by the astral forces of stars and planets, the invisible influences of “animal magnetism,” and the airs, vapors, and “humors” of the ambient environment. Medicinal smoke played an essential role in purifying the body of these influences.</p><p>烟雾权力的关键概念是人体多孔的想法，不仅仅是我们消耗的液体，食物或药物，也是由星星和行星的星系，“动物磁性的无形的影响“和空中，蒸气和”幽默“的环境环境。药物烟雾在净化这些影响的身体方面发挥了重要作用。</p><p> Even James I made reference to this commonplace belief in his  Counterblaste to Tobacco. Tobacco, he admitted, had a power of “suffumigation” that made it an “antidote” (albeit an “unsavory” one) for the treatment of smallpox. As James put it, it was “a sure aphorism” of physicians “that the brains of all men, being naturally cold and wet, all dry and hot things should be good for them; of which nature this stinking suffumigation is.”</p><p> 甚至詹姆斯甚至我就他对烟草的反击者提出了这种普遍的信念。他承认的烟草有一个“小组队”的力量，使其成为“解毒剂”（尽管是“令人讨厌的”一）用于治疗天花。正如詹姆斯把它所说，这是医生的“一个肯定的动力”“那个男人的大脑，自然寒冷湿润，所有干燥和热的东西都应该适合他们;哪个性质这种臭名的小组会是。“</p><p>  The concept of smoke as a medicinal purging of cold and wet humors within the head—a presumed source of all manner of ailments—soon made its way into a popular series of prints that depicted a young man’s foolish thoughts being quite literally “smoked out.”</p><p>  烟雾的概念作为寒冷和湿幽默的药用吹扫的头部 - 一系列疾病的推定来源 - 很快就进入了一个流行的一系列印刷品，描绘了一个年轻人的愚蠢思想，却是完全“熏化的沉思。 “</p><p>  Not long before the Covid-19 pandemic, I visited an archaeological lab at the University of California, Santa Cruz, that specialized in fragments of material culture from the Kingdom of Dahomey, in present-day Benin. Among the artifacts were drawers upon drawers of tobacco pipes: tiny shards of clay as white as bone, many still caked with the reddish dust of the earth they’d long been buried in.</p><p>  在Covid-19大流行前不久，我访问了加州大学圣克鲁斯大学的考古实验室，专门从事Dahomey王国的物质文化碎片，在当今贝宁。在烟草管的抽屉里有抽屉的抽屉：粘土的小碎片作为白色作为骨骼，许多仍然用他们长期被埋没的地球的红尘。</p><p> Smoking had an enormous range of forms and practices in the early modern period, but by the eighteenth century it had come to center on the disposable style represented by these white clay pipes and the low-quality powdered tobacco they once contained. By the time that cigarettes came to the fore in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, smoking had lost much of the complexity that marked its first phase of globalization. Cannabis smoking persisted, of course, but in an underground capacity, with cannabis tinctures, and not smoke, taking pride of place in medical accounts until recently.</p><p> 早期现代时期吸烟具有巨大的形式和实践，但在十八世纪，它已经在这些白色粘土管道代表的一次性风格和它们曾经包含的低质量粉末烟草上的中心。当香烟在第十九和二十世纪末所在的时候，吸烟失去了大部分复杂性，标志着其第一阶段全球化。当然，大麻吸烟仍然存在，但在地下容量，大麻酊剂，而不是吸烟，在医疗账户中骄傲地在最近。</p><p> Tobacco smoking has now begun to  decline in many countries around the world.
