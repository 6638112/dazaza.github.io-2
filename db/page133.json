", "note_en": "For a long time, it has been customary for tutorials to be a part of the First Time User Experience (FTUE). Usually, this meant that the journey would start from installing the game, followed by a rundown of the UI, adjusting preliminary settings, and being thrown into a tutorial. For newer games, logging into platforms and collecting player permission was adjusted somewhere in that flow.\n As games get longer and longer and   accommodate increasingly more complex mechanics with increasing hours of game time, it has become evident that teaching everything at the start and calling it a day is no longer sufficient as a tutorial. The concept of \u201ctaught when required\u201d has made sure that multiple tutorial sections are present in a game\u2019s journey from start to finish. Tutorials have long been divorced from the FTUE and their positioning and their appearances are now a close function of the pacing of the rest of the game.\n While allowing to skip tutorials is a minimum requirement in today\u2019s world, skipping a tutorial due to frustration may lead to a bad experience for the rest of the game. So let\u2019s define a good, frustration-free tutorial and look at a few key decisions that will define exactly how much your players will want to skip the tutorial and what you can do about it.\n   The \u201cgoodness\u201d of anything is an extremely subjective opinion. It matters on the situation, the actors, the stakeholders, the context, and a lot of other details. This means that even for a tutorial, goodness will be dependent on the game, genre, expectations created by marketing, and most importantly \u2014 the needs of the player. Respecting the pacing of the rest of the game will mean the tutorial will also depend on when exactly it is taking place in the timeline of the game experience, what mechanic is being introduced in the tutorial, what state of mind the player is in, and the designer\u2019s expectations of the outcome. The following list of questions may be heard in a discussion about tutorials (this is, by no means, exhaustive)\n Did the players understand the relation of this new thing with the old things they already know?\n All these questions hope to surface the outcome of any tutorial section which can be gauged in two parameters \u2014  knowledge/skill gained (did the player learn what was expected) and  negative emotions (how many negative emotions did the tutorial cause)\n  It is important to differentiate between knowledge and skill as there will be different ways to evaluate both. Knowledge is simply a piece of information that the wielder can utilise in any way whatsoever, which introduces a modicum of subjectivity to evaluation. For example, the fact that different pieces in chess have different behaviour is a piece of knowledge with which a player can come up with near-infinite plans of action to win. There is no way to evaluate whether a piece of knowledge was grasped the way the designer intended, since the outcome may not always reflect what was learnt. A player can use the piece of knowledge in any way, or can even lose despite knowing all facets of the information if the opposing player devises a better plan using the same knowledge. It is also quite possible for one to win with no knowledge whatsoever, where luck or a fluke can play a part. Skill, on the other hand, has much to do with practice and dexterity. The ability to kick a ball may be simple but to hit a pinpoint target takes immense practice, and the outcome is objectively measured no matter the situation. The player may kick the ball during practice, in a heated match, vs a good or bad opposing player, but skill will dictate that the outcome is always the same.\n Both knowledge and skill, can be gained at the end of learning or practice sessions.\n  Years of game design research have told us that negative emotions such as frustration, anxiety, or boredom arise from a mismatch of experiences and expectations that arise due to problems with the pacing. With the mere mention of pacing and video games, everyone must reliably refer to the flow theory (refer to  paper by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and  work by Jenova  Chen). While every designer is expected by now to be familiar with these pieces of literature, an important take-away is that introducing new things to a game depends on what phase the game is in and what is the trade-off between the different ways of crafting its tutorial that will affect the state of flow.\n   Having defined that the negative emotions caused by a tutorial are due to pulling players out of the flow zone, goodness is a simple understanding of how much deviation from the flow zone a player had to go to learn knowledge or gain a skills.\n  No tutorial exists in a vacuum. There will always be preceding and succeeding experiences (which may or may not be more tutorials). Even if the first tutorial is the first experience with the game, the player\u2019s expectations from the game will always precede it as an experience. It is not as simple as to say that the tutorial must fit within the flow zone, since there are multiple interdependent factors for that. For example, the tutorial to teach how to pilot a multi-part, complex submarine at the early beginner level may cause tremendous anxiety, whereas stopping a heated encounter to remind players how to reload will be very annoying. It is a very complex relationship of player emotions and expectations that will affect their own flow zone and how tutorials (or any section of the game) will be perceived.\n What designers call an \u201cinvisible tutorial\u201d is simply a tutorial section that fits perfectly in the flow zone, which values the preceding and succeeding events and respects player expectations. There will never be a situation where a player does not realise they are not participants of a tutorial, but an invisible tutorial will hardly be discernible from the game experience as it respects the pacing of all experiences around it.\n   To introduce to the new game mechanic and its underlying or supporting systems (impart Knowledge)\n To teach the actions that are important to this new mechanic and how they fit in the system supported by the mechanic (allow to build Skill)\n To explain how the new mechanic and its systems fit with the already introduced mechanics and the overarching systems (impart Knowledge)\n To create expectations of how players will be influenced or can influence the game using these new actions and the mechanic (impart Knowledge and show what high Skill can look like)\n The role of a tutorial is to carry out these four functions every time is appears, whether for a single, multiple, or a complex system of mechanics.\n Based on these roles, let\u2019s look at a few decisions that a designer will run in to and what trade-offs could occur.\n   Intuition really just means familiarity. Players don\u2019t need to be taught what they are familiar with, they simply need to be told of its existence. If the concept is similar to something that is already in the player\u2019s mind, the fastest way to teach them is to help bridge that gap by creating associations. And if it exactly like something that is experienced commonly, there is no need to teach it at all.\n Taking an example, who needed to be taught how to select and control their units in Anno 1800? For almost all isometric strategy games, whether RTS, sim, 4x4, or even MOBAs, the standard interaction is to select units with left click or drag and move them by right-clicking on the designated spot.\n  More notable examples include \u201cUse WASD to move\u201d, or \u201cPress LT to aim and RT to shoot\u201d which are standards of the medium as a whole.\n Making an intuitive tutorial is more about utilising familiar concepts and less about hoping that the players are inquisitive. This familiarity may stem from what players are playing besides your game, or even from what they have been doing inside your game for a long time.\n For example, the first few moments in Hollow Knight teach a player how to attack. There is no more than a single prompt that tell players what action allows them to attack, after which it is never repeated. This stems from the familiarity of the 2D platforming genre where usually one type of attack corresponds to one type of input.  Immediately after receiving this knowledge, the level is densely packed with situations to enforce this knowledge. After defining it as a medium of interaction once, it\u2019s never reminded again since it\u2019s the only way the player knows how to interact with things in that world.\n  The ability to test out the new knowledge is so densely packed in the first few minutes of Hollow Knight, that by the time the player finishes the tutorial section this action is the only way they know of that allows them to interact with anything. Simply striking things with the Knight\u2019s nail is so prevalent that it is not even questioned when it\u2019s being used in completely different mechanics, most of which are not even explicitly taught but simply discovered.\n  It may be normal to attribute their discovery to inquisitiveness, as these mechanics are never taught in any manner, but there is no denying that it really stems from familiarity of wanting to hit things with the nail that the game has established by the end of it\u2019s first tutorial section.\n  As mentioned, intuitiveness stems from familiarity. Depending on the players\u2019 intuitiveness is the safest bet when the game\u2019s mechanics are similar to what\u2019s in other games (especially what the target player base is playing) since it doesn\u2019t have to be taught. For teaching mechanics that are novel and unique to the game, it would depend a lot on how much of the previous stuff the player has learned can be reused. If a new piece of knowledge can be related to something the player has already seen before, the association will help greatly with the learning process. It would also be safe to assume that the players can use it from the get-go, allowing to quickly take on more appropriately leveled challenges after (or even during) the tutorial which would help accelerate the player into the flow state.\n On the other hand, if the mechanic is novel or the player is not expected to be familiar with it, relying on their intuitiveness would not be advisable.\n   It\u2019s often advised to be subtle with indications lest the players be annoyed. But through the complex emotions a player goes through, information must pass clearly if it has to be grasped. Considering how well crafted emotional experiences in games are, there is no doubt that players are experiencing strong emotions that reduce their ability to grasp knowledge. Experiences may cause fear, anxiety, stress, anger \u2014 all which are strong emotions that inhibit the ability to process information clearly.\n Let\u2019s take the example of the start in Dead Space 1. Throughout the tutorial section, the player is notified again and again to cut the limbs of the enemies to disable them. It\u2019s even frequently mentioned that shooting them does nothing and only cutting off their limbs is effective. This information is repeated again and again through text, audio, game world cues, and having it yelled at you.\n  The game is relentless with the information, not leaving anything to subtlety or discovery. It is often compared to the Ravenholm section in Half Life 2 (mainly because of this  amazing GMTK video). While the video makes an amazing case for Half Life 2\u2019s tutorial and dispels Dead Space 1&#39;s as annoying, it is imperative to analyse the preceding events that have already influenced player emotions.\n In Half Life 2, during the Ravenholm mission, there\u2019s a section where we are taught to use the gravity gun and the saws to dismember zombies. While the tutorial itself follows the simple rule imparting knowledge and immediately setting up a sandbox to try it, it does it in a subtle way. The knowledge is a part of the world design, that tells a story and stokes player\u2019s imaginations.\n  While this is indeed an amazing way to give away the information, neither this enemy for the mechanic are truly unique. The player has fought quite a few zombies so far (and are used to them) and have used the physics based propulsion of the gravity gun quite a few times. The game is thoroughly relying on the fact that it is very intuitive to simply pick up and throw things since that is something which has been taught in depth. The entry into this location is rather calm, albeit with suspense, which means players are more receptive to information than a heightened state.\n Now comparing this to Dead Space, everything is new. There is no preceding interaction where the player has used anything that they will be. The weapon and the enemy are brand new. Not only that, it is also missing the calmness of Ravenholm\u2019s barn. The introduction is hoping to achieve pure dread and thrill, which is emphasised by scripted events and a really strong atmosphere. All this causes strong emotions, which makes a player less receptive to information. By understanding the preceding events, Dead Space\u2019s tutorial section makes sure that the information is delivered to the player without any hesitation. It can be also highlighted further by the fact that learning this piece of information is Dead Space is far more critical than the piece of information taught in Half Life 2. Failing to grasp the knowledge in Half Life 2 would still allow a player to simply pull out their gun and proceed, whereas failing to grasp the knowledge in Dead Space would cause repetitive and annoying \u2018game over\u2019 situations. The importance of the information will dictate whether it needs to be subtle or in your face.\n It is quite possible to argue that Visceral Games devs, creators of Dead Space, could create a scenario that helps players discover this piece of information through world building and with subtlety which is a valid argument. But I also request the reader to get acquainted with the realities and tight schedules of game production cycles and how it affects the ability to iterate on a design.\n  It clearly depends on the emotional state that the player is experiencing, and how much their receptiveness to information is inhibited. This may not only come through strong negative emotions (such as fear, anxiety, stress) but also through strong positive emotions. Elation or relief that comes after overcoming a hard challenge is also an engaged state of mind which inhibits the receptiveness, so it should be considered as well.\n The decision outcome may come in two variants \u2014 information is shown when it is expected for a player to be receptive. This may be during a calmer period, or during an appropriate break in action. Such situations may arise and can be utilised or created by altering the pacing. The other variant may be that the information needs to be in a players face, constantly trying to grab their attention and appear more important than what\u2019s going on.\n  Once a player has learnt something, it is expected that they would like to try it out. Not only do they need to build up to the feel of the new mechanic, but also gain some level of mastery before being thrown into a challenge.  There are many ways to allow players a space and time to build up the skill, with merits for each method. For example, some games impart information and let players learn simply by taking on the challenge head on.\n  While Dark Souls sets up a scenario to test out this knowledge, Call of Duty throws the player into a high octane situation and simply uses basic prompts. This method works for both these games since the concepts being taught are ubiquitous to their respective genre and have been used in most games that their player base is playing otherwise.\n  The downside of using this approach is that the players may miss out the information altogether, or fail to use it as intended. It may be also possible to complete the challenge without using the knowledge at all, which may then fail to register in the player\u2019s mind. This is a very conscious decision as this type of tutorial is reserved for mechanics that are primitive to the medium and genre, and the fact will always remain that the players already know how to do these things before they even touch the game.\n On the other side, there are tutorials with explicit sandboxes that allows players to test all facets of the new mechanic they are being introduced to. These tutorials create a separate, safe space in the game world that allows players to try whatever they have learnt.\n  Another example of this approach is Saints Row 4, which instantly teleports the players into a safe space inside the game to try their new abilities.\n  The game does not hesitate to tell that this is a training session, and then proceeds to run the players through a gauntlet to make sure they understand all facets of the new mechanic. Even within the world of the game, they have a piece of fiction wrapped around this concept by explaining it as a \u201cvirtual training ground\u201d and having an exposition justifying its existence.\n  The need to practice a new mechanic depends on its novelty. If it\u2019s something common and the player need only build up the feel for it, the game can get away with letting them learn on the job. Dark Souls and Call of Duty don\u2019t have a designated tutorial as such, it\u2019s simply a collection of prompts followed by potential scenarios to experience the new knowledge in action. Doom Eternal and Saints Row on the other hand set up an explicit sandbox for due to the novelty of their mechanics. They require the player to understand the interactions, input, and outcome in a controlled environment before letting the players use these mechanics in a complex system with other mechanics.\n Whenever players are put into a sandbox as part of a tutorial, there is always an evaluation criteria that merits exit from the sandbox. This makes sure that the player does not miss out on the instruction or finer details, and granularity in the evaluation criteria allows players to understand what they are supposed to do with this mechanic. On the flip side with allowing to learn on the job, there is also careful consideration of the fact that the mechanics being introduced can be missed, and that is all right for the rest of experience. Without an evaluation criteria there is no gate to make sure that there is at least an objective understanding of the new mechanic.  When choosing to decide whether a tutorial needs an explicit sandbox, decide whether the mechanic needs an explicit and isolated evaluation criteria. Based on it\u2019s novelty and whether players can grasp it the way the designers intend may decide if the player needs to pulled out from the world into a place to practice it in.\n   While it is often suggested to not front load all the learning of a game into a single tutorial and to rather break it up and teach whenever required, but there are unique challenges associated with that. Not all games have the luxury of atomic mechanics that reside in silos, dependencies in knowledge makes it difficult to teach one thing at a time. This leads to no choice but to teach many things at once, which may or may not be closely related. This, in turn, increases the cognitive load which makes it harder to be receptive to knowledge or learning anything.\n Looking again at Anno 1800, the first hour of the campaign teaches the player about basics of production, supply chain, logistics, consumption, and population. While taking the players step by step from learning to produce goods and then distribute them, and how their population consumes these goods, the game also chooses to encourage players to think how to lay down their roads and city layouts. While the former is a hard requirement to learn, the latter is only a suggestion due to the fact that the knowledge changes for every island. Yet it is impossible for a player to learn how to produce and deliver goods without learning how to lay out their city and roads since these mechanics are deeply interwoven.

", "note_en": "During a congressional hearing last week, Republican Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas asked a U.S. Forest Service official if her organization or the Bureau of Land Management could change the orbit of the moon or Earth to reverse the effects of human-caused climate change. That seems like a perfectly reasonable idea, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s do it.\n  First, we must take stock of what we have\u2014the givens in what will be our equation for moving Earth. Our planet orbits the sun at an average distance of 149.6 million kilometers, and it soaks up enough sunlight to have an average temperature of about 15 degrees Celsius. The latter figure is, however, an increase of slightly more than one degree C from Earth\u2019s typical temperature across the past century. In short, this world is running a low-grade fever. According to current consensus estimates, that fever is likely to get much worse if left unchecked, raising Earth\u2019s average temperature by  another one degree C by the 2060s. Such an increase would render some presently people-packed parts of the planet effectively uninhabitable and threaten the sustainability of global civilization as we know it.\n  Radiative equilibrium, the balance between incoming energy from the sun\u2019s rays and energy emitted from Earth, is key to our understanding of our planet\u2019s changing temperature, says Britt Scharringhausen, a planetary astronomer at  Beloit College. It is described in the following equation, as scribbled out by Scharringhausen.\n    Here,  Teq\u00a0is Earth\u2019s temperature,  T \u2609 is the sun\u2019s temperature,  R \u2609 is the sun\u2019s radius,  X is the distance to the sun, and  A is Earth\u2019s albedo, or reflectivity.* Albedo measures how well our planet reflects solar energy, where 0 would be perfect absorption and 1 would be perfect reflection. There is a connection between climate change and albedo: snow and ice, for instance, have a high albedo, reflecting  up to 90 percent of the sunlight that hits them back to outer space. Anthropogenic warming causes snow and ice caps to melt, which can make Earth\u2019s albedo decrease. That, in  turn, eventually leads to  a higher average planetary temperature.\n  Some variables in this equation are changing naturally. Our star is very slowly swelling and brightening, becoming slightly larger and more luminous as it ages. Ethan Siegel, a theoretical astrophysicist and science writer, says that while it will take the sun on the order of 100 million years to increase in luminosity by 1 percent, our greenhouse-gas-emitting global civilization is projected to increase the solar energy retained by Earth by 1 percent over the next few hundred to 1,000 years.\n  To make Earth cooler, we need to decrease a variable on the right side of the equation: We can\u2019t easily lower the sun\u2019s temperature or radius\u2014and clearly meaningful reductions to our heat-trapping, albedo-shifting greenhouse gas emissions are out of the question. So let\u2019s take Representative Gohmert\u2019s advice and simply increase  X, the distance to the sun. All we have to do is find a way to move all 5.972 septillion kilograms of Earth\u2019s mass farther away from our star. Easy, right?\n  By Scharringhausen\u2019s calculations, a three-degree-C decrease in temperature to counteract current and near-future anthropogenic warming would require us to move our planet an additional three million kilometers from the sun. Using another back-of-the-envelope calculation, Scharringhausen finds that 5 x 10 31 joules could push all 5,972,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilograms of Earth\u2019s  mass three million kilometers out from its present orbit. These numbers present challenges for Representative Gohmert\u2019s plan\u00a0because annual global electricity production is around 10 19 joules,  or 0.0000000000002 percent of what we\u2019d need to move the globe. That\u2019s also assuming we can apply all that energy to Earth at 100 percent efficiency, which, thanks to the laws of thermodynamics, is physically impossible.\n  Setting aside such particulars, we haven\u2019t addressed what form this applied energy would take. There is the literal nuclear option: one method that scientists have proposed to move an asteroid is to detonate a nuclear bomb near it, Scharringhausen says. \u201cIt will basically vaporize part of the asteroid, and that escaping rock vapor acts like rocket exhaust and will push the asteroid along,\u201d she explains.\n  Scaled up, such a mechanism could, in principle, provide enough oomph to shift a planet\u2019s orbit. Still, it would take a billion times more nuclear explosions than we have ever set off to move Earth the required distance, or the equivalent of dropping an atomic bomb every second for 500 years, according to Geza Gyuk, director of astronomy at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. The strategy of constantly detonating nuclear bombs near Earth\u2019s surface with the goal of vaporizing parts of it to act as rocket exhaust also has several drawbacks. For our purposes, the most notable deleterious effect is that the blasts themselves would heat up the planet, counteracting the stated goal of reversing global warming.\n  A gentler option would be to siphon off the energy of other celestial objects, such as passing asteroids or comets, by engineering close planetary flybys. This technique is regularly used in reverse, with great success, by spacecraft that boost their speed by passing close to a planet to steal a portion of its orbital energy.  For moving our planet, the issue with the method is scale, Siegel says: the total mass of the asteroid belt is only  4 to 5 percent of that of the moon, or 0.05 to 0.06 percent of that of Earth. Using the mass of the entire asteroid belt in flybys would migrate Earth away from the sun by less than 748,000 kilometers, or a quarter of the distance we\u2019d need, he says. And a single off-course collision with our planet would spark destruction approaching that caused by the asteroid impact that eradicated the dinosaurs in a global mass extinction.\n  Fortunately, we have a much more massive space rock sitting in our backyard: the moon itself. Could we \u201ccut\u201d the gravitational string connecting the moon to the Earth, thereby slingshotting our planet into a wider orbit? Not in any way that we\u2019re capable of doing today, Siegel says, and the consequences would be disastrous. Besides having greatly reduced tides, a moonless Earth would have much darker nights, shorter days and extreme, unpredictable seasons because of a destabilized axis of rotation.\n  What if instead of getting rid of our natural satellite altogether, we only change its orbit around Earth? Increasing the radius of the moon\u2019s orbit by 10 percent would affect Earth\u2019s own trajectory around the sun in the long term, says Matteo Ceriotti, a rocket scientist at the University of Glasgow\u2019s James Watt School of Engineering.\n  We could extract and accelerate material off the moon, Ceriotti says. Using a 100-gigawatt laser, or one with about the power capacity of  every single wind turbine in the U.S., it would take 300 trillion years to lift sufficient amounts of material from the lunar surface. There is always the aforementioned nuclear option, too, which could be used to move the moon rather than Earth. Another, less messy choice would be to manually extract lunar material with conventional rockets.\n  \u201cIf we were able to build a spaceport on the moon and build a rocket equivalent to SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy to lift off moon material into deep space, we would need 7 x 10 16 launches,\u201d Ceriotti says. That\u2019s 70,000 trillion rocket launches. For comparison, during the entirety of the space age, humankind has only managed to achieve  70,780 launches, and more than half of them did not leave Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n  Humans could add a twist to the use of asteroids in the flyby idea and instead put them on a collision course with the moon, Gyuk says. We would need kilometer-sized comets to crash into the moon every second for a couple of hundred years to make a substantial difference. Again, though, an off-course projectile could cause a planetary mass extinction event.\n  Because of the magnitude of the change necessary to increase the Earth\u2019s orbit, any intervention would probably need to last for many millions of years at minimum, which raises an unexpected sociological issue, Gyuk says: We don\u2019t have precedent for planning across such vast timescales. And in fact, no civilization in human history has endured more than a mere few thousand years.\n  Finally, even if humans managed to alter our planet\u2019s orbit using any of these methods, they wouldn\u2019t be able to rest easy, Siegel says. \u201cIf we even somehow could make this enormous change in Earth\u2019s orbit,\u201d he says, \u201cit doesn\u2019t absolve us from the responsibility that we\u2019ll keep needing to make this change as long as we keep increasing the greenhouse gas concentration in our atmosphere.\u201d\n  To my ears, that sounds like a stirring endorsement of our fossil-fuel-addicted status quo! We should immediately prioritize pouring all our energy into changing Earth\u2019s orbit, starting now and lasting forever. Sure, it\u2019s a Sisyphean task in which humanity is Sisyphus and the boulder being eternally pushed uphill is Earth itself. But at least we\u2019d get to keep driving our sweet SUVs! I say we get to work.\n  *Editor\u2019s Note (7/18/21): This sentence was revised after posting to better align with the symbols given in the image.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 04:32:13",

", "note_en": "A urine test developed by researchers at the Nagoya University in Japan can pinpoint a person who has a brain tumor \u2014 regardless of its size or malignancy \u2014 with 100% accuracy, according to a new study.\n Decorated with 100 million zinc oxide nanowires, the test works by plucking tiny molecules called microRNAs from just a millimeter of urine in much greater quantities and varieties than traditional tests.\n It can be sterilized, produced on massive scales and completed by patients any time anywhere with \u201cminimal effort,\u201d according to the  study published recently in the journal ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces.\n  The test\u2019s non-invasive nature and easy handling could help to earlier detect and treat aggressive brain tumors, which go largely unnoticed until symptoms appear and have grown too large to be surgically removed, eventually improving brain cancer patient survival.\n \u201cUrine can be collected easily without putting a burden on the human body,\u201d study corresponding author Dr. Atsushi Natsume said in a  statement. \u201cUrine-based liquid biopsy hadn\u2019t been fully investigated for patients with brain tumors, because none of the conventional methodologies can extract microRNAs from urine efficiently in terms of varieties and quantities. So, we decided to develop a device capable of doing it.\u201d\n Past research has shown that microRNAs lodged in blood can be used for cancer screening, but studies on how these tiny revealing molecules from tumors in the brain fare in urine have been lacking. Part of the challenge lies in a stubborn  blood-brain barrier that strictly limits what\u2019s cruising in your bloodstream, such as potential toxins and disease-causing germs, from entering your brain.\n But the team\u2019s new test revealed microRNAs born in brain tumors can make their way to urine and exist \u201cin a stable condition,\u201d suggesting there are other ways besides expensive CT or MRI scans to detect brain cancer before it\u2019s too late.\n A total of 119 urine and tumor samples were collected from patients with central nervous system (CNS) cancers admitted to 14 hospitals in Japan between March 2017 and July 2020. Researchers used 100 urine samples from people without cancer to serve as a control for their test and a model they created based on the expression of microRNAs in pee.\n  The diagnostic pair was able to detect samples belonging to people with brain tumors with 100% sensitivity (its ability to identify those with cancer) and 97% specificity (its ability to identify those without cancer), regardless of the tumor\u2019s size or state.\n Cancer mortality rates over the last two decades have been on a steady decline, likely because of advances in early detection and treatment, but those for CNS tumors have not, the researchers said. \u201cThis is partly because hardly anyone will undergo regular medical checkups for CNS tumors until the tumors spread and neurological deficits are presented,\u201d such as speech problems or immobile limbs.\n \u201cIn the future, by a combination of artificial intelligence and telemedicine, people will be able to know the presence of cancer, whereas doctors will be able to know the status of cancer patients just with a small amount of their daily urine,\u201d Natsume said.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 04:31:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5c3f\u68c0,test,\u764c\u75c7", "title": "\u5c3f\u68c0\u53ef\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b100\uff05\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u8111\u80bf\u7624 ", "title_en": "Urine test can detect brain tumors with 100% accuracy", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/pee-could-tell-brain-tumor-180320855.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5c3f\u68c0", "test", "\u764c\u75c7"]}]
