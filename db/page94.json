But scientists recently discovered that some of the area\u2019s rusted rocks conceal traces of the lush rainforests that covered the area 15 million years ago during the Miocene Epoch.\n The area, McGraths Flat, is not Australia\u2019s only Miocene deposit, but these new fossils are a paleontological boon because of their exquisite preservation. Over the past three years paleontologists have excavated flowers, insects and even a bird\u2019s wispy feather.\n The scientists\u2019 discoveries,  published Friday in the journal Science Advances, help reconstruct Australia\u2019s Miocene rainforest in extensive detail, and the site \u201copens a whole new area of exploration for Australian paleontology,\u201d said Scott Hocknull, a paleontologist at Queensland Museum who was not involved in the research.\n Fifteen million years ago, a river carved through the jungle, leaving an oxbow lake (known as a billabong in Australia) in its wake at McGraths Flat. Nearly devoid of oxygen, this stagnant pool kept scavengers at bay, allowing plant material and animal carcasses to accumulate. As iron-rich runoff from nearby basalt mountains seeped into the billabong, the pool\u2019s low pH caused the iron to precipitate and encase the organic material. As a result, the fossils at McGraths Flat are preserved in a dense, iron-rich rock known as goethite.\n  This method of fossilization is uncommon, Dr. Hocknull said. Because quality fossils are rarely found in igneous rocks, paleontologists often overlook them. However, the fossils from McGraths Flat illustrate that goethite, which is common in Australia, can yield remarkable fossils.\n \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of goethite,\u201d Dr. Hocknull said. \u201cWe\u2019re essentially a rusting country.\u201d\n   Because of their iron-tinted origins, many of the fossils from McGraths Flat glimmer with a metallic sheen. In addition to pristine plants, the goethite is crawling with fossilized insects. As they split apart the brick-colored slabs of stone, the researchers have discovered a miniature menagerie of giant cicadas, dragonflies and parasitic wasps. And many are remarkably preserved \u2014 some ancient flies sport the detailed imprints of their compound eyes.\n The site has also yielded more than a dozen archaic arachnids. While insects have sturdy exoskeletons, Michael Frese, a virologist and paleontologist at the University of Canberra and a co-author of the study, likens spiders to \u201csquishy bags of liquid.\u201d As a result, Australia\u2019s fossil record of spiders was nearly nonexistent before McGraths Flat.\n  The fossils are so well preserved that the paleontologists were able to observe relationships between species \u2014 something that is often difficult to parse from fossil sites, according to Matthew McCurry, the curator of paleontology at The Australian Museum and the study\u2019s lead author. For example, the team observed parasites fastened to a fish\u2019s tail and a nematode that had infiltrated a longhorn beetle.\n Dr. Frese utilized an electron microscope and microphotography techniques to examine the rainforest\u2019s inhabitants. While imaging a fossilized sawfly, Dr. Frese discovered a clump of pollen on the bee-like insect\u2019s head.\n \u201cWe can tell which flower was visited by this particular sawfly before it fell into the water and met its untimely end,\u201d Dr. Frese said. \u201cThat would not be possible if the quality of preservation was not as high.\u201d\n   The pollen also revealed that the rainforest was surrounded by drier environments, making it likely that McGraths Flat represents a remnant patch of a once larger forest. According to Dr. McCurry, this makes sense considering the climatic trends of the Miocene.\n When these insects scurried around the iron-tainted billabong, Australia was drifting northward, away from Antarctica. As it traveled, its climate drastically dried out, causing the rainforests to retract and leading to widespread extinctions.\n  The researchers believe McGraths Flat offers an intimate glimpse of how this dramatic climate transition affected particular species within the rainforest ecosystem. For instance, some insects found at McGraths Flat endured drier conditions while others are now found only in northern Australia\u2019s remnant pockets of rainforest.\n \u201cStudying these fossil ecosystems, we can see which species were better able to adapt to those changes,\u201d Dr. McCurry said. \u201cWe can potentially predict which are most at risk in terms of future changes.\u201d\n Dr. Frese said that McGraths Flat was particularly useful for reconstructing ancient ecosystems because of the breadth of species it preserved.\n \u201cOur site is different because it\u2019s all small fossils, but in the end, I think it will tell us more about what has happened in the ecosystem,\u201d Dr. Frese said. \u201cYou do not need to find a one-ton terror bird to tell this story.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 05:43:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u96e8\u6797,prehistoric,\u53d8\u5316", "title": "\u53f2\u524d\u96e8\u6797\u7684\u5316\u77f3\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u751f\u9508\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u91cc\u85cf\u8d77\u6765", "title_en": "Fossils of a Prehistoric Rainforest Hide in Australia\u2019s Rusted Rocks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/07/science/fossils-australia-rainforest.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u96e8\u6797", "\u53d8\u5316"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7cf484ceeae6bc7fc2161eddc603cd15.jpg", "infoid": 1072563, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u8981\u5e26\u9886\u6280\u672f\u6821\u6b63\u7ebf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e0b\uff1a\n\u572890\u5e74\u4ee3\u56de\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u50cf\u5176\u4ed6\u6bcf\u4f4d\u5458\u5de5\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u6211\u7684\u684c\u5b50\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u58c1\u7684\u516c\u5171\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u3002\u6211\u5b89\u88c5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aweb\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548cpoof-instant\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\u5982\u4eca\uff0c\u4ece\u5bb6\u91cc\u8fd0\u884c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f51\u7ad9\u5c31\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u6ca1\u6709\u516c\u5171IP\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u65f6\u66f4\u6539\u3002\u5373\u4fbf\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u7684ISP\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u963b\u6b62\u60a8\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002\n\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u65c5\u884c\u5730\u7403\uff0c\u60a8\u7684IP\u5c06\u8ddf\u968f\u60a8\uff1a\u5728\u98de\u673a\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u9646\u5230\u5927\u9646\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4f55\u5904\u3002 yggdrasil\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u4f60\u3002", "note_en": "I\u2019m going to lead with the technical punch line, and then explain it:\n Yggdrasil Network is an opportunistic mesh that can be deployed privately or as part of a global-scale network. Each node gets a stable IPv6 address (or even an entire /64) that is derived from its public key and is bound to that node as long as the node wants it (of course, it can generate a new keypair anytime) and is valid wherever the node joins the mesh. All traffic is end-to-end encrypted.\n Yggdrasil will automatically discover peers on a LAN via broadcast beacons, and requires zero configuration to peer in such a way. It can also run as an overlay network atop the public Internet. Public peers serve as places to join the global network, and since it\u2019s a mesh, if one device on your LAN joins the global network, the others will automatically have visibility on it also, thanks to the mesh routing.\n It neatly solves a lot of problems of portability (my ssh sessions stay live as I move networks, for instance), VPN (incoming ports aren\u2019t required since local nodes can connect to a public peer via an outbound connection), security, and so forth.\n   Every device on the Internet, at one time, had its own globally-unique IP address. This number was its identifier to the world; with an IP address, you can connect to any machine anywhere. Even now, when you connect to a computer to download a webpage or send a message, under the hood, your computer is talking to the other one by IP address.\n Only, now it\u2019s hard to get one. The Internet protocol we all grew up with, version 4 (IPv4), didn\u2019t have enough addresses for the explosive growth we\u2019ve seen. Internet providers and IT departments had to use a trick called NAT (Network Address Translation) to give you a sort of fake IP address, so they could put hundreds or thousands of devices behind a single public one. That, plus the mobility of devices \u2014 changing IPs whenever they change locations \u2014 has meant that a fundamental rule of the old Internet is now broken:\n  Nowadays, you can\u2019t you host your own website from your phone. Or share files from your house. (Without, that is, the use of some third-party service that locks you down and acts as an intermediary.)\n Back in the 90s, I worked at a university, and I, like every other employee, had a PC on my desk with an unfirewalled public IP. I installed a webserver, and poof \u2013 instant website. Nowadays, running a website from home is just about impossible. You may not have a public IP, and if you do, it likely changes from time to time. And even then, your ISP probably blocks you from running servers on it.\n In short, you have to buy your way into the resources to participate on the Internet.\n I wrote about these problems in more detail in my article  Recovering Our Lost Free Will Online.\n  I already gave away the punch line at the top. But what does all that mean?\n  Every device that participates gets an IP address that is fully live on the Yggdrasil network.\n You can host a website, or a mail server, or whatever you like with your Yggdrasil IP.\n Encryption and authentication are smaller (though not nonexistent) worries thanks to the built-in end-to-end encryption.\n You can travel the globe, and your IP will follow you: onto a plane, from continent to continent, wherever. Yggdrasil will find you.\n  I\u2019ve set up /etc/hosts on my laptop to use the Yggdrasil IPs for other machines on my LAN. Now I can just \u201cssh foo\u201d and it will work \u2014 from home, from a coffee shop, from a 4G tether, wherever. Now, other tools like tinc can do this, obviously. And I could stop there; I could have a completely closed, private Yggdrasil network.\n Or, I can join the global Yggdrasil network. Each device, in addition to accepting peers it finds on the LAN, can also be configured to establish outbound peering connections or accept inbound ones over the Internet. Put a public peer or two in your configuration and you\u2019ve joined the global network. Most people will probably want to do that on every device (because why not?), but you could also do that from just one device on your LAN. Again, there\u2019s no need to explicitly build routes via it; your other machines on the LAN will discover the route\u2019s existence and use it.\n This is one of many projects that are working to democratize and decentralize the Internet. So far, it has been quite successful, growing to over 2000 nodes. It is the direct  successor to the earlier cjdns/Hyperboria and BATMAN networks, and aims to be a proof of concept and a viable tool for global expansion.\n Finally, think about how much easier development is when you don\u2019t have to necessarily worry about TLS complexity in every single application. When you don\u2019t have to worry about port forwarding and firewall penetration.

The British Antarctic Survey says the glacier is responsible for 4% of global sea rise, and the conditions leading to it to lose more ice are accelerating, University of Colorado ice scientist Ted Scambos said from the McMurdo land station last month.\n Oregon State University ice scientist Erin Pettit said Thwaites appears to be collapsing in three ways:\n  \u2014 The land part of the glacier \u201cis losing its grip\u201d to the place it attaches to the seabed, so a large chunk can come off into the ocean and later melt.\n \u2014 The glacier\u2019s ice shelf is breaking into hundreds of fractures like a damaged car windshield. This is what Pettit said she fears will be the most troublesome with six-mile (10-kilometer) long cracks forming in just a year.\n No one has stepped foot on the key ice-water interface at Thwaites before. In 2019, Wahlin was on a team that explored the area from a ship using a robotic ship but never went ashore.\n  Wahlin\u2019s team will use two robot ships \u2014 her own large one called Ran which she used in 2019 and the more agile  Boaty McBoatface, the crowdsource named drone that could go further under the area of Thwaites that protrudes over the ocean \u2014 to get under Thwaites.\n The ship-bound scientists will be measuring water temperature, the sea floor and ice thickness. They\u2019ll look at cracks in the ice, how the ice is structured and tag seals on islands off the glacier.\n Thwaites \u201clooks different from other ice shelves,\u201d Wahlin said. \u201cIt almost looks like a jumble of icebergs that have been pressed together. So it\u2019s increasingly clear that this is not a solid piece of ice like the other ice shelves are, nice smooth solid ice. This was much more jagged and scarred.\u201d\n      The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation,\u201d the CCI said in its 21-page order.\n  The probe follows a complaint from Digital News Publishers Association, which consists of the digital arms of some of India\u2019s biggest media firms. The association said their members get more than half of their traffic from online search engines, a category Google clearly commands, and the market-leading position has allowed Google to force the publishers into several unfavorable terms.\n In a wide-ranging complaint, the association said Google displaying snippets of news items limits the number of visitors to news outlets and impacts the ad revenue \u201cwhile Google continue[s] to earn ad revenue on its result page\u201d as well as enriches \u201cits search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries.\u201d\n \u201cIt has also been averred that the terms of the agreements entered between the members of the Informant [news publishers] and the OPs [Google and its subsidiaries] for sharing the advertisement revenues are unilaterally and arbitrarily dictated by the OPs, and the members of the Informant have no other option but to accept the terms, as they are, with no bargaining power whatsoever,\u201d the watchdog said.\n \u201cThe only alternate to the AMP system is for publishers to subscribe with Google, which benefits Google, to the detriment of the publishers,\u201d the watchdog said. The association accused that Google is forcing them to use its  AMP format, which has implications on their revenue.\n   \u201cIn a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders,\u201d the watchdog added.\n Friday\u2019s investigation is the latest of a series of probes the Indian competition watchdog has ordered in recent weeks.

M. Keck Observatory on Maunakea, Hawai\u02bbi Island \u2013 a team of researchers conducting the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE) transient survey observed the red supergiant during its last 130 days leading up to its deadly detonation.\n \u201cThis is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,\u201d says Wynn Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n, an NSF Graduate Research Fellow at UC Berkeley and lead author of the study. \u201cDirect detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova. For the first time, we watched a red supergiant star explode!\u201d\n  Pan-STARRS first detected the doomed massive star in Summer of 2020 via the huge amount of light radiating from the red supergiant. A few months later, in Fall of 2020, a supernova lit the sky.\n The team quickly captured the powerful flash and obtained the very first spectrum of the energetic explosion, named supernova 2020tlf, or SN 2020tlf, using Keck Observatory\u2019s Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS). The data showed direct evidence of dense circumstellar material surrounding the star at the time of explosion, likely the same exact gas that Pan-STARRS had imaged the red supergiant star violently ejecting earlier in the summer.\n   An artist\u2019s rendition of a red supergiant star transitioning into a Type II supernova, emitting a violent eruption of radiation and gas on its dying breath before collapsing and exploding. Credit: W. M. Keck Observatory/Adam Makarenko\n  \u201cKeck was instrumental in providing direct evidence of a massive star transitioning into a supernova explosion,\u201d says senior author Raffaella Margutti, an associate professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching a ticking time bomb. We\u2019ve never confirmed such violent activity in a dying red supergiant star where we see it produce such a luminous emission, then collapse and combust, until now.\u201d\n The team continued to monitor SN 2020tlf after the explosion; based on data obtained from Keck Observatory\u2019s DEep Imaging and Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) and Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES), they determined SN 2020tlf\u2019s progenitor red supergiant star, located in the NGC 5731 galaxy about 120 million light-years away as seen from Earth, was 10 times more massive than the Sun.\n The discovery defies previous ideas of how red supergiant stars evolve right before blowing up. Prior to this, all red supergiants observed before exploding were relatively quiescent: they showed no evidence of violent eruptions or luminous emission, as was observed prior to SN 2020tlf. However, this novel detection of bright radiation coming from a red supergiant in the final year before exploding suggests that at least some of these stars must undergo significant changes in their internal structure that then results in the tumultuous ejection of gas moments before they collapse.\n Margutti and Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n conducted most of the study during their time at Northwestern University, with Margutti serving as an Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy and member of CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics), and Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n as a graduate student.\n The team\u2019s discovery paves a path forward for transient surveys like YSE to hunt for luminous radiation coming from red supergiants, and gather more evidence that such behavior could signal the imminent, supernova demise of a massive star.\n \u201cI am most excited by all of the new \u2018unknowns\u2019 that have been unlocked by this discovery,\u201d says Jacobson-Gal\u00e1n. \u201cDetecting more events like SN 2020tlf will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution, uniting observers and theorists in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives.\u201d\n   The\u00a0Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS)\u00a0is a very versatile and ultra-sensitive visible-wavelength imager and spectrograph built at the California Institute of Technology by a team led by Prof. Bev Oke and Prof. Judy Cohen and commissioned in 1993. Since then it has seen two major upgrades to further enhance its capabilities: the addition of a second, blue arm optimized for shorter wavelengths of light and the installation of detectors that are much more sensitive at the longest (red) wavelengths. Each arm is optimized for the wavelengths it covers.\u00a0This large range of wavelength coverage, combined with the instrument\u2019s high sensitivity, allows the study of everything from comets (which have interesting features in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum), to the blue light from star formation, to the red light of very distant objects.\u00a0LRIS also records the spectra of up to 50 objects simultaneously, especially useful for studies of clusters of galaxies in the most distant reaches, and earliest times, of the universe.\u00a0LRIS was used in observing distant supernovae by astronomers who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2011 for research determining that the universe was speeding up in its expansion.\n  The DEep Imaging and Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) boasts the largest field of view (16.7arcmin by 5 arcmin) of any of the Keck Observatory instruments, and the largest number of pixels (64 Mpix). It is used primarily in its multi-object mode, obtaining simultaneous spectra of up to 130 galaxies or stars. Astronomers study fields of distant galaxies with DEIMOS, efficiently probing the most distant corners of the universe with high sensitivity.\n  The Near Infrared Echellette Spectrograph (NIRES) is a prism cross-dispersed near-infrared spectrograph built at the California Institute of Technology by a team led by Chief Instrument Scientist Keith Matthews and Prof. Tom Soifer. Commissioned in 2018, NIRES covers a large wavelength range at moderate spectral resolution for use on the Keck II telescope and observes extremely faint red objects found with the Spitzer and WISE infrared space telescopes, as well as brown dwarfs, high-redshift galaxies, and quasars. Support for this technology was generously provided by the Mt. Cuba Astronomical Foundation.\n  The W. M. Keck Observatory telescopes are among the most scientifically productive on Earth. The two 10-meter optical/infrared telescopes atop Maunakea on the Island of Hawai\u02bbi feature a suite of advanced instruments including imagers, multi-object spectrographs, high-resolution spectrographs, integral-field spectrometers, and world-leading laser guide star adaptive optics systems.\u00a0Some of the data presented herein were obtained at Keck Observatory, which is a private 501(c) 3 non-profit organization operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. The authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Maunakea has always had within the Native Hawaiian community.\u00a0We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 04:33:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89c1\u8bc1,witness,deimos", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u89c1\u8bc1\u7740\u5782\u6b7b\u7684\u660e\u661f\u8fbe\u5230\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5c40", "title_en": "Astronomers Witness a Dying Star Reach Its Explosive End", "transed": 1, "url": "https://keckobservatory.org/dying-star/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c1\u8bc1", "witness", "deimos"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eacd6db4f090f9a8c3c6d49130509437.png", "infoid": 1072552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "RSS\u6e90\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591aGovInfo\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u62ec\u53d1\u5e03\u7684100\u4e2a\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "note_en": "RSS feeds are available for many govinfo collections and generally include the 100 most recent documents published.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 04:32:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "feeds,govinfo", "title": "RSS\u6e90\u5bf9\u653f\u5e9c\u6b63\u5728\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "RSS Feeds about what the Government is doing", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.govinfo.gov/feeds", "via": "", "real_tags": ["feeds", "govinfo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "debde01b42432d05c75483c0372bddf7.jpeg", "infoid": 1072551, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8b66\u65b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u201c\u6d3e\u9063\u201d\u5230\u79c1\u4eba\u4fe1\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u5207 - \u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a", "note_en": "Police can access everything from \u201cpokes\u201d to private Messenger data \u2014 and increasingly do\n  In mid-September of 2019, Violet, a friend of mine, was jolted awake by a sound every activist dreads: the police door knock.
