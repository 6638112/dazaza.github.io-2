He kicked off the series with speaking about an advert for WhiteHat Jr, an ed-tech startup that gives coding courses for children as young as six;  within 18 months of operation, the startup was acquired by ed-tech giant Byju’s for $300 million in August.The advert shows a group of people in suits charging into a home, punching and pushing each other in a race to get there. Out on the porch, a mother and father are watching the action with a smile, sipping their morning tea. A neighbour comes to see what the ruckus is about, and the mother is gleeful as she tells him that these are investors, rushing to bank on ‘Chintu’, their elementary school son who has built an app. The neighbour is visibly jealous.Haria’s video pokes fun at the cinematography, the acting, along with self-deprecating jokes about how he has “wasted six years of his life” not learning how to code. It was uploaded on his channel, called Just Jihan, on Sunday afternoon, and Haria was pleased to see that it seemed to be doing well. But when he woke up from a post-lunch siesta, he was in for a shock: The video had been taken off YouTube for copyright violations, presumptively because it used footage from the advert itself. His channel had got one strike; with three strikes, the channel is taken down entirely.However, experts say the copyright claim doesn’t seem straightforward. “The law has an exemption for the purposes of commentary in the Copyright Act, where you can reproduce the content for reviews, for instance,” explains Prashant Reddy, an independent lawyer specialising in intellectual property (IP).“The video never dismissed WhiteHat Jr’s product itself; it was just a comment on the advertisement,” Haria says. “I was sad and discouraged to see it taken down, and I told my father we must react.”  Jihan Haria, a 12-year-old YouTuber, found his video roasting WhiteHat Jr&#39;s advertisement removed. Haria’s case is not in isolation; multiple people who have critiqued WhiteHat Jr (WHJ) or its marketing campaigns have found their posts swiftly taken down, across social media platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter and Quora.Haria’s father tweeted about the incident and got the attention of Pradeep Poonia, a former Cisco engineer and current UPSC civil services aspirant, who has been fighting against such takedowns by WhiteHat Jr for weeks now. Poonia posted a revised version of Haria’s video, which includes Haria giving an introduction on what happened on the Just Jihan video, on his YouTube channel instead, which he claims WhiteHat Jr has stopped policing since he garnered some media attention. At the time of writing, this video is still online. “It’s got about 2,000 views already, which is a big deal for me,” Haria smiles.This channel, however, is Poonia’s third. From his first YouTube channel, called WhiteHatSr, six videos were removed; another eight were wiped off his second channel, called Safed Topi Sr 2. This third channel, named Pradeep Poonia 3.0, stays away from the WhiteHat Jr references in its name, and has seen two videos erased. The first two channels were suspended because of repeat strikes.Poonia, who previously worked in ed-tech and found himself disillusioned with startups that chase money and numbers over education quality, began to post against WHJ in the middle of August. On September 11, his first video was taken down, and several posts since.Poonia’s videos take on various claims that WhiteHat Jr has made. For instance, WHJ advertises a certain child called ‘Wolf Gupta’, who, after learning to code with the firm, got a job at Google that pays in crores. Poonia points out in his video that Wolf Gupta’s age keeps changing across advertisements, from nine to 14, as does his salary package—from Rs1.2 crore to Rs20 crore to Rs150 crore. In another video, Poonia posts screen recordings of WHJ’s app reviews on the Google Play Store to show how many of the 5-star reviews have very similar text and therefore appear fake.According to notices from YouTube, which  Forbes India has reviewed, violations against Poonia’s videos have been raised by a company called AiPlex on behalf of either Byju’s or WHJ. AiPlex is a Bengaluru-based anti-piracy company that also launched digital marketing and advertising verticals in 2019. While a contact request to AiPlex went unanswered, it lists Byju’s among its clients on its website.“I’m not a YouTuber, and I just started these channels to highlight issues that I thought were misleading parents,” says Poonia. “So my videos got hardly 15 to 20 views to begin with. It was thus quite suspicious that they were being taken down.”Poonia’s videos were being flagged for copyright infringement, including ones that had no footage from any of WHJ’s own collaterals. For one that was taken down because ‘WhiteHatJr logo is shown on top left corner of the screen’, Poonia re-uploaded it with the entire screen blurred, and still got the same outcome. Soon, videos were being wiped out within 35 to 40 minutes of being uploaded.Poonia appealed to YouTube for most of the videos, and pasted these appeals in public posts on Reddit. They were taken down from Reddit and his account suspended. YouTube rejected the appeals, saying, “Thank you for your counter-notification. Unfortunately, it&#39;s unclear to us whether you have a valid reason for filing a counter-notification, so we won&#39;t be able to honour your request”, as seen in the screenshot below.  Meanwhile, Poonia also lost two Reddit accounts, one Quora account and a Twitter account. On Twitter, he has resurfaced as @WhiteHatSnr. He has uploaded all his videos to a decentralised platform called LBRY. Forbes India reached out to both WhiteHat Jr as well as YouTube India with detailed questionnaires on Wednesday (October 21) around 3.30 pm. Before the companies responded, Poonia, after weeks of rejected appeals, received three emails from YouTube Copyright between 5.59 pm and 6.28 pm. Each of the emails now said, “The complaint lacks one or more legally-required elements of a copyright takedown notice, so we asked the requesting party to provide additional information to complete their notice. Pending their response to our email, we reinstated your video(s) and resolved your copyright strike”. No fresh appeals were filed to prompt this action—in fact, Poonia says some of the videos reinstated weren’t appealed for at all.These emails are in  Forbes India’s possession, a sample of which has been pasted below.   “This means they had no legal grounds to take them down in the first place,” Poonia says. “I appealed for most of the videos across several weeks—how have all of them been reinstated in one go? Moreover, even the ones I hadn’t appealed for have been restored. That shows the authority such companies have over Google and YouTube.”A total of 14 of the 16 videos were reinstated on Wednesday evening, and his first two channels restored. Two videos on his third channel remain revoked. “Yet, they continue to remove others’ videos,” Poonia adds.Two marketing and communications professionals, Krishni Miglani and Ayushi Mona, posted Episode 1 of a passion project three days ago, a video on what the internet is raging about in the week. The video featured the ladies discussing the controversy over WhiteHat Jr’s advertisements and the clichés of the ‘neighbour’s envy, owner’s pride’ style campaigns, and was taken down within an hour for copyright issues. The duo has posted about the incident on their individual LinkedIn profiles, linking to the now-unavailable video.  Forbes India has a copy of the video.  Pradeep Poonia has been speaking out against WhiteHat Jr since August.“We did reach out to the [YouTube] team with concerns via LinkedIn and put out posts, but haven’t heard back,” Miglani tells  Forbes India via email . “We got a copyright violation reason mentioned but no specifics called out. YouTube is silent on the policy there as well as majority product reviews like movie reviews do feature them.” Watching the watchdogA statement from a WhiteHat Jr spokesperson in response to  Forbes India’s questionnaire says the onus to take down posts lies with the platform itself, not the company or complainant.“The right of deleting a social media post lies with the platform, no private organisation has it, and so the question of silencing dissent doesn’t arise,” the spokesperson said via email. “We have highlighted certain videos to respective platforms where inappropriate (read abusive) language was used. The final call on the video to be deleted is actually taken by the platform.”The company does acknowledge problems in its marketing in the next part of the statement: “Our vision is to inspire children to be creators of technology rather than being passive consumers of it. At the core—learning to code helps in developing logical thinking and problem-solving skills. In fact, globally too, leading economies, including the US, Australia, the UK, Israel and more advocate coding. We acknowledge consumer feedback on our marketing campaign and will work towards articulating our company vision in a more pointed manner in the future.”Experts say while corporate censorship issues are not new, this points to a larger need for transparency in content moderation.“This is more a comment on how YouTube and other social media are moderating their platforms,” says Reddy, the lawyer quoted above. “If it’s so easy for companies to censor critical content, that’s the larger issue. Algorithms cannot distinguish between fair use and the copyright law.” “On YouTube, it’s been an age-old issue over what is considered fair use and what is considered copyright,” agrees Shashidhar KJ, associate fellow, Observer Research Foundation, who specialises in technology and policy. “YouTube has a Content ID system where it tries to identify who owns the copyright and tries to give it to the rightful owner of the IP. This was primarily created for the music ecosystem, where record labels were asking for fair compensation for IP that they owned when people used their music. This controversy has been coming up a lot for legitimate criticism.”“What’s happening with WHJ is sort of an abuse of the Content ID system,” he adds. “If you are reviewing or critiquing the company’s marketing, you would have to show the advertisement you are talking about. Technically, those ads are copyright of WHJ, and YouTube has to comply with this. The Content ID system is heavily skewed in favour of the IP holder.”In response to  Forbes India’s queries, a YouTube spokesperson sent this statement:  &#34;YouTube&#39;s copyright removal process complies with the applicable law. We strive to be fair to our users and protect their freedom of expression while also respecting the legal rights of copyright owners. Based on a copyright claim raised by a copyright owner or an agent authorised to act on their behalf, users have the option to file a   counter notification  when they believe their content has been removed as a result of a mistake, misidentification of the content, including fair use. The process further requires the claimant to provide evidence that they have initiated a court action within a specified timeline. In the event of any misuse of our process, we take it seriously and overturn removal decisions where we find evidence that a removal request was submitted without considering exceptions to copyright law such as fair use, fair dealing or other exceptions.&#34; ***Reddy adds that this is a good example of the limitations of social media. “It’s probably time to fall back on legacy media, and this highlights why old-school journalism and activism are so important in raising such issues,” he says.This is a new issue in a sense, adds lawyer Nikhil Narendran, partner, Trilegal, as earlier, you had to go to court, get an order, and then get something pulled down. “Now, there are intermediaries controlling the flow of information using their community standards and guidelines,” he says. “Technically, they still need a court order, but due to commercial relationships with companies giving them so much advertising, they may move muscle to bring content down.”“To my mind, if someone is losing here, it’s WhiteHat Jr,” he says. “I would never subscribe to a service for my kids that’s in the habit of bullying people, even kids. They’re losing a large amount of consumer goodwill when resorting to such tactics.”Where does the debate go from here? Back to mainstream media, spreading information by word-of-mouth, and making parents aware of potential issues, experts say. “If you spread awareness on WhatsApp, it might be more difficult for WHJ to remove, because technically your messages are end-to-end encrypted,” Shashidhar KJ says.Abhik Choudhury, marketing expert and chief strategist &amp; founder, Salt and Paper Consulting, says a big part of the flaw rests with the marketing campaigns, and the damage control could have been better handled.“WhiteHat Jr is a relevant product that can truly make coding sexy in a way it never was. But here’s what it needs to do: Humbly accept the reality that it overdosed on advertising, go into product fine-tuning rehab and come back like a responsible leader who actually cares about the customer more than the sales target,” he says. “There is not a single historical evidence of a corporate doing the former who survived. In a category like education, respect needs to be earned. This category it is trying to build is certainly going to thrive, with or without them, and its standing will depend upon their ability to empathise.”       Show More                   Thank you for

Jr的广告作为开篇，该公司是一家高科技初创公司，为6岁以下的儿童提供编码课程。在运营的18个月内，这家初创公司在8月被ed-tech巨头Byju以3亿美元收购。广告显示一群穿着西装的人冲入房屋，互相冲撞，互相竞争，力争到达那里。在门廊上，一对父母微笑着看着动作，,着早晨的茶。一位邻居来看看骚动是什么，这位母亲告诉他这些是投资者，母亲高兴极了，急忙向他们的小儿子“ Chintu”靠钱，后者已经开发了一个应用程序。邻居明显嫉妒。哈里亚（Haria）的视频在电影摄影中取笑，表演以及自嘲自嘲的笑话，讲述了他如何“浪费了六年的生命”而不学习编码。它在周日下午上传到他的名为Just Jihan的频道中，Haria很高兴看到它的运行情况很好。但是，当他从午饭后的午睡中醒来时，他感到震惊：该视频因侵犯版权而被YouTube删除，这可能是因为该视频使用了广告中的素材。他的频道遭到了罢工。三次罢工后，该频道已被全部删除。但是，专家称版权声明似乎并不简单。 “版权法中出于评论目的，该法律是免税的，例如，您可以在其中复制内容以供审阅，”专门研究知识产权（IP）的独立律师Prashant Reddy解释说。“录像带从未撤销WhiteHat小产品本身；这只是对广告的评论。”哈里亚说。 “看到它被拆除，我感到难过和沮丧，我告诉父亲我们必须做出反应。” 12岁的YouTuber Jihan Haria发现他的视频烘焙WhiteHat Jr的广告已删除。哈里亚的案子并非孤立无援。许多批评过WhiteHat Jr（WHJ）或其营销活动的人发现他们的帖子在社交媒体平台上迅速被删除，包括YouTube，LinkedIn，Reddit，Twitter和Quora。 Poonia是Cisco的前工程师，现任UPSC公务员职位，他一直在与WhiteHat Jr的此类撤军作斗争。 Poonia张贴了Haria视频的修订版，其中包括Haria在自己的YouTube频道上介绍了Just Jihan视频中发生的事情，他声称WhiteHat Jr自从获得了一些媒体关注以来就停止了治安。在撰写本文时，该视频仍在线。 Haria笑着说：“已经有2,000次观看，对我来说这很重要。”但是，该频道是Poonia的第三频道。从他的第一个YouTube频道WhiteHatSr中删除了六个视频；他的第二个频道名为Safed Topi Sr 2删除了另外八个频道。这第三个频道名为Pradeep Poonia 3.0，名称与WhiteHat Jr参考文献保持距离，并且删除了两个视频。前两个频道因屡次罢工而被暂停.Poonia曾在ed-tech工作，但对那些追求金钱和数量超过教育质量的初创公司感到失望，于8月中旬开始对WHJ进行发布。 9月11日，他的第一个视频被撤下，此后又发布了几篇博文。例如，WHJ刊登了一个名为“ Wolf Gupta”的孩子的广告，这个孩子在学习了与公司的代码后，在Google找到了一份工作，付了高昂的薪水。 Poonia在他的视频中指出，沃尔夫·古普塔（Wolf Gupta）的年龄在各个广告中不断变化，从9岁到14岁不等，他的薪酬也​​从1200万卢比增加到2亿卢比，再到15亿卢比。在另一段视频中，Poonia在Google Play商店上发布了WHJ应用评论的屏幕录像，以显示有多少五星级评论的文字非常相似，因此看起来是假的。根据YouTube的通知，《福布斯》印度对此进行了评论，违反了Poonia的视频是由一家名为AiPlex的公司代表Byju或WHJ提出的。 AiPlex是总部位于班加罗尔的反盗版公司，该公司还在2019年启动了数字营销和广告垂直市场。尽管未收到对AiPlex的联系请求，但它在其网站上将Byju的客户列为客户。“我不是YouTuber，我刚开始通过这些渠道来突显我认为误导父母的问题。” Poonia说。 “因此，我的视频最初几乎没有15到20次观看。因此，Poonia的视频被标记为侵犯版权，其中包括没有来自WHJ自己的抵押品的录像带。对于因“ WhiteHatJr徽标显示在屏幕的左上角”而被撤消的内容，Poonia重新上传了该图片，整个屏幕模糊了，但结果仍然相同。影片很快就在上传后的35至40分钟内消失了。Poonia大部分影片都向YouTube提出上诉，并将这些诉求贴在Reddit的公开帖子中。他们从Reddit撤下，他的帐户被暂停。 YouTube拒绝了上诉，并说：“谢谢您的抗辩通知。不幸的是，我们不清楚您是否有提出抗辩通知的正当理由，因此我们将无法满足您的请求”，如以下屏幕截图所示。同时，Poonia还丢失了两个Reddit帐户，一个Quora帐户和一个Twitter帐户。在Twitter上，他以@WhiteHatSnr重新出现。他已将所有视频上传到一个名为LBRY的去中心化平台。 《福布斯》印度分部在周三（10月21日）下午3:30左右向WhiteHat Jr和YouTube印度提供了详细的调查表。在公司做出回应之前，Poonia经过数周的拒绝上诉后，在5.59 pm至6.28 pm之间收到了三封来自YouTube版权的电子邮件。现在，每封电子邮件都说：“投诉书缺少版权删除通知书中一项或多项法律要求的内容，因此我们请请求方提供其他信息以完成其通知。在他们回复我们的电子邮件之前，我们恢复了您的视频并解决了您的版权警告”。没有任何新的上诉要求提起诉讼-实际上，Poonia说恢复的某些视频根本没有被上诉。这些电子邮件是《福布斯》印度拥有的，其中一个示例已粘贴在下面。 Poonia说：“这意味着他们一开始就没有法律依据将其撤下。” “在数周内，我对大多数视频都提出了申诉-如何一次性恢复所有视频？而且，即使是我没有提出过的要求也已恢复。这表明了这些公司对Google和YouTube的权威。“在周三晚上，恢复了16个视频中的14个，并恢复了他的前两个频道。他的第三个频道上的两个视频仍然被撤消。 Poonia补充说：“但是，他们仍在继续删除其他人的视频。”三位营销和传播专业人士Krishni Miglani和Ayushi Mona在三天前发布了一个激情项目的第1集，该视频讲述了互联网在一周中的肆虐。录像带中的女士们讨论了有关WhiteHat Jr的广告的争议以及“邻居嫉妒，业主自尊”风格的宣传的陈词滥调，并在一小时内因版权问题而被撤下。两人在各自的LinkedIn个人资料上发布了有关该事件的信息，并链接到了现在不可用的视频。福布斯印度有此视频的副本。自8月份以来，Pradeep Poonia就一直在与WhiteHat Jr进行对话。“我们确实通过LinkedIn向了[YouTube]小组提出了疑问，并发布了帖子，但没有回音，” Miglani通过电子邮件告诉《福布斯》印度。 “我们提到了侵犯版权的原因，但没有具体说明。 YouTube对那里的政策以及大多数产品评论（例如电影评论）都没有提及的政策保持沉默。”怀特·哈特（WhiteHat Jr）发言人在回应《福布斯》印度调查问卷时发表声明说，删除帖子的责任在于平台本身，而不是公司或投诉人。“删除社交媒体帖子的权利在于平台，而不是私人的。组织拥有它，因此不会产生异议的问题，”发言人通过电子邮件说。 “我们已经在各自的平台上突出显示了某些视频，这些视频使用了不适当的（滥用阅读）语言。该平台实际上是要删除视频的最终决定。”该公司在声明的下一部分中承认其营销方面的问题：“我们的愿景是激发孩子成为技术的创造者，而不是被动的消费者。它的。核心是学习编码有助于发展逻辑思维和解决问题的能力。实际上，在全球范围内，包括美国，澳大利亚，英国，以色列在内的主要经济体也倡导编码。我们认可消费者对我们营销活动的反馈，并将在未来以更加明确的方式努力阐明我们的公司愿景。”专家说，尽管公司审查制度不是新问题，但这表明在内容审核方面需要更大的透明度。” “更多地是关于YouTube和其他社交媒体如何调节其平台的评论。”以上引用的律师雷迪说。 “如果公司很容易审查关键内容，那就是更大的问题。算法无法区分合理使用和版权法。” “在YouTube上，关于合理使用和版权问题一直存在一个古老的问题，”专门研究技术和政策的观察家研究基金会副研究员Shashidhar KJ表示同意。 “ YouTube具有Content ID系统，在该系统中，它试图确定谁拥有版权，并试图将其提供给IP的合法所有者。这主要是为音乐生态系统创建的，在唱片生态系统中，唱片公司要求人们在使用音乐时对其所拥有的IP进行公平补偿。合理的批评引起了很多争议。““ WHJ发生的事情是对Content ID系统的滥用，”他补充说。 “如果您正在审查或批评公司的营销，则必须显示您正在谈论的广告。从技术上讲，这些广告是WHJ的版权，YouTube必须遵守该广告。 Content ID系统严重偏向IP所有者。他们的言论自由，同时也尊重版权所有者的合法权利。基于版权所有者或授权代表他们行事的代理人提出的版权主张，用户可以选择在认为自己的内容已经被侵犯时提出反通知。由于错误，内容的错误标识（包括合理使用）而被删除。该流程还要求申诉人提供证据，表明他们已在指定的时间表内提起了诉讼。如果对我们的流程有任何滥用，我们将采取以下措施：认真考虑并推翻移除决定，因为我们发现证据表明提出了移除请求，而没有考虑版权法的例外情况，例如合理使用，fai交易或其他例外情况。” *** Reddy补充说，这是社交媒体局限性的一个很好的例子。他说：“可能是时候放弃传统媒体了，这凸显了为什么老式新闻和行动主义在提出此类问题时如此重要。”从某种意义上说，这是一个新问题。Trilegal合伙人律师Nikhil Narendran补充道。 ，就像之前一样，您必须去法庭，下达命令，然后再撤诉。他说：“现在，有中介机构使用其社区标准和准则来控制信息流。” “从技术上讲，他们仍然需要法院命令，但是由于与公司的商业关系为他们提供了很多广告，他们可能会竭尽全力降低内容。”“在我看来，如果有人在这里败北，那就是怀特·哈特。”说。 “我永远不会以欺凌他人甚至欺凌他人的习惯为我的孩子订购服务。当采取这种策略时，他们正在失去大量的消费者信誉。“争论从何而来？专家说，回到主流媒体，通过口耳相传的方式传播信息，并使父母意识到潜在的问题。 Shashidhar KJ说：“如果您在WhatsApp上传播意识，WHJ可能会更难删除，因为从技术上讲，您的消息是端到端加密的。” Salt and Paper Consulting营销专家兼首席策略师兼创始人Abhik Choudhury “缺陷的很大一部分在于营销活动，而损害控制本来可以得到更好的处理。” WhiteHat Jr是一种相关产品，可以以前所未有的方式真正使编码变得性感。但是，这是需要做的：谦虚地接受广告投放过多的现实，进行产品微调修复，然后像负责任的领导者那样回来，他实际上更关心客户而不是销售目标。” “没有任何历史证据表明一家公司能够幸存下来。在教育等类别中，需要赢得尊重。它尝试建立的这个类别肯定会蓬勃发展，无论它们是否存在，其地位将取决于他们的同情心。”显示更多感谢您的评论，我们重视您的意见以及您花时间给我们写信！</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div
