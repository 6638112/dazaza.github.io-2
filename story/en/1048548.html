That means a renewed interest in remote management and monitoring software.</p><p> 虽然许多组织能够使用电子邮件，消息应用程序和视频会议软件的HodgePodge成功地运行团队，但是希望更加了解其偏远工人的能见度的管理人员已经开始探讨更全面的方法，以便保持员工的详细措施取决于。这意味着对远程管理和监控软件的重新兴趣。</p><p>     Remote monitoring software is often sold as a tool for helping employers track productivity and as a means to help managers identify areas where workplace processes can be improved – something high on the agenda for businesses looking to make flexible working a permanent fixture.</p><p>     远程监控软件通常作为帮助雇主跟踪生产率的工具以及帮助管理者确定可以改进工作场所过程的区域的手段 - 寻求灵活工作永久性夹具的企业议程上的东西。</p><p>  These technologies provide a variety of capabilities that can give employers a remarkable insight into how employees use their time while at work, including the websites they visit, the apps they use, and in some cases include the ability to record their keystrokes and desktop sessions.</p><p>  这些技术提供了各种功能，可以使雇主对员工在工作中使用时间的显着洞察力，包括他们访问的网站，他们使用的应用程序以及在某些情况下包括录制击键和桌面会话的能力。</p><p> According to research from Skillcast and YouGov in December 2020, as many as one in five businesses are now  using technology capable of tracking workers&#39; online activity, or have plans to do so in the future. In a separate study by the UK&#39;s Trades Union Congress (TUC) in November, one in seven employees reported that their workplace had increased monitoring and surveillance since the start of the pandemic.</p><p> 根据Skillcast和Yougov的研究于2020年12月2020年12月，多达五分之一的企业现在正在使用能够跟踪工人的技术＆＃39;在线活动，或者未来计划这样做。在11月的英国和第39届交易会（TUC）的单独研究中，七位员工中的一名员工报告称，自流行的开始以来，他们的工作场所增加了监测和监督。</p><p> While businesses may have legitimate reasons for wanting to introduce activity-tracking software, particularly in those industries that handle high-value data on a day-to-day basis, some have raised concerns over what the slow creep of this technology into the remote-working environment means for employee privacy, particularly as the boundaries that separate work and private life become even more blurred.</p><p> 虽然企业可能具有合法的原因，想要引入活动跟踪软件，特别是在日常处理高价值数据的行业中，有些人提出了对遥控器缓慢蠕变的关注 - 工作环境对于员工隐私手段，特别是作为单独工作和私人生活变得更加模糊的界限。</p><p>   &#34;I think there are huge questions around how technology is changing our relationship to work and with employers, but also the speed at which it&#39;s being introduced,&#34; says Andrew Pakes, direction of communications and research at professional trade union Prospect.</p><p>   ＆＃34;我认为技术如何正在改变我们与雇主的关系以及与雇主改变关系的巨大问题，也是它被引入的速度和＃34;安德鲁举行，通信方向和专业工会前景的研究。 </p><p> &#34;During COVID-19, we&#39;ve seen this growing interest in the use of digital technology to support remote working, and in many ways, that&#39;s been a real benefit to support and connect people. But alongside the positive use of technology, we&#39;ve seen this worrying trend of intrusive surveillance, and a rush to use these new forms of software.&#34;</p><p>在COVID-19期间，我们已经看到了对使用数字技术支持远程工作的日益增长的兴趣，并且在许多方面，这对支持和联系人们是真正的好处。但是，除了积极使用技术外，我们还看到了这种令人担忧的侵入性监视趋势，并急于使用这些新形式的软件。</p><p> Prospect has been vocal in its pursuit for clearer guidance around the use of remote monitoring software, and what more widespread introduction of the technology into businesses means.</p><p> 在寻求有关使用远程监控软件的更清晰指导以及将技术广泛引入企业的意义上，Prospect一直在发出声音。</p><p> Research carried out by YouGov on behalf of Prospect last year suggested that two-thirds of employees were uncomfortable with the notion of employers recording information like screenshots and keystrokes while they were working from home.</p><p> YouGov去年代表Prospect进行的研究表明，三分之二的员工对雇主在家工作时记录屏幕截图和击键等信息的想法感到不自在。</p><p> Since then, the union has called on the UK Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) to provide further clarity on what worker&#39;s rights are when it comes to the data employers collect on them, as well as ensure that workers can have a say in the conversation around workplace technology.</p><p> 自那时以来，工会一直呼吁英国信息专员办公室（ICO）进一步明确雇主在收集雇主收集的数据时应享有的权利，并确保工人可以在有关工作场所技术的对话中发表意见。</p><p> Pakes calls the practice of monitoring employees &#34;a discreet discussion that too often happens in procurement and board rooms&#34;, but far away from employees themselves.</p><p> Pakes称之为监视员工的做法，这种谨慎的讨论经常发生在采购和董事会会议室中，但与员工本身相距甚远。</p><p> &#34;The law is clear that workers have a right to be informed if their data is being collected for surveillance purposes, and we have a right to be consulted. Our worry is that, too often, that consultation involvement isn&#39;t happening,&#34; says Pakes.</p><p> ＆＃34;法律明确规定，如果工人出于监视目的而收集其数据，则有权通知他们，我们有权进行咨询。我们担心的是，咨询的参与往往没有发生，帕克斯说。</p><p> &#34;We&#39;re saying two things. One, the ICO needs to provide greater and clearer guidance so that workers can see what their rights are. Secondly, we really need to start picking up and looking at where the gaps exist in existing legislation.&#34;</p><p> 我们在说两件事。第一，ICO需要提供更清晰的指导，以便工人可以看到自己的权利。其次，我们确实需要开始了解现有立法中存在的差距。＆＃34; </p><p>  The ICO&#39;s Code of Employment Practices warns that businesses risk breaching the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if they begin monitoring employees without proper authority.</p><p>ICO＆＃39;雇用实践规范警告说，如果他们在没有适当的权威的情况下开始监测雇员，则违反一般数据保护条例（GDPR）的企业风险。</p><p> It also states that workers should be left with a clear understanding of when information about them is likely to be obtained, why it is being obtained, how it will be used and to whom – if anyone – it will be disclosed.</p><p> 它还指出，应清楚地了解工人，在可能获得有关他们的信息时，为什么正在获得它，如何使用它以及谁 - 如果有人 - 它将被披露。</p><p> &#34;If monitoring is to be justified on the basis that it is necessary to enforce the organization&#39;s rules and standards, [these] must be known and understood by workers,&#34; the guidance reads. And yet, in TUC&#39;s November survey, fewer than 1 in 3 (31%) employees said they were consulted when new forms of technology were introduced to the workplace.</p><p> ＆＃34;如果监测是在基础上是有必要执行组织的合理性和第39条规则和标准，[这些]必须被工人所知和理解，＆＃34;指导读取。然而，在Tuc＆＃39; S 11月的调查中，少于1人（31％）员工表示，当新的技术形式被引入工作场所时，他们被咨询。</p><p> There are six lawful bases for processing personal data under GDPR: clear consent from the individual in question; legal obligation; vital interest to the individual; public interest; contractual obligation as well as legitimate interest of the data controller.</p><p> 在GDPR下处理个人数据有六个合法的基础：清楚同意有问题;法律义务;个人对个人的影响;公共利益;合同义务以及数据控制人的合法利益。</p><p> Sarah Pearce, privacy and cybersecurity partner at global law firm Paul Hastings, says this is where things can get murky for remote monitoring tools, particularly those that collect anything that could be deemed as sensitive or personal data under GDPR.</p><p> Sarah Pearce，隐私和网络安全合作伙伴在全球律师事务所Paul Hastings，这是对远程监控工具的东西可以获得Mulky的地方，特别是那些可以被视为在GDPR下被视为敏感或个人数据的东西。</p><p>  &#34;When it pushes into the border of special category and sensitive data, then there is more of an issue, because there are certain additional conditions in Article 9 of GDPR that need to be satisfied,&#34; she tells ZDNet.</p><p>  ＆＃34;当它推入特殊类别和敏感数据的边界时，那么有更多的问题，因为GDPR第9条需要满足的一些额外条件，而＃34;她告诉Zdnet。</p><p> Pearce also finds that companies are increasingly seeking to justify remote monitoring tools under the grounds of &#39;legitimate interest&#39; under GDPR. &#34;From speaking to my employment colleagues, it is very difficult to find a legal basis to justify monitoring in that way,&#34; she says.</p><p> Pearce还发现，公司越来越多地寻求在＆＃39的理由下证明远程监控工具;合法兴趣＆＃39;在GDP下。 ＆＃34;从对我的就业同事发言，很难找到法律依据，以便以这种方式证明监测，＆＃34;她说。 </p><p> Using the consent mechanism can also be problematic for employers. &#34;There is a big issue with using consent in the employment context. Generally speaking, you cannot use the consent mechanism in an employment context, because it&#39;s seen as being an unfair balance of power,&#34; says Pearce.</p><p>使用同意机制也可能对雇主造成问题。 ＆＃34;在就业环境中使用同意存在很大的问题。一般而言，您不能在雇用环境中使用同意机制，因为这被视为一种不公平的权力平衡。皮尔斯说。</p><p>  Certainly not all staff are comfortable with such monitoring. Microsoft faced criticism from privacy advocates who took issue with its Productivity Score feature for Microsoft 365. The tool analysed how users within an organization used Microsoft 365 products and then assigned them an overall &#34;productivity score&#34; based on how often they engaged with things like meetings, email and messaging apps.</p><p>  当然，并非所有员工都对这种监视感到满意。 Microsoft面临来自隐私拥护者的批评，他们对Microsoft 365的Productivity Score功能提出了质疑。该工具分析了组织中的用户如何使用Microsoft 365产品，然后为他们分配了总体“ Productivity Score”。基于他们与会议，电子邮件和消息传递应用程序等事物互动的频率。</p><p> The outcry mainly stemmed from the fact that Productivity Score showed analytics for individual employees that could potentially be used by managers to judge their performance. Microsoft subsequently pared back the tool by removing the ability for admins to view data on named employees.</p><p> 引起强烈抗议的原因是，生产率得分显示了针对单个员工的分析，管理人员可能会使用这些分析来判断其绩效。 Microsoft随后通过取消管理员查看命名雇员的数据的能力来缩减该工具。</p><p> Microsoft 365 corporate vice president, Jared Spataro, later clarified that Productivity Score was not designed as a tool for surveillance, but rather to help businesses identify how users were working within its software suite and help them run remote-working environments more successfully.</p><p> Microsoft 365公司副总裁Jared Spataro后来澄清说，Productivity Score并不是作为监视工具而设计的，而是帮助企业确定用户在其软件套件中的工作方式，并帮助他们更成功地运行远程工作环境。</p><p>  Regardless of employee attitudes to these kinds of tools, the fact that Microsoft is making moves in this space is enough to set alarm bells ringing for Pakes, who sees it as a sign that the technology is moving into the mainstream.</p><p>  无论员工对这些工具的态度如何，微软在这一领域采取行动的事实足以使Pakes敲响警钟，Pakes认为这标志着该技术已成为主流。</p><p> &#34;If Microsoft is introducing tools that can be used for work-based surveillance, then lots of other software products will be offering similar forms of monitoring that employers can use,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;如果Microsoft推出了可用于基于工作的监视的工具，那么许多其他软件产品将提供雇主可以使用的类似监视形式，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> &#34;It was sold as a really exciting product for employers, that you could check what your workers are doing. That sets alarm bells off to me. What is says is that workers don&#39;t have a seat at the table when these issues are being discussed, either by big software companies or inside businesses, and that we need to get a better understanding of what the power of these tools are.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;对于雇主来说，这是一个非常令人兴奋的产品，您可以检查一下您的工人在做什么。那给我敲响了警钟。这就是说，在大型软件公司或企业内部讨论这些问题时，工人没有坐下来的位子，我们需要更好地了解这些工具的作用是什么。＆＃34; </p><p>  Both employers and employees agree that remote working, or at the very least a combination of both at-home and office-based working, is going to form the foundations of the post-COVID work economy. It stands to reason, then, that more organizations will be looking for tools that can make this sustainable in the long-term, by leveraging the kind of insights that can be enabled by analytics and reporting capabilities – particularly if it offers to fix problems that the rushed approach to remote working has created.</p><p>雇主和雇员都同意，远程工作，或者至少是在家工作和办公室工作的结合，将构成COVID后工作经济的基础。因此，有理由推论，更多的组织将寻求利用可以通过分析和报告功能实现的洞察力来长期实现这一目标的工具，尤其是当它提供解决问题的能力时匆忙进行远程工作的方法已经创建。</p><p> &#34;What businesses want to know right now is really two things. One: what are the employees working on when they are working from home? And two: trying to bring back that level of security that they had in an office environment,&#34; says Eli Sutton, VP of operations at Teramind.</p><p> ＆＃34;企业现在想知道的实际上是两件事。一：在家工作时员工在做什么？还有两个：试图恢复他们在办公环境中的安全级别，＆＃34; Teramind运营副总裁Eli Sutton说。</p><p> Teramind&#39;s software offers a combination of user productivity monitoring, data loss and threat detection tools for employers who need deeper insight into workplace activity. The company has customers throughout the healthcare, legal, automotive, energy, government and financial industries.</p><p> Teramind的软件为需要更深入地了解工作场所活动的雇主提供了用户生产力监控，数据丢失和威胁检测工具的组合。该公司在医疗保健，法律，汽车，能源，政府和金融行业拥有客户。</p><p>    Sutton says the software ensures that workers are using company time properly. Teramind can track which websites employees visit and for how long; live-stream and record workers&#39; desktop sessions, monitor employee keystrokes and read the contents of their email, along with any attachments.</p><p>    萨顿说，该软件可确保工人正确利用公司时间。 Teramind可以跟踪员工访问哪些网站以及访问了多长时间。直播和记录工作者桌面会话，监控员工的击键并阅读其电子邮件内容以及所有附件。</p><p> The purpose of the software is two-fold: keeping track of productivity and performance, as well as protecting businesses from any harm they could be exposed to as a result of data leaks, fraud or, in the case of banking and finance, insider trading.</p><p> 该软件的目的有两个：跟踪生产力和性能，以及保护企业免受由于数据泄漏，欺诈或内部交易而可能遭受的任何伤害。 。</p><p> &#34;Typically our customers in the financial sector use the solution on the security side of things: making sure that users who have access to their data don&#39;t either accidentally or maliciously leak information that could cause financial harm or harm to their credibility,&#34; says Sutton.</p><p> 通常，我们在金融部门的客户会在安全性方面使用该解决方案：确保有权访问其数据的用户不会意外或恶意泄漏可能对财务造成损害或损害的信息。他们的信誉，＆＃34;萨顿说。</p><p> &#34;On the productivity side, it&#39;s essentially monitoring of websites and applications. From there, you can drill down and see exactly how much time they spend on either these websites or applications, if there are websites or applications that don&#39;t necessarily fit within their company tasks, and how much time was spent on those.&#34;</p><p> 在生产率方面，它实际上是对网站和应用程序的监视。从那里，您可以深入查看并确切查看他们在这些网站或应用程序上花费了多少时间，如果有网站或应用程序不一定适合其公司任务，以及在这些任务上花费了多少时间。 ＆＃34; </p><p> Sutton explains that features can be enabled or disabled based on what customers want from the software. He also suggests that, for the most part, organizations aren&#39;t using Teramind&#39;s to micromanage employees or call them out for spending too much time on YouTube (although this is something the software can flag).</p><p>Sutton解释说，可以根据客户对软件的需求来启用或禁用功能。他还建议，在大多数情况下，组织不会使用Teramind来对员工进行微观管理，也不会因为在YouTube上花费过多时间而将他们召唤出来（尽管软件可以标记出这些东西）。</p><p> &#34;The only time it really comes to discussion is if somebody&#39;s really abusing company policy. For the most part, it&#39;s more about making sure the user has all the resources necessary, especially during the work-from-home environment,&#34; he says.</p><p> 真正要讨论的唯一时间是，是否有人真的在滥用公司政策。在大多数情况下，更多的是确保用户拥有所有必要的资源，尤其是在在家工作的环境中。他说。</p><p> &#34;We&#39;ve found that, for many of our customers, they&#39;ve discovered that particular users were taking longer to complete certain tasks. Through the solution, they found that it was because they were lacking the essential tools while working at home to complete these tasks.&#34;</p><p> 我们发现，对于我们的许多客户而言，他们发现特定用户花费更长的时间来完成某些任务。通过该解决方案，他们发现这是因为他们在家中完成这些任务时缺少必要的工具。</p><p> Whatever your take on the technology is, there is clearly an appetite for it. According to Sutton, Teramind has seen business increase three-fold since the start of the pandemic.</p><p> 无论您对技术采取什么态度，显然都有胃口。根据萨顿的说法，自大流行开始以来，Teramind的业务增长了三倍。</p><p> &#34;Even today, with talks of vaccinations and talk of people going back to work, we&#39;re still seeing an increase,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;即使在今天，关于疫苗接种的话题和人们重新上班的话题，我们仍然看到增长，＆＃34;他说。</p><p>  The fact that a large chunk of the professional workforce is now working from home adds another degree of complexity to the debate around remote monitoring software.</p><p>  现在，一大批专业劳动力正在在家工作，这一事实为围绕远程监控软件的争论增加了另一种复杂程度。</p><p> In December, the European Parliament voted in support of granting digital workers in Europe  a fundamental &#39;right to disconnect&#39; from work-related tasks outside of working hours, without facing consequences from their employers.</p><p> 12月，欧洲议会投票支持授予欧洲数字工作者基本的“断开连接权”。在工作时间以外的时间从事与工作有关的任务，而不必面对雇主的后果。 </p><p> In January, MEPs called for this to be enshrined into EU law, saying it was crucial for preventing burnout among workers in a culture that pressured them to be always on – an issue that has undoubtedly been exacerbated by the pivot to working from home.</p><p>1月份，MEPS呼吁将此载入欧盟法律，说这对防止迫使他们的工人的倦怠是至关重要的至关重要的 - 这一问题无疑被枢轴加剧了家庭。</p><p> Pakes argues that the rise of remote monitoring tools, particularly as they move into the home, would make it even harder for workers to disengage from work &#34;This creeping boundary of what is our home life and our right to a private life, I think, is going to be one of the great challenges of this decade,&#34; he says.</p><p> 令人争论认为远程监控工具的兴起，特别是在进入家中，甚至更加努力地从工作中脱离工作和＃34;这种匍匐边界是我们家庭生活和我们私生活的权利，我想，将成为这十年的巨大挑战之一，＃34;他说。</p><p> &#34;This is a fundamental change, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve got to ensure that we&#39;re using the rights that we&#39;ve got, but we also have an embracing conversation about, what does it look like for the future?&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这是一个基本的变化，而且为什么我们＆＃39; ve必须确保我们使用我们＆＃39; ve get的权利，但我们也有一个拥抱对话，这对未来看起来像什么？＆＃34;</p><p> Kiri Addison, head of data science for threat intelligence and overwatch at Mimecast, suggests that more invasive forms of remote monitoring and surveillance software risks eroding trust between employer and employee.</p><p> 威胁情报和Mimecast矫枉过正的数据科学负责人Kiri Addison表明，更多的侵入形式的远程监控和监控软件风险侵蚀雇主和员工之间的信任。</p><p>  &#34;Personally, I think to go to those extremes is probably more damaging for the relationship between the employer and the company,&#34; she tells ZDNet.</p><p>  ＆＃34;个人，我认为对那些极端的人对雇主和公司之间的关系可能更加破坏，＆＃34;她告诉Zdnet。</p><p> &#34;There are cases where, particular employees see it then as a game, they&#39;re trying to get around the monitoring software, and you&#39;re introducing security risks. It&#39;s not a good dynamic, the relationship between the company and the employee, if they see the company as an enemy or someone they have to &#39;beat&#39;.</p><p> ＆＃34;有案例在哪里，特定员工将其视为游戏，他们尝试绕过监控软件，以及＆＃39;重新引入安全风险。它不是一个不错的动态，公司与员工之间的关系，如果他们认为公司作为敌人或他们必须＆＃39;击败＆＃39;</p><p> Gartner analyst Whit Andrews shares a similar view, adding that workers may view monitoring attempts as  a breach of the &#34;social contract&#34; between employer and employee.</p><p> Gartner Analyst Whit Andrews分享了类似的看法，并补充说，工人可以将监测尝试视为违反＆＃34;社会合同＆＃34;雇主和雇员之间。 </p><p> &#34;It&#39;s unsurprising then that we&#39;re beginning to see that workers are not particularly pleased with increased capacity to monitor them,&#34; he tells ZDNet.</p><p>那么，我们开始发现工人对监视他们的能力增强并不特别满意，这不足为奇。他告诉ZDNet。</p><p> &#34;They&#39;re seriously concerned about this, and their reaction is understandably oriented towards evading the system... When you start talking about monitoring workers in their homes, I think that social contract becomes a little bit harder to defend.&#34;</p><p> 他们认真地关心这一点，他们的反应是可以逃避系统的。这是可以理解的。当您开始谈论监视家中的工人时，我认为社会契约变得更加难以捍卫。＆＃34;</p><p> ICO guidance makes clear that, in all but the most straightforward of cases, employers should perform a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) to decide if and how to carry out monitoring, and whether monitoring is justified to begin with.</p><p> ICO指南明确指出，除了最直接的情况外，雇主应执行数据保护影响评估（DPIA），以决定是否以及如何进行监控，以及是否有理由进行监控。</p><p> A DPIA can help organizations identify and minimize any risks associated with projects that include processing personal data, particularly those that could pose a high risk to individuals, and are something that Pearce always recommends to clients that are thinking about going down the monitoring avenue.</p><p> DPIA可以帮助组织识别和最小化与包括处理个人数据在内的项目相关的任何风险，尤其是那些可能对个人造成高风险的风险，而Pearce始终向考虑考虑采用这种监控方式的客户建议这些。</p><p> &#34;A DPIA really is an assessment, evaluation, and in-depth analysis of what you are anticipating doing: what are your reasons, what are your anticipations, and then equally, what is the impact on the individuals? That has to be very in-depth,&#34; she says.</p><p> ＆＃34; DPIA实际上是对您预期所做的事情的评估，评估和深入分析：您的原因是什么，您的预期是什么，然后同样对个人有什么影响？这必须非常深入，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> &#34;The ICO has a template standard form. It&#39;s not a requirement that you follow it in that way, but it does set out some suggestions of what you might want to include in a DPIA. Any company looking to do that would be well-advised to have a look at that.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34; ICO具有模板标准格式。您不必以这种方式遵循它，但是它确实提出了一些您可能希望包含在DPIA中的建议。任何希望这样做的公司都建议您仔细考虑一下。＆＃34;</p><p>  Of course, with many organizations having been forced to move to cloud-based working almost overnight, businesses have been left with little time to draw up new technology blueprints for the months and years ahead.</p><p>  当然，由于许多组织不得不在一夜之间转移到基于云的工作，因此企业在接下来的几个月和几年中几乎没有时间来草拟新技术蓝图。 </p><p> Reports have suggested that some organizations have had to bring forward their digital transformation plans by as many as five years, and that guidance could be slow to catch up.</p><p>报告表明，一些组织不得不将他们的数字化转型计划提出长达五年之久，而该指南可能会很慢地赶上。</p><p>    Last month, Labour shadow digital minister, Chi Onwurah, warned that &#34;guidance and regulation to protect workers are woefully outdated in light of the accelerated move to remote working and rapid advancements in technology,&#34; and called on ministers to provide better regulatory oversight of online surveillance software to ensure people have the right to privacy whether in their workplace or home, &#34;which are increasingly one and the same.&#34;</p><p>    上个月，劳工影子数字部长Chi Onwurah警告说，鉴于向远程工作的加速迁移和技术的迅猛发展，保护工人的指导和法规已经过时了。并呼吁部长们对在线监视软件进行更好的监管，以确保人们无论在工作场所还​​是家中，都拥有隐私权，而这种隐私越来越多。</p><p> Speaking to ZDNet, Onwurah says that neither the Government nor the ICO have responded to this dramatic change in our working lives, leaving far too many subject to exploitative practices.</p><p> Onwurah在对ZDNet的讲话中说，政府和ICO都没有对我们工作生活中的这一急剧变化做出反应，这使得太多人遭受剥削。</p><p> &#34;There is a woeful lack of protection for workers as they bring their work home in this pandemic, and they are also increasingly being subject to unacceptable levels of digital surveillance without their informed consent,&#34; she warns.</p><p> ＆＃34;在这种大流行中，工人将工作带回家的过程中，严重缺乏保护，并且，未经知情同意，他们也越来越受到无法接受的数字监视，＆＃34;她警告。</p><p> An ICO spokesperson told ZDNet that the organization was in the early stages of developing new employer-focused guidance, though didn&#39;t specify whether this would contain provisions for the use of remote monitoring and surveillance software.</p><p> ICO发言人告诉ZDNet，该组织处于制定以雇主为中心的新指南的初期阶段，尽管未指定该指南是否包含使用远程监控软件的规定。</p><p> &#34;As this work develops, we will be engaging with organizations and seeking their views,&#34; the spokesperson said.</p><p> ＆＃34;随着这项工作的发展，我们将与组织合作并征求他们的意见，＆＃34;发言人说。</p><p> Pakes worries that too much of the ICO guidance is focused on employers, rather than workers themselves. &#34;Yes, the ICO has a role to provide advice to employers, but it also has a role to provide it to workers,&#34; he says.</p><p> 派克斯担心，太多的ICO指南侧重于雇主，而不是工人本身。 ＆＃34;是的，ICO的作用是向雇主提供建议，但也有作用向工人提供建议，＆＃34;他说。 </p><p> &#34;The ICO never says we&#39;re going to provide clear guidance for workers so that you can see your rights. They only talk about guidance for employers, and I think we&#39;ve got to redress that balance.&#34;</p><p>ICO从未说过我们不会为工人提供明确的指导，以便您可以看到自己的权利。他们只谈论对雇主的指导，我认为我们必须纠正这种平衡。</p><p>  Clearly, there is a balance to strike in making remote working sustainable for businesses in the long term, while respecting the rights of employees and ensuring that their homes remain safe havens from the demands of work.</p><p>  显然，要在长期内使企业实现远程工作可持续发展，同时又要尊重员工的权利，并确保员工的家园成为避开工作要求的避风港，就需要权衡取舍。</p><p> Employers will undoubtedly need more visibility over staff who are working on home networks that may be less secure than corporate ones, particularly if they&#39;re regularly dealing with valuable data. But what degree of monitoring this requires – or is perhaps necessary – is another question.</p><p> 对于在家庭网络上工作的员工来说，雇主无疑将需要更高的可视性，这些员工的安全性可能不如企业网络，尤其是当他们定期处理有价值的数据时。但是，这需要或可能必要的监视程度是另一个问题。</p><p> You could argue that employers who are doing the work they&#39;re meant to have nothing to worry about. But the issue doesn&#39;t seem to be in employers having tools to catch workers not doing their jobs, but what it means for trust, transparency and fairness in working environments increasingly governed by analytics.</p><p> 您可能会争辩说，正在从事他们本该工作的雇主不必担心。但是问题似乎并不在于雇主拥有工具来抓捕未从事工作的工人，而是在越来越多的分析方法所控制的工作环境中，对信任，透明和公平意味着什么。</p><p> Employees have already proven that they can be trusted to work from home and still be productive. Is remote monitoring software needed to ensure it stays that way?</p><p> 员工已经证明他们可以信任在家工作，并且仍然可以保持生产力。是否需要远程监控软件来确保保持这种状态？</p><p> &#34;We&#39;ve long argued that workers should have flexibility. What we want to avoid is a return to presenteeism, where people are told they have to be in the office when they don&#39;t,&#34; says Pakes.</p><p> 我们长期以来一直主张工人应该具有灵活性。我们要避免的是重返Presentism，在这种情况下，人们被告知当他们不上班时必须在办公室里。帕克斯说。</p><p> &#34;We&#39;ve inverted our economic model over the past year and we&#39;ve proved that many of us can work safely and securely and productively from home.</p><p> 在过去的一年中，我们改变了经济模式，并证明我们中的许多人可以在家中安全，高效地工作。 </p><p> &#34;If we&#39;re going to be using digital technology to create a kind of national framework for the future of work, we&#39;ve got to ensure that we are amplifying the benefits and having serious conversations about minimizing the risks. And surveillance is one of them.&#34;</p><p>如果我们要使用数字技术来为未来的工作创建一种国家框架，我们必须确保我们正在扩大收益，并进行认真的对话以最大程度地减少工作量。 风险。 监视就是其中之一。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-bosses-are-using-software-to-monitor-remote-workers-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it/">https://www.zdnet.com/article/more-bosses-are-using-software-to-monitor-remote-workers-not-everyone-is-happy-about-it/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/远程工作/">#远程工作</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/远程/">#远程</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/working/">#working</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
