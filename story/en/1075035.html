Putin of Russia in Moscow on Thursday during a long-planned visit that began hours before Russian forces attacked Ukraine.</p><p>巴基斯坦总理伊姆兰·汗定于周四在莫斯科会见俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京，这是一次计划已久的访问，在俄罗斯军队袭击乌克兰数小时前开始。</p><p> Mr. Khan intended to push for a multibillion-dollar gas pipeline to be built by Pakistani and Russian companies, according to news media reports in Pakistan.</p><p>据巴基斯坦新闻媒体报道，汗打算推动巴基斯坦和俄罗斯公司建造一条价值数十亿美元的天然气管道。</p><p> And while some commentators called the visit ill-timed and said it would be cut short, Pakistan’s information minister  said on Twitter that it would proceed as planned, with Mr. Khan returning to Pakistan later Thursday.</p><p>虽然一些评论员称这次访问不合时宜，并表示将缩短访问时间，但巴基斯坦新闻部长在推特上表示，访问将按计划进行，汗将于周四晚些时候返回巴基斯坦。</p><p> Gas is a crucial export for Russia, and Germany on Monday halted certification of the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline linking the country to Russia in response to the Kremlin’s recognition of two separatist regions in Ukraine. That could potentially increase the importance of other outlets for Russian gas.</p><p>天然气是俄罗斯的关键出口，德国周一暂停了连接该国与俄罗斯的Nord Stream 2管道的认证，以回应克里姆林宫承认乌克兰的两个分裂地区。这可能会增加其他俄罗斯天然气出口的重要性。</p><p> Mr. Khan, in an  interview broadcast on Tuesday, avoided criticizing Moscow’s policy in Ukraine and said he hoped the crisis could be resolved peacefully.</p><p>在周二播出的一次采访中，汗避免批评莫斯科在乌克兰的政策，并表示希望危机能够和平解决。</p><p> “What we want to do is not become part of any bloc,” he said in the interview, given with the Russian news media courtesy of the Moscow-controlled broadcaster RT. “We want to have trading relations with all countries.”</p><p>“我们不想成为任何集团的一部分，”他在接受俄罗斯新闻媒体采访时说，“我们想与所有国家建立贸易关系。”</p><p>  The U.S. State Department said that it was aware of Mr. Khan’s visit and that it hoped Pakistan, like all countries, would voice objection to Mr. Putin’s action in Ukraine, especially given the longstanding partnership between Islamabad and Washington.</p><p>美国国务院表示，它知道汗的访问，并希望巴基斯坦和所有国家一样，对普京在乌克兰的行动表示反对，特别是考虑到伊斯兰堡和华盛顿之间的长期伙伴关系。</p><p> Ned Price, a  State Department spokesman, said at a briefing on Wednesday that Washington hoped “every country around the world would make that point clearly in unambiguous language in their engagements with the Russian Federation.”</p><p>美国国务院发言人内德·普莱斯在周三的一次简报会上说，华盛顿希望“世界上每个国家在与俄罗斯联邦的交往中都能用明确的语言表达这一点。”</p><p> In Moscow, Mr. Khan laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a war memorial dedicated to Soviet troops who died in World War II, according to The Associated Press of Pakistan, which said it was the first visit by a Pakistani leader to Moscow in two decades.</p><p>据巴基斯坦美联社报道，在莫斯科，汗向无名士兵墓敬献了花圈。无名士兵墓是一座战争纪念碑，纪念在二战中牺牲的苏联军队。美联社称，这是巴基斯坦领导人20年来首次访问莫斯科。</p><p>      SLOVYANSK, Ukraine — The eastern Ukraine city of Slovyansk was the site of fierce fighting in 2014 when war broke out between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed rebels. But while many are now expressing anger at Russia for bringing war into their lives, not everyone believes that President Vladimir V. Putin was at fault.</p><p>乌克兰斯洛文尼亚斯克——2014年，乌克兰军队与俄罗斯支持的叛军爆发战争，乌克兰东部城市斯洛文尼亚斯克曾是激烈战斗的地点。但是，尽管许多人现在对俄罗斯将战争带入他们的生活表示愤怒，但并不是所有人都认为弗拉基米尔·V·普京总统有错。</p><p> “It’s our scoundrels in Ukraine who listen to NATO and the Pentagon, which are pushing them into war,” said Lyubov Vasilyevna, 75, who would give only her first name and patronymic.</p><p>75岁的柳波夫·瓦西里耶夫纳说：“是我们乌克兰的无赖在听北约和五角大楼的话，他们正把他们推向战争。”她只透露了自己的名字和赞助人。</p><p> While she waited to withdraw money from an apparently empty A.T.M., she showed a sack filled with loaves of bread she had just purchased.</p><p>当她在一个似乎空无一人的自动取款机上等待取款时，她拿出一个装满她刚买的面包的袋子。</p><p> A native of Donbas, the eastern region of Ukraine, she said all she wanted was to live in peace, reciting a poem she wrote two years ago:</p><p>她是乌克兰东部地区顿巴斯的本地人，她说她只想和平生活，背诵了两年前她写的一首诗：</p><p> I am so looking forward to peace, But it is coming to us so slowly. We still have а little patience. Peace is close at hand And we are waiting for it to arrive  Without gunfire, with blood.  Enough has been spilled in Donbas.  Let the sun smile and the sky brighten  And the children smile.  Let it go in black moment.  There will be peace for all  And people will say God heard us.  Let all stormy skies leave us,  And hail Donbas and the city of Slovyansk.</p><p>我非常期待和平，但和平来得太慢了。我们仍然没有耐心。和平就在眼前，我们正在等待它的到来，没有枪声，没有流血。顿巴斯已经撒了足够多的水。让太阳微笑，让天空明亮，让孩子们微笑。让它在黑暗中消失吧。所有人都会得到和平，人们会说上帝听到了我们。让暴风雨的天空离开我们，向顿巴斯和斯洛文尼亚城致敬。</p><p>    Israel issued a condemnation of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after initially sidestepping direct criticism to avoid antagonizing a key military power in the Middle East.</p><p>以色列在最初回避直接批评以避免对抗中东主要军事力量后，谴责俄罗斯入侵乌克兰。</p><p> Following two days of more equivocal statements from Israeli officials, the Israeli Foreign Minister, Yair Lapid, said in a statement Thursday afternoon that “the Russian attack on Ukraine is a serious violation of the international order. Israel condemns the attack, and is ready and prepared to provide humanitarian assistance to the citizens of Ukraine.”</p><p>在以色列官员发表了两天更加模棱两可的声明之后，以色列外交部长亚尔·拉皮德，在周四下午的一份声明中说，“俄罗斯对乌克兰的袭击严重违反了国际秩序。以色列谴责这次袭击，并准备向乌克兰公民提供人道主义援助。”</p><p> Mr. Lapid’s statement took care to note Israel’s “deep, long-lasting, and good relations with Russia and with Ukraine,” but it nevertheless broke with his ministry’s previous line.</p><p>拉皮德的声明谨慎地注意到以色列“与俄罗斯和乌克兰有着深厚、持久和良好的关系”，但它仍与以色列外交部之前的立场相悖。</p><p> In an earlier  statement on Thursday, the Foreign Ministry simply noted that the conflict had entered “a new and difficult stage” and told Israel’s estimated 8,000 citizens in Ukraine to leave via land crossings in the country’s west. The ministry had avoided even mentioning Russia in a  statement on Wednesday, saying only that “Israel supports the territorial integrity and the sovereignty of Ukraine.”</p><p>在周四早些时候的一份声明中，外交部只是指出，冲突已进入“一个新的、困难的阶段”，并告诉在乌克兰的约8000名以色列公民通过该国西部的陆路过境点离开。外交部在周三的一份声明中甚至避免提及俄罗斯，只表示“以色列支持乌克兰的领土完整和主权”</p><p> Israel is a key ally of the United States and has received more American aid since World War II than any other country. But Israel is wary of angering Russia, which has a large military presence in Syria, Israel’s northeastern neighbor and enemy.</p><p>以色列是美国的重要盟友，自第二次世界大战以来获得的美国援助比任何其他国家都多。但以色列担心激怒俄罗斯，因为俄罗斯在叙利亚有大量军事存在，叙利亚是以色列东北部的邻国和敌人。</p><p> The Israeli Air Force frequently strikes Iranian and Syrian military targets in Syria, and needs Russia’s tacit blessing to continue that campaign. Iran uses Syria to funnel weapons and aid to Hezbollah, a militant group that dominates southern Lebanon and is opposed to Israel.</p><p>以色列空军经常袭击伊朗和叙利亚在叙利亚的军事目标，需要俄罗斯的默许才能继续这一行动。伊朗利用叙利亚向真主党输送武器和援助，真主党是一个控制黎巴嫩南部、反对以色列的激进组织。</p><p> Hundreds of thousands of Jews live in Russia  and Ukraine, and Mr. Lapid said that his staff would assist any Jew affected by the war.</p><p>数十万犹太人生活在俄罗斯和乌克兰，拉皮德说，他的工作人员将帮助任何受战争影响的犹太人。</p><p> BRUSSELS — When President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia moved to recognize the separatist Ukrainian enclaves of Donetsk and Luhansk on Monday, the European Union won accolades for quickly and decisively moving to impose sanctions on people in his inner circle.</p><p>布鲁塞尔——当俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京周一采取行动承认乌克兰分离主义飞地顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克时，欧盟因迅速果断地对其核心圈子的人实施制裁而赢得赞誉。</p><p> Leaders in the bloc also warned that a larger package was being readied in case Mr. Putin decided to invade. And diplomats on Wednesday expressed hope that the mere threat of that second package, which they called a “Damocles sword,” would act as a deterrent.</p><p>欧盟领导人还警告称，正在准备一个更大的方案，以防普京决定入侵。外交官们在周三表示，希望仅仅是第二个方案的威胁——他们称之为“达摩克利斯之剑”——就能起到威慑作用。</p><p> But as Russian troops launched an invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, it became painfully clear that they had badly miscalculated.</p><p>但是，随着俄罗斯军队在周四对乌克兰发动入侵，令人痛苦的是，他们显然严重误判了。</p><p> E.U. leaders will therefore flock to Brussels on Thursday evening for an emergency summit that will seek to quickly approve the second round of sanctions, although finding compromise without appearing to dither in the face of a once-in-a-generation conflict will be hard.</p><p>因此，欧盟领导人将于周四晚上蜂拥到布鲁塞尔参加紧急峰会，寻求迅速批准第二轮制裁，尽管在一代人中只有一次的冲突面前，在不显得犹豫不决的情况下找到妥协是很困难的。</p><p> Until the invasion, European diplomats directly involved in the talks over sanctions presented a much less united picture of the European Union, whose dependence on Russian gas is just one of the ways it is limited in truly punishing Moscow without crippling its own economies.</p><p>在入侵之前，直接参与制裁谈判的欧洲外交官对欧盟的看法就不那么一致了，欧盟对俄罗斯天然气的依赖只是它在真正惩罚莫斯科而不损害自身经济方面受到限制的方式之一。</p><p> Diplomats said that several E.U. members were concerned about other sectors of Russia’s economy that could be penalized. Austria, Germany and Italy raised concerns about imposing broad sanctions on cross-border financial transactions and banking operations. And Italy was pushing to leave the luxury goods industry untouched so that it could continue exporting fashion and other high-end products to Russia.</p><p>外交官们说，一些欧盟成员国担心俄罗斯经济中可能受到惩罚的其他部门。奥地利、德国和意大利对对跨境金融交易和银行业务实施广泛制裁表示担忧。意大利正在推动奢侈品行业不受影响，以便继续向俄罗斯出口时装和其他高端产品。</p><p> “Going further than Wednesday’s sanctions could prove a big problem for Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the managing director for Europe with the Eurasia Group consulting firm, referring to Italy’s multifaceted dependence on Russia.</p><p>欧亚集团咨询公司（Eurasia Group consulting Company）负责欧洲事务的董事总经理穆伊塔巴·拉赫曼（Mujtaba Rahman）表示：“对意大利总理马里奥·德拉吉来说，制裁的力度可能会超过周三，这将是一个大问题。”拉赫曼指的是意大利对俄罗斯的多方面依赖。</p><p> Belgium was seeking an exemption for its large diamond sector, and no E.U. countries were seriously advocating sanctions on Russia’s vital energy sector.</p><p>比利时正在寻求对其大型钻石部门的豁免，没有哪个欧盟国家认真主张对俄罗斯的重要能源部门实施制裁。</p><p> The European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, has been working on the sanctions package for months, which partly explains why the first set of penalties this week was approved so swiftly. But there are no guarantees that the same will be the case with the second one on Thursday.</p><p>欧盟的执行机构欧盟委员会（European Commission）数月来一直在制定制裁方案，这在一定程度上解释了为何本周第一套惩罚措施如此迅速地获得批准。但不能保证周四的第二场也会如此。</p><p> Josep Borrell Fontelles, the E.U.’s top diplomat, said on Thursday morning that the bloc was set to adopt “the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented.” The proof will be in the doing.</p><p>欧盟最高外交官乔塞普·博雷尔·丰泰尔斯（Josep Borrell Fontelles）周四上午表示，欧盟将采取“我们实施过的最严厉的一揽子制裁措施”证据就在行动中。</p><p>  Russian troops reached the outskirts of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, and set up checkpoints on a main road on Thursday morning, according to videos posted to the messaging service Telegram. It appeared to be the farthest Russian troops had been seen penetrating into Ukraine.</p><p>根据消息服务电报上发布的视频，俄罗斯军队于周四上午抵达乌克兰第二大城市哈尔科夫郊区，并在一条主要道路上设置了检查站。这似乎是俄罗斯军队进入乌克兰最远的一次。</p><p> SLOVYANSK, Ukraine — There were runs on banks, runs on gas stations, and some people were just running Thursday, as panic set in here in eastern Ukraine, just a few dozen miles from where Russian troops were reportedly engaged in a fierce firefight with the Ukrainian military.</p><p>乌克兰斯洛文尼亚斯克——周四，银行挤兑，加油站挤兑，一些人刚刚开始跑步，乌克兰东部的恐慌在这里开始，据报道，距离俄罗斯军队与乌克兰军队发生激烈交火的地方只有几十英里。</p><p> “It’s panic, don’t you see?” said Yevheni Balai, pointing to a line of anxious Ukrainians standing outside a closed bank, desperate to take out cash.</p><p>“这是恐慌，你不明白吗？”耶夫赫尼·巴拉伊指着一排焦急的乌克兰人说，他们站在一家关闭的银行外，不顾一切地想取出现金。</p><p> “They’ve gotten exactly what they wanted, the ones on the other side, panic and destabilization,” Mr. Balai said, refusing to mention the word Russia or the name of President Vladimir V. Putin, whom he referred to as “that person.”</p><p>“他们得到了他们想要的东西，另一边的人，恐慌和不稳定，”巴拉伊说，拒绝提及俄罗斯这个词或弗拉基米尔·V·普京总统的名字，他称他为“那个人”</p><p>  At a base for Ukraine’s National Guard, troops in drab green uniforms raced to and fro, seemingly uncertain of what it was they were supposed to be doing. Wives and girlfriends had come to say goodbye to soldiers, who acknowledged that they did not quite know where they were being ordered to go.</p><p>在乌克兰国民警卫队的一个基地，身穿灰绿色制服的部队来来往往，似乎不确定他们应该做什么。妻子和女朋友们前来向士兵们告别，士兵们承认他们不太清楚被命令去哪里。</p><p> A National Guard soldier named Yevheni, who would not give his last name, listed cities nearby in eastern Ukraine where he said the Russian flag was already flying.</p><p>一名名叫耶夫赫尼的国民警卫队士兵列出了乌克兰东部附近的城市，他说俄罗斯国旗已经飘扬在那里。耶夫赫尼不愿透露自己的姓氏。</p><p> “It’s not good, I’ll tell you,” he said, adding that he had been fighting against Russia-backed separatists in breakaway enclaves of eastern Ukraine since the war broke out in 2014.</p><p>“我告诉你，这不好，”他说，并补充说，自2014年战争爆发以来，他一直在乌克兰东部分离飞地打击俄罗斯支持的分离主义分子。</p><p> His wife, Yelena, came to deliver clothes from the couple’s home village of Bakhmut about 40 minutes’ drive further east.</p><p>他的妻子叶琳娜从这对夫妇的家乡巴克穆特（Bakhmut）向东开车约40分钟来送衣服。</p><p> “They told us to not come to work; all the kindergartens are closed; but right now everything is quiet,” she said. “They said they are preparing for evacuation.”</p><p>“他们告诉我们不要来上班；所有的幼儿园都关门了；但现在一切都很安静，”她说。“他们说他们正在准备撤离。”</p><p>         Even with the tons of weapons, ammunition and equipment delivered to Ukraine by Western allies in just the last few weeks, the Ukrainian military is outgunned by the larger, more technologically advanced Russian forces that have launched a multipronged invasion.</p><p>即使西方盟国在过去几周内向乌克兰运送了数以吨计的武器、弹药和设备，乌克兰军队仍被规模更大、技术更先进的俄罗斯军队所击败，后者发起了一场多管齐下的入侵。</p><p> Back in December, the commander of Ukraine’s military intelligence service, Gen. Kyrylo O. Budanov, outlined a scenario in which a Russian invasion would begin with airstrikes and rocket attacks aimed at ammunition depots and trench-bound troops — foreshadowing the attack that came early Thursday morning.</p><p>早在去年12月，乌克兰军事情报局指挥官基里洛·布达诺夫上将就概述了一种情况，即俄罗斯的入侵将以空袭和火箭弹袭击开始，目标是弹药库和战壕部队——这预示着周四凌晨发生的袭击。</p><p> Very quickly, he said, the Ukrainian military would be incapacitated, its leadership unable to coordinate a defense and supply the front. After that, he said, responsibility would fall to frontline commanders to carry on the fight alone.</p><p>他说，乌克兰军队很快就会丧失能力，其领导层无法协调防御和前线补给。他说，在那之后，责任将落在前线指挥官身上，由他们独自进行战斗。</p><p> “They will hold up as long as there are bullets,” General Budanov said in an interview. “They’ll be able to use what they have in their hands, but believe me, without delivery of reserves, there’s not an army in the world that can hold out.”</p><p>“只要有子弹，他们就能撑得住，”布达诺夫将军在接受采访时说。“他们将能够利用手中的一切，但相信我，没有储备，世界上就没有一支军队能够坚持下去。”</p><p> General Budanov spoke at a time when the Russian military had deployed about 100,000 troops to the region. By the time of the invasion, according to U.S. officials, Russia had amassed an estimated 190,000 troops in or near Ukraine, including in Crimea and in Russia-backed separatist areas in the eastern Donbas region.</p><p>布达诺夫将军发表讲话时，俄罗斯军方已经向该地区部署了大约10万名士兵。据美国官员称，到入侵时，俄罗斯在乌克兰境内或附近集结了约19万军队，包括在克里米亚和俄罗斯支持的顿巴斯东部地区的分离主义地区。</p><p> In recent weeks, the Russian military also deployed advanced S-400 antiaircraft systems that could effectively neutralize Ukraine’s small air force, as well as Iskander-M cruise missiles capable of striking targets just about anywhere in Ukraine.</p><p>最近几周，俄罗斯军方还部署了先进的S-400防空系统，可以有效地压制乌克兰的小型空军，以及伊斯坎德尔-M巡航导弹，能够打击乌克兰任何地方的目标。</p><p> The Russian force includes 120 to 125 battalion tactical groups, up from the mid-80s earlier in the month, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the American intelligence assessment. Some of the forces are Russian reservists who would make up an occupation force after an invasion, the officials said. The officials asked for anonymity to discuss government assessments.</p><p>据两名熟悉美国情报评估的美国官员透露，俄军包括120至125个营战术小组，高于本月早些时候的80年代中期。官员们说，其中一些部队是俄罗斯预备役军人，他们将在入侵后组成占领军。官员们要求匿名讨论政府评估。</p><p> Ukraine has only slightly more enlisted soldiers and officers in its entire military, according to the Ministry of Defense. The roughly 200 aircraft that comprise Ukraine’s entire air force are fewer than the number of fighter planes that Russia has deployed already to the Ukrainian border.</p><p>据国防部称，乌克兰全军士兵和军官人数仅略多。构成乌克兰整个空军的大约200架飞机，比俄罗斯已经部署到乌克兰边境的战斗机数量还少。</p><p> But Ukraine’s military is not the pushover it once was. In 2014, elite Russia troops were able to seize the entire Crimean Peninsula in southern Ukraine without firing a shot. When Russian-backed separatists then took over part of the Donbas, Ukraine had to rely on volunteer brigades of people who took up arms, with little or no military training.</p><p>但乌克兰的军事力量已不再是过去的强者。2014年，俄罗斯精锐部队能够在不开枪的情况下占领乌克兰南部的整个克里米亚半岛。当俄罗斯支持的分离主义者接管顿巴斯的部分地区时，乌克兰不得不依靠志愿军，他们拿起武器，几乎没有或根本没有接受过军事训练。</p><p> The Ukrainian military has since clawed its way back, fighting the separatists to a stalemate and putting a stop to the most serious hostilities. It did so with help from Western allies.</p><p>自那以后，乌克兰军方已经卷土重来，与分离主义分子的斗争陷入了僵局，并停止了最严重的敌对行动。它是在西方盟友的帮助下这样做的。</p><p> The United States alone has provided $2.5 billion in military assistance that has included high-tech surveillance and communications equipment and drones. In November, the United States delivered about 88 tons of ammunition, part of a $60 million military aid package pledged by the Biden administration.</p><p>仅美国一国就提供了25亿美元的军事援助，其中包括高科技监视和通信设备以及无人机。11月，美国交付了约88吨弹药，这是拜登政府承诺的6000万美元军事援助计划的一部分。</p><p>   ISTANBUL — Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara called for Turkey to close its airspace and to forbid passage through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits to warships.</p><p>伊斯坦布尔——乌克兰驻安卡拉大使呼吁土耳其关闭领空，禁止军舰通过博斯普鲁斯海峡和达达尼尔海峡。</p><p> The straits are the only way for ships to transit from the Black Sea, where Russia maintains a naval fleet, to the Mediterranean.</p><p>这些海峡是船只从黑海进入地中海的唯一途径。俄罗斯在黑海拥有一支海军舰队。</p><p> In a live televised news conference from the Ukrainian embassy in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, Ambassador Vasyl Bodnar said Ukraine had made an official request to the Turkish government. He also called for support from Turkey for sanctions against Russia, and for military and humanitarian assistance and help for Ukrainian citizens in Turkey.</p><p>在乌克兰驻土耳其首都安卡拉大使馆举行的电视直播新闻发布会上，大使瓦西尔·博德纳尔说，乌克兰已向土耳其政府提出正式请求。他还呼吁土耳其支持对俄罗斯的制裁，并为土耳其境内的乌克兰公民提供军事和人道主义援助和帮助。</p><p> “Right now all the masks are off,” he said. “Right now we are at war. We call all the world to take up and prevent that aggression. Today Ukraine is protecting your safety too.”</p><p>“现在所有的面具都被摘下了，”他说。“现在我们处于战争状态。我们呼吁全世界采取行动，防止这种侵略。今天乌克兰也在保护你们的安全。”</p><p> President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, who  visited Ukraine earlier this month, began a security meeting with senior security officials Thursday morning, the presidential palace announced in a statement.</p><p>总统府在一份声明中宣布，本月早些时候访问乌克兰的土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安周四上午开始与高级安全官员举行安全会议。</p><p> Turkey is a member of NATO but also maintains economic and military industry ties with Russia. The two countries are on opposing sides in two Middle Eastern wars, in  Syria and  Libya, and in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the South Caucasus.</p><p>土耳其是北约成员国，但也与俄罗斯保持着经济和军事工业联系。在叙利亚和利比亚的两场中东战争中，以及在南高加索地区阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚之间的冲突中，这两个国家站在对立的一边。</p><p>  Early Thursday, just as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced on television that he had decided “to carry out a special military operation” in Ukraine, explosions were reported across the country.</p><p>周四早些时候，正当俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京在电视上宣布他已决定在乌克兰“进行一次特别军事行动”时，全国各地都有爆炸报道。</p><p> Blasts were heard in Kyiv, the capital; in Kharkiv, the second largest city; and in Kramatorsk in the region of Donetsk, one of two eastern Ukrainian territories claimed by Russia-backed separatists since 2014.</p><p>首都基辅听到了爆炸声；第二大城市哈尔科夫；在顿涅茨克地区的克拉马托尔斯克，自2014年以来，俄罗斯支持的分离主义分子声称拥有乌克兰东部的两块领土之一。</p><p> Ukraine’s Interior Ministry said that Russian troops had landed in the southern port city of Odessa and were crossing from Russia into Kharkiv. Footage captured by security cameras showed Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine from Crimea, the peninsula that Russia seized in 2014.</p><p>乌克兰内政部表示，俄罗斯军队已在南部港口城市敖德萨登陆，正在从俄罗斯进入哈尔科夫。安全摄像头拍摄的画面显示，俄罗斯军车从克里米亚进入乌克兰，克里米亚是俄罗斯在2014年占领的半岛。</p><p> Rocket attacks targeted Ukrainian fighter jets parked at an airport outside Kyiv, and Ukraine closed its airspace to commercial flights, citing the “potential hazard to civilian aviation.”</p><p>火箭弹袭击的目标是停在基辅郊外机场的乌克兰战斗机，乌克兰以“对民用航空的潜在危险”为由关闭了其领空，禁止商业飞行</p><p> More than 40 Ukrainian soldiers were killed and dozens were wounded in the fighting on Thursday morning, said Oleksiy Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.</p><p>乌克兰总统沃洛蒂米尔·泽伦斯基的顾问奥列克西·阿雷斯托维奇说，周四上午的战斗中，40多名乌克兰士兵死亡，数十人受伤。</p><p> As air raid sirens blared in Kyiv, the western city of Lviv and other urban areas, residents rushed to take shelter in bus and subway stations. In Kyiv, people packed up their cars and waited in long lines to fill up with gas on their way out of the city. In eastern Ukraine, early signs of panic appeared on the streets as lines formed at A.T.M.s and gas stations.</p><p>在基辅、西部城市利沃夫和其他城市地区，空袭警报响起，居民们纷纷赶到公共汽车站和地铁站避难。在基辅，人们收拾好汽车，排起长队，在离开城市的路上加油。在乌克兰东部，当自动变速器和加油站排起长队时，街上出现了恐慌的早期迹象。</p><p> With attacks across the country, it quickly became clear that Russia’s campaign, whatever Mr. Putin meant by a “special military operation,” was aimed at far more than the rebel territories in the east. Within an hour, Ukraine’s state emergency service said that attacks had been launched in 10 regions of Ukraine, primarily in the east and south, and that reports of new shelling were “coming in constantly.”</p><p>随着全国各地的袭击，很快就可以清楚地看出，俄罗斯的行动——无论普京所说的“特别军事行动”——针对的对象远不止东部的叛军领土。不到一个小时，乌克兰国家应急服务机构表示，袭击已经在乌克兰的10个地区发动，主要是在东部和南部，新的炮击报告“不断传来”</p><p> Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, called it “a full-scale invasion of Ukraine” and said his country would defend itself, while calling on the world to “stop Putin.”</p><p>乌克兰外交部长德米特罗·库列巴称之为“对乌克兰的全面入侵”，并表示乌克兰将自卫，同时呼吁世界“阻止普京”</p><p> Russia’s Defense Ministry said that it was using “high-precision weapons” to disable military infrastructure, air defense facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian army planes, Russia’s state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. But the ministry said it was not attacking cities, and promised that “the civilian population is not at risk.”</p><p>据俄罗斯官方媒体俄新社报道，俄罗斯国防部表示，它正在使用“高精度武器”摧毁军事基础设施、防空设施、军用机场和乌克兰军用飞机。但该部表示，它没有攻击城市，并承诺“平民人口没有危险”</p><p> The Ukrainian authorities said that invading naval forces were coming ashore at multiple points, including in Kharkiv and the southern city of Kherson.
