This change allowed us to do a major code cleanup and migrate to some newer methods in different areas which are only available on Buster and above.\n Debian 9 \u201cStretch\u201d was released in 2017, and it has been initially superseded by Debian 10 \u201cBuster\u201d, and then Debian 11 \u201cBullseye\u201d.\n DietPi v7.9 was the last release with support for Debian Stretch.  DietPi v8.0 and later require Debian Buster or newer.\n Read our article   Why you should upgrade your Stretch system now to learn more about the need to make this upgrade and you could do this easily to Debian Buster and even further to latest version ( Debian Bullseye).\n  Network    For new images, the default DHCP timeout is not reduced to 10 seconds anymore. This could have been too short, in which case network targets of the boot sequence are reached before an IP has been actually assigned. Especially in case of  AUTO_SETUP_AUTOMATED=1 this could have lead to connection test timeouts and hence abortion of the automated first run setup. Many thanks to  @jpeg2600 for reporting such a case:  MichaIng/DietPi#5143\n DietPi-Config    When configuring a first WiFi slot via scanning for SSIDs, the WiFi adapter is now not brought up via  ifup but  ip l dev wlanX up. This way no DHCP and WPA client starts are triggered, which are doomed to fail when the WiFi adapter is not connected to any access point yet. Especially in case of the default 60 seconds DHCP timeout, this would otherwise cause an unnecessary long delay.\n DietPi-Dashboard    Added an option to view multiple dashboard nodes from one frontend web interface. Related to this, the backend can now be installed only, reducing memory usage and making it impossible to manually access the node outside of the backend API.\n DietPi-Print_large    This new script has been added which can be executed or sourced from  /boot/dietpi/func/dietpi-print_large to print the string passed via first argument in large  figlet style fonts. It currently only supports the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, dot and dash, i.e. those commonly allowed in hostnames.\n DietPi-Banner    Added an option to print the system\u2019s hostname in large  figlet style fonts, right below the banner header. In case it is enabled as well, the regular/small hostname line will then be skipped. Many thanks to  @matellis for implementing this feature:\n DietPi-Software |  Mono    mono-complete won\u2019t be installed anymore but only  mono-devel instead. This skips the  XSP4 webserver service, which listens on port 8084 by default where it conflicts with File Browser. This only affects new installations. You can manually apply this change running next command:\n DietPi-Software |   FuguHub    The outdated official installer has been replaced with a fully automated own setup, removing the obsolete or even harmful interactive dialogues. On fresh installs, an admin account  dietpi with global software password is created as well.\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Installation is now done via official APT repository, which means quicker install compared to compiling from source, fewer dependencies and easier updates via  apt upgrade:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Airsonic    Since the project has been archived by its maintainer and suffers from the critical  Log4Shell security vulnerability, we moved to the advertised fork \u201cAirsonic-Advanced\u201d which also enables compatibility with Java 17 and hence Debian Bullseye. Airsonic will be reinstalled as part of the DietPi update to apply the migration. All data and settings will be preserved and migrated automatically.\n DietPi images |   Parallels Desktop (macOS)    New Virtual Machine image for Parallels Desktop on macOS.\n  Raspberry Pi    Resolved an issue where unintentionally the turbo mode was enabled. This got backported to v7.9, to our existing RPi images and via live patch. Many thanks to  @ayo-x and  @whyisthisbroken for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5088\n DietPi-FS_partition_resize    Resolved an issue where in some cases the boot partition failed to mount on first boot since after the partition resize the system in some cases didn\u2019t get sufficient time to fully apply the change before continuing with the boot mount attempt. Many thanks to  @Mausy5043 and  @sistemicorp for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5006\n DietPi-Config    Resolved an issue where on Raspberry Pi, when the full KMS display driver is used, the sound card selection could have been falsely applied. With full KMS enabled, for each HDMI port an additional HDMI sound card appears (replacing the regular firmware HDMI sound device), even when no HDMI device is attached and with onboard audio disabled. This lead to an increase of external sound card indices. The appearance of the KMS HDMI sound cards is now aligned with the onboard firmware HDMI sound cards, i.e. if not onboard  auto or HDMI is selected in  dietpi-config, now the KMS HDMI sound devices are disabled as well, making use of the  noaudio device tree overlay parameter.\n DietPi-Software Resolved an issue where on first boot, choice and preference menu selections triggered an error as the install state file did not exist yet. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5080\n Resolved an issue where the deprecated  AUTO_SETUP_FILE_SERVER_INDEX option in  dietpi.txt file was applied inverted.  -1 should have installed  ProFTPD and  -2 Samba, while it was done the opposite way. However, note that this setting is not present on current images and deprecated. Use  AUTO_SETUP_INSTALL_SOFTWARE_ID instead to mark any one or multiple file servers for automatic install. Many thanks to  @bsheeres for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5081\n Browsers - On the ARMv6 Raspberry Pi models Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero (1) since Bullseye,  Chromium and  Firefox fail to start due to hardware and build limitations which are outside of our control. Since those are currently the only two browser available from  dietpi-software, they have been disabled together with the browser preference menu for those systems, until we find and implement a good additional compatible browser. Further info:  RPi-Distro/chromium-browser#21.\n DietPi-Software |   Kodi    Resolved an issue where subsequent Kodi reinstalls created duplicates of the  CMA parameter for the KMS overlay setting in  config.txt. The duplicates are patched out during DietPi update.\n DietPi-Software |   Docker    Resolved an issue where the install was aborted due to an incorrect check for missing kernel modules. Many thanks to  @dragonandy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5061\n DietPi-Software |   Pi-hole    Resolved an issue where the teleporter import log was not shown but denied by the X-Frame-Options header:  https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unable-to-restore-teleporter-backup-fresh-install-no-funky-changes-made/51573\n DietPi-Software |   Blynk Server    Resolved an issue on ARMv6 RPi models where the install failed as the latest Blynk Server release does not contain a Java 8 build. Since the older Java 8 build does not contain a native Log4Shell vulnerability mitigation, it is added server-wise on these systems.\n DietPi-Software |   Mycroft AI    Resolved an issue on Bullseye (and above) systems where  mycroft-cli-client command fails with a permissions issue, even as root user. Many thanks to  @berndverhofstadt for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5100\n DietPi-Software |   Nukkit    Resolved an issue where the install failed due to a changed download URL. The Jenkins instance has moved to  ci.opencollab.dev, where also the Geyser and Floodgate projects are hosted.\n DietPi-Software |   FuguHub    Resolved an issue where the uninstall failed as the process was not stopped as intended. Many thanks to  @kd9352 for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5058\n DietPi-Software |   myMPD    Resolved an issue where the installation failed due to an updated dependency. Many thanks to  @supersexy for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5115\n DietPi-Software |   Python 3    Worked around an issue where the  pip reinstall failed. Many thanks to  @hueppinr for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5117\n DietPi-Software |   Unbound    Resolved an issue where the  unbound-resolvconf service applied localhost automatically as local name server, if the  resolvconf package was installed. Since often Unbound is installed in combination with Pi-hole or AdGuard Home, and those are usually used by network clients only, not the server itself,  unbound-resolvconf is disabled now on Unbound installs. If Unbound is wanted as local resolver as well, it should be explicitly configured, e.g. via dietpi-config network options. Many thanks to  @Ianszh for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5133\n DietPi-Software |   Mosquitto    Applied a workaround on ARMv6 where the latest Mosquitto packages from the official APT repository are not ARMv6-compatible. Many thanks to  @thomasmockridge for reporting this issue:  MichaIng/DietPi#5140\n As always, many smaller code performance and stability improvements, visual and spelling fixes have been done, too much to list all of them here.

But the USPTO has maintained that \u201cspectacles\u201d is a generic term for smart glasses and that Snap\u2019s version \u201chas not acquired distinctiveness,\u201d as required for a trademark.\n In its complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in California, Snap claims that the Spectacles name \u201cevokes an incongruity between an 18th century term for corrective eyewear and Snap\u2019s high-tech 21st century smart glasses. SPECTACLES also is suggestive of the camera\u2019s purpose, to capture and share unusual, notable, or entertaining scenes (i.e., \u201cspectacles\u201d) and while also encouraging users to make \u2018spectacles\u2019 of themselves.\u201d\n Snap first introduced its camera-equipped Spectacles in 2016 (\u201ca wearable digital video camera housed in a pair of fashionable sunglasses,\u201d according to its complaint), which can take photos and videos while the user wears them and connects with the Snap smartphone app. Despite selling them both online and in pop-up vending machines around the world, the first iteration of Spectacles mostly flopped with consumers. In its 2017 third-quarter earnings report,  Snap said it had lost nearly $40 million on some 300,000 unsold Spectacles.\n In May 2021,  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel showed off an augmented reality ver sion of the Spectacles, which so far are available only to a small group of creators and reviewers chosen by the company. The  AR Spectacles aren\u2019t yet available for purchase by the general public.\n  Snap\u2019s new complaint posits that there\u2019s been enough media coverage of Spectacles, bolstered by some industry awards and its own marketing including social media, to support its claim that consumers associate the word \u201cspectacles\u201d with the Snap brand. Snap first filed a trademark application for Spectacles in September 2016, \u201cfor use in connection with wearable computer hardware\u201d and other related uses \u201camong consumer electronics devices and displays.\u201d\n During several rounds of back-and-forth with the company since then, the USPTO has maintained that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d appeared to be \u201cgeneric in connection with the identified goods,\u201d i.e. the camera glasses. Snap continued to appeal the agency\u2019s decision.\n In a  November 2021 opinion, the USPTO\u2019s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (pdf) upheld the decision, reiterating that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d was a generic term that applied to all smart glasses, not just Snap\u2019s version. Despite the publicity Snap claimed its Spectacles had received from its marketing and social media, the board noted in its opinion that Spectacles\u2019 \u201csocial media accounts have an underwhelming number of followers, and the number of followers is surprisingly small,\u201d which didn\u2019t support the company\u2019s argument that there had been a high enough level of consumer exposure to Snap\u2019s Spectacles to claim that consumers associated the word with Snap\u2019s brand.\n In its Tuesday complaint, Snap\u2019s attorneys argued that \u201cspectacles is an old-fashioned term popular in the 18th century,\u201d and that it \u201cis not often used today in the United States,\u201d especially by Snapchat\u2019s young audience. \u201cThis indicates that modern-day usage of \u201cspectacles\u201d in the United States\u2014especially among a younger demographic of consumers who are the relevant consumers of Snap\u2019s SPECTACLES camera product\u2014is not commonly understood to mean eyeglasses, and certainly not a wireless-enabled video camera product.\u201d\n But the USPTO appeal board said in November that the evidence didn\u2019t support that argument, and that the word \u201cspectacles\u201d still retains its generic meaning and therefore can\u2019t be trademarked.

And now at least one splinter group is arguing that the entire project should be decentralized, potentially an industry first.\n Launched in July,  Pudgy Penguins has become one of the most successful NFT projects, raking in over  45,400 ETH in sales on NFT marketplace OpenSea. (That works out to about $140 million in today\u2019s ether ( ETH) prices.) NFT stands for \u201c non-fungible tokens,\u201d a subcategory of cryptocurrencies that represents ownership in a unique asset, from art to real estate.\n The collection of 8,888 chubby and flightless Antarctic creatures \u2013 donning accessories such as baseball caps and fishing rods \u2013 were available to mint last July for 0.03 ETH and sold out in less than 20 minutes.\n  According to Twitter user and Pudgy Penguins owner  @9x9x9eth, Pudgy Penguins co-founder  Cole Thereum \u201cpromised a game, a token, an educational book on NFTs and more\u201d to the community last September.\n \u201cAfter a half year, they still have not yet set up the team, they are still in the stage of hiring,\u201d 9x9x9 told CoinDesk via Twitter.\n (9x9x9 publicly stated he has spent nearly 600 ETH on the collection and holds 242 Pudgy Penguins NFTs and one rare \u201cbanana\u201d penguin, purchased for 100 ETH.)\n Pudgy Penguins pseudonymous co-founders Cole Thereum and Twitter user  @tubbyfat didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment via Twitter direct message.\n  On Wednesday evening, 9x9x9 published  a Twitter thread claiming the Pudgy Penguins founders were looking to abandon the project and offered to sell him its shell for 888 ETH (about $2.8 million), an offer he turned down.\n Since the tweets,  the floor price of a Pudgy Penguin shot up from about 0.6 ETH ($1,860) on Wednesday evening to 1.7 ETH ($5,270) as of press time.\n Now, the project has received buyout offers as high as 750 ETH ($2.3 million) from other prominent individuals in the NFT market, including  Mintable co-founder  Zach Burks, NFT collector  @beaniemax and  Netz Capital\u2019s  Luca Netz.\n    Others in the community are more wary of a buyout. NFT hedge fund  Starry Night Capital\u2019s  @Vince_Van_Dough and  eGirl Capital\u2019s  @loomdart \u2013 other prominent stakeholders in the project \u2013 have floated the idea of migrating the community to a new project called  Wrapped Penguins.\n  The Pudgy Penguins founding team receives a small percentage in royalties from each NFT sale, meaning founders of successful projects can continue to line their pockets as long as trading volume persists.\n Wrapped Penguins,  available as a free mint on NFT platform  Metadrop for current Penguin holders, would sever all ties with the original founding team with the new project in the hope of creating a parallel community that would be governed using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) framework.\n A wrapper is a  smart contract that takes an asset and issues a parallel asset, allowing the Pudgy Penguins NFT holder to hold an identical \u201cwrapped\u201d penguin. The Wrapped Penguins project has said the holder will be able to \u201cunwrap\u201d their token into the original NFT at any time.\n Profile picture projects (PFP) such as Pudgy Penguins, Larva Labs\u2019 CryptoPunks and Yuga Labs\u2019 Bored Ape Yacht Club have driven the recent boom in NFT sales, often run by centralized founding teams who tease new releases for their holders.\n Pudgy Penguins \u201ccould be the first pure decentralized PFP project ever,\u201d 9x9x9 told CoinDesk.\n  The battle for control over the Pudgy Penguins project also raises governance questions surrounding NFT communities \u2013 or more broadly, what happens when founders fail to deliver on stated goals or the communities themselves experience infighting.\n Recent events are reminiscent of battles that have plagued major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, known in the industry as  \u201chard forks.\u201d\n \u201cIn real life, stakeholders can use the board to dump a poorly performing CEO. This is the first attempt I\u2019ve seen in crypto to do in essence the same thing,\u201d tweeted  Jordi Alexander, chief investment officer of  Selini Capital. \u201cThe community forks everything out without the baggage of the CEO.\u201d\n Amid the turmoil, some Pudgy Penguin holders have used the spotlight to spread a popular Pudgy rallying cry: \u201cI am my penguin and my penguin is me.\u201d\n  The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

If you intend to use an EV to reduce carbon emissions from oil, you don\u2019t have to wait until you own one. If you already own one, you can further reduce your footprint. Let\u2019s find out.\n Transport, by far, is one of the largest sectors contributing to CO2 emissions. The time it takes for the oil to burn and pollute is short in this sector. And we burn it in our towns and cities where we live. This is easy to see and experience. Hence the immediate concern.\n  Bu  t what we don\u2019t see is how we unconsciously consume everyday products made out of materials derived from petroleum. While they may not immediately release emissions as vehicles do, they still contribute to our carbon footprint every single day.\n Perhaps oil is one of the most efficiently refined resources. With the current demand, a barrel of oil produces more than just fuel. Mass adoption of EVs could change that. But how about the products made from petroleum?\n  There are over 6,000 products made from petroleum. The tires, bodywork, and the dashboard of an electric vehicle use materials made from petroleum products. Some of the sophisticated healthcare equipment use materials made from petroleum. Our modern lives depend on them.\n Chances are you are currently wearing clothes that are made from petroleum products. Just take a look around and you will see they are everywhere. It is virtually impossible to avoid using them all.\n  Trash, a lot of trash! Once these products reach the end of their lifetime (often barely used), they end up in landfills and in places where they shouldn\u2019t \u2014 rivers, ocean, soil.\n Single-use plastic is the major contributor. Plastic is notoriously difficult to recycle. Of all the plastic ever produced, only 9% is recycled. The majority of the plastic waste is sent to landfills and the ocean and thus killing sea life. Say no to single-use plastic.\n  Synthetic clothes made from polyester, polyacryl, etc., shed microfibre particles on each wash. These particles reach the waterbody and enter our food chain through crop absorption and seafood. And let\u2019s not forget, they do kill marine life.\n  Teabags can release microplastic particles in your cup of tea, as many as 11.6 billion of them, and you know where they go! Instead, loose tea leaf and metallic infusers could be your best bet. Bonus \u2014 you also reduce the trash created by teabags.\n Personal care products such as face wash, toothpaste, etc., containing solid plastic microbead particles enter the waterbody and end up on your plate. Several countries have banned the use of microbeads for good!\n  And the list goes on! Often the petroleum products having shorter shelf life are a matter of concern. That said, we cannot deny the positive uses of some of the products based on petroleum. A few have saved lives! It is about finding the right balance.\n By now, you must have also thought about public transport and ridesharing to reduce the carbon footprint. How is this related to EVs?

Create regular iTunes backups, to check them later for signs of compromise. Trigger sysdiags regularly and save them.\n\u2014 Costin Raiu (@craiu)  September 14, 2021\n   But in a\u00a0 blog post\u00a0on Tuesday, ZecOps said that the iOS restart process isn\u2019t immune to being hijacked once an attacker has gained access to a device.\n The researchers said they developed a technique they called\u00a0 NoReboot\u00a0that taps into\u00a0 SpringBoard\u00a0(the Apple iOS UI app, aka the Home Screen) and\u00a0 Backboardd\u00a0(the daemon behind SpringBoard) to detect and intercept a phone restart command (such as pressing the Volume Down + Power buttons) and then disabling the SpringBoard UI instead of shutting down the entire OS.\n This effectively leaves the iPhone screen with no UI, mimicking the state a device is usually in when it is turned off.\n However, the device is still powered on, but without a user interface. To prevent the device from ringing or vibrating, ZecOps said its\u00a0 NoReboot proof-of-concept code\u00a0also disables features such as 3D Touch feedback, camera LED indicators, and vibration and sound for any incoming calls or notifications.\n The proof-of-concept code also includes a fake boot-up screen to complete the illusion of a full iOS reboot.\n  ZecOps said the NoReboot technique works with regular restarts but does not work with\u00a0 forced restarts, which take place at a hardware level, rather than software.\n \u201cWe have not found an easy way to hijack the force restart event. This event is implemented at a much lower level,\u201d ZecOps researchers said.\n However, ZecOps researchers warn that this does not mean users should believe they are safe if they perform a forced restart.\n Because the forced restart event requires users to rapidly press the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons multiple times and then long-press the Power Button, an attacker could watch for a pattern that resembles a forced restart, block it before it finishes, and then perform the NoReboot attack instead.\n The discovery and revelation of the new NoReboot attack highlights that users should not solely rely on iOS reboots to remove malware from their device but should primarily rely on classic security apps and forensics tools to identify and remove such threats instead.\n At the time of writing, no iOS malware has been seen or publicly documented using a trick resembling NoReboot.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:27:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,ios,iphone,\u6f14\u5458,actors", "title": "\u5a01\u80c1\u6f14\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u62dfiPhone\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684iOS\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6", "title_en": " Threat Actors Can Simulate IPhone Reboots and Keep IOS Malware On a Device", "transed": 1, "url": "https://therecord.media/threat-actors-can-simulate-iphone-reboots-and-keep-ios-malware-on-a-device/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "ios", "iphone", "\u6f14\u5458", "actors"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072535, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Saola\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u96be\u4ee5\u6349\u6478\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u6ca1\u6709\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5bb6\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5b83\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u5b58\u5b83\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u52aa\u529b\u6539\u5584\u5b89\u7eb3\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c71\u8109\u81ea\u7136\u4fdd\u62a4\u533a\u7684\u5de1\u903b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5c71\u8109\u901a\u8fc7\u8001\u631d\uff0c\u8d8a\u5357\u548c\u4e1c\u5317\u67ec\u57d4\u5be8\u5ef6\u4f38\u7ea6680\u82f1\u91cc\uff0c\u5077\u730e\u4e00\u76f4\u5f3a\u70c8\u3002 \u201c\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u4eba\u4f7f\u7528\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u68ee\u6797\u91cc\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5927\u578b\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u6ca1\u6709\u529e\u6cd5\u9003\u907f\u5e76\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u5b89\u5229\u4e9a\u7279\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u201d\u79d1\u7f57\u62c9\u591a\u5dde\u7acb\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u535a\u58eb\u5b66\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e16\u536b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u9677\u9631\u5bf9\u5371\u53ca\u5371\u5bb3\u5927\u578b\u9e7f\u8338\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u5982\u679c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u7684Saolas\u5c06\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7531SWG\u548c\u8d8a\u5357\u653f\u5e9c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4fd8\u864f\u80b2\u79cd\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5728\u8d8a\u5357\u4e2d\u90e8B\u1ea1chm\u00c3\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56ed\u3002", "note_en": "The saola is so elusive that no biologist has seen one in the wild. Now they are racing to find it, so they can save it\n    W eighing 80-100kg and sporting long straight horns, white spots on its face and large facial scent glands, the saola does not sound like an animal that would be hard to spot. But it was not until  1992 that this elusive creature was discovered, becoming the first large mammal new to science in more than 50 years.\n Nicknamed the \u201cAsian unicorn\u201d, the saola continues to be elusive. They have never been seen by a biologist in the wild and have been camera-trapped only  a handful of times. There are reports of villagers trying to keep them in captivity but they have died after a few weeks, probably due to the wrong diet.\n  It was during a survey of wildlife in the remote V\u0169 Quang nature reserve, a 212 square mile forested area of north central  Vietnam, in 1992, that biologist Do Tuoc came across two skulls and a pair of trophy horns belonging to an unknown animal.\n Twenty more specimens, including a complete skin, were subsequently collected and, in 1993, laboratory tests revealed the animal to be not only a new species, but an entirely new genus in the bovid family, which includes cattle, sheep, goats and antelopes.\n Initially named Vu Quang Ox, the animal was later called saola ( Pseudoryx  nghetinhensis) \u2013 meaning \u201cspindle horns\u201d, the arms or posts (sao) of a spinning wheel (la) according to Lao-speaking ethnic groups in  Laos and neighbouring Vietnam.\n  The discovery was hailed as one of the most spectacular zoological discoveries of the 20th century but  less than 30 years later the saola population is believed to have declined massively due to commercial wildlife poaching, which  has exploded in Vietnam since 1994. Even though the saola is not directly targeted by poachers, intensive commercial snaring that supplies animals for use in traditional Asian medicine or as bushmeat serves as the primary threat.\n  Despite efforts to improve patrolling of nature reserves in the Annamite mountains, a major mountain range extending about 680 miles through Laos, Vietnam and into north-east Cambodia, poaching has been intensifying. \u201cThousands of people use snares, so there are millions of them in the forest, which means populations of large mammals and some birds have no way to escape and are collapsing throughout the Annamites,\u201d says Minh Nguyen, a PhD student at Colorado State University, who studies the impact of snares on critically endangered large-antlered muntjac.\n In 2001, the saola population was estimated to number 70 to 700 in Laos and several hundred in Vietnam. More recently, experts have put the number at  fewer than 100 \u2013 a decline that led to the species being listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list in 2006, the highest risk category that a species can have before extinction in the wild. The animal was  last camera-trapped in 2013 in the Saola Nature Reserve in central Vietnam. Since then, villagers continue to report its presence in areas in and around Pu Mat national park in Vietnam and in Bolikhamxay province in Laos.\n We stand at a moment of conservation history. We know how to find and save this magnificent animal. We just need the world to come together\n In 2006, William Robichaud and Simon Hedges, a biologist and specialist on wildlife conservation and countering the illegal wildlife trade in Asia and Africa, co-founded the  Saola Working Group (SWG) with the aim of finding the last saolas in the wild for a captive breeding programme, in order to reintroduce the species back into the wild in future, in a natural habitat that is free from threats.\n The SWG connects conservation organisations in Laos and Vietnam to raise awareness, collect information from local people, and search for saola. But the animals continue to elude the team. Between 2017 and 2019, the SWG carried out an intensive search using 300 camera traps in an 11 square mile area of the Khoun Xe Nongma national protected area in Laos. Not one of the million photographs captured saola.\n According to the IUCN,  only about 30% of potential Saola habitat has had any form of wildlife survey and potentially as little as 2% has been searched intensively for the species. Technologies limit the capabilities \u2013 camera traps are not good at detecting individual animals that are spread across a large area, especially in the damp, dense forest of the saola range. In August this year, the IUCN Species Survival Commission called for more investment in the search for the saola. \u201cIt is clear that search efforts must be significantly ramped up in scale and intensity if we are to save this species from extinction,\u201d said Nerissa Chao, Director of the IUCN SSC Asian Species Action Partnership\n  One organisation,  the Saola Foundation, is raising money for a new initiative that would train dogs to detect saola signs such as dung. Any samples would then be studied onsite using rapid saola-specific DNA field test kits being developed in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Molecular Laboratory in New York. Should the kits return a positive result within an hour, expert wildlife trackers will start searching for saola in the forest.\n If successful, captured saolas will be taken to a captive breeding centre being developed by the SWG and the Vietnamese government at B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 national park in central Vietnam.\n \u201cWe stand at a moment of conservation history,\u201d says Robichaud, who is president of the Saola Foundation. \u201cWe know how to find and save this magnificent animal, which has been on planet Earth for perhaps 8m years. We just need the world to come together and support the effort. It won\u2019t cost much, and the reward, for saola, for the Annamite mountains, and for ourselves, will be huge.\u201d\n Find more  age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters  Phoebe Weston and  Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:25:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,\u6293\u4f4f,step,\u9677\u9631", "title": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u201c\u4e9a\u6d32\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u201d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u7a00\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u7269\u4e4b\u4e00", "title_en": "Scientists Step Up Hunt For 'Asian Unicorn,' One of World's Rarest Animals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/scientists-step-up-hunt-for-asian-unicorn-one-of-worlds-rarest-animals-aoe", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "\u6293\u4f4f", "step", "\u9677\u9631"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d79de91228e184b2b1c662f798e5387.jpg", "infoid": 1072534, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u572812\u670821\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u8df3\u5230\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aNFT\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u964d\u81f3\u540c\u6837\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u4e00\u6837\uff0cNFT\u7cfb\u5217\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6570\u7ef4\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u804a\u5929\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e00\u8d77\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u90fd\u5373\u5c06\u5411\u5176\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u5206\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724cAirDrop\u768421\u4e16\u7eaa\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7684NFT\u666e\u96f7\u65af\u7684\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd - \u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u652f\u6301\u8005\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u5206\u53d1 - \u51e0\u5929\u540e\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u662f\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u96be\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6295\u8d44\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u201d\n\u8461\u8404\u7f51\u7edc\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u9662\u957f\u5e15\u5e15\u65af\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u521d\u59cb\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u9996\u5148\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Webhooks\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u771f\u6b63\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5728\u9a84\u50b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u201dPappas\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop \u2014 essentially a free distribution to early supporters \u2014 a few days later.\n Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official \u201cannouncements\u201d channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance \u2014 but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.\n In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first  from Monkey Kingdom and  then from Fractal, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers  got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was  reported to be $1.3 million.\n the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers\n Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens \u2014 specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It\u2019s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers \u2014 and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.\n In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be \u201ccalled\u201d (or, in a closer approximation, \u201ctexted\u201d) to connect to an application on the other end.\n By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake \u201cannouncement\u201d had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags \u2014 but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled.\n \u201cwe are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users\u201d\n Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the  official documentation describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it\u2019s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there\u2019s no way to switch off all of them at once if you\u2019ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren\u2019t paying attention to their integrations.\n A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy  resource center.\n \u201cDiscord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,\u201d said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. \u201cWhile there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.\u201d\n \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism\u201d\n The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana.\n By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a  phishing attack that involves getting the target banned, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.\n Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to  The Verge that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation.\u201d\n In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym \u201cMonkey King\u201d) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.\n NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours \u2014 or sometimes minutes \u2014 so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.\n  In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers.  A Chainalysis examination of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.\n There\u2019s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there\u2019ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins \u2014 but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.\n The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace,  went live on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:24:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,nft,hacking,\u653b\u51fb", "title": "\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u9ed1\u5ba2\u662fNFT\u4e70\u5bb6\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1", "title_en": "Discord Hacking is the Newest Threat For NFT Buyers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ed1\u5ba2", "nft", "hacking", "\u653b\u51fb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e820db917f0e9ee6cec2ad4b899ac5f0.jpg", "infoid": 1072533, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JALOPNIK\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4eae\u8d77\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7530\u6c7d\u8f66\u57282002\u5e74\u7684\u4e00\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5361\u4f4f\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u8513\u5ef6\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u52302004\u5e74\u548c2012\u5e74\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u7530\u548cACURA\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u521a\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u5468A\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u5c06\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90a3\u65f6\u534f\u52a9\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u5c06\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53d1\u51fa\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u544a\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u7530\u82f1\u56fd\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u54a8\u8be2\u60a8\u5f53\u5730\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u91ca\u653e\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u534f\u52a9\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u7cfb\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63f4\u52a9\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u67e5\u770b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53ca\u5176\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u672c\u7530\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u53d1\u9001\u66f4\u65b0\u78c1\u76d8\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u672c\u7530\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u65f6\u949f\u5e94\u8be5\u57288\u6708\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u7ea0\u6b63\u81ea\u5df1\u3002", "note_en": "The Jalopnik inbox has been lit up with a number of reports about clocks and calendars in Honda cars getting stuck at a certain time in the year 2002. The spread is impressive, impacting Honda and Acura models as old as 2004 and as new as 2012. Here\u2019s what might be happening.\n  If you scroll through a   Honda or   Acura   forum right now, chances are you\u2019re going to run into a bunch of confused owners. When they hopped into their cars on January 1 they found the clocks on their navigation systems frozen at a certain time. And the calendar date? 2002, or 20 years ago.\n The issue is widespread, hitting a huge number of cars in Acura\u2019s and Honda\u2019s   lineup with navigation systems. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, as owners in Canada and even as far as the United Kingdom have all reported similar issues.\n      As a number of Honda and Acura owners have noted on these forums, their clocks read correctly until what appeared to have been the first time update of 2022. Then, their navigation systems turned into time machines, leaving them behind as they went back to 2002.\n    American Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems. We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.\n  Owners have also reached out and received different responses. American Honda provided the CR-V Owners Club   forum this response:\n We have escalated the NAVI Clock Issue to our Engineering Team and they have informed us that you will experience issue from Jan 2022 thru August 2022 and then it will auto-correct. Please be assured that we will continue to monitor this and will advise you if a fix is available before that time.\n   We have just received some more information regarding this and were advised that the Honda technical department are currently working on this. Once there is a fix for this issue Honda authorized dealers will be made aware of it and will be able to assist with this at that point. A service bulletin will be issued to our dealers from Honda UK on how to fix this. As such it would be best to check with your local Honda authorized dealer for any updates as they would have the latest information for this and will be able to assist once the fix is released. They can also contact the Honda technical department for additional assistance with this if necessary. You can see the nearest Honda authorized dealers and their contact details by using the link below.\n  If you have experience coding or troubleshooting software, the possible cause of this time warp probably popped into your head early on.\n Drive Accord   forum user Jacalar went into the navigation system\u2019s diagnostic menu on Sunday and discovered that the GPS date was set to May 19, 2002, or exactly 1024 weeks in the past.\n  Global Positioning Systems measure time from an epoch, or a specific starting point used to calculate time. The date is broadcasted including a number representing the week, coded in 10 binary digits. These digits count from 0 to 1023 then roll over on week 1024. GPS weeks first started on January 6, 1980 before first zeroing out on midnight August 21, 1999. It happened again April 6, 2019. The next happens in 2038.\n   If software isn\u2019t coded to account for the rollover, weird stuff can happen, like a calendar going back exactly 1024 weeks. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure without being able to look at Honda\u2019s programming, but these navigation systems might be programmed so that the start of their week counter is a date 19.6 years in the past, but not in-line with GPS epoch.\n Owners should be able to turn off the automatic update function and set the date and time manually, but they\u2019re finding that the functionality doesn\u2019t work right now. Likewise, the clock resets back to the incorrect time every time the car is started.\n  This isn\u2019t the first time that Honda and Acura owners have experienced this issue.   On August 16, 2017, Hondas and Acuras with navigation systems from model years 1999 through 2004 had their clocks reset to 0:00 and their calendars roll back to January 1, 1998. It then happened  again   on January 1, 2021 to many owners.

The subject of books, articles, plays, and even an opera, Batavia was wrecked on a chain of small islands off the coast of Western Australia.\n Of Batavia\u2019s 341 crew and passengers, 40 drowned trying to get off the ship, while all others made it to the uninhabited islands nearby. The captain, senior officers, two women, and one child left in one of the ship\u2019s boats to get help. But further tragedy followed.\n A group of men on the islands who had gathered around the acting commander deliberately drowned, strangled, cut the throats, or brutally hacked to death 125 children, women, and men. When the rescue party returned months later, they managed to overpower this death squad and bring the remaining survivors to safety. Together with its many victims and the murderers, Batavia\u2019s wreckage was left in the Houtman Abrolhos archipelago.\n The Dutch ship was 45.3 meters long and 600 metric tons in size. It sank on its maiden voyage to Southeast Asia. The shipwreck was found in the 1960s off Morning Reef and was excavated in the 1970s.\n  The surviving stern section, now in Fremantle\u2019s Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum, is the only portion of any early 17th-century Dutch East India ship raised from the seabed and preserved.\n Previously, historians could only guess where the timber for such ships came from, when it was felled, or how it was used, as archival records of Dutch timber trade before 1650 are rare or lost.\n But in\u00a0 new research, we studied the tree rings of the Batavia shipwreck timbers. We have found that the oak for the hull was sourced from two separate forests (in northern Germany and the Baltic region), with wood for the framing elements coming predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony. The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled (in 1625 or later) and was still green when the shipbuilders cut and bent the planks into shape.\n Knowing more about these timbers helps us understand the Dutch success in world trade, including how they managed to build such large ocean-going vessels and so many of them.\n   Batavia\u2019s remains provide a rare archaeological resource for tree-ring examination because exact dates of its construction and sinking are known.\n Construction began sometime in the spring of 1626, and the ship set sail from Texel (the Netherlands) to the East Indies (known today as Indonesia) in October 1628. It struck a reef on June 4, 1629. As Batavia had never undergone repairs or maintenance work, we know every piece of timber belongs to the original structure.\n When Batavia was built, the Dutch were the foremost shipbuilders in Europe. By 1640, for example, around 1,000 seagoing ships were being constructed in the Netherlands each year, mostly for export markets.\n The Dutch lacked domestic timber resources to supply the bustling shipbuilding industry and yet would have needed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of oak trees to build Batavia.\n Where did all this timber come from? The Dutch East India Company archives provide no detailed information on where its shipyards bought timber at the time of Batavia\u2019s construction. While the company kept detailed records from the mid-17th century onward, hardly any of those from the early 1600s have survived.\n Fortunately, tree rings can provide answers to those questions. Trees in temperate climate zones form a growth ring each year, just under the bark. This sequence of growth rings produced over years and decades acts like an environmental bar code, a growth pattern that is particular to the place where they grew and died.\n  This growth pattern is very similar for trees of the same species growing in the same area.\n By measuring the ring widths from many trees, a reference tree-ring chronology can be built. Then, we can cross match the growth pattern of a specific timber to such reference chronologies, establishing when the tree was felled and where it had grown. This field of study is  known as dendrochronology.\n The many Batavia timbers we sampled had only heartwood, or interior rings, demonstrating that Dutch shipbuilders discarded the sapwood (outer rings). Sapwood is softer and contains substances that make it more vulnerable to insect infestation and decay.\n Furthermore, the outermost heartwood ring of the Batavia hull planks that we sampled dates to 1616. When accounting for the missing sapwood (nine rings for Baltic oak), this means the trees were felled in 1625 or later.\n The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled. All this demonstrates that Batavia\u2019s builders were skilled craftspersons, intimately familiar with the properties of the wood they used.\n  The oak timber used in Batavia\u2019s hull planks came from two forests. Trees from near L\u00fcbeck in northern Germany were used above the ship\u2019s waterline, while timber from the Baltic region of Northeastern Europe was applied exclusively below the waterline.\n This Baltic timber was prized by artists like\u00a0 Rembrandt, who used it for panels on which to paint. Trees from this region had beautifully straight trunks with very fine growth rings, making the wood easy to work and stable.\n Obviously, company shipbuilders valued these same properties when building ships strong enough to endure several return voyages to Southeast Asia. They avoided using trees with knots in the hull and preferred wood from which they could fashion long and strong planks.\n  In contrast, we found that the timber for Batavia\u2019s framing elements came predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony (northwest Germany). Frames utilized the strong properties of these oaks\u2019 curved wood fibers. As it was sourced closer to home, this timber may have been cheaper and easier to acquire.\n Our study was only possible because Batavia\u2019s hull was raised in its entirety. Waterlogged wood is mushy, so extracting samples from the timbers while still under water is always challenging. It also would have required cutting out large sections of the ship to access all the different elements.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:17:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"With the new work  Euglossini cologne, interdisciplinary artist Hsurae has made a case for why the new scent she has created is not merely metaphoric and why reconstructed scents are intellectual structures, really little more than a metaphor or an abstraction of what once was.\n Orchid bees ( Euglossini) have a unique fragrance biology\u2014 they are thought to be the only species other than humans that gather ingredients and make fragrance compositions. In decline from Mexico to Brazil, these bees are the sole pollinators of many flowers including the Vanilla Orchid.\u00a0 Hsurae has created a computation of the fragrance of this bee through \u201cscientific instrumentality.\u201d She has written, \u201cWhen their ecology is dead and the species long gone, this may serve as the only memory of the orchid bee.\u201d\n   Even though it\u2019s about this sense of this organic animal, it\u2019s really about how the memory of this  species can become encapsulated by scientific means, and how science tells its stories about this relationship with nature. I was very inspired by this collaborative project between Daisy Ginsberg, Sissel Tolaas and synthetic biologists, that took place at Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston.\n The project \u201cResurrecting the Sublime\u201d that was about reviving the scent of extinct plants?\n Yes, they went through extinct species in the Harvard Arboretum and extracted DNA and analyzed it. Then they revived some of the aromatic compounds that were used to create the scent of that particular plant.\n  I was drawn to this project because it felt like a very poetic move, trying to recreate a scent of something that\u2019s extinct. At the same time, Ginkgo Bioworks is a biotech company, so it\u2019s very scientific and deterministic. However, in the project, with the DNA that Ginkgo analyzed, there could be a lot of ways the different kinds of compounds could have been mixed together in any number of ratios to create the very specific scent to this plant, so the reconstruction of the flower\u2019s smell still may be lost. What they have is a variation they came up with, even though it\u2019s based on some sort of scientific DNA analysis, it\u2019s just one of the million possibilities of the scent that this plant could hold that nobody living has smelled before. But the way that the story is told is that the scientists collaborating with artists have managed to revive the scent of an extinct plant species. It got me thinking about the relationship of science with nature and how it turns nature into specimens, which can only specify their value as a thing, as an object to be observed.\n The first thing that struck me about  Euglossini cologne was that the fragrance was contained in this machined, corrosion resistant, stainless-steel vault of a bottle. Can tell us about that?\n I really wanted that kind of monolithic scientific authority. I wanted it to have an important presence in this scent piece. And that was the reason for the container. It is a vessel for high pressure and high temperature chemical reactions. Inside the steel is a little Teflon tub and that\u2019s where the liquid is held. You might have noticed that there\u2019s a key, a steel rod that goes through it to create a very tight secure encapsulation. That\u2019s the key to tighten that seal. It gets you more leverage to really tighten it down. When you remove it, you\u2019re not supposed to be able to open the chamber by hand. In that way, it also functions as a kind of time capsule. And so that goes with what I was saying about the timeframe of this piece.\n How did you arrive at the need to preserve the smell that the orchid bee creates?\n Well, I actually first arrived at bee orchid by way of the XKCD comic strip.\u00a0There\u2019s this kind of sexual reproduction replication happening in certain species of orchids that binds the bee species pollinating them to itself. Certain species of orchids rely on a specific kind of bee to pollinate them. A lot of them form these one-to-one mutual relationships. And through time, the sexual organs of these orchid flowers evolve to look like the female species of that bee that they want to pollinate them.\n There was this comic strip by XKCD that is about this bee orchid. It narrates that there\u2019s this kind of orchid, whose partner bee has gone extinct, so the only memory we have of this bee that once existed lies in the interpretation of a flower of what the genital of this kind of bee looked like. It\u2019s quite a touching comic. The last frame stated that \u201cthe only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.\u201d\n Then Donna Haraway wrote about this. So, I first came to this little anecdote through that comic strip, but then reading Haraway\u2019s book, \u201cStaying with the Trouble\u201d in the chapter about sym-poiesis, which means \u2018making with\u2019, she was talking about this particular comic strip, commenting on how it\u2019s special because it didn\u2019t mistake lures for identity. It\u2019s not saying that this bee orchid is exactly what the female bee\u2019s reproductive organs look like. It is a rendering of its image through the interpretation of the flower.\n  I arrived at the orchid bee by chance, when I was googling bee orchid but typed it in reverse. But then I saw how these bees were really the first species in nature to create perfumes. That was the part that got me interested in orchid bees. So, I started reading more and more about them. There are many types of orchid bees. I feel like the scent they collect is really a map of the territory that they inhabit. It\u2019s like a scent map. It\u2019s also a lot of the bees\u2019 agency that goes into creating their particular types of scent. I was thinking about that and reading accounts of how more and more of these kinds of bees are going extinct because their habitats are being destroyed. That\u2019s one of the reasons why my statement for this piece is in a style that mimics that last line of the comic where it says the last memory of the extinct bee is painted by a dying flower. I was thinking about how, when all the habitats are gone and all of these species are extinct, how science might claim to recreate this ephemeral smell that they made during their lifetimes\u2026\n In  Euglossini cologne,the scent compounds used in this smell are mimicking the scent traps that are used by scientists to trap orchid bees for study. It\u2019s a synthesis of the smell through science, but it\u2019s also an interpretation, a very human interpretation through the tools of science of what the scent could smell like, and how that serves as a more accurate memory of this species.\n So, the scent that you have created is based on the hormonal chemical components that research scientists deciphered that attract the male bee?\u00a0The bee\u2019s perfume that it compiled on its body was not scientifically analyzed?\n Yes. What scents they collect is dependent on which species of orchid bees they are and their particular habitat. They\u2019re known to collect from sources that we humans find disgusting, like feces or rotten meat or rotting wood, but it\u2019s the complexity of their perfume that really counts when it comes to mating season, and not really how pleasant smelling that perfume is. It\u2019s that unpleasant aspect of it, but I really wanted the skatole to come out.\n The work takes one into insect cognition and perception of scent, questioning the difference of scent perception in human species and insect species. What\u2019s actually perceived as pleasant and what\u2019s conceived as important.\n What is conceived as a culturally important scent? I\u2019ve also been reading a lot about olfactory racism and how scent is construed in the social life and how power lacks scent. When you go into institutions that are supposed to be some kind of institute of authority, like a bank or a museum, you don\u2019t smell anything. The lack of smell is a symbol of power. And what humans find disgusting is very much conditioned through the colonial era. And so, how what we deem as pleasant and unpleasant is already racially coded, are some facets that really interest me about scents. It\u2019s not just how good it smells or how bad it smells, but it\u2019s all really ingrained in there.\n   When did your interest in the smell and the chemical communication enter your work?\u00a0 Is this your most important work so far in that area?\n Yes, kind of. I guess that interest developed as I was fermenting different kinds of materials. So, SCOBY is one of them. I also ferment vegetables, seafood sometimes, and it\u2019s become a real interest of mine. And in the beginning, it was more about the material that I was interested in using, as in using in my own practice. But then in the process of fermenting these things, the scent of it really starts to impose on you. And for me, especially in New York where living space is so small and tight, I was really living in those quarters with all these different scents. And I was just really interested in  kind of this medium as its own medium of communication that we humans really don\u2019t understand as much as we like.\n I have always been interested in the scientific side of scents. My work with the SCOBY was heavily about the microbiome and how we\u2019re outnumbered by other cells and how we can reconstruct our own sense of identity and individualism through this knowledge that we\u2019re always more other than ourselves, like what we can see to be ourselves. And so, in all these microbiome studies, I would be drawn to scent repercussions in microbiomes. There\u2019s always been the knowledge that, for example, we choose our partners subconsciously on the kind of scent that they  admit emit. And we\u2019ve never really understood why. And now there\u2019s a microbiome interpretation of that saying that it\u2019s this subconscious form of communication that\u2019s not to the human, but maybe to the immune system, to the cells in the immune system or the bacteria in the microbiome of the human that communicates that this person\u2019s microbiome and hence immune system is complimentary to your own.\n So that scent that we\u2019re drawn to is us looking, subconsciously looking for compatible immunological profiles to form partnerships with, because it maybe evolution that gave us an advantage to form family units with people whose health is complementary to our own. I approached or arrived at scent in these two very different ways. One is a very embodied, very lived-in relationship with different scents. And then the other is really more cerebral or more intellectual engagement with  its scent. It all kind of came together with this new piece in the exhibition New York/New Fumes.\n Considering you have this background with the biome and the fact that bacteria manufacture different volatile compounds\u2014 smells, what do you think about the idea that the bees might be collecting the types of microorganisms that they need. Bacteria produce characteristic odors.\n That could be. That could very much be. Maybe they\u2019re collecting their own little microbiomes. However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything about it. I\u2019ve read about microbiomes and bees that exist under guts, but for these orchid bees, they collect these scents into these two pouches under their hind legs and they rub them against their front legs which covers the scent compounds in lipids and fat, and stores it in that pouch. So, some sort of chemical reaction I think happens in the pouch. I\u2019m not completely sure there is a live bacterial community inside those pouches, but it could be that maybe there\u2019s more to what they\u2019re collecting than just thinking of them, oh, how cute, these bees collect and make their own perfumes. Maybe it serves another kind of purpose that we don\u2019t understand yet.\n Speaking of which, I\u2019m aware that Orchid bees do a particular performance to push the scent into the air, into the perceivability of the female. Can you tell us about that?\n I\u2019ve seen videos of this behavior and I think they all vary a little bit, so it\u2019s not like they all do the same dance, but they all do a kind of dance with their wings and their legs that creates like a pumping motion that sprays the scent they\u2019ve collected in their hind leg pouches into the air in front of the female during mating season.\n The fact that Orchid bee courtship behavior involves creating and sharing a cologne is an interesting phenomenon.\n Science understands it as a means to serve the purpose of getting the scent out in a mist form, but I like to think about it as a ritualistic dance or ceremonial dance, it gives it another dimension to be understood by. Maybe this is a spiritual experience for them. Maybe it is just pleasure. We tend to write about it as this tool they use for mating, like the Bowerbird that collects beautiful objects and makes a house out of it to impress the female. Maybe it\u2019s more than that. Maybe there\u2019s something to it that we don\u2019t get, and that\u2019s ok.\n P retty much all our observations of behaviors, especially in animals and insects, are given Darwinian-based interpretations. What are your hopes for this piece in terms of thinking about the ecological and biodiversity extinction crisis that we\u2019re in? I felt like you were a making a big statement about chemical communication in nature and the key role pollinators play in life cycles of aromatic flowering plants. These are complex relationships. Can you talk a little bit about it?\n I would hope someone would walk away from the piece with a feeling of a lack because that smell is, like I said, it could be one in a million of interpretations that\u2019s made on what a perfume collected by an orchid bee may smell like. And so that itself is already a loss. And then to think about this scent in terms of extinction really puts it in a timeframe where the situation we\u2019re in now might really feel like, as something that\u2019s already bygone. If that makes any sense. I hope someone could encounter this piece and, well, be left with a chance to think about the times we\u2019re in and what could be done to provoke some sort of emotion and then perhaps action.\n That\u2019s part of the reasons why World Sensorium Conservancy is working conserve aromatic plants. To actually preserve the scent, we must preserve the plant. But what we are really talking about is conserving ecological communities. I felt that  Euglossini cologne brings attention to the pollinators and how the symbiotic relationship between pollinators and the plants are intertwined in the survival.\n The work took me to the plants are severe decline and threatened with extinction. The artwork brings attention to the fact that there\u2019s really no way to preserve their smell yet. There is progress in chemical analysis and recreations but these really aren\u2019t accurate- they\u2019re high concept. We must save the plants, and the community of species that create the smells. it means also saving the ecosystems because the bacteria are often the producers of the smells and you have to save the bacteria. We need to be conserving whole ecological communities. These are very powerful and primal relationships that are jeopardy.\n I completely agree. We need to be thinking about the rhizomatic connections in an ecology that interweaves into each other\u2019s survival, instead of viewing each plant as a specimen. I was brought up with a positivist mentality, and even though I\u2019ve come to find much joy in science, I\u2019m also learning that there are no technofixes. It is tempting to buy into the narrative that scientists will engineer bacteria to digest plastic waste or that extinct wooly mammoths can be resurrected in a lab, but as we\u2019ve witnessed with each case, there can be no isolated solution for a global ecological crisis. The scientific community didn\u2019t learn about the underground mycelial wood wide web until 1997 (while sylvan communication has been described in many indigenous epistemologies), and we are slowly coming to terms with the impact that our microbial communities have on us. Our understanding of conservation needs to be as networked, grounded and interconnected as the microbial inter-glot that sustains our environments, inside and out, with or without our (scientific) knowledge.\n HsuRae\u00a0 (Taiwanese) is an artist and educator of Bioart and endosymbiotic aesthetics.

Some might want to refactor their mainframe workloads to run on AWS by transforming legacy applications \u2013  likely written in COBOL \u2013 into modern Java-based cloud services.\n  Alternatively, customers can keep their applications as written and re-platform their workloads to AWS reusing existing code with minimal changes.\n  Mainframe Modernization promises a complete, end-to-end migration pipeline that includes development, testing, and deployment tools necessary to automate the process.\n  \u201cWith today\u2019s launch of AWS Mainframe Modernization, customers and systems integrators can now more quickly modernize their legacy mainframe workloads in a predictable way and get rid of much of the complexity and manual work involved in migrations,\u201d said William Platt, GM of Migration Services at AWS.\n  The service puts the cloud vendor at odds with mainframe manufacturers and specialist software vendors that include IBM, Unisys, Bull, NEC, and Fujitsu.\n  Mainframe Modernization was presented at this week\u2019s re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where AWS also announced the expansion of the Outpost hardware line-up, a private 5G networking service, and new EC2 instances.\n    More than 50 years after the appearance of the first mainframe, the IBM System/360, these hulking machines are still a common sight in banking, insurance, and retail, thanks to their ability to efficiently process huge volumes of transactions, and their reputation for security and uptime.\n  However, these systems are incredibly expensive and difficult to maintain, and the pool of people qualified to deal with their legacy software is shrinking all the time.\n  AWS has been trying to get customers off mainframes and into its data centers  for years. This time, the company says it has built a runtime enthronement provides all the necessary compute, memory, and storage to run both refactored and replatformed applications while automatically handling capacity provisioning, security, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\n  Since this is all done via public cloud, there are no upfront costs, and customers only pay for the amount of compute provisioned.\n  Brazil\u2019s Banco Inter was among the first organizations to sign up for Mainframe Modernization with AWS.\n  \u201cBy using the AWS Mainframe Modernization managed runtime, we expect to simplify our card processor operations for enhanced resiliency and scalability,\u201d said Guilherme Ximenes, CTO at Banco Inter. \u201cWe are also excited by the DevOps CI/CD pipeline for increasing the agility we need to more quickly deliver new credit and debit card transaction capabilities to our customers.\u201d\n  AWS Mainframe Modernization is available in preview in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), EU (Frankfurt), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo) regions, before being expanded to additional locations \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n  The AWS approach to refactoring legacy software is not unique: a similar model has been promoted by other companies, like the Swiss startup LzLabs, which has been developing a product called Software-Defined Mainframe since 2011, based on its own COBOL and Java interoperability architecture.\n  Going in a different direction, the Open Mainframe Project  founded in 2015 is attempting to make existing machines a lot more useful, by teaching them to run on Linux, rather than proprietary operating systems like z/OS.\n  It would be useful to note that the death of the mainframe has been predicted for  at least two decades, and yet these machines have managed to stay surprisingly relevant.\n  Do you have strong opinions about mainframes?
