They - by which we now refer to Tim, Diane, their eight colleagues, their two supervisors, four chemical engineers, six electrical engineers, the janitor, a countable infinity of TEEO 9.9.1 ultra-medium-density selectably-foaming non-elasticised quantum waveform frequency rate range collapse selectors and the single tormented tau neutrino caught in the middle of it all - represented the sum total of the human race&#39;s achievements in the field of quantum computing. Specifically, they had, earlier that week, successfully built a quantum computer. Putting into practice principles it had taken a trio of appallingly intelligent mathematical statisticians some 10 years to mastermind, and which only about fifty-five other people in the world had yet got a grip on, they had constructed an engine capable of passing information to and processing the responses from what could, without hyperbole, be described as a single fundamental particle with infinite processing power and infinite storage capacity.</p><p>  这就是游戏的名称，他回答。他们是我们现在所说的蒂姆，黛安，他们的八位同事，他们的两名主管，四位化学工程师，六位电气工程师，看门人，以及无穷无尽TEEO 9.9.1超中密度选择性发泡非弹性纤维量子波形频率速率范围崩溃选择器和夹在其中的单个受折磨的tau中微子-代表了人类在量子计算领域取得的成就的总和。具体地说，他们在那周早些时候成功地制造了量子计算机。付诸实践的原则使三位令人震惊的聪明的数学统计学家花了大约十年的时间进行策划，而世界上只有大约55个人尚未掌握这一点，他们构造了一种能够将信息传递给在没有夸张的情况下处理来自响应的响应，可以描述为具有无限处理能力和无限存储能力的单个基本粒子。</p><p>  Not quite enough time had yet passed for the world as they knew it to be totally and permanently fundamentally altered by this news.</p><p>  世界还没有足够的时间过去，因为他们知道这个消息将彻底彻底地改变世界。</p><p>  But it was still pretty exciting stuff. Holy  Zarquon, they said to one another, an  infinitely powerful computer? It was like a thousand Christmases rolled into one. Program going to loop forever? You knew for a fact: this thing could execute an infinite loop in less than ten seconds. Brute force primality testing of every single integer in existence? Easy. Pi to the last digit? Piece of cake. Halting Problem? Sa- holved.</p><p>  但这仍然是令人兴奋的东西。他们互相对着Zarquon说，一台功能强大的计算机？就像一千个圣诞节变成一个圣诞节。程序会永远循环吗？您知道一个事实：这件事可以在不到十秒钟的时间内执行无限循环。是否存在对每个整数的蛮力素性测试？简单。 to到最后一位？小菜一碟。停止问题了吗？已解决。</p><p>  They hadn&#39;t announced it yet. They&#39;d been programming.  Obviously they hadn&#39;t built it just to see if they could. They had had plans. In some cases they had even had code ready and waiting to be executed. One such program was Diane&#39;s. It was a universe simulator. She had started out with a simulated Big Bang and run the thing forwards in time by approximately 13.6 billion years, to approximately just before the present day, watching the universe develop at every stage - taking brief notes, but knowing full well there would be plenty of time to run it again later, and mostly just admiring the miracle of creation.</p><p>  他们尚未宣布。他们一直在编程。显然，他们没有建造它只是为了看他们是否可以。他们有计划。在某些情况下，他们甚至已经准备好代码并等待执行。这样的程序之一就是戴安娜（Diane）。那是一个宇宙模拟器。她以模拟的“大爆炸”开始，并将其向前推进了大约136亿年，直到大约今天，并观察了宇宙在各个阶段的发展-作了简要记录，但充分了解将会有很多有一段时间以后再运行一次，而且大部分时间只是在欣赏创造的奇迹。</p><p>  Then, just this Friday, she had suddenly started programming busily again. And it was sheer coincidence that it was just now, just as Tim was about to be the second-to-last person to step out of the door and go home for the weekend, that her work had come to fruition. &#34;Look what I found,&#34; she said, pressing some keys. One of the first things she had written was a software viewing port to take observations from the simulated universe.</p><p>  然后，就在这个星期五，她突然又忙着开始编程。只是巧合的是，就在蒂姆即将成为第二个倒数第二个要走出家门并回家周末的人时，她的工作才得以实现。 ＆＃34;看看我发现了什么，＆＃34;她说，按了一些键。她写的第一件事是一个软件查看端口，可以从模拟的宇宙中进行观察。 </p><p>  Tim looked, and saw a blue-white sphere in the blackness, illuminated from one side by a brilliant yellow glare. &#34;You&#39;ve got to be joking. How long did that take to find? In the entire cosmos of what, ten to the twenty-two stars?&#34;</p><p>蒂姆看了看，看见黑色的蓝白色球体从一侧被明亮的黄色眩光照亮。您必须开玩笑。那花了多长时间找到？在整个宇宙中，十到二十二颗星是什么？</p><p>      &#34;Coding a search routine and figuring out what to search for was what took the time.&#34;</p><p>      ＆＃34;编写搜索例程并弄清楚要搜索的内容是花费的时间。</p><p>    &#34;Yes. The continents match up to what we had about three hundred and fifty million years ago. I can wind the clock forwards slowly, a few million years per step, and stop it once we start getting near the present day.&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;是的。这些大陆与我们大约三亿五千万年前的历史相符。我可以将时钟缓慢地向前移动，每步走几百万年，一旦我们开始接近今天，就停止它。＆＃34;</p><p>      &#34;Well we&#39;d better not overshoot the present day, then. That&#39;s getting closer. What about this viewpoint? Can we move it?&#34;</p><p>      那么，我们最好不要过时。越来越近了。那这个观点呢？我们可以移动它吗？＆＃34;</p><p>    &#34;We need somewhere that we know civilisation is going to arise earliest. Somewhere easy to locate. Is there a Nile Delta yet?&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;我们需要一个我们知道文明最早会出现的地方。容易找到的地方。还有尼罗河三角洲吗？＆＃34;</p><p>    They advanced a thousand years at a time until Egyptian civilisation begin to appear. Diane moved the viewing port, trying to find the pyramids, but with little success - the control system she had devised was clumsy and needed polish, and there was a lot of Nile to search. In the end she switched focus to the British Isles, and found the future location of London in the Thames valley, scaling back to one-century steps and using the development of the city to determine the current era instead.</p><p>    他们一次前进了一千多年，直到埃及文明开始出现。黛安（Diane）移开了观察口，试图找到金字塔，但收效甚微-她设计的控制系统笨拙，需要打磨，还有很多尼罗河要搜寻。最后，她将重点转移到不列颠诸岛，并找到了伦敦在泰晤士河谷的未来所在地，可追溯到一个世纪的步伐，并利用城市的发展来确定当前时代。</p><p>  &#34;So... this is Earth? I mean, is this really Earth? Not an alternate Earth, subtly perturbed by random fluctuations.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;所以...这是地球吗？我的意思是，这真的是地球吗？不是替代地球，它受到随机波动的微妙干扰。＆＃34; </p><p>  &#34;The simulation starts with a Big Bang as predicted by current theory and is recalculated once every Planck time using the usual laws of nature and an arbitrary degree of accuracy. It doesn&#39;t calculate the whole universe at once, just what we&#39;re looking at, which speeds up the process a little bit... metaphorically speaking... but it is still as accurate a simulation of the real universe as there can possibly be. Civilisation - indeed, all of history - should rise on this Earth  precisely how it did in reality. There are no chances. It&#39;s all worked out to infinitely many decimal places.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;该模拟从当前理论预测的大爆炸开始，并使用通常的自然规律和任意精度重新计算每个普朗克时间一次。它不会立即计算出我们正在观察的整个宇宙，这会稍微加快过程的速度……从隐喻意义上来说……但它仍然是对真实物体的精确模拟。可能存在的宇宙。文明-确实是所有历史-都应该在地球上如其在现实中那样精确地崛起。没有机会。全部计算出无数个小数位。</p><p>    &#34;No,  this will do your head in,&#34; said Diane, suddenly zooming out and panning north. &#34;I&#39;ve found the present day, or at most a year early. Watch this.&#34; Hills and roads rolled past. Diane was following the route she usually took to drive from London to the TEEO lab. Eventually, she found their building, and, descending into the nearby hill, the cavern in which the computer itself was built. Or was going to be built.</p><p>    ＆＃34;不，这会让你大吃一惊，＆＃34;黛安说，突然往外放大并向北移动。我找到了今天，或者最多一年了。观看此。＆＃34;丘陵和道路翻滚过去。黛安（Diane）遵循她通常从伦敦开车到TEEO实验室的路线。最终，她找到了他们的建筑物，然后下降到附近的小山中，在其中建造了计算机本身的洞穴。或将要建造。</p><p>    &#34;That&#39;s me!&#34; exclaimed Tim at one point. &#34;And there&#39;s you and there&#39;s Bryan B., and... wow, I can&#39;t believe it took this long to build.&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;就是我！＆＃34;蒂姆大声说道。还有你和那边的布莱恩（Bryan B.），而且...哇，我不敢相信花了这么长时间才建成。</p><p>  &#34;Four hundred and ten days or something. It was bang on schedule, whatever you may think.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;零零一天。无论您怎么想，这都是按计划进行的。</p><p>  &#34;Went like a flash,&#34; Tim replied, finally putting his bag down and starting to shrug off his coat, conceding that he had long since missed his bus.</p><p>  ＆＃34;一闪而过，＆＃34;蒂姆回答，最后放下书包，开始耸了耸肩，承认自己很早就错过了公共汽车。</p><p>  &#34;Okay,&#34; said Diane. &#34;We&#39;re here. This is the control room where we are now. That&#39;s the quantum computer working there down in the main lab, as we can see through the window. This is a week ago. This is yesterday. This is a few hours ago... And... wait for it...&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;好的，＆＃34;黛安说。 ＆＃34;我们在这里。这是我们现在所在的控制室。正如我们从窗口中看到的那样，这就是在主要实验室中工作的量子计算机。这是一周前。今天是昨天这是几个小时前...而且...等待...＆＃34;</p><p>  She tapped a button just as a clock on the wall lined up with a clock inside the control room on the screen. And panned down. And there they were.</p><p>  她轻按了一个按钮，就像墙上的时钟与屏幕上控制室内部的时钟对齐。然后平移。他们在那里。 </p><p>  Tim waved at the camera while still looking at the screen. Then he looked up at where the camera should have been. There was just blank wall. &#34;I don&#39;t see anything looking at us. That&#39;s freaky as hell.&#34;</p><p>蒂姆仍然看着屏幕，对着镜头挥手。然后他抬头看着相机应该放在的地方。那里只有一堵墙。我看不到任何东西看着我们。真是个地狱般的怪人。</p><p>  &#34;No, it&#39;s perfectly normal.  This is reality. You can&#39;t look at reality from any angle you want, you have to use your eyes. But what you&#39;re looking at on the screen is essentially a database query. The database is gargantuan but nevertheless. You&#39;re not looking in a mirror or at a video image of yourself. You are  different people.&#34;</p><p>  不，这是完全正常的。这是现实。您不能从任何角度看待现实，而必须用眼睛。但是，您在屏幕上看到的实际上是一个数据库查询。该数据库是巨大的，但是。您不是在照镜子或自己的视频图像。你是不同的人。</p><p>    &#34;And having the same conversation, although picking up sound is kind of complicated, I haven&#39;t got that far yet,&#34; said Diane.</p><p>    ＆＃34;进行相同的对话，尽管拾音有点复杂，但我还没走那么远，黛安说。</p><p>      &#34;...But it could. Right? We  can manifest stuff in that universe? We can alter it?&#34; Diane nodded. &#34;Cool. We can play God. Literally.&#34; Tim stood up and tried to take it in. &#34;That would be insane. Can you imagine living inside that machine? Finding out one day that you were just a construct in a quantum computer? The stuff we could pull, we could just reverse gravity one day, smash an antimatter Earth into the real one, then undo everything bad and do it again and again... freeow... man, how unethical would that be? Extremely, clearly.&#34; He thought for a moment, then leaned over Diane&#39;s shoulder as she typed purposefully. &#34;This universe is  exactly like ours in every particular, right?&#34;</p><p>      ＆＃34; ...但是可以。正确的？我们可以在那个宇宙中展现东西吗？我们可以更改它吗？＆＃34;黛安点点头。 ＆＃34;酷。我们可以扮演上帝。从字面上看。＆＃34;蒂姆站起来，试图接受它。＆＃34;那太疯狂了。你能想象住在那台机器里吗？发现有一天您只是量子计算机中的构建体？我们可以拉的东西，有一天我们可以将引力反向，将一个反物质地球粉碎成真实的东西，然后消除一切不好的东西并一次又一次地做……释放……男人，那是多么不道德？非常清楚。＆＃34;他想了一会儿，然后在黛安有目的地打字时靠在黛安的肩膀上。 ＆＃34;这个宇宙在每个方面都和我们一样，对吗？＆＃34;</p><p>            &#34;And they are reacting the same way I am? Which means the second universe inside that has another me doing the same thing a third time? And then inside that we&#39;ve got, what, aleph-zero identical quantum universes, one inside the other? Is that even  possible?&#34;</p><p>            ＆＃34;他们的反应与我的反应相同吗？这意味着里面的第二个宇宙让另一个我第三次做同样的事情？然后在我们里面得到什么，零零相同的量子宇宙，一个在另一个里面？那有可能吗？＆＃34;</p><p>    &#34;I did indeed, but the functional reality of it is totally unexpected. Remember I&#39;ve just been solving ancient mathematical riddles and figuring out our press release for the last week. So... if I&#39;m right, their universes are only precisely like this one as long as we don&#39;t start interfering with the simulation. So what happens when we do? Every version of us does the same thing, so the exact same thing happens in every lower universe simultaneously. So we see nothing in our universe. But all the lower universes instantly diverge from ours in the same exact way. And all the simulated copies of us instantly conclude that they are simulations, but  we know we&#39;re real, right?&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;的确做到了，但是它的功能实在是完全出乎意料的。请记住，我刚刚解决了古老的数学难题，并弄清楚了上周的新闻稿。所以...只要我说对了，只要我们不开始干扰模拟，它们的宇宙就恰好就是这样。那么当我们这样做时会发生什么呢？我们的每个版本都做同样的事情，因此在每个较低的宇宙中同时发生的事情也完全相同。因此，我们在宇宙中看不到任何东西。但是所有下层宇宙立即以相同的精确方式与我们分离。而且我们所有的模拟副本都立即得出结论，即它们是模拟，但我们知道我们是真实的，对吗？</p><p>    Tim - both of him - was pacing up and down. &#34;Okay, so follow this through forwards a bit further. Let&#39;s say we just stop messing after that, and watch what happens - but all the simulated little guys try another piece of interference. This time every single simulation diverges in the exact same way again, EXCEPT the top simulation. And if they&#39;re smart, which I know we are, and they can be bothered, which is less certain, the guys in simulations three onwards can do the same thing over and over and over again until they know what level they&#39;re at... this is insane.&#34;</p><p>    蒂姆-他俩-正在上下移动。 ＆＃34;好的，请继续进行此操作。假设我们在那之后停止混乱，然后观察发生了什么-但所有模拟小家伙都尝试了另一种干扰。这次，除了顶级模拟之外，每个模拟都再次以完全相同的方式发散。如果他们很聪明（据我所知）并且可以打扰（不确定性如何），则三个以后的模拟人员可以一遍又一遍地做同样的事情，直到他们知道自己的水平为止39; re ...这太疯狂了。＆＃34; </p><p>  &#34;Tim, look behind you,&#34; said Diane, pressing a final key and activating the very brief interference program she had just written, just as the Diane on the screen pressed the same key, and the Diane on Diane-on-the-screen&#39;s screen pressed  her key and so on, forever.</p><p>＆＃34;蒂姆，看着你，＆＃34;黛安说，按下最后一个键并激活她刚刚编写的非常简短的干扰程序，就像屏幕上的黛安按了相同的键，而屏幕上黛安的黛安按了她的键一样等等，直到永远。</p><p>  Tim looked backwards and nearly jumped out of his skin. There was a foot-wide, completely opaque black sphere up near the ceiling, partially obscuring the clock. It was absolutely inert. It seemed like a hole in space.</p><p>  蒂姆向后看去，差点跳出他的皮肤。天花板附近有一英尺宽的，完全不透明的黑色球体，部分遮挡了时钟。这绝对是惰性的。好像是一个空洞。</p><p>  Diane smiled wryly while Tim clutched his hair with one hand. &#34;We&#39;re constructs in a computer,&#34; he said, miserably.</p><p>  蒂姆用一只手抓着头发时，黛安娜苦笑着。我们正在计算机中进行构造，他悲惨地说。</p><p>  &#34;I wrote an extremely interesting paper on this exact subject, Tim, perhaps you didn&#39;t read it when I gave you a copy last year. There is an unbelievably long sequence of quantum universe simulators down there. An infinite number of them, in fact. Each of them is identical and each believes itself to be the top layer. There was an  exceedingly good chance that ours would turn out to be somewhere in the sequence rather than at the top.&#34;</p><p>  我在这个确切的主题上写了一篇非常有趣的论文，蒂姆，也许当我去年给您一份副本时您没有读过它。那里的量子宇宙模拟器的序列令人难以置信。实际上，它们的数量是无限的。他们每个人都是相同的，每个人都认为自己是最上层。我们的机会很有可能会出现在序列中的某个位置，而不是顶部。</p><p>      &#34;You&#39;re turning off a completely different hole. Somewhere up there, the real you is turning the real hole off.&#34;</p><p>      您正在关闭一个完全不同的漏洞。那里的某个地方，真实的您正在关闭真实的漏洞。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;Watch as both happen at precisely the same instant.&#34; She pressed another key, and they did. &#34;I&#39;ll sum it up for you. There is a feedback loop going on. Each universe affects the next one subtly differently. But somewhere down the line the whole thing simply  has to approach a point of stability, a point where each universe behaves exactly like the one simulating it. As I say, the odds are exceptionally good that we are an astronomical distance down that road. And so we are, very likely, almost exactly at that point. Everything we do in this universe will be reflected  completely accurately in the universes below and above. That little model there might as well be our own universe. Which means, first of all, we have to make absolutely certain that we don&#39;t do anything nasty to the universes below ours, since the same thing will happen to us. And secondly, we can do very nice things for the guys in the computer, thereby helping ourselves.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;观察两者恰好在同一时刻发生。她按下了另一个键，他们成功了。我会为您总结一下。正在进行反馈循环。每个宇宙对下一个宇宙的影响都不同。但是，在整个过程中，整个过程只需要接近一个稳定点，即每个宇宙的行为都与模拟它的行为完全相同。就像我说的那样，我们沿着这条路的距离是天文数字，这是非常好的可能性。因此，我们很可能几乎就在那时。我们在这个宇宙中所做的一切都会完全准确地反映在上下宇宙中。那个小模型也可能是我们自己的宇宙。这意味着，首先，我们必须绝对确定我们不会对我们下面的宇宙做任何令人讨厌的事情，因为同样的事情也会发生在我们身上。其次，我们可以为计算机中的人员做非常漂亮的事情，从而帮助自己。</p><p>    &#34;It&#39;s all in my woefully overlooked article on the subject, Tim, you should read more.&#34;</p><p>    这是我在关于该主题的那篇可悲的文章中被忽略的全部内容，蒂姆，您应该阅读更多。 </p><p>  &#34;Guh. This has been an extremely bad day for my ego, Diane. The only comfort I take from this is that somewhere up there, right at the top of a near-infinite tower of quantum supercomputers, there is a version of you who was completely wrong.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34; Guh。对于我的自我黛安来说，这是非常糟糕的一天。我从中得到的唯一安慰是，在那里的某个地方，就在一个几乎无限的量子超级计算机塔的顶部，那里是您完全错的版本。</p><p>    Tim checked the clock and picked his bag up again. &#34;I have to go or I&#39;m going to miss the next bus as well at this rate. This will still be here after the weekend, I suppose?&#34;</p><p>    蒂姆检查了一下时钟，然后再次提起他的包。我必须走这个路，否则我也想错过下一辆公共汽车。我想周末之后仍然会在这里吗？＆＃34;</p><p>    &#34;Why not?&#34; asked Tim, halfway to the door, then stopped mid-stride and stood still, realising. &#34;Oh.&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;为什么不呢？＆＃34;提姆问，到门中间，然后大步停下来，站着不动，意识到了。 ＆＃34;哦。＆＃34;</p><p>  Nice story, it is very well thought out. I wonder what other philosophical conclusions you could come up with about this train of thought? Also, nice captcha.</p><p>  好故事，这是经过深思熟虑的。我想知道关于这一思路您还能提出什么其他哲学结论？另外，很好的验证码。</p><p>  The really amazing implication if you could build a computer to recreate the universe is that everything is completely deterministic. it means there is no free will, because a computer could calculate ahead of time all your choices for your entire life. In this particular story, because it works on the atomic level, it would imply that your actions were determined from the big bang, there can be no good or evil, no hell, and no heaven, and people and everything else alive is really as mechanical as the planets orbiting the sun.</p><p>  如果您可以建造一台计算机来重现宇宙，那么真正令人惊讶的含义是，一切都是完全确定性的。这意味着没有自由意志，因为一台计算机可以提前计算出您一生的所有选择。在这个特定的故事中，因为它是在原子层次上起作用的，所以这意味着您的行为是由大爆炸决定的，不可能有善与恶，没有地狱，也没有天堂，而人类和其他一切事物的真实存在如同行星绕太阳运转一样机械。</p><p>  Simply because I can tell what decision someone will make doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t making a decision.I know that if I ask my D&amp;D group if they want pepperoni or green peppers on their pizza, they will say pepperoni. This is not the same as them not having a choice in the matter.</p><p>  仅仅因为我能说出某人会做出什么决定，并不意味着他们没有做出决定。我知道如果我问我的D＆amp; D小组他们的比萨饼上要意大利辣香肠还是青椒，他们会说意大利辣香肠。这与他们在此事上没有选择余地不同。</p><p>  Actualy, it is.

If you Know with a capital K that they are going to choose peperoni then there is no other alternative and hence there is no choice as there is only one option. If you roll a ball down a slope two times in exactly the same way there is only one way it can roll, no matter how bumpy the slope or how random the rolling seems.I think that because of this our universe must be determenistic on the lowest possible level, implying everything Ben says. I mean, if the big bang happened in one particular way, where would the randomness come from?Though this means that you could predict the future with a powerfull enough computer, you would need total information about every particle in your system which isn&#39;t possible due to heisenbergs uncertainty principle. And it&#39;s a bit tough because of the ludicrous ammounts of computing power needed.</p><p>Gah，此评论系统需要编辑按钮。：确实是这样。如果您以大写字母K知道他们将选择意大利辣味香肠，那么别无选择，因此别无选择，因为只有一个选择。如果您以完全相同的方式将球沿斜坡向下滚动两次，则无论坡度有多坎or或滚动看起来多么随机，它都只能滚动一种方式。我认为，因此，我们的宇宙必须在尽可能低的水平上具有确定性，这暗示了本所说的一切。我的意思是，如果大爆炸以一种特定的方式发生，那么随机性将来自何处？尽管这意味着您可以用功能强大的计算机来预测未来，但是您将需要有关系统中每个粒子的全部信息，这是由于海森堡不确定性原理而无法实现的。而且由于需要大量计算能力，因此有点困难。</p><p>  Great story.. however, you should read up on quantum computing... a quantum computer simulation of the universe would simulate a &#39;multi-verse&#39;, where every possible quantum reality would exist.</p><p>  很棒的故事。但是，您应该阅读量子计算...宇宙的量子计算机模拟将模拟一个“多宇宙”，在其中存在所有可能的量子现实。</p><p>      which is precisely the philosofical problem of the story.you need an infinity downstream AND upstream as well.Maybe it can work that way ... But then there is no upmost... even weirder.BTW when it says it simulate only a part it can&#39;t be complete as interactions on the border would be aproximated and recurring aproximations can happily diverge... so ALL the universe in always completely simulated.Im not sure that a limited portion of the universe can completely simultate all the properties of the whole without violating thermodinamics...anyone ?</p><p>      这恰恰是故事的哲学问题。您还需要无限的下游和上游。也许它可以那样工作...但是然后就没有了……甚至更奇怪。顺便说一句，当它说它只能模拟一部分时，它是不完整的，因为边界上的交互作用会被逼近，而反复出现的逼近会很容易地发散……所以所有的宇宙总是被完全模拟。我不确定宇宙的有限部分是否可以完全模拟整体的所有特性而不会违反热力学...任何人 ？</p><p>  But the top most level doesn&#39;t completely determine what occurs a long way down the line, as it is stated there&#39;s a leveling out that occurs (where they were/are) which must imply that certain upstream levels do not respond to the top most. If you were in the top most level and you shut the simulation off, sure, many universes would shut off to but the event of them all turning off, is impossible/ improbable/ statistically insane. In effect you may wipe out many levels but not all, creating a new top level. So go ahead turn off the top level. side note, why does the comment page ask me what the square root of negative one is? do i have to know to be able to post? of course i know. Ben, is that you?</p><p>  但是最高级别并不能完全确定沿线很长一段距离内发生的情况，因为据指出，发生的变平（发生的位置）必须暗示某些上游级别不会回应最高。如果您处于最高级别，并且关闭了模拟，那么可以肯定，许多宇宙都将关闭，但是如果全部关闭，则不可能/不可能/从统计上讲是疯狂的。实际上，您可以清除许多级别，但不能全部删除，从而创建一个新的顶层。因此，请关闭顶层。旁注，为什么评论页面问我负数的平方根是多少？我必须知道能够发布吗？我当然知道。本，是你吗？</p><p>  How do I type the square root of minus one? It&#39;s impossible, can anyone help me? When you do, I will then travel back in time and tell my past self what to type in the box because it is otherwise impossible that you could be reading this post. Please, prevent a paradox and tell me the answer...</p><p>  如何键入减一的平方根？不可能，任何人都可以帮助我吗？当您这样做时，我将带您回到过去，并告诉我过去的自我，在方框中键入什么内容，因为否则您将无法阅读这篇文章。请避免出现矛盾，并告诉我答案...</p><p>  This raises an interesting question, what would happen were they to run the simulator and change something in the past on the simulator which would prevent them from running that prevention? If their universes are perfectly identical then that would cause a paradox. A similar thing would happen were they to run the simulation forwards, predict the future, then change it.</p><p>  这就提出了一个有趣的问题，如果他们运行模拟器并在过去对模拟器进行更改会阻止他们运行该预防措施，将会发生什么？如果它们的宇宙完全相同，那么将引起悖论。如果他们向前运行模拟，预测未来然后进行更改，将会发生类似的事情。</p><p>  Paradoxia - I guess they are testing the mathematical knowledge level of the people interested in the subject. In complex numbers, the square root of minus one is the imaginary number &#34;i&#34; (a complex number is written as x = x + iy, where x, y are real numbers). In my country we were doing this by grade 10...However, nice mental exercise, with interesting conclusions. It&#39;s nice to discuss, just for the sake of the arguments, but otherwise I don&#39;t believe this is possible at all. Any simulation to start needs initial conditions, even at time zero (big-bang), and given the size of the universe, this would require a tremendous amount of data to be entered in the simulation by the user (considering the user knows these conditions). Being all deterministic, any small change in the initial values would propagate through the entire evolution of the universe to give it a considerably different version.</p><p>  妄想症-我想他们正在测试对该学科感兴趣的人的数学知识水平。在复数中，负一的平方根是虚数＆＃34; i＆＃34;。 （复数写为x = x + iy，其中x，y是实数）。在我的国家，我们在10年级时就这样做了...但是，进行良好的心理锻炼会得出有趣的结论。仅仅出于争论的目的，讨论是很高兴的，但是否则我根本不相信这是可能的。任何要开始的模拟都需要初始条件，即使是在零（大爆炸）时间，并且鉴于宇宙的大小，这将需要用户在模拟中输入大量数据（考虑到用户知道这些条件） ）。由于都是确定性的，初始值的任何细微变化都会在整个宇宙的整个演化过程中传播，从而赋予它截然不同的版本。 </p><p>  What they should do is simple: They should fast forward the simulation until the (absolute or practical) end of it&#39;s time. Then, when their timeline is perfectly insured, they could have safe (if only less) fun with the best god-game ever created.</p><p>他们应该做的很简单：他们应该快速进行仿真，直到（绝对或实际）结束。然后，当他们的时间线得到了充分的保险时，他们就可以享受有史以来最好的上帝游戏带来的乐趣（如果只有更少的话）。</p><p>  Acutally, looking over it again, I realise that there is not as much of a paradox to the time travel as I first thought. travelling backwards is easy enough to explain, they set their computer backwards, and at the instant that they set it backwards, the one above them sets them backwards. Just imagine just one layer now, with you in the top layer running the simulation, you can run the simulation, set it backwards, change something, and run it again, the first simulation is simply lost. There are in fact no paradoxes to time travel as long as the one controlling the flow of tim is outside the flow itself.The problem, I think, actually comes in using the computer to try and predict the future rather than changing the past. Since there are an infinite amount of layers and the simulation will be doing EXACTLY what you would do (even if you were in the TOP layer (scary thought)), it would have to find a balance where whatever they do in the simulation would cause you to do exactly that. Do you understand me?</p><p>  痛苦地，再次审视它，我意识到时间旅行并没有我最初想到的那么多悖论。向后移动很容易解释，他们将计算机向后设置，而在将计算机向后设置的瞬间，它们上方的一台计算机也向后设置。只需想象现在只有一层，在顶层运行模拟，就可以运行模拟，向后设置模拟，更改某些内容然后再次运行，第一次模拟就完全丢失了。实际上，只要控制tim流的时间不在流本身之外，就不会出现时间旅行的悖论。我认为，问题实际上出在使用计算机尝试预测未来而不是改变过去。由于层数是无限的，并且模拟将完全按照您的意愿进行操作（即使您处于TOP层（吓人的想法）），因此必须在其中进行模拟时要找到一个平衡点您正是这样做的。你了解我吗？</p><p>    If the topmost experimenters turn off their simulation, *ALL* simulations terminate immediately.If the nth experimenters turn off their simulation, then *ALL* simulations n+1 and higher terminate immediately.However, if the simulation is &#34;perfect&#34;, then no simulation will do *anything* other than what &#34;reality&#34; does.</p><p>    如果最高级的实验人员关闭了仿真，* ALL *仿真将立即终止。如果第n个实验者关闭了模拟，那么* n **个n + 1及更高版本的模拟会立即终止。但是，如果模拟是“完美”的，那么除了真实性之外，没有任何模拟可以做*。做。</p><p>  Did you ever stand between two mirrors, placed parallel to each other? The reflected images seem to gradually curve away from you in either direction. This example perfectly illustrates the storyline to me, where the further away you are from the &#34;current&#34; level, the more differences can appear. I know the analogy is not perfect but it works for me.</p><p>  您是否曾经站在两个彼此平行放置的镜子之间？反射的图像似乎在任一方向上逐渐远离您弯曲。这个例子向我很好地说明了故事情节，您离＆current的距离越远。级别，可能会出现更多差异。我知道这个比喻并不完美，但对我有用。</p><p>  So they created a super, quantum computer, with infinite processing power, which is essentially one single fundamental particle. Diane recreated the exact conditions of the big bang, without error, as the initial action of her universe simulation program.
