Part of it discusses charter vs state schools and the allegations of fraud of various kinds undermining charter schools record of better achievement. Reading it, I realized that I took for granted that public schools engage in systematic fraud in a variety of ways. I don’t think this is something everyone understands, hence this post.</p><p>我正在阅读Slate Star Codex对“智能法则”的评论。它的一部分讨论了特许学校与公立学校以及各种欺诈指控，这些损害了特许学校成绩的记录。通过阅读，我意识到我认为公立学校以各种方式从事系统性欺诈是理所当然的。我认为这不是每个人都可以理解的，因此这篇文章。</p><p> I went to a state school in the UK. State schools are rated on a 1 − 4 scale from unsatisfactory to outstanding. My school was rated good, meaning a 3. A few memories which stand out. During my first week I saw one of the boys in my class who was 11 at the time held up against the wall in a corridor while a 16 year old put a shiv to his throat and robbed him. He handed over his wallet and keys. A year or two later and I remember seeing a small boy who struggled with depression held up by the throat against a locker and slapped in the face by a troublemaker from the same class in front of everyone just before we went in to the classroom. I remember classes which were filled start to finish with people shouting and talking. Neither of the first two events were common but they also weren’t uncommon. No one was surprised to witness them. It’s worth emphasizing again that my school was above average, in fact quite far above average, and in a middle class area. It’s also worth noting that I was mostly in top ability streamed classes, meaning my classroom experience was likely far better than average.</p><p> 我去了英国的一所公立学校。从不满意到优秀，国立学校的评分为1-4分。我的学校被评为好，意思是3。一些回忆很突出。在我的第一个星期里，我看到班上的一个男孩当时是11岁，当时在走廊上靠墙站着，而一个16岁的男孩则用细屑把他的喉咙抢劫了。他交出了钱包和钥匙。一两年后，我还记得一个小男孩，他在与抑郁症作斗争时，被喉咙紧贴着一个储物柜，并被同班的同班同学在我们走进教室之前在每个人面前拍了拍脸。我记得，随着人们大喊大叫而结束的课堂开始了。前两个事件都不是很普遍，但也很常见。没有人惊讶地看到他们。再次需要强调的是，我的学校处于中等偏上水平，高于平均水平，实际上远远高于平均水平。还应该指出的是，我主要参加了一流的流媒体课程，这意味着我的课堂学习体验可能比平均水平要好得多。</p><p> There were many ways in which the school and teachers gamed the system to boost their measured performance. One way was to do exams for students. I was on a bottom set language class for French. After two years I literally couldn’t speak a single sentence in french and maybe knew 20 words in total. I still passed my exams. How? We did the tests in class. Often the teacher would go through them with us. Literally giving us the test and then going through each question on the whiteboard and telling us what to write. A different year and a different teacher, this time the teacher would sit next to us and write the answers down. Why sit next to us? It was the bottom set so people often wouldn’t even bother to write down the answer if they were told it. This kind of thing was normal, so much so that I, and I think most people there, didn’t realize anything unusual was happening.</p><p> 学校和教师可以通过多种方式来玩系统，以提高他们的考核成绩。一种方法是为学生做考试。我上法语的基础语言课。两年后，我几乎不会说一句话法语，也许总共知道20个字。我仍然通过了考试。如何？我们在课堂上做了测试。老师经常会和我们一起经历它们。从字面上给我们测试，然后遍历白板上的每个问题并告诉我们该写什么。不同的年份和不同的老师，这次老师将坐在我们旁边，写下答案。为什么坐在我们旁边？这是最低设置，因此，如果人们被告知答案，人们通常甚至都不会费心写下答案。这种事情很正常，以至于我和我在那里的大多数人都没有意识到正在发生任何异常情况。</p><p> Another way schools game metrics is to cheat inspections. A major component of how schools are judged in the UK is through independent inspections carried out by an independent quasi-governmental organization called Ofsted. Now, you may imagine that these inspections would be unannounced, so as to best get a real image of how a school works. Not the case. They’re scheduled well in advance. Before every inspection, a few things would happen in my school:</p><p> 学校游戏指标的另一种方法是欺骗检查。在英国，如何评判学校的一个主要因素是通过一个独立的准政府组织（称为Ofsted）进行的独立检查。现在，您可能会想知道这些检查不会被宣布，以便最好地了解学校的运作方式。并非如此。他们提前安排好了。在每次检查之前，我的学校会发生一些事情：</p><p> The worst troublemaker kids would be taken aside and put in a special room where inspectors wouldn’t see them. Either that or they would just be told not to come into school at all on that day.</p><p> 最糟糕的制造麻烦的孩子将被带到一个特别的房间，检查员不会看到他们。要么要么被告知他们那天根本不上学。</p><p> All of us were told in assembly that an inspection was coming and to be on our best behavior on that day. Often teachers would have conversations with less serious troublemakers and impress on them that they would behave on that day or face consequences afterwards.</p><p> 在组装时，我们所有人都被告知要进行检查，并在当日采取我们的最佳行为。通常，教师会与不太认真的麻烦制造者进行对话，并给他们留下深刻印象，即他们当天会表现良好或事后面临后果。</p><p> Teachers would put a great deal more effort into their lesson plans than was normal. Classroom behavior management would also be far stricter.Because of these and other measures my school during an inspection was utterly different than my school on a normal day. On some level this isn’t surprising. If teachers’ promotions and management’s jobs depend on good inspection results and inspections are easy to game, people will game them. Incentives drive behavior. But it’s still sad.</p><p> 与正常情况相比，教师会在课程计划上付出更多的努力。课堂行为管理也将更加严格。由于这些措施和其他措施，我的学校在检查期间与正常情况下的学校完全不同。在某种程度上，这并不奇怪。如果教师的晋升和管理工作取决于良好的检查结果，并且检查工作容易进行，人们就会对此进行比赛。激励驱动行为。但是还是很伤心 </p><p> Another way the stats were gamed was by not recording bad behavior. When a school gives a detention or suspends/​expels a student, there’s a record of it. This is especially true of suspensions, students being sent home or expulsions. The more of these you have, the worse you look as a school. The solution then is obvious, don’t punish people or punish them in non-recorded ways. Again, in my school it was completely normal for students in lower sets to swear at the teacher, talk over them or disrupt the class for everyone else. It was normal for someone to be aggressive and abusive towards others and to face at most a 40 minute detention, but even getting a detention would be unusual.</p><p>统计数据的另一种方式是不记录不良行为。学校被拘留或暂停/开除学生时，会有记录。对于停学，将学生送回家或驱逐出境尤为如此。您拥有的这些越多，您的学校状况就越差。这样，解决方案就显而易见了，不要惩罚人们或以未记录的方式惩罚他们。再说一次，在我的学校里，低位学生向老师发誓，与他们交谈或对其他人造成干扰是完全正常的。一个人对他人进行攻击和侮辱并最多面临40分钟的拘留是正常的，但是即使被拘留也很罕见。</p><p> I realize that one data point is not enough to draw solid general conclusions. My own perception is that this kind of fraud wasn’t specific to my school. My cousin went to a state school fairly nearby. He’s 4 years younger than me. During one of my winters back from undergrad we discussed his school and his experiences mirrored mine. His exact words regarding inspections were “I learned 4 times more that day than any other day that year. It was amazing”. I talked to a few British students at university, although specifically the not middle/​upper class ones who would have gone to public schools. They had gone to schools similar to mine in different parts of the country and their stories were similar and often worse. Two particularly funny examples from my friends’ experiences stand out. A teacher in year 9 walked up to a student who was talking, picked them up and threw them out of an (open) first floor window. My friend sitting in class noticed two boys making fun of him and then proceeded to get up in the middle of class while the teacher was talking, walk to their table, flip the table upwards to hit them in the face before going to sit down again when the teacher told him to. (Remember, my friend was a studious, sporty Asian kid and not a troublemaker. This kind of thing is normal in that environment). Comedic stories aside, my experiences in school, while not universal, seem fairly common in the UK and from what I’ve read of the statistics, bad US schools are far, far worse.</p><p> 我意识到一个数据点不足以得出可靠的一般性结论。我个人认为这种欺诈行为并非我学校所特有。我堂兄去了附近的一所公立学校。他比我小四岁。在我从本科生回来的一个冬天里，我们讨论了他的学校，他的经历也反映了我的情况。他关于检查的确切说法是“那天我学到的知识比那年的任何一天都要多四倍。这是惊人的”。我与大学里的一些英国学生进行了交谈，尽管特别是那些不会上公立学校的中上阶层学生。他们曾在该国不同地区上过与我的学校相似的学校，他们的故事相似，而且往往更糟。我朋友的经历中有两个特别有趣的例子。 9年级的一位老师走到一个正在谈话的学生那里，将他们捡起并从一楼（打开的）窗户扔出去。我的一位坐在教室里的朋友注意到两个男孩在取笑他，然后在老师谈话时在教室中部起床，走到他们的桌子，向上翻转桌子以打他们的脸，然后再次坐下。当老师告诉他。 （请记住，我的朋友是一个勤奋好学的运动型亚洲孩子，而不是麻烦制造者。在这种环境下，这种事情很正常）。除了喜剧故事以外，我在学校的经历虽然不是普遍的，但在英国似乎相当普遍，从我对统计数据的了解来看，糟糕的美国学校远非如此。</p><p>  Charters may cook their books in various ways. In the UK, State schools do too. I would be surprised if it wasn’t also the case in the US.</p><p>  宪章可以以各种方式来制作书籍。在英国，公立学校也这样做。如果在美国也并非如此，我会感到惊讶。</p><p> I think that I feel like a lot of commentators on places like SSC have fairly middle class experiences of fairly good schools and that bleeds into how their comparison between state vs charter schools. It’s just good to remember that it’s not those nice middle class schools that charters typically replace.</p><p> 我认为，在SSC之类的地方，很多评论员都拥有相当好的学校的中产阶级经历，这让他们对公立和特许学校之间的比较感到困惑。请记住，并不是通常由宪章取代的那些好的中产阶级学校。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Yv9aj9bWD5H7aaDdy/how-my-school-gamed-the-stats">https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/Yv9aj9bWD5H7aaDdy/how-my-school-gamed-the-stats</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/学校/">#学校</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/gamed/">#gamed</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
