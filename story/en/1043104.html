I got the Covid six weeks ago and yesterday I was declared virus free. I had what was called a moderate case of Covid. I was never hospitalized. I was never in any real danger of death. But I was in bed for three weeks. It knocked me on my ass.</p><p>我是一个狂热的幸存者。六个星期前我获得了Covid，昨天我被宣布没有病毒。我有所谓的Covid中度病例。我从未住院过。我从来没有真正的死亡危险。但是我躺在床上三个星期。它把我撞倒了。</p><p> I have been talking about my covid when I go out and a lot of people are interested in what it really means to have a moderate case of Covid. I don’t claim to speak for every Covid patient. I certainly can’t speak for the ones who went into the hospital and are on ventilators. But I think the majority of people have a moderate case of Covid so I thought I would write this up for people that were interested.</p><p> 我外出时一直在谈论我的covid，很多人都对拥有适度Covid病例的真正含义感兴趣。我并不是说要为每位Covid患者讲话。我当然不能代表那些去医院呼吸机的人。但是我认为大多数人的Covid病情中等，所以我想为有兴趣的人写这篇文章。</p><p> I had what is called a moderate case of covid which according to the CDC is about 20% of covid cases. About 80% of covid cases are classified as &#34;mild&#34; which basically means no symptoms at all or very minor symptoms like you would have with a flu that you have for a few days. 1% of covid cases are &#34;severe&#34; and require hospitalization.</p><p> 我有一个所谓的中度covid病例，根据CDC的说法，这大约是covid病例的20％。大约80％的共生病例被分类为“轻度”。这基本上意味着根本没有症状，也没有非常轻微的症状，就像几天后出现的流感一样。严重病例中有1％为“严重”；并需要住院。</p><p> According to the CDC,when COVID-19 symptoms progress from mild to moderate, you’ll know because one or more of the following may occur: Your fever will be above 100.4 F. You’ll develop a more persistent cough. You’ll experience temporary shortness of breath when you exert yourself – going up the stairs for instance. You’ll feel like you need to stay in bed. If this occurs, call your doctor. The virus could be progressing into pneumonia.</p><p> 根据CDC的资料，当COVID-19症状从轻度变为中度时，您会知道，因为可能发生以下一种或多种情况：发烧会超过100.4F。您会咳嗽更加持久。劳累时会出现短暂的呼吸急促，例如上楼梯。您会觉得自己需要卧床休息。如果发生这种情况，请致电您的医生。该病毒可能正在发展为肺炎。</p><p> I had &#34;You’ll feel like you need to stay in bed&#34;. The covid knocked me on my ass. I spent three weeks in bed, didn&#39;t eat, and slept 12 to14 hours a day.</p><p> 我有＆＃34;您会觉得您需要卧床＆＃34;。那个狂热的家伙把我撞倒了。我在床上呆了三个星期，没吃饭，每天睡12到14个小时。</p><p>   I don’t know how I got the Covid. I actually feel like I’ve been pretty careful since the Covid started. When Oklahoma Governor Stitt came to speak to our local chamber of commerce about six months ago there were about 200 people in the audience and I was sitting on the front row and I had on my mask and Governor Stitt did not have on a mask and he got the Covid about two weeks after that. And most of the 200 people in the audience did not wear masks. So I was pretty careful. I was in the top 1% of people who were social distancing and wearing masks and trying to stay at home when there weren&#39;t many people wearing masks and a lot of people weren&#39;t taking covid seriously it seemed.</p><p>   我不知道如何获得Covid。实际上，自Covid成立以来，我一直在非常小心。大约六个月前，当俄克拉荷马州州长史蒂特（Stitt）来我们当地的商会讲话时，观众约有200人，我坐在前排，戴着口罩，史蒂特州长没有戴着口罩，他大约两周后获得了Covid。观众中的200人中大多数没有戴口罩。所以我非常小心。在没有社交的人和戴着口罩的人中，当我没有社交的时候，我似乎是最差的1％。</p><p> I do not know how I got the Covid. I have been basically quarantining in my house since about March. I would go out shopping once or twice a week or to the post office or to stop in and see my best friend down at his store. But I would always wear a mask when I got out of the car and I would be careful to social distance. So who knows how I got it. Maybe somebody who had Covid sneezed and one minute later I walked through it and that’s where it came from.</p><p> 我不知道我是怎么得到Covid的。从三月份开始，我基本上一直在我的房子里隔离。我会每周购物一次或两次，或者去邮局逛街，或者进去看看我最好的朋友在他的商店逛街。但是当我下车时，我总是会戴上口罩，并且要小心与社会保持距离。所以谁知道我是怎么得到的。也许有人被Covid打喷嚏，一分钟后，我穿过了它，那是它的来源。 </p><p> Now the interesting thing is I knew I got it almost right away. I monitor my health pretty closely. I have been doing this for several years. I keep a daily chart and I write down my weight my O2 level, my temperature, and my blood pressure so I notice any changes in any of my vital signs right away.</p><p>现在有趣的是，我知道我几乎马上就知道了。我非常密切地监视我的健康状况。我已经做了几年了。我保留每日图表，并记下体重，O2水平，体温和血压，以便立即注意到我生命体征的任何变化。</p><p>  On November 24 I felt a little fever so I measured my temperature and it was 101. I kept checking my temperature on an hourly basis and it stayed above 100 for four or five hours. Then it dropped back down to normal and I didn’t really think anything about it.</p><p>  11月24日，我感到有点发烧，因此测量体温为101。我一直每小时检查一次体温，并且在4到5个小时内一直保持在100以上。然后它又恢复到正常水平，我对此一无所知。</p><p> I called my doctor the next day and told him that I had noticed that temperature rise and he told me to go in and get a covid test and so I did and it came back positive two hours later.</p><p> 第二天，我打电话给我的医生，告诉他我已经注意到体温上升，他告诉我进去进行covid检测，所以我照做了，两个小时后又恢复了阳性。</p><p> My doctor sent me over to our local hospital and I had some x-rays taken of my chest. They were looking for viral pneumonia. While I was at the hospital I started feeling lightheaded and I started to hear a ringing in my ears. I felt like my blood pressure was falling so I sat down and after they finished my x-ray I asked them to get me a wheelchair and took me out to my car and I was able to drive home safely. It is the first time in my life I have asked for a wheelchair but I just didn&#39;t feel right. I don’t know it was if I felt bad because of the Covid or if I was just coming to the realization that I might have Covid.</p><p> 我的医生把我送到了当地医院，我的胸部拍了X光片。他们正在寻找病毒性肺炎。当我在医院时，我开始感到头晕，并且开始听到耳鸣。我感觉自己的血压正在下降，所以我坐下，等他们完成X射线检查后，我要求他们给我坐轮椅，将我带到汽车上，我才得以安全回家。这是我一生中第一次要求轮椅，但我当时感觉不对。我不知道是因为Covid而感到难过还是只是意识到我可能拥有Covid。</p><p> You can see the photograph of me sitting at the dining room table 3 days after I was diagnosed with covid and I’m feeling pretty good. I’m not really feeling sick. I’m feeling like hey maybe I’m one of those guys who is asymptomatic or hardly has any symptoms at all. I still had my appetite. Food still tasted good. I was up and around and paying bills and doing stuff around the house. But that wasn’t gonna last much longer.</p><p> 在我被诊断出患有狂犬病之后三天，您可以看到我坐在饭厅餐桌上的照片，感觉还不错。我不是真的很恶心。我感觉像是嘿，也许我是无症状或几乎没有任何症状的人之一。我仍然有胃口。食物仍然很好吃。我在周围走来走去，在屋子周围付账单和做东西。但这不会持续更长的时间。</p><p> About four days in, I started feeling weak. I didn’t feel like getting up out of bed in the morning.</p><p> 大约四天后，我开始感到虚弱。我不想早上起床。</p><p> I lost my appetite. Food really held no allure for me. I just didn’t feel like eating and I didn’t eat. For some reason I was able to eat Jell-O and I guess I ate Jell-O for about two weeks. But covid knocked me on my ass. I was laying in bed all day long. I was sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day.</p><p> 我食欲不振。食物对我真的没有吸引力。我只是不喜欢吃，我不吃。由于某种原因，我能够吃Jell-O，而且我猜我吃了Jell-O大约两个星期。但是科维奇把我打倒了。我整天躺在床上。我每天睡12到14个小时。 </p><p> Luckily that’s as bad as it got. I was very fatigued and tired but I did not feel unwell. I was able to keep my food down. My stomach was not really upset. My stool was regular. I was getting up to urinate about 20 times a day. I wasn&#39;t drinking that much so I don’t know where that came from. But I spent about three weeks in bed and for two of them I couldn’t of got out of bed it would’ve taken a fire for me to get out of the house.</p><p>幸运的是，情况糟透了。我感到非常疲劳和疲倦，但没有感到不适。我能够把食物压低。我的胃并没有真正不适。我的大便很规律。我每天要小便20次。我没喝那么多酒，所以我不知道那是哪里来的。但是我花了大约三个星期的时间在床上，其中有两个我无法起床，这让我起火了。</p><p>   I was spending each day spitting up phlegm. The mucus in my lungs was attacking the virus like white blood cells defending the body. And they would engulf the virus and I was expelling the mucus and the dead virus.</p><p>   我每天都在吐痰。我肺部的黏液像保护人体的白细胞一样，在攻击病毒。而且它们会吞没病毒，而我正在驱逐粘液和死亡的病毒。</p><p> The mucus was green. The mucus was red. Some days the mucus was blue. I saw yellow mucus. I was getting up and getting in my hot tub to kind of jiggle my body around to break the mucus up so I could spit it out.</p><p> 粘液是绿色的。粘液是红色的。有时候粘液是蓝色的。我看到黄色的粘液。我起床后进入热水浴池，使我的身体在微弱地晃动，使粘液破裂，这样我就可以吐出来了。</p><p> The covid was not particularly unpleasant. Even when I was spitting up the phlegm it wasn&#39;t particularly disagreeable. But keep in mind that I was in pretty good shape before I got the covid and I had good lung capacity. For the past year I’ve been doing treadmill twice a week and getting myself into the aerobic zone for 40 minutes each session and so I had good endurance and good lung capacity.</p><p> covid并不是特别令人不愉快。即使当我吐痰时，也不是特别令人讨厌。但是请记住，在我获得胎膜早破和良好的肺活量之前，我的身体状况相当不错。在过去的一年中，我每周都要做两次跑步机，每次训练都要进入有氧区40分钟，因此我的耐力和肺活量都很好。</p><p> If I had not been in that good of shape it would have been a lot more difficult for me to breath. At no point did my oxygen level drop below 90%. That was the danger point. My doctor told me if my oxygen level dropped that low I should go to the emergency room. I wanted to avoid that at all costs. My late wife was a doctor and always told me to stay out of the hospital. That&#39;s where people go to die, she would say.</p><p> 如果我身体状况不佳，那么呼吸会困难得多。我的氧气含量从未下降到90％以下。那是危险点。我的医生告诉我，如果我的氧气水平下降到这么低，我应该去急诊室。我想不惜一切代价避免这种情况。我已故的妻子是一名医生，总是告诉我不要去医院。她会说，那是人们死亡的地方。</p><p> I had significant weight loss. I have weighed about 206 for the past 10 years for a BMI which is at the high end of normal for my 6&#39;4&#34; frame.</p><p> 我的体重明显减轻。在过去的10年中，我的BMI体重约为206，在我的6＆＃4＆＃34;体重指数中处于正常水平帧。</p><p> I lost my desire to eat with covid. It wasn’t that food nauseated me or made me feel ill. Food just held no attraction for me. I would eat a little Jell-O every day and that was fine but I had no desire to eat anything more substantial.</p><p> 我失去了与covid一起吃饭的欲望。食物不是让我感到恶心或使我感到不适。食物对我来说没有吸引力。我每天都会吃一点果冻，这很好，但是我不想吃任何更多的东西。 </p><p> I dropped 25 pounds. My weight went from 206 to 178. I didn’t have a loss of taste or smell. I could still taste my food. I just had no desire to eat it.</p><p>我掉了25磅。我的体重从206上升到178。我没有失去味觉或嗅觉。我仍然可以品尝我的食物。我只是不想吃它。</p><p> Another symptom that I had was bleeding gums. I went into brush my teeth one day and when I looked in the sink it was filled with blood. I looked at my gums and they were bleeding and they looked like they were receding and I got kind of scared about that. I called my dentist about it and he called me back later and said he done some research and he couldn’t find any connection between Covid and bleeding gums.</p><p> 我的另一个症状是牙龈出血。一天，我刷了牙，看着水槽里充满了血。我看着我的牙龈，他们正在流血，看上去好像在退缩，对此我感到有些害怕。我打电话给我的牙医，后来他给我回了电话，说他做了一些研究，他发现Covid和牙龈出血之间没有任何联系。</p><p> He prescribed some special mouthwash for me which I already had and I started using that instead of brushing my teeth and I think that kept my gums from bleeding more.</p><p> 他给我开了一些特殊的漱口水，我开始用它代替刷牙，我认为这可以防止牙龈出血。</p><p> The other thing I did is start taking megadoses of vitamin C. I was taking 1000 mg three times a day.</p><p> 我做的另一件事是开始服用大剂量的维生素C。我一天服用1000毫克，三次。</p><p> I remembered how sailors used to get scurvy because they didn’t get enough vitamin C and they had bleeding gums so I figured what do I have to lose. I don’t know if it was the placebo effect but after about two days of Vitamin C my gums stopped bleeding. I was able to get a soft bristle brush so I could brush my teeth without irritating my gums a lot. When I told my doctor about this he sent me in for some blood test he said it’s possible that I am low on my platelets or that I have some impaired liver function.</p><p> 我记得水手们曾经因为缺乏维生素C和牙龈出血而变得坏血病，所以我想出了我该失去的东西。我不知道这是否是安慰剂作用，但是服用维生素C大约两天后，我的牙龈就停止了流血。我能够得到柔软的猪鬃刷，这样就可以刷牙而又不会刺激我的牙龈。当我告诉我的医生时，他派我去接受血液检查，他说我的血小板可能不足或肝功能受损。</p><p>  Now here’s the strangest part of my story. I was in bed sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day for about two weeks. I started having nightmares every night. These are the nightmares where you can&#39;t wake up and you’re drowning and you are gasping for your last breath of air. You feel like you are dying and you wake up and your lungs are heaving and you’re bathed in sweat.</p><p>  现在，这是我故事中最奇怪的部分。我每天躺在床上睡12到14个小时，大约两个星期。我每天晚上开始做噩梦。在这些噩梦中，您无法醒来，溺水而倒吸一口气。您感觉自己快要死了，醒来了，肺部胀了，汗流bath背。</p><p> I had these nightmares every night like clockwork. They were terrible and I began to dread falling asleep. I know that I was not in my right mind while I had the nightmares. The nightmares were so realistic that they felt like hallucinations.</p><p> 我每天晚上都像发条一样做噩梦。他们太可怕了，我开始害怕入睡。我知道做噩梦时我不在头脑中。噩梦是如此逼真，以至于它们像幻觉一样。 </p><p> I began to carry on conversations with my father who has been dead 20 years and with my wife who has been dead for three. That part wasn&#39;t scary. I knew it wasn&#39;t really happening but I just went with the flow.</p><p>我开始与已经去世20年的父亲和已经去世3年的妻子进行对话。那部分并不可怕。我知道那不是真的，但我只是顺其自然。</p><p> Every night I would relive five years of my life. I started out in grade school and remembered the kids that were sitting next to me in first grade and the teachers and the bullies and I would be reliving that and seeing the people that I knew. A lot of them are dead now.</p><p> 每天晚上，我都会重温五年的生活。我刚从小学毕业的时候，就想起了一年级时坐在我旁边的孩子们，老师和欺凌者，我会自以为是，看到我认识的人。现在很多人已经死了。</p><p> They were confronting me. They were asking me what I was doing with my life. I relived the mistakes I made in my life. It was very intense. I worked through my life five years a night and at the end of 14 days I had reached age 70 and I felt like I had revisited my whole life.</p><p> 他们正在面对我。他们问我我在做什么。我重温了我一生中犯的错误。非常激烈。我每晚工作五年，到14天结束时我已经达到70岁，感觉就像重新回到了我的一生。</p><p> I felt like I was wrestling with the devil. Poeple would come out of the past and accuse me terrible acts. I felt like my life was being judged. Everyone makes some mistakes in their life. I felt like I was on the witness stand answering for my life decisions. I met lots of people who had been in my life 20 or 30 or 40 years ago who were dead now.</p><p> 我觉得自己在和魔鬼搏斗。人民会过去，指责我的行为恶劣。我觉得自己的生命正在被审判。每个人在生活中都会犯一些错误。我觉得自己在证人席上为自己的人生决定作答。我遇到了许多20或30或40年前已经死去的人。</p><p> I’ve made mistakes in my life and I had to confront my mistakes and atone for them. But feeling like I was going to die put things in a different perspective and let me think about things that have happened to me in my life in a different way. I talked to my father who died 20 years ago and we finally worked everything out and I understood him and he understood me. I talked to my wife who died three years ago and she told me that it wasn’t my fault that she died and that there was nothing I could have done to save her and that she wanted me to go on living and to live my life for both of us. I felt the guilt and the anger about her death melt away.</p><p> 我在生活中犯了错误，不得不面对自己的错误并为他们弥补。但是，感觉自己快要死了，这使事情有了不同的看法，让我以不同的方式思考生活中发生的事情。我与20年前去世的父亲交谈，我们终于搞定了一切，我了解他，他也了解我。我与三年前去世的妻子谈话，她告诉我她死不是我的错，我无能为力挽救她，她想让我继续生活并过我的生活为了我们俩。我感到内和对她死亡的愤怒消失了。</p><p> At the end of my 14 day trial I felt a profound spiritual cleansing. I felt like I had been born again. I felt like I had left the baggage from my 71 years of life behind me and that now I can start to live a new life. From now on I am just do what is important. If there is one good thing that came out of the covid it was this. It gave me a chance to look at my life and re-evaluate it.</p><p> 在14天的试用期结束时，我感到了深刻的精神清洗。我觉得自己已经重生了。我觉得自己已经摆脱了71年的生活重担，现在我可以开始新的生活了。从现在开始，我只是做重要的事情。如果covid有一件好事就是这样。它给了我一个机会来审视我的生活并重新评估它。</p><p> Now I&#39;m only going to do the important things and I think that those are the things that I love and the things that bring me and my family and friends joy and pleasure and uplift us. I talked to my son and daughter about what I had gone through and how I had come out on the other side.</p><p> 现在，我只要做重要的事情，我认为这些是我爱的事物，是带给我和我的家人及朋友快乐，愉悦和振奋我们的事情。我和儿子和女儿谈了我经历过的事情以及如何从另一边走出来。 </p><p> Life can still be full of surprises. Who would have thought that getting covid would give me a spiritual purification and the impetus to change my life. I would never have imagined it. But it happened.</p><p>生活仍然充满惊喜。谁会想到获得狂喜会给我一种精神上的净化，并带动改变我的生活。我永远都无法想象。但是发生了。</p><p>   I am on the mend now. Four days ago I forced myself to get up out of bed and put some clothes on. That was good for me. And then I went out and ran a couple of small errands. And two days ago I drove over to Pawhuska to see the status of a statue that they’re working on for me at the Bronze Horse Foundry. It was a 2 Hour drive over and back and it wore me out and when I got back I went to sleep for three or four hours.</p><p>   我现在好转了。四天前，我强迫自己起床并穿上一些衣服。那对我很好。然后我出去跑了几个小事。两天前，我开车去了帕霍斯卡（Pawhuska），看看他们在青铜马铸造厂为我工作的雕像的状况。那是一个2小时的来回车程，它使我不堪重负，当我回来时，我睡了三四个小时。</p><p> I went in for some blood tests late last week and the doctor says I am virus free. He says that I have covid anti-bodies so I now have immunity. There is some controversy in the medical community about how long immunity lasts but it seems the general consensus is at least 3 to 6 months. The will keep me safe long enough to get the vaccine. And I have been told that the immunity that get from developing your own anti-bodies is better than what you would get from a vaccination but I don&#39;t know how true that is.</p><p> 上周晚些时候我去做了一些血液检查，医生说我没有病毒。他说我有共抗体，所以我现在有免疫力。医学界对免疫持续多久存在争议，但似乎普遍共识至少需要3到6个月。这将使我安全足够长的时间来接种疫苗。我被告知，开发自己的抗体所获得的免疫力要比接种疫苗所获得的免疫力更好，但我不知道那是多么真实。</p><p> I shaved my beard off after I got the news. I don&#39;t know why exactly but I felt like I wanted to mark the end of my ordeal some way. But I hate shaving so I started growing another full beard right away and it is coming in nicely.</p><p> 得知消息后，我剃掉了胡须。我不知道为什么会这样，但是我觉得我想以某种方式来标记我的磨难结局。但是我讨厌剃须，所以我马上就开始长另一个胡须，而且胡须很好。</p><p> I’m getting stronger every day. I’m feeling better every day. I went out and got some carry out and I’m eating again and I am up to 183 pounds which is probably where I’d like to stay. I feel good. No, I feel great. I don’t miss those 25 pounds. It’s like the baggage that I’ve left behind for my new life. I’ve left behind all the old guilts and ambitions and I’m only going to do what’s important from now on. I’m 71 years old and I may have five more years or ten but I am going to live every day like it’s my last.</p><p> 我每天都在变强。我每天都感觉好些。我出去吃东西了，又吃了一次，我重达183磅，这可能是我想要住的地方。我感觉很好。不，我感觉很好。我不会错过那25磅。就像我为新生活留下的行李一样。我抛弃了所有旧的内和野心，从现在开始我只会做重要的事情。我今年71岁，可能还有5年或10年，但我将像我最后一天一样过着每一天。</p><p>  Covid Surivivor: This Photo was taken  three weeks into covid. At this point I had taken to my bed. I am sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day and I am having the terrible nightmares every night.</p><p>  Covid Surivivor：这张照片是covid拍摄的三周。这时我已经上床了。我每天要睡12到14个小时，而且每晚都有噩梦。</p><p>  Covid Surivivor: This Photo was taken  three and a half weeks into covid. At this point I was basicly spending 24 hours a day in bed. I was too weak to get up.
