She had nearly two decades of experience leading diversity and inclusion efforts inside important institutions, like Washington state’s governor’s office, but she’d never worked at an influential global business leader like Amazon.</p><p>当Chanin Kelly-Rae于2019年开始在亚马逊担任公司云计算部门多元化全球经理时，她对新工作抱有很大的野心。她在领导华盛顿州州长办公室等重要机构的多元化和包容性工作方面拥有近二十年的经验，但是她从未在像亚马逊这样有影响力的全球商业领袖中工作过。</p><p> But less than a year later, Kelly-Rae quit. Her tenure inside the company convinced her that Amazon’s corporate workplace has deep, systemic issues that disadvantage Black employees and workers from other underrepresented backgrounds. And she was dismayed by her perception that Amazon leadership was unwilling to listen to internal experts about how to identify and fix these problems.</p><p> 但不到一年后，凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）辞职了。她在公司任职的时间使她确信，亚马逊公司的工作场所存在着深刻的系统性问题，这些问题使黑人员工和其他背景不足的工人都处于不利地位。而且，她对亚马逊领导层不愿意听取内部专家关于如何识别和解决这些问题的看法感到沮丧。</p><p> “Amazon was not doing things in a way that represents best practices that would advance diversity and inclusion in any way that is meaningful and thoughtful,” she told Recode. “Let me add: Amazon appeared to be taking steps backward instead of forward.”</p><p> 她对Recode表示：“亚马逊没有以代表最佳实践的方式来做事，而这会以有意义和深思熟虑的任何方式促进多样性和包容性。” “让我补充：亚马逊似乎正在向后而不是向前迈出一步。”</p><p>  Kelly-Rae, who is Black, is one of more than a dozen former and current Amazon corporate employees — 10 of whom are Black — who told Recode in interviews over the past few months that they felt the company has failed to create a corporate-wide environment where all Black employees feel welcomed and respected. Instead, they told Recode that, in their experience, Black employees at the company often face both direct and insidious bias that harms their careers and personal lives. All of the current and former employees, other than Kelly-Rae, spoke on condition of anonymity either because of the terms of their employment with Amazon or because they fear retribution from Amazon for speaking out about their experiences.</p><p>  黑人的凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）是十几名亚马逊公司现任和现任公司员工之一（其中10名是黑人），他们在过去几个月的采访中对Recode表示，他们认为该公司未能创建一家公司，所有黑人员工都受到欢迎和尊重的广阔环境。相反，他们告诉Recode，根据他们的经验，该公司的黑人员工经常面临直接和​​隐性的偏见，这损害了他们的职业生涯和个人生活。除了凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）以外，所有现任和前任雇员都是匿名的，要么是因为他们在亚马逊工作的条件，要么是因为他们害怕说出自己的经历而受到亚马逊的惩罚。</p><p> Current and former Amazon diversity and inclusion professionals — employees whose work focuses on helping Amazon create and maintain an equitable workplace and products — told Recode that internal data shows that Amazon’s review and promotion systems have created an unlevel playing field. Black employees receive “least effective” marks more often than all other colleagues and are promoted at a lower rate than non-Black peers. Recode reviewed some of this data for the Amazon Web Services division of the company, and it shows large disparities in performance review ratings between Black and white employees.</p><p> 亚马逊现任和前任多元化和包容性专业人员（其工作重点是帮助亚马逊创建和维护公平的工作场所和产品的员工）告诉Recode，内部数据表明亚马逊的审查和促销系统造成了不公平的竞争环境。黑人雇员获得“最有效”标记的频率要高于其他所有同事，并且其晋升率要低于非黑人雇员。 Recode审查了该公司Amazon Web Services部门的一些数据，它显示了黑人和白人雇员之间在绩效评估等级上的巨大差异。</p><p> “We struggle to bring [Black] folks in because there’s not a whole lot of desire, in my opinion, to go outside of our normal practices,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode. “And then when they do get here, it’s harder to get promoted, harder to get top-tier rated, and easier to get lowest-tier. All those things combined make it so folks don’t wanna stay. And folks will leave Amazon and go take on more senior roles elsewhere.”</p><p> 一位现任亚马逊多样性经理告诉Recode：“我们努力招募[黑人]员工是因为，我认为并没有很大的希望走出我们的常规做法。” “然后，当他们确实到达这里时，就很难晋升，更难获得顶级评价，也更容易获得最低的评价。所有这些因素加在一起，使人们不想留下来。人们将离开亚马逊，在其他地方担任更高的职位。”</p><p>  “We disagree with this characterization of Amazon’s culture and believe that it misrepresents the facts and is based on the views of a small number of individuals.”</p><p>  “我们不同意亚马逊文化的这种特征，并认为它歪曲了事实，是基于少数人的观点。” </p><p>  We work hard to build an inclusive culture that welcomes, celebrates, and values all people, but we’re disappointed if even one person has a negative experience. Teams across Amazon have hired hundreds of thousands of Black employees and thousands of Black managers, and our retention data and employee surveys illustrate that they have similar attrition rates and greater job satisfaction and feelings of inclusion than their non-Black colleagues. We recognize we have work to do, including increasing Black representation at all levels, and we set — and met — aggressive goals to double the representation of Black Vice Presidents and Directors in 2020 and are committing to do so again in 2021. We encourage anyone to compare our goals and progress towards achieving those goals with other large employers.</p><p>我们努力建立一种包容性的文化，以欢迎，庆祝和珍视所有人，但即使一个人也有负面经历，我们都会感到失望。亚马逊各地的团队已经雇用了数十万黑人员工和数千名黑人经理，我们的保留数据和员工调查表明，与非黑人同事相比，他们的流失率相似，工作满意度和包容感更高。我们认识到我们要做的工作，包括增加黑人在各个级别的代表，并且我们设定了并实现了一些雄心勃勃的目标，以在2020年使黑人副总统和董事的代表人数增加一倍，并承诺在2021年再次这样做。我们鼓励任何人与其他大型雇主比较我们的目标和实现这些目标的进度。</p><p> Some of those who spoke to Recode recounted what they saw as biased interactions inside Amazon’s corporate offices, including a white male manager who told a Black female employee, unprompted, that his ancestors “owned slaves but I’m pretty sure they were good to their slaves.” Others described microaggressions like being called out by managers and peers for not smiling or being friendly enough.</p><p> 与Recode交谈的一些人讲述了他们在亚马逊公司办公室内部的有偏见的互动，包括一位白人男性经理，他不加提示地告诉一位黑人女雇员，他的祖先“拥有奴隶，但我很确定他们对自己的奴隶有好处”。奴隶。”其他人则描述了一些微侵略行为，例如被管理者和同伴召唤出来，因为他们没有微笑或不够友好。</p><p> They told Recode that even when they reported these kinds of interactions to human resources, the offending colleagues often faced few or no repercussions, especially in cases where there were no other witnesses. Many of these employees work or worked for Amazon Web Services, the division of Amazon that is run by longtime Amazon executive  Andy Jassy, whom Jeff Bezos recently announced will succeed him as Amazon CEO later this year. Still, several said they believe that Jassy cares about systemic racism impacting Black Americans inside and outside of the company.</p><p> 他们告诉Recode，即使他们向人力资源报告了这种互动，但冒犯性的同事通常很少受到影响，甚至没有受到影响，尤其是在没有其他证人的情况下。这些员工中有许多人在亚马逊网络服务部门工作或工作，亚马逊网络服务部门由长期担任亚马逊高管的安迪·贾西（Andy Jassy）管理，杰夫·贝佐斯（Jeff Bezos）最近宣布将在今年晚些时候接替他的职务。不过，仍有几人说，他们认为Jassy关心系统性种族主义会影响公司内部和外部的黑人美国人。</p><p>  The employees Recode interviewed said the racial bias they encountered at Amazon affected them in a multitude of meaningful ways: Four of the Black women who spoke to Recode said they sought mental health counseling while at Amazon, either solely or in large part because of their experience working at the company. Some workers said treatment from colleagues and managers compelled them to leave the company, even though they’d once viewed it as the opportunity of their dreams. And some stuck it out at the company by transferring roles, and even taking demotions, to escape toxic bosses. One current employee said she’s still at Amazon because she believes she can make a difference.</p><p>  Recode接受采访的员工表示，他们在亚马逊遇到的种族偏见以多种有意义的方式影响了他们：与Recode交谈的四名黑人妇女表示，他们在亚马逊寻求心理健康咨询的原因完全是或部分是因为她们的经验在公司工作。一些工人说，同事和经理的待遇迫使他们离开公司，即使他们曾经将其视为梦the以求的机会。有些人通过调换职位甚至降职以逃避有毒的老板而在公司中脱颖而出。一名现任员工表示，她仍在亚马逊工作，因为她相信自己可以有所作为。</p><p>   Some of those interviewed said that not all teams and managers perpetuate these racial biases at the company. And several told Recode they were heartened when company leaders, including Bezos, spoke out publicly last year to condemn police killings of Black Americans and to support the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>   其中一些受访者表示，并非所有团队和经理都能使公司的种族偏见长期存在。有几位告诉Recode，当包括贝佐斯在内的公司领导人去年公开表示谴责警察杀害黑人美国人并支持黑人生活问题运动时，他们感到鼓舞。</p><p> But they all said their view is that the company is plagued by systemic issues that disproportionately harm Black employees — and several faulted the company’s senior leadership team, known as the S-team, for not focusing enough on identifying and implementing the right strategies to fix the biases. Some employees also told Recode that they think the human resources division has not done enough to root out employees that they feel have discriminated against them or their Black colleagues.</p><p> 但是所有人都说，他们的观点是该公司受到严重困扰着黑人员工的系统性问题困扰，还有一些人批评该公司的高级领导团队（即S团队），因为他们没有将精力集中在确定和实施正确的解决方案上偏见。一些员工还告诉Recode，他们认为人力资源部门的工作还不足以铲除他们认为已歧视他们或他们的黑人同事的员工。</p><p> And these issues extend far beyond Amazon’s corporate workforce, as seen last spring after Amazon fired a Black warehouse manager named Christian Smalls, who had organized a small employee walkout at a facility to protest what the group said were inadequate health protections for workers during the early weeks of the pandemic. Amazon’s top lawyer, David Zapolsky, later referred to Smalls as “not smart, or articulate” in notes from a meeting with Bezos and other company leaders. After these notes  leaked to the press,  Amazon white-collar employees fumed over the treatment of Smalls and Zapolsky’s choice of words, which were viewed as offensive at best and racist at worst.</p><p> 这些问题远远超出了亚马逊公司的员工队伍，例如去年春天，亚马逊解雇了一名名为Christian Smalls的黑人仓库经理，该经理曾在一家工厂组织了一次小型员工罢工，以抗议该组织所说的早期员工的健康保护不足大流行的几周。亚马逊的最高律师戴维·扎波斯基（David Zapolsky）后来在与贝索斯（Bezos）和其他公司负责人的会议中的笔记中，将斯莫尔斯（Smalls）称为“不聪明，或者说清楚”。这些笔记泄露给媒体之后，亚马逊的白领员工对Smalls和Zapolsky的措词选择的待遇感到气愤，这些措辞充其量是令人反感和种族歧视。 </p><p>  These allegations matter because the company is the second-largest private sector employer in the US, and how Amazon hires, treats, and retains Black employees directly impacts the hundreds of thousands of people who work for the tech giant. Beyond that, Amazon’s runaway success makes it a model for other businesses that try to emulate its internal culture and labor practices. But it also matters because Amazon runs businesses across varied industries — from retail to media to cloud computing to  facial recognition software — and the decisions its leaders make, and experiences and points of view that inform their decisions, have the power to positively or negatively affect tens of millions of other Americans far outside of Amazon’s walls.</p><p>这些指控之所以重要，是因为该公司是美国第二大私营部门雇主，而且亚马逊如何雇用，对待和留住黑人雇员直接影响着为这家科技巨头工作的数十万人。除此之外，亚马逊取得的巨大成功使其成为其他试图效仿其内部文化和劳工惯例的企业的榜样。但这也很重要，因为亚马逊经营着各个行业的业务-从零售到媒体，云计算再到面部识别软件-以及其领导者做出的决策以及可以为决策提供依据的经验和观点能够正面或负面地影响数以千万计的美国人远远超出了亚马逊的城墙。</p><p> Kelly-Rae, for her part, said Amazon’s massive reach and power come with great responsibility.</p><p> 凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）表示，亚马逊的巨大影响力和强大责任感。</p><p> “They have access to our lives in more ways than any other company,” she said. “The best thing they can do when creating opportunity is make sure that opportunity is enjoyed universally and not kept from some because of who they are.”</p><p> 她说：“他们比其他任何公司都能以更多方式进入我们的生活。” “他们在创造机会时可以做的最好的事情是确保机会得到普遍的享受，而不是因为他们是谁而被排斥在外。”</p><p> “Amazon is really good at things it wants to be good at,” she added, “and if Amazon decided it really wanted to be good at this, I have no doubt it can be.”</p><p> 她补充说：“亚马逊真的很擅长做自己想做的事情，而且如果亚马逊决定真的想做得很好，我无疑会做到。”</p><p>  Kelly-Rae was only a month into her job as a diversity and inclusion leader for a department in Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing division, when she started to realize the work ahead would be daunting.</p><p>  Kelly-Rae在公司云计算部门Amazon Web Services部门担任多元化和包容性主管的工作只有一个月，当时她开始意识到未来的工作将是艰巨的。</p><p> She had gathered with the rest of Amazon’s diversity and inclusion employees at the company’s Seattle, Washington, headquarters for an inaugural all-staff meeting in January 2020, shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic turned the world upside down.</p><p> 在Covid-19大流行使世界颠倒之前不久，她与亚马逊多样性的其他成员和包容性员工聚集在该公司位于华盛顿州西雅图市的总部，于2020年1月举行了首次全体员工会议。</p><p> The teams had gathered for the first-annual internal diversity summit to share feedback, learn from their peers and leaders, and discuss goals and the right strategies to meet them.</p><p> 这些团队聚集在一起参加了第一届内部多样性峰会，以分享反馈，向同行和领导者学习，讨论达成目标的目标和正确策略。 </p><p> During a Q&amp;A session with employees at that summit, tensions rose as employees started questioning Beth Galetti, Amazon’s head of human resources and a member of Bezos’s S-team. According to three people who were present at the event, some employees were concerned about what they saw as a lack of resources for diversity and inclusion work, and they wanted to know why Amazon has for years failed to hit certain S-team goals related to the percentage of job applicants from underrepresented racial backgrounds who get an in-person interview.</p><p>在该峰会上与员工进行的问答环节中，由于员工开始质疑亚马逊人力资源主管，贝索斯S-team成员贝丝·加莱蒂（Beth Galetti），紧张局势加剧。据参加此次活动的三人称，一些员工担心他们认为缺乏用于多元化和包容性工作的资源，他们想知道为什么亚马逊多年来一直未能实现与以下目标有关的某些S-team目标：种族背景不足的求职者接受面试的百分比。</p><p> The conversation reached a boiling point when Galetti was asked why D&amp;I employees at Amazon who work outside of the HR department don’t have access to more granular data about the demographics of the workforce across different management levels.</p><p> 当有人问加莱蒂时，为什么在人力资源部门以外工作的亚马逊D＆amp; I员工无法访问有关不同管理级别的员工人口统计的更细粒度的数据，谈话就达到了沸点。</p><p> At the  @SeattleChamber  #RLC2017 where Beth Galetti, Amazon’s SVP for HR, talks about our leadership principles and our investment in talent.  pic.twitter.com/2AZKIhVy3H</p><p> 在@SeattleChamber＃RLC2017上，亚马逊亚马逊人力资源高级副总裁贝丝·加莱蒂（Beth Galetti）谈论了我们的领导原则和我们对人才的投资。 pic.twitter.com/2AZKIhVy3H</p><p>— Jared Axelrod (@JaredAxelrod)  October 20, 2017</p><p>—贾里德·阿克塞尔罗德（@JaredAxelrod）2017年10月20日</p><p> “You don’t need the data to do your job,” was Galetti’s approximate response, the three sources said.</p><p> 这三位消息人士说：“您不需要数据就可以完成工作。”</p><p> “That left everyone in the room aghast,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “If the data doesn’t matter, then that body of work doesn’t matter.”</p><p> “这让房间里的每个人都惊呆了，”凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）告诉Recode。 “如果数据无关紧要，那么那项工作就无关紧要。”</p><p> Those in attendance said the response was shocking not only because  Amazon leaders boast about the central role data plays in everything the tech giant does, but also because data analysis is crucial in identifying problems and opportunities in diversity and inclusion work.</p><p> 与会人员说，这一反应之所以令人震惊，不仅是因为亚马逊领导人夸耀数据在科技巨头所做的一切中都扮演着核心角色，而且还因为数据分析对于识别多样性和包容性工作中的问题和机会至关重要。 </p><p> “That’s the antithesis of what you would say about anything at Amazon,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode.</p><p>一位现任亚马逊多元化经理对Recode表示：“这与您对亚马逊的一切看法相反。”</p><p> The Amazon spokesperson said employees at the summit misunderstood Galetti’s intent and that she meant it wasn’t necessary to access the requested data to know Amazon needs to make progress in D&amp;I, or to prove to company leaders that more needs to be done.</p><p> 亚马逊发言人说，峰会上的员工误解了加莱蒂的意图，她表示没有必要访问所请求的数据来知道亚马逊需要在D＆amp; I方面取得进展，或者向公司领导者证明还有更多工作要做。</p><p> After Galetti’s comment, Kelly-Rae raised her hand to explain to Galetti the importance of such data. She then approached Galetti afterward to introduce herself, and to offer to continue the conversation at a later date.</p><p> 加莱蒂（Galetti）发表评论后，凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）举手向加莱蒂（Galetti）解释了此类数据的重要性。然后，她随后与加莱蒂（Galetti）进行了自我介绍，并提出以后继续进行对话。</p><p> “She told me when I was at Amazon longer, then I could talk to her,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “And she walked away from me.”</p><p> “她告诉我，当我待在亚马逊的时间更长时，我可以和她交谈，”凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）告诉Recode。 “然后她离开了我。”</p><p> Kelly-Rae left Amazon in September after just 10 months; she is now focused exclusively on a consulting business she founded 20 years ago, Chanin Kelly-Rae Consulting. She says the comments by Galetti, who is white, were one of the earliest signs in her brief tenure at Amazon that led her to believe the executive team was not truly interested in making it a priority to attract and retain employees from underrepresented backgrounds.</p><p> 仅仅10个月后，凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）于9月离开了亚马逊。她现在专注于20年前创立的咨询业务Chanin Kelly-Rae Consulting。她说，白人白人加莱蒂（Galetti）的言论是她在亚马逊任职期间的最早迹象之一，这使她相信高管团队并不真正有兴趣将吸引和留住员工的代表放在优先位置。</p><p>   On the surface, Amazon’s diversity statistics look better than most tech giants: In 2019, 26.5 percent of employees identified as Black. But the main reason for that is the disproportionate number of Black workers employed in Amazon’s lower-paying front-line workforce — the hundreds of thousands of workers who pick, pack, and ship orders out of Amazon warehouses and, in some cases, deliver them to customer doors. (Amazon hasn’t publicly released data on the racial breakdown between its corporate and front-line workforces since 2016.)</p><p>   从表面上看，亚马逊的多元化统计数据看起来比大多数科技巨头都要好：2019年，有26.5％的员工被确定为黑人。但这主要是因为在亚马逊低薪的一线员工中雇用的黑人工人人数过多-成千上万的工人从亚马逊仓库中拣货，打包和运送订单，在某些情况下将其交付到客户的门。 （自2016年以来，亚马逊尚未公开发布过公司和一线员工之间种族差异的数据。）</p><p> Around 11 percent of Amazon managers in 2020 were Black, including both corporate staff and front-line warehouse and physical store positions. (Black Americans make up 12 percent of the entire private sector workforce across the US, but just 7 percent of managerial roles,  according to new research from the consulting firm McKinsey.) In 2020, Amazon said it doubled its number of Black directors and vice presidents and would aim to do the same in 2021; Amazon has around 400 vice presidents globally, but only around a dozen are Black.</p><p> 2020年，约11％的亚马逊经理是黑人，包括公司员工以及一线仓库和实体店职位。 （根据咨询公司麦肯锡的最新研究，黑人美国人占美国整个私营部门劳动力的12％，但仅占管理职位的7％。）2020年，亚马逊表示，其黑人董事和副总裁的人数翻了一番总统，目标是在2021年这样做；亚马逊在全球拥有约400位副总裁，但布莱克只有十几位。 </p><p> But even directors and VPs aren’t necessarily at the top of Amazon’s hierarchy, where corporate employees are slotted into Levels 4 through 12, which is occupied solely by Bezos (and soon, presumably,  future CEO Jassy). The top leadership team, the S-team, is composed of about two dozen executives, including everyone at Level 11, and a select few VPs, who sit at Level 10. This exclusive group meets regularly to discuss long-term ideas as well as pressing issues, and to also set or approve goals for important initiatives across the company, including the diversity goals pertaining to directors and VPs. But the S-team hasn’t set a similar goal of doubling Black representation among its own group for 2021.</p><p>但是，即使董事和副总裁也不一定处于亚马逊层级的顶端，因为公司员工被划分为4至12级，而贝佐斯（不久之后，很可能是未来的首席执行官杰西）则占据了4级至12级。最高领导团队是S团队，由大约二十名高管组成，其中包括11级的所有人，以及少数几个10级的VP。这个专属小组定期开会，讨论长远的想法以及紧迫的问题，并为整个公司的重要计划设定或批准目标，包括与董事和副总裁有关的多元化目标。但是，S车队还没有设定类似的目标，即在2021年之前在自己的团队中将黑人代表人数增加一倍。</p><p> Only this summer did Amazon finally name its first Black leader to the S-team: Alicia Boler Davis, a vice president who runs the company’s warehouse network worldwide. Amazon’s spokesperson said the company has not set a goal to double Black S-team representation in 2021 but declined to provide a reason.</p><p> 直到今年夏天，亚马逊才最终将其首位黑人领导者任命为S-team团队的负责人：艾莉西亚·博勒·戴维斯（Alicia Boler Davis），该公司在全球范围内运营着该公司的仓库网络。亚马逊发言人表示，该公司尚未设定在2021年使Black S-team的代表人数增加一倍的目标，但拒绝提供理由。</p><p>   For Kelly-Rae, this goal to double the company’s Black VPs and directors is not enough. “If Amazon was to ever enjoy wholesale success in diversity and inclusion programming, they need to have experienced D&amp;I practitioners represented at every level,” Kelly-Rae told Recode. “They need someone on the S-team.”</p><p>   对于凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）来说，使公司的黑人副总裁和董事加倍的目标还不够。 Kelly-Rae告诉Recode：“如果亚马逊要在多样性和包容性编程方面大获成功，他们需要在各个级别都有经验丰富的D＆I从业人员。” “他们需要S团队中的某个人。”</p><p> For other Black managers in the division, Galetti’s “you don’t need the data” moment was an inflection point for a different reason.</p><p> 对于该部门中的其他黑人管理人员来说，加莱蒂的“您不需要数据”时刻是一个拐点，其原因有所不同。</p><p> “That, for me, was transformative,” a current Amazon diversity manager told Recode. “I thought, ‘Shit, if I can’t get buy-in and help from [Galetti], where do I go?’”</p><p> “对我而言，这具有变革性，”现任亚马逊多元化经理告诉《 Recode》。 “我想，‘该死，如果我无法从[加莱蒂（Galetti）]获得买进和帮助，我应该去哪里？’”</p><p>  All 10 Black employees who spoke to Recode said either they or Black colleagues they know were hired at lower levels in Amazon’s internal hierarchy than their qualifications justify. At Amazon, your level means a lot: It dictates a role’s importance, salary range, and additional compensation (usually in the form of Amazon stock). Coming in at a lower level can set back your career at Amazon by years.</p><p>  与Recode交谈的所有10名黑人雇员表示，他们或他们认识的黑人同事在亚马逊内部层次中的聘用水平低于其资格所能证明的水平。在亚马逊，您的职位意义重大：它决定了职位的重要性，薪资范围和额外的薪酬（通常以亚马逊股票的形式）。进入较低级别可能会使您在亚马逊的职业生涯受挫。</p><p> “I think there are very serious systemic issues around leveling,” Kelly-Rae said. This observation isn’t merely anecdotal. Kelly-Rae’s former role as a diversity and inclusion manager gave her specific insight into some of  the company’s internal hiring and promotion practices. “It is not uncommon for women, and especially Black women, to have a role advertised at one level but extended an offer at a position that is lower.”</p><p> “我认为平整方面存在非常严重的系统性问题，” Kelly-Rae说。这种观察不仅是轶事。凯莉·雷（Kelly-Rae）以前是多元化和包容性经理，她对公司的一些内部招聘和晋升做法具有特定见解。 “女性，尤其是黑人女性，在一个级别上登广告，但在较低职位上提供报价的情况并不少见。” </p><p>  Sources told Recode that’s what happened with Black employees who joined Amazon in 2016 when it acquired Partpic, an Atlanta-based tech startup founded by two Black entrepreneurs. Multiple former Amazon employees familiar with the situation told Recode that both Partpic founders left after approximately three years because they had negative experiences at Amazon.</p><p>消息人士告诉Recode的消息，黑人员工于2016年加入亚马逊，当时该公司收购了由两名黑人企业家创立的亚特兰大科技初创公司Partpic。熟悉情况的多名前亚马逊员工告诉Recode，这两位Partpic创始人大约三年后就离开了，因为他们在亚马逊上有过负面经历。</p><p> They said the startup’s co-founder/CEO at one point took a demotion so that she could remove herself from a toxic working relationship with a disrespectful boss. And they said she spent considerable time during her tenure fighting for promotions for several employees who had PhDs but were down-leveled when they joined.</p><p> 他们说，这家初创公司的联合创始人/首席执行官曾被降职，以使她可以摆脱与卑鄙老板的有害工作关系。他们说，她在任职期间花了很多时间为几名拥有博士学位但加入公司后降职的员工争取晋升。</p><p> Sources said Amazon slotted several Black Partpic employees with PhDs into Level 4 roles when they joined the company — the lowest level for any corporate employee, including those who have just finished their undergraduate degree. Another employee, Partpic’s chief technology officer, was placed at Level 5 though some of her peers at Amazon with similar education and work backgrounds were working at Level 6. (She was eventually promoted to Level 6, but it took two years; she later transferred to AWS.) Sources told Recode that the other Partpic co-founder left, in part, because he felt misled and disrespected when Amazon quickly killed the startup’s core technology shortly after it launched as a standalone feature in the Amazon shopping app.</p><p> 消息人士称，亚马逊在加入公司时将数名拥有博士学位的Black Partpic员工晋升为4级职位，这是所有公司员工中最低的，包括刚完成大学学位的员工。 Partpic的首席技术官是另一名员工，尽管她在亚马逊上的一些具有类似教育背景和工作背景的同龄人都在6级工作。（她最终晋升为6级，但花了两年时间；后来她调到了6级。消息人士告诉Recode，另一位Partpic联合创始人之所以离开，部分原因是，当亚马逊在亚马逊购物应用程序中作为独立功能推出后不久就迅速杀死了这家创业公司的核心技术时，他感到误解和不尊重。</p><p>  And for Kelly-Rae, down-leveling wasn’t just something she observed happening to other Black Amazon employees. She said it happened to her. When she received her offer to join Amazon in late 2019, she confronted an unpleasant surprise: Despite her almost 20 years of experience, Amazon slotted her into a management level that was lower than the one a recruiter originally described. That meant a lower salary and fewer shares of Amazon stock.</p><p>  对于凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）来说，降级不仅仅是她观察到的其他Black Amazon员工所发生的事情。她说这件事发生在她身上。当她在2019年末收到加入亚马逊的报价时，她遇到了一个令人不愉快的惊喜：尽管她拥有近20年的经验，但亚马逊仍将她提升为低于招聘人员最初描述的管理水平。这意味着较低的薪水和更少的亚马逊股票。</p><p>   This kind of down-leveling can happen at Amazon, in part, because of the company’s hiring process. Interviews are conducted not only by recruiters and hiring managers, but also by soon-to-be peers of the candidate and at least one person outside of the immediate team, called a “bar raiser.” Amazon told Recode these bar raisers are trained, in part, to identify potential bias during the interview process. A single interviewer taking part in what Amazon calls the hiring “loop” can essentially vote against hiring a candidate, or can recommend that a candidate get down-leveled. Candidates are not told why they are being slotted at a certain level, or one lower than the one they were first told.</p><p>   这种降级可能在亚马逊发生，部分原因是该公司的招聘过程。面试不仅由招聘人员和招聘经理进行，而且还由应聘者的即将成为同事的人以及直属团队之外的至少一个人（称为“举证人”）进行。亚马逊告诉Recode，对这些举证者进行了部分培训，以确定他们在面试过程中的潜在偏见。参加亚马逊所谓的招聘“循环”的单个面试官实质上可以投票反对招聘候选人，也可以建议候选人降级。候选人没有被告知为什么他们被安排在某个水平，或者比他们最初被告知的水平低。</p><p> Anderson, the Amazon spokesperson, would not confirm or deny Kelly-Rae’s specific claim. She acknowledged that it’s common for candidates to be down-leveled during interview processes, but said this is something that happens to employees from all backgrounds, and that candidates are sometimes even up-leveled.</p><p> 亚马逊发言人安德森（Anderson）不会证实或否认凯利·雷（Kelly-Rae）的具体主张。她承认，在面试过程中降低候选人的职位很普遍，但她说这是所有背景的员工都会遇到的事情，甚至有时候选人也会被晋升。</p><p> Kelly-Rae said two AWS VPs, including a hiring manager, later acknowledged that she should have been brought on at a higher level, but they hadn’t rectified the mistake by the time she left.</p><p> Kelly-Rae说，包括一名招聘经理在内的两个AWS副总裁后来承认，她本应得到更高的职位，但到她离开时，他们还没有纠正错误。 </p><p> Amazon judges its version of “culture fit” by evaluating job candidates, and existing employees during performance reviews, on some of the company’s 14 leadership principles. Several former Black employees pointed to these principles as possible tools for discrimination, and said they could provide cover for some managers to use them against Black employees. The most problematic leadership principle according to these former employees is  “Earns Trust,” which reads in full: “Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.”</p><p>亚马逊会根据公司的14项领导原则中的一些，通过评估求职者和绩效评估期间的现有员工来判断其“文化契合度”。几位前黑人员工指出这些原则是歧视的可能工具，并表示它们可以为某些经理提供掩护，以将其用于黑人员工。根据这些前雇员的说法，最成问题的领导原则是“ Earns Trust”，其全文为：“领导者认真倾听，坦率说话，并尊重他人。他们口头批评自己，即使这样做很尴尬或尴尬。领导者不相信他们或他们的团队的体味有香水味。他们将自己和他们的团队与最好的组织进行比较。”</p><p> “If you talk to people across Amazon, they’ll say that if the company ever wants to weaponize a leadership principle, the one they go to often is Earns Trust,” Kelly-Rae said. “What does it mean? It’s a catchall. It means nothing so it can mean everything. Someone can say it if they don’t think you are a team player. They can say it if they don’t believe you’ll fall in line. They can say it if they believe you’re someone who pushes back too much. And they can say it if you are someone who doesn’t push back enough. They don’t have to quantify it or qualify it.”</p><p> “如果您与整个亚马逊地区的人们交谈，他们会说，如果该公司想武器化领导原则，他们经常去的就是赚取信任，” Kelly-Rae说。 “这是什么意思？这是一个包罗万象的东西。它没有任何意义，因此可以代表一切。如果他们不认为您是团队合作者，可以说出来。如果他们不相信您会同意，他们可以说出来。他们可以说，如果他们相信您是一个推倒太多的人。如果您是一个没有足够努力的人，他们可以说出来。他们不必对其进行量化或限定。”</p><p> Three other former Black Amazon employees interviewed by Recode said the Earns Trust leadership principle was used as reasoning to try to push them, or Black colleagues at the company, out. A Black former Amazon employee told Recode that a director once told them and other Black employees in a candid conversation about the downsides of the company’s values system that “the one they use against Black women specifically was Earns Trust.” After he</p><p> Recode采访的其他三名前Black Amazon员工表示，Earns Trust领导原则被用作试图将他们或公司的Black同事赶出市场的理由。一名黑人的前亚马逊雇员告诉Recode，一位董事曾经坦率地告诉他们和其他黑人雇员关于公司价值观体系的弊端，“他们专门针对黑人女性的是赚取信任”。在他之后</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/26/22297554/bias-disrespect-and-demotions-black-employees-say-amazon-has-a-race-problem?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/26/22297554/bias-disrespect-and-demotions-black-employees-say-amazon-has-a-race-problem?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/amazon/">#amazon</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/亚马逊/">#亚马逊</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/表示/">#表示</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/current/">#current</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
