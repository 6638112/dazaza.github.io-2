", "note_en": "Developing forms of plastic that don&#39;t take centuries to break down after use is a common objective among eco-conscious material scientists, and lately we&#39;re seeing how bacteria might offer a helping hand. Scientists at the University of Edinburgh have taken this idea one step further, by demonstrating how an engineered form of  E. coli bacteria can be used to turn plastic bottles into vanillin, the primary compound of vanilla flavoring.\n Discoveries in recent years have demonstrated how bacteria might help us tackle the monumental problem of plastic waste. These have included the unearthing of enzymes produced by bacteria that lurk around recycling centers in Japan and  feed on the material as an energy source, and the use of  bacterial biofilms that can trap difficult-to-trace microplastic particles. Lately, we&#39;ve also seen how embedding enzymes in plastic during production can enable the material to  break down in days, or even  keep itself clean.\n The new research from University of Edinburgh scientists is pioneering in that it doesn&#39;t just seek to quickly break down single-use plastics, but use bacteria to turn it into something useful. The team focused on polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the plastic typically used for packaging of everything from food, to shampoos to soda bottles, and generates around 50 million tonnes of waste each year.\n While PET can be converted into its original building blocks that are used to produce more PET plastics through current recycling methods, the authors of the new study sought to turn it into something else entirely. They developed a technique that uses an engineered form of  E. coli bacteria to take aim at a PET waste product called terephthalic acid (TA). With fine-tuning of the chemical reactions, the bacteria was added to degraded PET plastic bottles and was able to convert 79 percent of the TA to vanillin.\n &#34;This is the first example of using a biological system to upcycle plastic waste into a valuable industrial chemical and this has very exciting implications for the circular economy,&#34; says first author of the study Joanna Sadler. \u201cThe results from our research have major implications for the field of plastic sustainability and demonstrate the power of synthetic biology to address real-world challenges.&#34;\n While vanillin is the main chemical component of extracted vanilla beans, it has wide-ranging applications beyond just the food industry, also serving as an ingredient in herbicides, cosmetics, cleaning products and anti-foaming agents. So, if the scientists can demonstrate how their technique can be scaled up, it could offer a new source for a product the world uses tens of thousands of tonnes of each year.\n &#34;This is a really interesting use of microbial science at the molecular level to improve sustainability and work towards a circular economy,&#34; says Dr Ellis Crawford Publishing Editor at the Royal Society of Chemistry. &#34;Using microbes to turn waste plastics, which are harmful to the environment, into an important commodity and platform molecule with broad applications in cosmetics and food is a beautiful demonstration of green chemistry.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 15:34:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u964d\u7ea7,converts,\u7ec6\u83cc", "title": "\u7ec6\u83cc\u5c06\u53ef\u964d\u7ea7\u7684\u5851\u6599\u74f6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9999\u8349\u5473 ", "title_en": "Bacteria converts degraded plastic bottles into vanilla flavoring", "transed": 1, "url": "https://newatlas.com/materials/bacteria-converts-pet-plastic-waste-vanilla-flavoring/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u964d\u7ea7", "converts", "\u7ec6\u83cc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "23023bb0eef78e14bb7e804ea68e559d.jpeg", "infoid": 1067152, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\uff08AP\uff09 - \u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d4e\u91d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u653b\u51fb\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u8c03\u67e5\u5c40\u5bf9\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u6765\u52a0\u500d\uff1a\u4e0d\u8981\u652f\u4ed8\u7f51\u7edc\u72af\u7f6a\u5206\u5b50\u3002 ", "note_en": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As ransomware attacks  surge, the FBI is doubling down on its guidance to affected businesses: Don't pay the cybercriminals.

\u8c22\u8c22\uff01 ", "note_en": "The DOM is the foundation of the web platform programming model, and its design and performance impacts the rest of the browser pipeline. However, its history and evolution is far from a simple story.\n Over the past three years, we\u2019ve embarked on an in-flight refactoring of the DOM in Microsoft Edge, with our eye on a modernized architecture offering better real-world performance and reduced complexity. In this post, we\u2019ll walk you through the history of the DOM in Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge, and the impact of our recent work to modernize the DOM Tree, which is already resulting in substantially improved performance in the Windows 10 Creators Update.\n  What we think of as \u201cthe DOM\u201d is really the cooperation of several subsystems. In Microsoft Edge, this includes JS binding, events, editing, spellchecking, HTML attributes, CSSOM, text, and others, all working together. Of these subsystems, the DOM \u201ctree\u201d is at the center.\n Several years ago, we began a long journey to update to a modern DOM \u201ctree\u201d (node connectivity structures). By modernizing the core tree, which we completed in Microsoft Edge 14, we landed a new baseline and the scaffolding to deliver on our promise of a fast and reliable DOM. With Windows 10 Creators Update and Microsoft Edge 15, the journey we started is beginning to bear fruit.\n  We\u2019re just scratching the surface, but want to take this opportunity to  geek out a bit, and share some of the internal details of this journey, starting with the DOM\u2019s arcane history and showcasing some of our accomplishments along the way.\n  When web developers today think of the DOM, they usually think of a tree that looks something like this:\n  However nice and simple (and obvious) this seems, the reality of Internet Explorer\u2019s DOM implementation was much more complicated.\n Simply put, Internet Explorer\u2019s DOM was designed for the web of the 90s. When the original data structures were designed, the web was primarily a document viewer (with a few animated GIFs and other images thrown in). As such, algorithms and data structures more closely resembled those you might see powering a document viewer like Microsoft Word. Recall in the early days of the web that there was no JavaScript to allow scripting a web page, so the DOM tree as we know it didn\u2019t exist.  Text was king, and the DOM\u2019s internals were designed around fast, efficient text storage and manipulation. Content editing (WYSIWYG) was already a feature at the time, and the manipulation paradigm centered around the editing cursor for character insertion and limited formatting.\n  As a result of its text-centric design, the principle structure of the DOM was the  text backing store, a complex system of text arrays that could be efficiently split and joined with minimal or no memory allocations. The backing store represented both text  and tags as a linear progression, addressable by a global index or  Character Position (CP). Inserting text at a given CP was highly efficient and copy/pasting a range of text was centrally handled by an efficient \u201csplice\u201d operation. The figure below visually illustrates how a simple markup containing \u201chello world\u201d was loaded into the text backing store, and how CPs were assigned for each character and tag.\n  To store non-textual data (e.g. formatting and grouping information), another set of objects was separately maintained from the backing store: a doubly-linked list of  tree positions (TreePos objects).  TreePos objects were the semantic equivalent of tags in HTML source markup \u2013 each logical element was represented by a begin and end  TreePos. This linear structure made it very fast to traverse the entire DOM \u201ctree\u201d in depth-first pre-order traversal (as required for nearly every DOM search API and CSS/Layout algorithm). Later, we extended the  TreePos object to include two other kinds of \u201cpositions\u201d:  TreeDataPos (for indicating a placeholder for text) and  PointerPos (for indicating things like the caret, range boundary points, and eventually for \u201cnew\u201d features like  generated content nodes).\n Each  TreePos object also included a  CP object, which acted as the tag\u2019s global ordinal index (useful for things like the legacy  document.all API).  CPs were used to get from a  TreePos into the text backing store, easily compare node order, or even find the length of text by subtracting  CP indices.\n To tie it all together, a  TreeNode bound pairs of tree positions together and established the \u201ctree\u201d hierarchy expected by the JavaScript DOM as illustrated below.\n   The foundation of  CPs caused much of the complexity of the old DOM. For the whole system to work properly,  CPs had to be up-to-date. Thus,  CPs were updated after  every DOM manipulation (e.g. entering text, copy/paste, DOM API manipulations, even clicking on the page\u2014which set an insertion point in the DOM). Initially, DOM manipulations were driven primarily by the HTML parser, or by user actions, and the  CPs-always-up-to-date model was perfectly rational. But with rise of JavaScript and DHTML, these operations became much more common and frequent.\n To compensate, new structures were added to make these updates efficient, and the  splay tree was born, adding an overlapping series of tree connections onto TreePos objects. The added complexity helped with performance\u2014at first; global  CP updates could be achieved with  O(log n) speed. Yet, a splay tree is really only optimized for repeated local searches (e.g., for changes centered around one place in the DOM tree), and did not prove to be a consistent benefit for JavaScript and its more random-access patterns.\n Another design phenomenon was that the previously-mentioned \u201csplice\u201d operations that handled copy/paste, were extended to handle all tree mutations. The core \u201csplice engine\u201d worked in three steps, as illustrated in the figure below.\n  In step 1, the engine would \u201crecord\u201d the splice by traversing the tree positions from the start of the operation to the end. A splice record was then created containing command instructions for this action (a structure re-used in the browser\u2019s Undo stack). In step 2, all nodes (i.e.,  TreeNode and  TreePos objects) associated with the operation were deleted from the tree. Note that in the IE DOM tree,  TreeNode/ TreePos objects were distinct from the script-referenced  Element objects to facilitate overlapping tags, so deleting them was not a functional problem. Finally, in step 3, the splice record was used to \u201creplay\u201d (re-create) new objects in the target location. For example, to accomplish an  appendChild DOM operation, the splice engine created a range around the node (from the  TreeNode\u2018s begin  TreePos to its end), \u201cspliced\u201d the range out of the old location, and created new nodes to represent the node and its children in the new location. As you can imagine, this created a lot of memory allocation churn, in addition to the inefficiencies of the algorithm.\n  These are just a few of the examples of the complexity of the Internet Explorer DOM. To add insult to injury, the old DOM had no encapsulation, so code from the Parser all the way to the Display systems had  CP/ TreePos dependencies, which required many dev-years to detangle.\n With complexity comes errors, and the DOM code base was a reliability liability. According to an internal investigation, from IE7 to IE11, approximately 28% of all IE reliability bugs originated from code in core DOM components. This complexity also manifested as a tax on agility, as each new HTML5 feature became more expensive to implement as it became harder to retrofit concepts into the existing architecture.\n  The launch of  Project Spartan created the perfect opportunity modernize our DOM. Free from platform vestiges like  docmodes and  conditional comments, we began a massive refactoring effort. Our first, and most critical target: the DOM\u2019s core tree.\n We knew the old text-centric model was no longer relevant; we needed a DOM tree that actually  was a tree internally in order to match the expectations of the modern DOM API. We needed to dismantle the layers of complexity that made it nearly impossible to performance-tune the tree and the other surrounding systems. And finally, we had a strong desire to encapsulate the new tree to avoid creating cross-component dependencies on core data structures. All of this effort would lead to a DOM tree with the right model in place, primed and ready for additional improvements to come.\n To make the transition to the modern DOM as smooth as possible (and to avoid building a new DOM tree in isolation and attempting to drop and stabilize untested code at the end of the project\u2014a.k.a. the very definition of \u201cbig bang integration\u201d), we transitioned the existing codebase in-place in three phases. The first phase of the project defined our tree component boundary with corresponding APIs and contracts. We chose to design the APIs as a set of \u201creader\u201d and \u201cwriter\u201d functions that operated on nodes. Instead of APIs that look like this:\n    This API design discourages callers from thinking about tree objects as actors with their own state. As a result, a tree object is only an identity in the API, allowing for more robust contracts and hiding  representational details, which proved useful in phase 3.\n The second phase migrated all code that depended on legacy tree internals to use the newly established component boundary APIs instead. During this migration, the implementation of the tree API would continue to be powered by the legacy structures. This work took the most time and was the least glamorous; it took several dev-years to detangle consumers of the old tree structures and properly encapsulate the tree. Staging the project this way let us release EdgeHTML 12 and 13 with our fully-tested incremental changes, without disrupting the shipping schedule.\n In the third and final phase, with all external code using the new tree component boundary APIs, we began to refactor and replace the core data structures. We consolidated objects (e.g., the separate  TreePos,  TreeNode, and  Element objects), removed the splay tree and splice engine, dropped the concept of  PointerPos objects, and removed the text backing storage (to name a few). Finally, we could rid the code of  CPs.\n The new tree structure is simple and straightforward; it uses four pointers instead of the usual five to maintain connectivity: parent, first-child, next, and previous sibling (last-child is computed as the parent\u2019s first-child\u2019s previous sibling) and we could hide this last-child optimization behind our  TreeReader APIs without changing a single caller. Re-arranging the tree is fast and efficient, and we even saw some improvements in CPU performance on public DOM APIs, which were nice side-effects of the refactoring work.\n  With the new DOM tree, reliability also improved significantly, dropping from 28% of all reliability issues to just around 10%, and at the same time providing secondary benefits of reducing time spent debugging and improving team agility.\n  While this feels like the end of our journey, in fact it\u2019s just the beginning. With our DOM tree APIs in place and powered by a simple tree, we turned our attention to the other subsystems that comprise the DOM, with an eye towards two classes of inefficiencies: inefficient implementations inside the subsystems, and inefficient communication between them.\n  For example, one of our top slow DOM APIs (even after the DOM tree work) has historically been  querySelectorAll. This is a general-purpose search API, and uses the selectors engine to search the DOM for specific elements. Not surprisingly, many searches involve particular element  attributes as search criteria (e.g., an element\u2019s  id, or one of its class identifiers). As soon as the search code entered the attributes subsystem, it ran into a whole new class of inefficiencies, completely unrelated to those addressed by the new DOM tree.\n For the attributes subsystem, we are simplifying the storage mechanism for element content attributes. In the early days of the web, DOM attributes were primarily directives to the browser about how to display a piece of markup. A great example of this is the colspan attribute:\n  colspan has semantic meaning to the browser and thus has to be parsed. Given that pages weren\u2019t very dynamic back then and attributes were generally treated like enums, IE created an attribute system that was optimized around eager parsing for use in formatting and layout.\n Today\u2019s app patterns, however, heavily use attributes like  id,  class, and  data-*, which are treated less like browser directives and more like generic storage:\n  Thus, we\u2019re deferring most work beyond the bare minimum necessary to store the string. Additionally, since UI frameworks often encourage  repeated CSS classes across elements, we plan to  atomize strings to reduce memory usage and improve performance in APIs like  querySelector.\n Though we still have plenty of work planned, with Windows 10 Creators Update, we\u2019re happy to share that we\u2019ve made significant progress!\n  Reliably measuring and improving performance is  hard and the  pitfalls of  benchmarking are  well documented. To get the most holistic view of browser performance possible, the Microsoft Edge team uses a combination of user telemetry, controlled measurement real-world scenarios, and synthetic benchmarks to guide our optimizations.\n  User telemetry \u201cpaints with a broad brush\u201d, but by definition measures the most impactful work. Below is an example of our build-over-build tracking of the  firstChild API across our user base. This data isn\u2019t directly actionable, since it doesn\u2019t provide all the details of the API call (i.e. what shape and size is the DOM tree) needed for performance tuning, but it\u2019s the only direct measurement of the user\u2019s experience and can provide feedback for planning and retrospectives.\n  We highlighted our  Performance lab and the nitty-gritty details of measuring browser performance a while ago, and while the tests themselves and the hardware in the lab has changed since then, the methodology is still relevant. By capturing and replaying real-world user scenarios in complex sites and apps like Bing Maps and Office 365, we\u2019re less likely to overinvest in narrowly applicable optimizations that don\u2019t benefit users. This graph is an example of our reports for a simulated user on Bing Maps. Each data point is a build of the browser, and hovering provides details about the statistical distribution of measurements and links to more information for investigating changes.\n  Our Performance lab\u2019s fundamental responsibility is to provide the repeatability necessary to test and evaluate code changes and implementation options. That repeatability also serves as the platform for synthetic benchmarks.\n In the benchmark category, our most exciting improvement is in  Speedometer. Speedometer simulates using the  TodoMVC app for several popular web frameworks including Ember, Backbone, jQuery, Angular, and React. With the new DOM tree in place and other improvements across other browser subsystems like the Chakra JavaScript engine, the time to run the Speedometer benchmark decreased by 30%; in the Creators update, our performance focus netted another improvement of 35% (note that Speedometer\u2019s scores are a measure of speed and thus an  inverse function of time).\n  Of course the most important performance metric is the user\u2019s perception, so while totally unscientific, we\u2019ve been super excited to see others notice our work!\n   kudos to Microsoft, latest Edge version is nearly 50% faster on  https://t.co/KFX8Y4SpDI (and now crushes Firefox)\n  Latest Edge also 2x faster for Ember. Finally, some change I can believe in! Good work Edge team. ????  pic.twitter.com/nj6Qld4aTW\n  We\u2019re not done yet, and we know that Microsoft Edge is not yet the fastest on the Speedometer benchmark. Our score will continue to improve as a side effect of our performance work and we\u2019ll keep the dev community updated on our progress.\n  A fast DOM is critical for today\u2019s web apps and experiences. Windows 10 Creators Update is the first of a series of releases focused on performance on top of a re-architected DOM tree. At the same time, we\u2019ll continue to improve our performance telemetry and community resources like the  CSS usage and  API catalog.\n We\u2019re just beginning to scratch the surface of what\u2019s possible with our new DOM tree, and there\u2019s still a long journey ahead, but we\u2019re excited to see where it leads and to share it with you!

He had been married to his wife, Abigail, for more than twenty years. The medical students who performed the autopsy declared Allen\u2019s body anatomically female, but the coroner continued to call the deceased \u2018he\u2019 because \u2018I considered it impossible for him to be a woman, as he had a wife.\u2019 The marriage certificate convinced the coroner to ignore Allen\u2019s anatomy: social gender trumped biological gender. The rest of the community agreed. Allen wore trousers, worked as a manual labourer, had a wife and was called James. He was \u2018sober, steady, strong and active\u2019. Of course he was a man. Only after Allen\u2019s death, as news of the autopsy spread, did some people begin to express different opinions: they\u2019d always noticed his lack of facial hair, they said, and oddly high voice. But, even then, for every person who feminised Allen in retrospect, another insisted on his masculine traits \u2013 a face roughened by a life spent outdoors, large hands hardened by decades of work as a groom and sawyer.\n As Jen Manion\u2019s  Female Husbands and Rachel Mesch\u2019s  Before Trans show, a considerable number of people assigned female at birth lived as men, between genders, and outside gender during the 18th and 19th centuries \u2013 long before the rise of endocrinology and gender affirmation surgery. The people documented in these books were rich and poor, rural and urban, fixed and itinerant, literate and illiterate, French, British and American. Some had sex with men, some with women, some with both, some with no one at all. Almost all were white and, Manion shows, on the rare occasions when journalists and police did interact with trans people of colour, they focused on race. Femininity was so bound up with whiteness that a black woman who passed as a man was not seen to be making as great a gender leap as a white woman who did so. And because blackness was associated with enslavement, what white people noticed most about a black female sailor, say, was not that a woman had taken on a man\u2019s role but that an African American had exercised an unusual degree of freedom.\n As the title  Before Trans suggests, Mesch doesn\u2019t use \u2018trans\u2019 to refer to her book\u2019s three French gender-nonconformists, although they sometimes used masculine titles and pronouns. Mesch refers to them as \u2018she\u2019 throughout, arguing that none fully renounced the use of female pronouns, even as they sought to defy the rules imposed by the obsessively gendered French language. \u2018They\u2019, now widely adopted as a singular pronoun by individuals who combine or move between genders, seems to me the more appropriate choice for these figures. Because Manion\u2019s female husbands chose to live as men, I refer to them using male pronouns.\n Mesch\u2019s first subject, Jane Dieulafoy (b. 1851), was a French patriot, a Catholic, an archaeologist and a sharpshooter in the Franco-Prussian War. They were married to the engineer and archaeologist Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy and together the couple undertook a number of expeditions to Persia. Their \u2018common dress\u2019 reflected their common interests (one journalist wrote that Dieulafoy\u2019s male attire enabled \u2018man and wife\u2019 to enjoy \u2018unbroken companionship\u2019). Joan of Arc served as inspiration and precedent, legitimising the expansion of \u2018femininity\u2019 to include defending the nation, but Dieulafoy\u2019s activities included the modest as well as the epic: writing novels about women warriors and designing gender-neutral costumes for amateur theatrics.\n The novelist Rachilde, born Marguerite Eymery in 1860, also made use of an external authority to gain a degree of gender autonomy. Aged sixteen, they claimed to be possessed by the spirit of Rachilde, a 17th-century Swedish count, and soon afterwards began to wear men\u2019s clothes and ordered calling cards printed with \u2018Man of Letters\u2019. Rachilde, Mesch writes, was \u2018never entirely sure\u2019 of their identity, but \u2018had long been sure\u2019 they were not a woman. Raoule, the protagonist of  Monsieur V\u00e9nus (1884) , Rachilde\u2019s most famous novel, alternates between male and female dress and becomes a female husband to an effeminate young man. Asked to account for the book by the Paris police, Rachilde described it as a tale about a woman who sexually penetrates men, \u2018noting that anything was possible with the help of technology\u2019. They stopped wearing trousers after marrying Alfred Vallette in 1889, but continued to respond to both \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and \u2018Madame\u2019.\n Mesch\u2019s third subject, the art critic Marc de Montifaud (1845-1912), born Marie-Am\u00e9lie Chartroule de Montifaud, rejected gender categories altogether, insisting on a radical individualism: not \u2018he\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019 but \u2018I am me.\u2019 Montifaud used both male and female pronouns and took male and female lovers; after they married, both partners went by \u2018Monsieur Montifaud\u2019. Montifaud\u2019s salacious short stories weren\u2019t safe from French obscenity laws, however, and resulted in prison sentences, confinement in asylums and temporary flights into exile.\n Mesch\u2019s gender renegades were wealthy and educated, so records of their inner lives survive. They wrote memoirs, letters and novels, commissioned portraits and compiled scrapbooks. By contrast, Manion\u2019s working-class British and American subjects rarely had much control over the way they were represented by journalists and balladeers. Most female husbands made the news only after something went wrong in their lives. Some were blackmailed while others were exposed after falling ill or getting arrested.\n Female husbands expressed their masculinity through their choice of clothing, names, behaviours and, above all, their labour and their marriage status. As tavern keepers, soldiers, sailors, mountebanks, builders and itinerant tinkers, they rejected the belief that those born female couldn\u2019t do men\u2019s work. Husbands were not born, but made. Because most people believed that marriage could exist only between a man and woman, having a wife was just as convincing a proof of manhood as physical strength, a long stride and a tendency to drink too much and get into fights.\n Some female husbands remained in stable unions for decades. Others, revealed to have been born female, moved to new places and continued to live as men, or were forced to dissolve their marriages, in some cases resuming female attire. The way women responded to their female husbands varied with the state of their relationships. Some wives pressed charges. In 1838, Henry Stoake, an oven builder from Manchester who had lived as a man since his late teens, was exposed by his wife of 22 years. Angry that he was holding back her housekeeping allowance, she sought a legal separation and tried to secure a claim to his assets by telling her lawyer that Stoake had been born female. (In fact, her revelation cast doubt on whether she was legally married at all.) Other wives stood by female husbands who ended up on the wrong side of the law. When George Wilson was arrested for vagrancy after fainting in a New York street in 1836 (there wasn\u2019t yet a crime of dressing as the other sex to charge him with), Elisabeth, his wife of fifteen years, fetched him from the police station to the house the couple shared with her father. Samuel Bundy, born Sarah Paul, a sailor, was jailed in 1760 on a charge of fraud for marrying a woman (his initial defence was that a shark had eaten his penis). Bundy was reportedly visited in prison by a dozen women to whom he had paid court; his wife refused to press charges and eventually he was released. Nine months later, living as a woman, Bundy married a man.\n Female husbands troubled their communities because they proved it wasn\u2019t always straightforward to tell men and women apart, despite the notion of \u2018opposite sexes\u2019. The consequences of this unease could be severe. In 1746, Charles Hamilton, an itinerant quack doctor in the southwest of England, was reported to the authorities by his wife of two months for \u2018pretending herself a man\u2019. He was publicly whipped in four different towns, then sentenced to six months\u2019 hard labour. (By the time Hamilton\u2019s story surfaced in a Boston newspaper, he was reported to have had fourteen wives.) But many female husbands were supported by their communities, and press coverage could be sympathetic. James Howe began to live as a man in 1732, aged sixteen, and had been married for thirty years before his desperation at being blackmailed by a childhood acquaintance led him to reveal his secret. After his friends and neighbours learned that Howe had been born female, they took the news in their stride. The blackmailer was sentenced to four years in prison for extortion. A widely circulated account of the trial, Manion notes, portrayed Howe as \u2018a person of integrity \u2013 despite their gender ambiguity\u2019.\n Female husbands had varied relationships to masculinity. Some transitioned to maleness early in adolescence, others much later; some lived as men for most of their lives, some only briefly and others moved between genders. In 1852, 17-year-old Mary Robins met the 32-year-old Mrs Panton, who claimed to be an illegitimate royal \u2013 born male but forced to disguise himself as female to avoid scandal. Mrs Panton dropped that disguise to wed Mary Robins as Albert Guelph. During the honeymoon, Mary learned that Albert was the mother of three children, and the marriage was annulled. Guelph resurfaced four years later in Syracuse, New York, when the father of his next bride reported him to the authorities, this time against his daughter\u2019s wishes.\n In both these books, gender has more to do with habit than biology. According to Manion, female husbands knew that \u2018what makes a man is not the sex they are assigned at birth but the life they live.\u2019 In the  Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle argued for a form of knowledge he called practical: one learns to become a swimmer by swimming. One might say that a person becomes a man by living as a man. Mesch proposes that gender isn\u2019t a label so much as a story, although judging by these accounts, it\u2019s not just one story but many. The stories trans people told about themselves often collided with the way others understood them. Family members, neighbours, employers, spouses, lovers, police officers and doctors could make or unmake the tale and the teller.\n Trans people encounter resistance not only because they challenge widely held notions about gender but also because they threaten society\u2019s conformist tendencies. Dieulafoy, for example, found much more acceptance than Rachilde, because Dieulafoy\u2019s masculinity served the French imperial state. The press lauded them as an \u2018intrepid explorer\u2019 whose Persian expeditions added treasures to the Louvre. The same holds true for some of Manion\u2019s female husbands. Robert Shurtliff, an American soldier in the War of Independence, also known as Deborah Sampson, was celebrated for acting out of the \u2018purest patriotism\u2019 and without \u2018any selfish motives\u2019. When the British soldier James Gray revealed that he had once been Hannah Snell, he was treated as a hero. By contrast, the deliberately perverse Rachilde, determined \u2018to be strange or nothing at all\u2019, was denounced, censored and pathologised. When a judge found Albert Guelph guilty of vagrancy in 1856, he claimed that he had \u2018harmed the entire community\u2019.\n As society\u2019s ideas about gender changed, so too did attitudes towards female husbands. After the rise of feminism in the 1840s, female husbands became associated with the growing numbers of women eager to vote, go to college and work in jobs formerly reserved for men. The press began to fret that a once eccentric phenomenon might soon become widespread. In 1883, the  New York Times announced that \u2018many women \u2026 if they had the opportunity, would select other women as husbands rather than marry men.\u2019 Although reports of female husbands remained rare, agitation about gender-crossing intensified. With the rise of sexology in the 1880s, doctors and journalists began to see female husbands as lesbians, that is, as more female than husband. Sex, now considered a fixed biological essence, began to trump gender: no longer a person successfully living as a man, the female husband was a deviant woman.\n Then as now, conservatives feared that the many would follow the few. In 1837, a religious conservative in Boston warned that what Manion calls \u2018transing\u2019 might \u2018become universal\u2019. In the 1860s, US states and cities began to enact laws that made it a crime for women to dress as men and men as women. If there was no widespread hysteria about trans people using public toilets, it was only because there were so few public toilets. Those that did exist were indeed sites of gender trouble. In 1870, for example, Fanny (n\u00e9e Frederick) Park and Stella (n\u00e9e Thomas) Boulton were arrested for disturbing the peace, then charged with conspiracy to commit sodomy, after using the Ladies\u2019 Retiring Room in a London theatre.\n Mesch and Manion correctly point out that feminist and lesbian scholars long disregarded or downplayed the self-definitions of people who had spent their lives insisting they were not women. Mesch cites Rachilde\u2019s assertion that they were \u2018not a feminist\u2019 because they were \u2018not a woman\u2019. But the zeal with which Mesch and Manion take those scholars to task suggests that they believe lesbians and feminists to be especially hostile to trans existence. This is a view shared by many young people, who associate the term \u2018lesbian\u2019 with transphobic ideas about who is and is not a woman. It is far more common, however, for feminist organisations and individuals to support transgender rights. In 2019, more than seventy self-identified UK women\u2019s rights advocates signed a letter distancing themselves from trans exclusionary activists. All the major feminist organisations in Iceland supported a 2019 law that allows people to legally change their gender without a medical diagnosis and created an option for a third gender on all official documents. The tensions among some lesbians, feminists, trans people and their supporters are real. But these groups also have common enemies and shared goals, beginning with liberating us all from the relentless gender policing that begins before birth.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 14:51:38",

pointed out that we\u2019re missing a step-by-step guide on how to go from an idea, to hardware, to a fully implemented feature in Xous for Precursor. So, here it is.\n Because Precursor uses an FPGA for its SoC, we can add new features to the hardware \u201con the fly\u201d. In this case, we\u2019re going to add some improvements to our basic managed TRNG block. To review, the existing TRNG consists of an  avalanche noise source and a  ring oscillator noise source as hardware-based sources of \u201ctrue\u201d entropy. Two generators are used for the following reasons:\n An external discrete generator is easy to check (just put an oscilloscope on the avalanche noise source), but harder to protect against physical access attacks\n An integrated, on-chip generator is harder to hack (more robust against a pair of tweezers executing a short-to-ground attack, or RF interference attacks), but harder to check (is the data from the TRNG, or merely a decoy CSPRNG implant?)\n All hardware mechanisms are fallible; having two sources improves robustness against transient drop-outs or aging failures\n We\u2019ve already done extensive, months-long characterization of both of the TRNG sources and found them to produce passable raw entropy. However, the system is still missing two features that are generally considered to be best practice:\n Independent, on-line health monitors of the raw TRNG outputs. It\u2019s important that the health monitoring happens before any conditioning or mixing of the raw data happens, and significantly, there is no one-size-fits-all health monitor for a TRNG: it\u2019s advised ( NIST SP 800-90B sec 4.4) to have tests that are tailored to the noise source.\n Conditioning of the raw data. Despite best efforts to make TRNGs unbiased and flawless, they are really hard to get right. Furthermore, they are only capable of producing high-quality entropy at a limited data rate. Thus, most practical systems take a TRNG output and run it through a cryptographic stream cipher to generate a final datastream; this simultaneously protects against minor flaws in the TRNG while improving the availability of random numbers.\n The following lengthy posts walk step-by-step through the thought process, implementation and debugging process of adding these features. Few people would even notice these features, and if everything is doing its job right (that is, the TRNG\u2019s raw data is working correctly) is indistinguishable from the state before all this effort. However, we take TRNGs seriously here; so much rides on the quality of these random numbers that it\u2019s probably worth the effort to harden them against failures, be they unintentional, malicious, or just design bugs.\n I have to be honest, I spent a lot of time to check a box that few people care about, but I\u2019ve come to realize that\u2019s mainly what writing OS code and firmware is about. You can get more fame and dopamine from creating a cool UI theme with an afternoon of work. It\u2019s also really hard to explain to everyday people what you\u2019re doing exactly with all this time and effort; but without the underlying frameworks that make things durable and reliable, we all might as well be drawing chalk pictures on the side walk.\n Without further ado, here are the two guides for adding features, there\u2019s some repetition between the posts so they can be read independently.\n  I\u2019ll also take highlights from these wiki articles and repost them to the blog here, creating a \u201cTL;DR\u201d version that is also neatly delivered to the inboxes of my blog\u2019s email subscribers.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 14:47:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u524d\u4f53,precursor,trng", "title": "\u5347\u7ea7\u524d\u4f53\u7684TRNG ", "title_en": "Upgrading Precursor\u2019s TRNG", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6094", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u524d\u4f53", "precursor", "trng"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067148, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "It was early June in 1987 when Richard Stallman announced the release of the GNU C compiler version 1.0. As I wrote in  Open Sources, it was the most thrilling and most terrifying day of my life (up to that point). Having first read and lightly hacked Emacs code in 1985, having read and lightly hacked GDB code in 1986, I eagerly attended a week-long lecture series on Emacs Stallman gave in Febrary 1987 at MCC in Austin Texas. By day, my appreciation for Stallman and the GNU project grew as I as I began to understand the depth of his technical designs, the beauty of his implementation approaches and the method by which both were protected  for me instead of  from me by the GPL. By night, my curiosity grew as Stallman would steal moments between lectures and especially at the end of the day to hack on a project he was not yet ready to disclose.By the end of the week in February the secret had been revealed to me: he was working on a C compiler and was in the final stages of polishing the optimizer. I was 22 years old at the time, and I still harbored a dream that I might someday write &#34;The Great American Compiler&#34;. I was thrilled to have a chance to see how a master like Stallman would write such a thing, and I was terrified that I would never create something worthy of recognition if he had been there first. When Stallman announced version 1.0, 20 years ago to this day (more or less), I had a decision to make: I could join him, I could compete with him, or I could pick a new dream. I downloaded GCC version 1.0 and began a collaboration that would last for ten years (when, due to RSI, I gave up programming as a mainstream activity.)GCC version 1.0 was a watershed event in my life. The first day I was intent on just learning how it worked--the parser, the lexical analyzer, the intermediate code generator, the optimizers, and the machine-dependent assembly output routines. I printed all the files (consuming three reams of paper) and proceeded to lay them out in piles across my extra-large dining table and any other horizontal surfaces I could see from my central position. I brought out the colored pencils I&#39;d used when learning the art and science of integrated circuit design (red for polycilicon, green for n-diffusion, blue for metal, yellow for n-well, and black for vias and contacts) and gave the colors new meanings to track data, code, and other relationships relevant to compilers. After five days and nights, something &#34;clicked&#34; and I no longer needed the printouts--the data structures and basic organization suddenly became &#34;obvious&#34;. I put away the pencils and began to itch with the desire to hack GCC, and not lightly.I decided to take the next step--to write a completely new port of the compiler to a microprocessor that had always fascinated me: the National Semiconductor 32032. I already had the manual from my days at the Moore School of Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, and so I began the process of replacing templates used for the VAX and Motorola 68020 processors with templates appropriate for the National chip. I immediately ran into problems--but they were small problems and easily fixed. I had GCC generating code for the National chip within a few days, and I had it generating correct code a few days after that.When I did this work, the typical compiler company charged millions of dollars for the service of delivering a compiler in 12-18 months, and sometimes longer. Two weeks to the day after I downloaded the compiler from the Free Software Foundation, I had it generating code that was 20% faster that the code coming from the National compiler. If I compared the $3000/month salary I earned at the time with what these companies charged, I delivered a product that was 20% better (6-9 months in Moore&#39;s Law time) for 1/1000th the cost in 1/30th the time. It was a heck of a 23rd birthday present to myself!Within hours of posting an announcement of this new port, it became obvious to me and to others that there were many optimizations I had not yet implemented. After another two weeks of work, I was generated code that was 40% faster than the National compiler. 40% was an important number because the 32032 was marketed as a &#34;1 MIPS&#34; chip (meaning able to execute one million instructions per second), but it only benchmarked at 0.75 MIPS and was headed for commercial irrelevancy. With my 32032 port, the chip benchmarked above 1 MIPS, proving to me that the hardware guys had delivered, but the software guys had not. I also realized that even in 1987, there were already sufficiently many people to make a collaborative process very successful.I went on to write many other ports that summer, demonstrating with remarkable consistency that by hacking on GNU, I could routinely generate better product faster than whole teams of compiler-writers employed by much larger companies. By the end of that year I went on to achieve a new goal, which was to write the GNU C++ compiler. To me, GNU C++ was &#34;The Great American C++ Compiler&#34;, a new, improved version of my original goal. And because I benefited so much, both by what others shared with me before I started hacking, and by the helpful suggestions and bugfixes I received after I started hacking, I, too, shared freely the knowledge I had gained. I wrote and delivered the first comprehensive training on the GNU compiler internals, giving my 100+ LaTeX slides to Stallman so he, too, could earn money by teaching others how to hack. Two years later, I formally commercialized the commercial advantages of GNU software, and the rest, as they say, is history.I wonder what the next 20 years will bring...", "posttime": "2021-06-21 14:46:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4eca\u5929,years,warning", "title": "\u597d\u5427\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e8c\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u524d\u4eca\u5929\uff082007\u5e74\uff09 ", "title_en": "Well It Was Twenty Years Ago Today (2007)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://opensource.org/node/155", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4eca\u5929", "years", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e492a7568242d1ed8f079e2558c390e1.jpg", "infoid": 1067147, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Google Chrome\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86Web\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5e02\u573a\u4efd\u989d\u7684\u94c1\u6293\u5730\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc720\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5728\u9ad8\u8b66\u62a5\u4e0a\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8c37\u6b4c\u521a\u521a\u5728\u4e00\u5468\u5185\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u7d27\u6025\u5347\u7ea7\u8b66\u544a\u3002\n           \u5728\u5b98\u65b9\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\u5728\u533f\u540d\u63d0\u793a\u540e\uff0c\u5728Chrome\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u201c\u96f6\u65e5\u201d\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fdb\u5165\u91ce\u5916\u4e4b\u524d\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4fee\u8865\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b89\u5168\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u96f6\u5929\u5206\u7c7b\u662f\u6307\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5df2\u77e5\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5e76\u79ef\u6781\u88ab\u5265\u524a\u3002\n    \u5173\u4e8e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08CVE-2021-30554\uff09\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5728WebGL\u4e2d\uff0c\u5448\u73b0\u51fa\u7528\u4e8e\u6e32\u67d3\u7684JavaScript API\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u96f6\u65e5\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u5c0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u591a\u5730\u8d2d\u4e70Chrome\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5347\u7ea7\u3002 \u201c\u8c37\u6b4c\u610f\u8bc6\u5230CVE-2021-30554\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u91ce\u5916\uff0c\u201d\u6240\u6709Chrome\u6280\u672f\u65b9\u6848\u7ecf\u7406Sista\u90fd\u8868\u793a\u3002\n    \u8981\u6253\u51fb\u8fd9\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\uff0cChrome\u7528\u6237\u5e94\u8be5\u7acb\u5373\u8fdb\u5165\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff06gt;\u5e2e\u52a9\uff06gt;\u5173\u4e8eGoogle Chrome\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u7684Linux\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7248\u672c\uff0cMacOS\u548cWindows\u4e0a\u5217\u4e3a91.0.4472.114\u6216\u4ee5\u4e0a\u60a8\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\uff0c\u8bf7\u624b\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e00\u65e6\u66f4\u65b0\u5c31\u7eea\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u8fd8\u786e\u8ba4\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u7248\u672c\u7684Chrome\u4e2d\u4fee\u8865\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u4e09\u4e2a\u201c\u9ad8\u201d\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\n    CVE-2021-30554\u662f\u81ea\u5e74\u5e74\u5c4a\u81ea\u5e74\u5c81\u53ca\u4e00\u5468\u4e4b\u4e8c\u7684\u94ec\u4e03\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7b2c\u4e03\u5f20\u96f6\u70b9\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u91ca\u653e\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e5f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eChrome\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\n    \u76ee\u524d\uff0cChrome\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u660e\u667a\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8b66\u60d5\u3002\u4e0a\u5468\u5411BleepingComputer\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u8b66\u544aKaspersky\u8b66\u544a\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u7fa4\u65b0\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u79f0\u547c\u81ea\u5df1\u201cPuzzlemaker\u201d\u5728\u94fe\u63a5Chrome\u96f6\u65e5\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u6210\u529f\u7684\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728Windows\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u6076\u610f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3002\u4e0a\u5468\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u672c\u8eab\u4e3aWindows\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86\u7d27\u6025\u5b89\u5168\u8b66\u544a\u3002\n  \u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u94ec\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u65fa\u5b63\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8b66\u62a5\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u60a8\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u65b0\u3002 ", "note_en": "Google Chrome retains an iron grip on  web browser market share with well over two billion users. Unfortunately, all those users need to be on high alert because Google has just issued its second urgent upgrade warning in a week.\n           In an  official blog post, Google has confirmed that a new \u2018zero-day\u2019 exploit has been found in Chrome after an anonymous tip-off. Most security flaws are discovered and patched before they get out into the wild, but a zero-day classification means the vulnerability is known to hackers and actively being exploited.\n    Little is known about the vulnerability (CVE-2021-30554) other than it being found in  WebGL, a JavaScript API for rendering. It is standard practice for Google to keep zero-day details to a minimum to buy Chrome users more time to upgrade. \u201cGoogle is aware that an exploit for CVE-2021-30554 exists in the wild,\u201d is all Chrome technical program manager Srinivas Sista  has said.\n    To combat this threat, Chrome users should immediately go to  Settings &gt; Help &gt; About Google Chrome. If your browser version on Linux, macOS and Windows is listed as 91.0.4472.114 or above you are safe. If not, manually check for updates and restart the browser once the update is ready. Google also confirmed that three other \u2018High\u2019 level threats are patched in this version of Chrome.\n    CVE-2021-30554 is the seventh zero-day vulnerability found in Chrome since the turn of the year and the second in a week. Google typically does a fine job releasing fixes quickly but their effectiveness is also determined by the speed with which Chrome users update their browsers.\n    Chrome users would also be wise to be extra vigilant at this time. Speaking to  BleepingComputer last week, security vendor Kaspersky warned that a new group of hackers calling themselves \u2018PuzzleMaker\u2019 have been successful in chaining together Chrome zero-day bugs to install malware on Windows systems.

Plastic waste isn&#39;t going away, but the next big pollution problem to compound our anxieties is e-waste. So why toss out a perfectly good, albeit cracked and worn, phone?\n      1. Probably isn&#39;t even that old (do you get a new computer every 1-2 years????)\n  2. Probably has 4-8 processors and ~4 GB of RAM- and  definitely has a built-in UPS. Slap an external hard drive on it, and it looks like the perfect candidate to back up your entire home network!\n    Fair warning: This is a &#34;because I can&#34; type of project. Since we&#39;re still working with Android, we have a few hoops we&#39;ll have to jump through and we are limited in many ways. This probably won&#39;t be the easiest way to do backups on your home network, nor will it be the best use of UrBackup. HOWEVER, once it&#39;s set up and running, it&#39;s very easy to manage backups for multiple machines and to add storage.\n      Root your phone. I won&#39;t be going over this today, but head over to   Magisk to root your phone and come back when you&#39;re finished.\n Keep in mind, I&#39;m making some very specific configuration decisions in this tutorial, and most of them are to accommodate the quirks of working with Debian on Android in a chroot environment.\n                    Although you can technically store your backups on an SD card, this is  NOT recommended. SD cards are slower, less reliable and cannot handle constant writing for an extended period of time. If you&#39;re planning on backing up to an SD card, just plan on it getting corrupted within a year (or even within a month, if you have a lot of data).\n              a. On your rooted phone, head over to GitHub and download the .apk packages for   Linux Deploy and   BusyBox. Install the apps.\n      b. Once installed, open up BusyBox. Select  Install. Once installation is complete, take note of where BusyBox was installed; here, you can see it was installed at &#34;/system/xbin&#34;. You will need this location later.\n      C. Open up Linux Deploy and navigate to the settings icon on the bottom right.\n                      PSA: ONCE YOU MOUNT YOUR BLOCK DEVICE, YOU MUST UNMOUNT OR SHUT DOWN YOUR SERVER BEFORE PHYSICALLY DISCONNECTING YOUR BLOCK DEVICE. YOU WILL LIKELY LOSE ALL OF YOUR DATA IF YOU DISCONNECT YOUR BLOCK DEVICE WITHOUT UNMOUNTING.\n    d. Navigate back to the welcome screen and select the top left menu. Select  Settings and scroll all the way down to  PATH variable. Here is where you want to set the location BusyBox was installed in   step 1.b. Once the PATH variable is set, select  Update ENV.\n      e. Navigate back to the welcome screen and select the top right menu. Select  Install. You will see a live log of the installation. Once complete, the log will end with &#34;deploy&#34;. Select  START at the bottom left of your screen. You are now running a Debian server on your Android phone!\n            The IP address is the same as your phone, the port will be 22, and you can login with the credentials you set in step 1.c. The rest of this tutorial assumes you are logged in as root. You can see your IP when you open Linux Deploy:\n                This is the latest stable release as of writing. Check their   download page for updates.\n        During installation, you will be asked where you want your backup directory to be. Remember this location for the next step. If you&#39;ve already mounted storage in   step 1.c, set this to that mountpoint.\n      In this example, I will set the backup directory at &#34; /mnt/backup&#34;. If you&#39;ve already mounted your storage, your directory will already be created; if not, create the directory:\n                We will not be able to call systemd in a chroot environment, so we need to start the service manually:\n    But instead of typing this out all the time, we can just create a script for this:\n                    This will result in a log of the server starting up. CTRL-C will stop the service, so open up another SSH session.\n            Since we can&#39;t &#34;enable&#34; the UrBackup service the traditional way, we&#39;ll set a cron job to start at boot. In addition, if you ever disconnect your external block storage or reboot your phone, the permissions to your backup directory may revert. To ensure these things are set at reboot, add cronjobs:\n                                              Follow the &#34;Download preconfigured client installer for Windows&#34; link and install the client. Follow the instructions to install, and you&#39;re done.\n                  During the installation, the script will ask you to select a snapshot mechanism. Enter &#34;2&#34; for &#34;LVM - Logical Volume Manager snapshots&#34;:\n                urbackupclientctl  set -settings \\ -k internet_mode_enabled  -v  true \\ -k internet_server  -v  &#34; YOUR_SERVER_IP&#34; \\ -k internet_server_port  -v  &#34;55415&#34; \\ -k computername  -v  &#34; YOUR_CLIENT_NAME&#34; \\ -k internet_authkey  -v  &#34; YOUR_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_KEY&#34;\n  Ensure &#34; YOUR_CLIENT_NAME&#34; is the same hostname you set in step   3.b and &#34; YOUR_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_KEY&#34; is the key your server generated   previously.\n    Return to your web interface and you may find that your client is not online. Click  Settings on the top navigation bar:\n        (You can uncheck &#34;Do image backups over the internet&#34; and &#34;Do full file backups over the internet&#34; if all of your clients are local.)\n            Still in  Settings, click Client settings. Check &#34;Separate settings for this client&#34; and set the directories you want backed up in &#34;Default directories to backup&#34; under  File Backups. Multiple directories can be added with a semi-colon &#34; ;&#34; in between.\n                        Your client should now be connected. You might see &#34;No paths to backup configured&#34; under &#34;File backup status&#34;, but this is ok. This is what it will say until you&#39;ve completed your first backup. Also note that, if you have connected a Linux client, image backups are not supported. However, you can simply run an image backup from your Linux client and set the directory of the backup images to be backed up by this server.\n              If you&#39;ve already mounted your storage and you&#39;re happy with your setup, you&#39;re done! If you want to add some flexibility to your storage, continue to   Part II! LVM allows you to add or remove storage without having to transfer data to another storage device; you can simply add the amount of storage you need, or simply remove unused storage you want to use elsewhere. Part II will mostly be an exercise in LVM (Logical Volume Management), and, although it isn&#39;t difficult, it&#39;s definitely a process.\n                  Have more questions about UrBackup?

A byproduct of these public health protocols has been lower rates of other viral and seasonal diseases like colds and the flu. But, as these safety measures are easing up, and crowds once again gathering unmasked, the spread of viral droplets seems to be resuming.\n One virus in particular that is on the rise is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In a  statement last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a warning that RSV cases, after rapidly declining in April 2020, are back and climbing, especially in the South.  CDC data show that the rate of positive RSV antigen tests are currently about tenfold what they were this time last year.\n RSV predominantly affects infants, young children, and older adults. In an ordinary year, the  CDC says that about 58,000 children under the age of 5 and 177,000 adults 65 years and older are hospitalized because of it. RSV causes flu-like symptoms (runny nose, fever, coughing, loss of appetite, etc.), but it can also increase susceptibility to more serious respiratory conditions like bronchiolitis and pneumonia\u2014the virus is the leading cause for those two illnesses in babies under a year old. Like there is no cure for the common cold, there is also no specific treatment for RSV infection other than symptom management.\n Given just how anomalous this season\u2019s RSV infection patterns are, the CDC also mentioned that \u201cat this time it is not possible to anticipate the likely spread, peak, or duration of activity with any certainty.\u201d\n  RSV infections in the US are usually contained within the fall and winter cold and flu seasons. Such elevated numbers of infections during the summer months are alarming, but likely due to the fact that the virus didn\u2019t circulate much during the winter months.\n Sally Goza, immediate past president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, told   The Washington Post that during an ordinary fall and winter, her practice goes through boxes and boxes of flu and RSV tests. But this year, \u201cwe didn\u2019t go through a box of tests.\u201d\n The decreased RSV circulation this past year was a double-edged sword. While all the safety measures of the pandemic decreased the amount of germs the average person was regularly exposed to, it may have also  delayed the development of immune systems in young children, an effect that scientists will need to study in future years. The CDC said that \u201colder infants and toddlers might now be at increased risk of severe RSV-associated illness since they have likely not had typical levels of exposure to RSV during the past 15 months.\u201d Goza agreed and said to  The Washington Post that she\u2019s worried about the potential uptick of older children contracting diseases usually concentrated among babies\u2014\u201cThose patients who had not had a chance to catch these things will catch them at ages we don\u2019t usually see.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 13:58:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u63ed\u5f00,unmask,rsv", "title": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u4eec\u63ed\u5f00\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75be\u75c5\u6b63\u5728\u9020\u6210\u5371\u9669\u7684\u590d\u51fa ", "title_en": "As people unmask, other viral diseases are making a dangerous comeback", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.popsci.com/health/rsv-infections-rising-post-covid/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u63ed\u5f00", "unmask", "rsv"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "921f6f8492ff7087f574949e8804b63a.jpg", "infoid": 1067144, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6b64\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u8981\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5f55\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u3002\n \u4ece2022\u5e747\u67086\u65e5\u8d77\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5c06\u6709\u4e49\u52a1\u9002\u5408\u5e26\u7740\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50\u201d\u7684\u201c\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50\u201d\u5e02\u573a\u63a8\u5411\u6b27\u6d32\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53f7;\u7528\u4e8e\u5f55\u5236\u6280\u672f\u6570\u636e - \u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f46\u6d89\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8c01\u5c06\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b83\uff1f\n \u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\u6253\u7b97\u62e5\u6709\u6240\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u5f55\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7740\u540d\u7684\u201c\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50\u201d\u548c\uff0334;\u7528\u4e8e\u98de\u673a\u3002\u8be5\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u524d\u4e00\u79d2\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\uff08\u4e58\u7528\u8f66\u548c\u578b\u6c7d\u8f66\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5230\u4e24\u8f6e\u673a\u52a8\u8f66\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u6267\u6cd5\u5b98\u5458\u5c06\u88ab\u6388\u6743\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8bbf\u95ee\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4fdd\u9669\u516c\u53f8\u8bbf\u95ee\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u3002\n \u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5c24\u5176\u5305\u62ec\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5236\u52a8\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u76d8\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u8def\u4e0a\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u5426\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u5c06\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u786e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\uff0c\u5e76\u5411\u5236\u9020\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee4\u4eba\u62c5\u5fe7\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002\n  \u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u627f\u8bfa\u88ab\u533f\u540d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u8f66\u8f86\u8bc6\u522b\u53f7\u7801\u6216\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u8f66\u8f86\u6240\u6709\u8005\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u4e0e\u98de\u673a\u9ed1\u5323\u5b50\u98de\u884c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4eea\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f55\u5236\u9a7e\u9a76\u8231\u8c08\u8bdd\uff01\n   \u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u80fd\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u8f66\u8f86\u5c31\u4f1a\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u4e4b\u524d\u548c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u79d2\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u5f55\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5c06\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u3002 ", "note_en": "This system cannot be switched off and will operate continuously as soon as the vehicle is in motion while recorded data will be constantly overwritten with new data.\n From July 6, 2022, auto manufacturers will be obliged to fit new models destined for the European market with a kind of \u201cblack box&#34; for recording technical data \u2014 data that can then be used in the event of an accident. But what data is involved, and who will have access to it?\n The European Union intends to have all new cars fitted with new data recording systems similar to the famous \u201cblack boxes&#34; used on aircraft. The idea is to gain access to a set of specific technical data relating to the seconds preceding collisions, of varying degrees of severity. This applies to all categories of cars (passenger cars and utility vehicles), but not yet to two-wheeled motor vehicles. Note that only law enforcement officials will be authorized to access this data, when necessary, and not insurance companies.\n The data involved notably includes the vehicle\u2019s speed, braking, steering wheel angle, its incline on the road, and whether the vehicle\u2019s various safety systems were in operation, starting with seatbelts. The system will also make it possible to identify the precise type of vehicle and to provide feedback to manufacturers about incidents of concern.\n  All data is promised to be anonymized, in that the data will not include the vehicle identification number or any other information that could identify the vehicle owner. And, unlike aircraft black box flight recorders, no cockpit conversations will be recorded!\n   This system cannot be switched off and will operate continuously as soon as the vehicle is in motion. However, recorded data will be constantly overwritten with new data, except for the seconds prior to and following collisions.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 13:58:44", "source_domain":

Moving parts seize-up, circuit boards fail, cables wear out. If a user needs a replacement connector, chip, ribbon, gear, shell\u2014or any of the thousands of other parts that, in time, can break, melt, discolor, delaminate, or explode\u2014they\u2019re usually out of luck, unless they have a spare system to scavenge.\n  But there is an exception to this depressing law of nature. In San Jose, on a side street next to a highway off-ramp, inside an unmarked warehouse building, is part of the world\u2019s largest remaining collection of factory-original replacement Atari parts \u2014\u00a0a veritable fountain of youth for aging equipment from the dawn of the home computing and video gaming era. This is the home of Best Electronics, a mail-order business that has been selling Atari goods continuously for almost four decades.\n  But if you&#39;d like to share in Best\u2019s bounty, as many die-hard Atari fans desperately do, there&#39;s a very important piece of advice you need to keep in mind: whatever you do, don&#39;t piss off Bradley.\n  Almost everyone who spends enough time loving, collecting, and using Atari products eventually finds their way to the Best Electronics website. And many of them quickly develop strong feelings about Bradley Koda, Best&#39;s proprietor, who, by outlasting most of his competition, has become a sort of one-man Atari-parts powerhouse.\n  His stock spans all Atari eras. Would you like to buy  only the buttons and faceplate circuitry for an Atari Lynx? Just the keyboard for an Atari 800? Maybe you&#39;d like to replace an individual faulty chip on the motherboard of an Atari 7800? Or perhaps you\u2019d like a brand-new mouse for an Atari ST? Best has all these things and much more.\n  And the crucial thing, from a buyer&#39;s perspective, is that these are not salvaged parts. They&#39;re unused originals, for the most part acquired directly from Atari&#39;s warehouses and preserved, for decades, in Koda&#39;s sole custody. He has simply never run out.\n  A single order from Best can transform a malfunctioning, beat-up Atari system into a thing of beauty \u2014\u00a0a portal to a time when 64K was all the RAM a person could ever want.\n  No other seller on the planet has managed to maintain as extensive an inventory of brand-new Atari replacement parts and peripherals in the 25 years since Atari exited the hardware business. And this inventory has become intensely desirable to retro-tech devotees over the past two decades, as trade in ancient gaming and computing gear has evolved into a passion-driven collector\u2019s market.\n  Most of Koda&#39;s customers adore him. He&#39;s a skilled service technician with an encyclopedic knowledge of Atari systems. He helps customers put the joy back in their joysticks with fresh replacement circuit boards. He has been known to diagnose complex Atari ailments over the phone. He even occasionally produces his own fresh runs of crucial replacement parts when his vintage stock runs dry\u2014most recently a brand-new AC adaptor for the Atari 2600, to replace his customers\u2019 malfunctioning 40-year-old power bricks.\n  But even those who love buying from Koda admit that they experience a slight tingling of animal fear every time they order from Best Electronics.\n  \u201cIf I don\u2019t hear back from him in three or four days, I get nervous trying to reach out again,\u201d said Steve Maks, an Atari Lynx collector from the Chicago area who has placed orders with Best occasionally over the past 20 years. \u201cIt\u2019s like, am I going to get on the ban list? Will I not be able to buy for six months? He\u2019s the only source for some of these parts.\u201d\n  \u201cIf you call him too many times in a month, he gets annoyed with you,\u201d said Xavier Ulyanovich, an Atari enthusiast from Oklahoma and a longtime Best customer. \u201cIf you try to order too many things, he gets annoyed with you. It just comes down to having to adapt to the way he does business. Once you\u2019re on his shitlist, it\u2019s kinda hard to get off.\u201d\n  Among Atari fans, Best is almost as famous for ignoring and blacklisting badly behaved customers as it is for selling Atari parts. A first attempt to buy from Best Electronics is a sink-or-swim proposition: learn the rules, or accept your fate.\n  Every purchase from Best Electronics requires personal interaction with Koda. Although he\u2019s fond of using the editorial \u201cwe,\u201d he is a one-man operation, and he doesn\u2019t believe in automation. &#34;We prefer to talk, Via E-Mail, Phone or E-FAX to our Atari customers, and make sure you getting the Right Atari Replacement Parts / Items the first time,\u201d he explains on the Best website, in his inimitable prose style.\n  Koda is a monopolist, of a sort, but he\u2019s no Jeff Bezos. Best Electronics has no virtual shopping cart, or any other Amazon-esque conveniences. The store\u2019s website looks the same as it has since the early 2000s: it\u2019s a lengthy, multicoloured text scroll, as if Jack Kerouac quit the novel-writing business (but not the benzedrine) and started typing about Atari.\n  Best\u2019s catalog is only available in print. It costs $7.50 plus shipping, is the size of a small phone book, and is more than 20 years out of date. It needs to be cross-referenced with an \u201caddendum\u201d section on the Best website, where Koda has logged about 65 typewritten pages\u2019 worth of piecemeal price changes and other corrections over the past two decades.\n  Anyone who can\u2019t figure out this system risks being deemed a time-waster. In emails to customers, Koda often laments his busy schedule, and he seems to take distractions personally. He would rather lose a sale than suffer someone who hasn\u2019t learned the rules.\n  At least two users of the AtariAge forums, a large online Atari fan community, have reported being blacklisted from Best for the same crime: revising their orders repeatedly. Koda processes each order by hand, and complains bitterly when made to write up more than two invoices for a single buyer. Both users claimed, in outraged AtariAge posts, that they were banned from buying for a year.\n  Another common infraction is trying to buy more than a few items at a time. Koda will not handle large orders. Repeated attempts to convince him to make an exception will cause a customer&#39;s future emails to be ignored. (Recently, the limit has been three items.)\n  The no-large-orders rule has an important corollary: Koda will not accept PayPal orders under $50. Failure to find a happy medium quickly enough can scuttle a sale.\n  As Koda\u2019s supplies of certain sought-after parts have dwindled, he has imposed lifetime one-per-customer limits on some of them. Attempts to circumvent those limits can also result in a buyer being shunned.\n  And there are more creative ways to get banned. One AtariAge user told me that, in 2014, he had just finished paying for a purchase from Best Electronics when he noticed that Koda had refunded his money. Along with the refund came a note: &#34;see your email to Best Electronics dated 2012.\u201d\n  In 2012, the user had tried to buy 20 cables at once \u2014 a rookie mistake. When Koda declined the order, the user retorted with a promise to shop elsewhere. The meaning of the refund was that Koda had decided to hold this buyer to that promise, even if it meant not making a sale.\n  Kevin Lund, a retro computing enthusiast from the Bay Area, used to work near Koda&#39;s offices. \u201cI had been in the habit of going to his office to pick up parts on my lunch hour,\u201d Lund says. Over a period of several years, Lund was a loyal customer. According to his recollection, he placed an order with Best once every few months. One day, he made a fatal mistake.\n  \u201cI had ordered a speaker for an Atari 800 computer I was restoring for a friend,\u201d Lund says. \u201cAnd I forgot to pick it up from Best at the agreed time. When I went to place my next order a couple months later, Bradley reminded me that I hadn\u2019t picked up that speaker from him at his office and that he\u2019d waited for me for two hours. And he said he wouldn\u2019t sell to me again.\u201d As in,  ever again.\n  Being exiled from Best Electronics can be sort of a  Paradise Lost situation. Expelled from Koda&#39;s Eden of pristine replacement parts, buyers are forced to wander the earth&#39;s thrift stores and junkyards, scavenging circuits from husks of yellowing plastic. (Or they have their friends secretly order from Best on their behalf.)\n  Working one&#39;s way back into Koda&#39;s favour after exile can be difficult, or outright impossible.\n  \u201cHe rarely returns any of the emails I send asking for forgiveness,\u201d Lund says. \u201cI had been doing it every six to eight months or so, hoping he might change his mind, but he holds a grudge pretty good. And this was over a five-dollar part.\u201d\n  But Atari fans keep coming back. There are, after all, no true alternatives. And, for some, there may be a certain appeal to buying computer and gaming parts from a store that still sells them the way they were sold in 1983. \u201cIt\u2019s almost part of the charm, maybe,\u201d says Maks, the Atari Lynx collector. \u201cIs there some sort of nostalgia for the Best website, in the same way there\u2019s nostalgia for  Asteroids on the Atari 2600? Maybe that\u2019s part of it.\u201d\n  Successful orders are richly rewarded. Days later, a box lands in the buyer\u2019s mailbox, like a meteoroid from some alternate universe where it\u2019s still 1995. Even before they open that box, they know it&#39;s something special. Koda wraps every package in Atari-branded shipping tape from the 1980s. It seems he has a lifetime supply of it.\n   So, how did one person corner the Atari-parts market, and why is he apparently so indifferent to selling his stuff?\n  I sent Koda an email to request an interview, and received the expected response: I was wasting his time.\n  &#34;Sorry for the delay in getting back to you Steve,&#34; he wrote. &#34;It is very simple here. Unless your E-Mail is about placing an Atari order we do not have the free time to answer it.&#34; He closed with a suggestion that I try again in six to eight months.\n  Although he wouldn&#39;t talk to me, he has given two extended interviews that I&#39;m aware of: one to a German Atari enthusiast named Andreas Bertelmann in 2007 and another to ANTIC, an Atari podcast, in 2014. In those interviews, he explains the unique circumstances that led to him becoming the Standard Oil of Atari parts.\n  According to Koda, he was living in the Bay Area, not far from Atari\u2019s Sunnyvale corporate headquarters. It was the early 1980s and Silicon Valley was awash with Atari goods. Even the injection moulding plant where he worked was under contract with Atari, cranking out plastic parts around the clock. He started moonlighting as an Atari dealer.\n  \u201cI saw an opening in the way Atari did business, a long time ago,\u201d he  told ANTIC. \u201cThey had their dealers set up for replacement parts, but it wasn\u2019t very good. We were always getting requests from people saying I need this, I need that, so I saw a little bit of a window there. As a part-time hobby I started buying stuff at dealers or whatever I could find in the Valley here. Sometimes dumpster divers would bring us pallets of stuff. That\u2019s how it started.\u201d\n  The great video game crash happened in 1983. Almost overnight, Atari was transformed from a fast-growing, ludicrously profitable tech company into a money-losing albatross.\n  In 1984, Atari\u2019s corporate parent, Warner Communications, sold Atari\u2019s consumer products division to a company fronted by ex-Commodore CEO Jack Tramiel. Along with the company, Tramiel inherited warehouses full of excess 8-bit computers, consoles, and software Atari had produced during its brief heyday. Distributors were no longer keen on it. Retailers were no longer buying it.\n  Tramiel and his sons spent years liquidating that stock \u2014 sometimes by tossing it into scrap heaps. Meanwhile they committed their own string of product blunders, culminating in one of Atari\u2019s most notorious mistakes: its 64-bit home video game console, the Jaguar. In 199 6, Atari reverse merged with a hard drive manufacturer and effectively ceased to exist. (Atari&#39;s brand name and intellectual property are now owned by an unrelated company.)\n  Best Electronics was one of a handful of small businesses that discovered they could profit off of Atari&#39;s constant overproduction and market failure by buying up unsold products and parts in very large quantities, at large discounts, directly from Atari warehouses in the Sunnyvale area. They were essentially betting that there would continue to be a small but active market for product lines that Atari had abandoned \u2014 which, of course, turned out to be a good bet.\n  A pivotal moment for Koda and his contemporaries came as Atari was facing its final demise. The company&#39;s last Sunnyvale warehouse was choked with unwanted goods, and there were fewer willing buyers than ever before.\n  Another Atari store that partook in some of these liquidation deals was Minnesota-based Video 61, which was (and is still) owned by a genial midwesterner named Lance Ringquist. \u201cRegular dealers that dealt in Atari were pretty much wiped out by poor support for the machines and for the market,\u201d Ringquist told me. \u201cAtari would try to invite whoever they could into these warehouses to buy this stuff. They were always looking for someone to unload it on, because there was so much of it.\u201d\n  \u201cBy the last warehouse, there was hardly anybody interested at all. Atari was pretty much dead,\u201d Ringquist said.\n  But Best was still interested. In the Bertelmann interview, Koda claims to have purchased over 8,000 pallets of items from Atari\u2019s warehouses over the course of his career. And it appears that a lot of that purchasing happened towards the end of Atari\u2019s run.\n  Prior to Atari\u2019s collapse in 1996, Koda\u2019s catalog was 46 pages long. After Atari folded, he released a new version, with 228 pages.\n  But none of this explains the endless rules and stipulations, the blacklisting, or the website. Ringquist\u2019s operation is similarly bare-bones, so I\u2019ll let him speak for old-school Atari dealers everywhere: \u201cThere are boxes in my warehouse that I have not opened yet, from the late 1980s,\u201d he told me. \u201cI don\u2019t need a fancy modern site. The stuff sells itself. It sells faster than I can unpack. So, I mean, how much faster do we want to sell it? I have no spare time at all. I should be retired by now.\u201d\n  In some markets, a merchant with a pattern of refusing sales and banning customers might eventually be out-competed, but Koda has no true competition. His stock is unique in the world.\n  For many years, it was possible to buy new-old-stock Atari goods from a few other suppliers, but most are now out of business or greatly diminished.\n  San Jose Computer and American Techna-Vision are long gone. B&amp;C Computervisions, a California electronics shop that worked directly with Koda to buy large lots of Atari goods in the 1980s and 1990s, still sells a few things on eBay. But the store&#39;s owner, Bruce Carso, is semi-retired. There is some concern and speculation among Atari enthusiasts about how much longer Carso intends to stay in business, and what will become of his inventory when he finally chooses to step away.\n  Lance Ringquist&#39;s Video 61 is still open for business, and it still has a decent stock of new software for certain Atari systems. But Ringquist told me that he&#39;s recovering from a serious injury he suffered while working in his warehouse. He&#39;s not sure how long he can continue. When he retires, he plans to pass whatever remains of his stock on to his children. He&#39;s not sure what they&#39;ll do with it.\n  Koda himself is most likely in his mid-60s, and his stock is starting to dwindle. \u201cI imagine he\u2019s probably tired all the time,\u201d Ringquist says. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not so easy.\u201d\n  \u201cWe\u2019ve got to conserve our strength, and do the best we can to keep serving the community as long as we can. Because when we\u2019re gone, that\u2019s it.\u201d\n  When Best is gone, the world&#39;s Atari users will be without a centralized source of factory-original replacement parts for the first time ever. In a very literal sense, Koda and his inventory are all that remains of a once-great American tech empire.\n  He saved it all for himself. But the important thing is: he saved it all.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 13:16:06", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4fdd\u6301,piss,atari", "title":

Olympic Stadium, Glinda the Good Witch, Disney\u2019s Cinderella, the art series \u201cUnweave a Rainbow\u201d by neo-surrealist painter Ariana Papademetropoulos, Sir Isaac Newton, the first \u201cviral\u201d ad campaign of the late Victorian era, and morose Dutch still-life paintings have in common? They all reflect a preoccupation with soap bubbles, with shiny, shimmery, and iridescent spheres that we tend to associate with children and play.\n Far from being objects that just feed our natural proclivities toward shiny and shimmering surfaces, bubbles are a recurring trope in the history of philosophy, literature,  the arts, and science. \u201cMake a soap bubble and observe it; you could spend a whole life studying it,\u201d Sir William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, allegedly said in the late nineteenth century.\n  You may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the provided link on any marketing message.\n  Interest in bubbles in the arts, literature, and sciences reached a high point in the seventeenth century, when they became closely associated with the concept of  vanitas vanitatum, the fragility and transience of human life.  Homo bulla (man is a bubble) was a concept dear to the baroque era.\n The symbolism of homo bulla was already proverbial by the first century BCE. Varro (116\u201427 BCE) wrote the following in the first line of the first book of De Re Rustica: \u201cfor if, as they say, man is a bubble (homo bulla), all the more so is an old man,\u201d he wrote. In his  Satyricon, Petronius (1st century CE) has a character bemoan the sudden death of a friend whose funeral he just attended by saying, \u201cWe are meaner than flies; flies have their virtues, we are nothing but bubbles.\u201d\n    One of the most eminent early examples appears in a dialogue by second-century CE Greek-language writer Lucian of Samosata. In his  Dialogue between Charon and Mercury, the former says:\n I\u2019d like to tell you, Mercury, that to me all men and their lives seem alike. Have you ever watched those bubbles that form in the pool of a waterfall? The foam which is made up of bubbles? The tiny ones break and vanish immediately\u2026. That\u2019s what man\u2019s life is like.\n When it comes to the visual arts, we have to credit Dutch artists for making bubbles a popular subject. In 1574, the Dutch painter Cornelis Ketel depicted a husky putto (cherub) standing against a cloudy sky on a bed of grass, in the act blowing bubbles. The inscription above, in Greek, reads \u201cman is a bubble.\u201d This panel is on the reverse of a portrait of Adam Wachendorff, the secretary of the London offices of the Hanseatic League, a trading alliance of European cities.\n \u201cIt is likely that Ketel\u2019s painting provides the first appearance of a soap bubble, as opposed to the more traditional air bubble on a water surface as in the Dialogue of Lucian,\u201d writes the mathematician Michele Emmer in the journal Leonardo. (In 2019, Emmer curated a monographic exhibition on bubbles across the arts in Perugia, Italy.) In 1594, Hendrik Goltzius completed bubble- and putto-themed engravings that cemented the soap bubble as an enduring theme in Dutch art. In one titled \u201cHomo Bulla,\u201d a putto languidly leans on a skull as he absent-mindedly looks at the bubbles he just blew.\n  Throughout the seventeenth century, the putti started being \u201cdowngraded\u201d to mere children. As the literary scholar Sarah Tindall Kareem wrote in her 2015 article \u201c Enlightenment Bubbles, Romantic Worlds:\u201d\n The popularity of the subject of children blowing soap bubbles might be partly attributable to seventeenth century Dutch culture\u2019s valorization of children\u2019s play evident in the new genre of compendia of children\u2019s games in which blowing bubbles is standard part of the repertoire.\n The 1663 painting \u201cBoy Blowing Soap Bubbles\u201d by Karel Dujardin sees a boy looking with satisfaction at the bubbles he has just sent flying. He is balanced on a soap bubble resting on top of a shell, which is the only surrealist element of what would otherwise look like a realistic, if slightly mythologized, depiction of a youth entertaining himself.\n  Of course, not all depictions of bubbles feature children. In David Bailly\u2019s \u201cVanitas: Self-portrait of the Artist, Still Life,\u201d from 1651, floating bubbles appear alongside busts, candles, portraits, and skulls in a standard still-life setting. Similarly, Jan Steen\u2019s \u201cThe Dancing Couple\u201d (1663), leaves childhood imagery behind to depict a tavern scene where people are definitely having fun: musicians play, people dance, eat, and drink, while children play with their toys. The presence of cut flowers, broken shells, and soap bubbles are there to remind us of the transience of merriment and pleasure, but that does not necessarily have to mean doom and gloom.\n \u201cWhen, in overly moralized interpretations, we reduce such paintings to pictorial sermons on vanity, we fail to grasp\u2026the ambiguous wholeness of these images,\u201d writes the art historian  Paul Barolsky. This wholeness \u201cprompt[s] us to reflect not upon mortality alone, but upon the ways life and death define each other.\u201d\n  Between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, bubbles also became a popular subject in literature. In 1591, Francis Bacon asserted that \u201cThe world is a bubble.\u201d In other words, a bubble is a microcosm of the world: each individual element bends toward fulfilling its purpose within the whole.\n The seventeenth-century poet Richard Crashaw, who is best known for his religious poetry in English, also wrote erudite poems in Latin. One of them, \u201cBulla,\u201d extensively describes a soap bubble in hallucinogenic detail: \u201cThere by the contiguous waters pale little torches droop. Here the vein of a very delicate wave full of the neighboring flames learns the purple paths and leaps from the red channel,\u201d reads one translation. \u201cHere is the intricate labor of heaven: orbs are in the path of orbs; here the herd of the golden fleece is the pellucid herd of the ether; which wear down the black pasture of night in pure bites.\u201d\n  These passages record the ever-changing play of light and color on the surface of the bubble, while also acknowledging how hard it is to put into words. \u201cThe task Crashaw set himself in the poem is doomed to fail from the outset,\u201d writes the Renaissance poetry scholar  Stephen Guy-Bray in the  Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies. \u201cBut while \u2018Bulla\u2019 may not accurately describe a bubble, it could certainly be argued that it provides more information than a painting could: if we take \u2018Bulla\u2019 as an example of the popular Renaissance debate over the respective merits of painting and poetry we could argue that poetry wins.\u201d\n A bubble becomes a conceit that allows for the conceptualization of other things, of fictionality. As the literary scholar Kareem writes:\n The bubble\u2019s liminal status, materially between water and air, spatially between ground and sky, temporally between inflation and bursting, parallels fiction\u2019s own boundary-crossing nature, making the bubble uniquely suited to metaphorically rendering the temporary transport fiction provides.\n  Towards the end of the seventeenth century, scientists latched onto the subject of bubbles as well. \u201cIt is probably not insignificant that this same period saw soap bubbles achieve their greatest fame as a subject for painting,\u201d Emmer (the mathematician) writes. \u201cIt is thus likely that children\u2019s games and works of art stimulated scientists to try to understand the workings of these phenomena that were attractive and entertaining.\u201d\n In 1672, the English scientist Robert Hooke made this observation to the Royal Society in England:\n A mass of bubbles was created in a soap solution by blowing into it through a glass tube. At the beginning of the experiment, one could easily see that the soap film enclosing each bubble of air was a clear white colour, without any trace of other colours. But after a while as the film gradually became thinner, one began to see all the colours of the rainbow on the surface of the bubbles.\n In his  Opticks: or, a treatise of the reflexions, refractions, inflexions and colours of light published in 1704, Sir Isaac Newton described the surfaces of bubbles in great detail. He argued that their colors are produced \u201con the same grounds that thin plates or bubbles do reflect or transmit those rays [of color].\u201d Colors of bubbles, to him, were \u201ca common observation\u201d from which a theory could be built.\n  In 1827, the Bolognese painter Pelagio Palagi painted \u201cNewton Discovers the Refraction of Light,\u201d where Newton is depicted in being struck by the discovery of the phenomenon of light refraction as he observes a child blowing bubbles. In the painting, the bubble becomes the world, or at least its formal analog: just like a globe is placed on the right-hand side of Newton, the bubble occupies a similar position with the child. \u201cBubbles were to be to optics what apples had allegedly been to gravitation,\u201d the historian of science Simon Schaffer once wrote.\n  In the following centuries, bubbles remained a subject dear to the arts. Jean-Baptiste Chardin\u2019s \u201cLes Bulles de Savon\u201d (circa 1734) depicts two children who are playing at the moment when a bubble, already formed, is about to escape from the pipe. The search for complex moral or philosophical significance, beyond the evident allusion to the fragility of human life, is totally absent. The art historian  Theodore Rousseau Jr. writes:\n Judging from contemporary accounts, it appears unlikely that Chardin painted under the direct influence of any idea derived from classical or literary sources. His father, a carpenter, who is described as \u201cdistinguished by a talent for making good billiard tables,\u201d was a poor man and unable to give him a formal education\u2026\n So, rather than focusing on the symbolism, Chardin concentrated on the technical aspects of his paintings.\n  Nineteenth century artists including \u00c9douard Manet tended to away from the connotations of vanitas. The fourteenth canto of Byron\u2019s \u201cDon Juan\u201d suggests how the bubble becomes a child\u2019s plaything and a cosmic globe. Sarah Tindal Kareem writes that \u201c[h]e moves away both from the bubble on a water surface as a symbol of vanitas and from connotations of puffery, embracing instead the soap-bubble as an emblem of verse\u2019s sheer, ludic joy.\u201d\n On the other hand, John Keats famously accused Newton\u2019s  Opticks of \u201cunweav[ing] a rainbow,\u201d both at a dinner party hosted in December 1817 by Benjamin Haydon and in his poem \u201cLamia.\u201d He claimed Newton \u201chad destroyed all the poetry of the rainbow, by reducing it to prismatic colors,\u201d according to Haydon\u2019s own account. Nineteenth-century physicists and mathematicians, most notably the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau, would devise a formula that could predict and explain the iridescent patterns of soapy films.\n Yet they  kept evoking a sense of wonder. \u201cThey are soap bubbles, pure chimerae that attract the imagination,\u201d wrote Fyodor Dostoevsky in  Crime and Punishment. In  A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain stated, \u201cA soap-bubble is the most beautiful thing, and the most exquisite in nature\u2026 I wonder how much it would take to buy a soap-bubble if there was only one in the world.\u201d\n In the late nineteenth century, pre-Raphaelite painter  John Everett Millais departed from the medieval settings of his earlier paintings, which featured sensuous maidens, to depict a boy blowing bubbles.

", "note_en": "By  one estimate, there are between 2.2 million and 3.8 million species of fungi \u2014 and more than 90% of them aren&#39;t cataloged.\n  But mycologists (as fungus professionals are known) do get a big boost from a surprisingly sophisticated world of amateurs \u2014 both those who tromp through the forests observing oddball species, as well as those who have helped build a community that links the amateurs with the pros.\n    Consider the story of Taylor Lockwood, a 74-year-old mushroom enthusiast and professional photographer. This spring, we met in the hills of West Virginia, where he has been prowling the countryside in a van he has converted into a camper, a photo studio and a workshop.\n  &#34;I&#39;m in my Edison mode,&#34; he says, gesturing toward circuit boards and hardware that he has cobbled together.\n    More about that in a minute, but first the backstory. Growing up, Lockwood spent the 1970s playing electric violin and other instruments in bands out West.\n    He also worked as a carpentry contractor. And in 1984, while living on the Mendocino coast of California, he fell in love. With mushrooms.\n  &#34;Outside my cabin were these beautiful mushrooms,&#34; he says. &#34;And it was as if these mushrooms looked at me and said, &#39;Taylor, go out and tell the world how beautiful we are.&#39; And I said, &#39;OK, I&#39;ll do it.&#39; &#34;\n  Lockwood bought camera gear and became passionate about photographing mushrooms. One of his images is even on a U.S. postage stamp. He says sometimes he would dig a hole next to a mushroom for his camera so he could get just the right angle.\n    His passion for mushroom photography has taken him around the world. And what he has  found and photographed doesn&#39;t simply have artistic interest.\n  He, like many amateur mushroom hunters, works symbiotically with the mycologists in universities and government labs.\n    &#34;I might have hundreds or thousands of photos of things that are unnamed or unknown, or might be known on some other continent,&#34; he says.\n  He made one of those memorable discoveries here in the Monongahela National Forest. A few years back, he came across something he had never seen before: a mushroom that looked like tiny fingers wearing off-white gloves.\n    &#34;Like most mushrooms, I saw it as natural beauty,&#34; he says, &#34;and that&#39;s why I took a picture of it.&#34;\n    He posted that photo on a website called  mushroomoberver.org, where professional and amateur mushroom experts meet to crowdsource information. The site is the brainchild of Nathan Wilson, another amateur who started the project in 2006.\n  &#34;I&#39;d always wanted to have something computer-based for sharing my observations of mushrooms that I&#39;d made over my lifetime,&#34; he says. So he applied his software skills to the task.\n  &#34;I told my friends about it, and they told their friends about it, and it has been successful beyond my wildest dreams,&#34; Wilson says. He says it now houses millions of images from all over the world. And these days he&#39;s not alone \u2013  inaturalist.org also catalogs millions of fungi images, along with records of many other branches of the tree of life.\n    &#34;There are many more amateurs than there are professionals,&#34; Wilson says, &#34;and the professionals often end up relying on amateurs \u2014 or  quote amateurs.&#34;\n  &#34;It&#39;s not uncommon to find people who are not professionals, who are still world class in terms of their ability to identify groups and even publish species,&#34; he says.\n      His photo caught the attention of Amy Rossman, who for many years headed research at the federal government&#39;s voluminous fungus collection in Beltsville, Md. She recognized the distinct form of this mushroom but found only three records of it growing in the United States \u2013 two from Tennessee in 1888 and a third sample, from Maine, cataloged in 1915.\n  A sample of this rare mushroom made its way to a graduate student in Scotland who  ran a DNA test on it and verified its identity,  Hypocreopsis rhododendri, known in the United Kingdom, where it is rare, by the common name &#34;hazel gloves.&#34;\n  Rossman says it&#39;s not only rare, but it also appears to have a bizarre lifestyle. It doesn&#39;t grow directly on wood. It is a parasite that lives only on another species of fungus that forms a crust on rotting wood.\n  &#34;But the crust fungus itself is not very big, so you would wonder, how could you get a parasite that&#39;s so much bigger than the thing it parasitizes?&#34; Rossman says.\n  One hypothesis is that it essentially uses the crust fungus as a straw and sucks up nutrients through it. It&#39;s hard to study because most of the time, fungi like live hidden as tiny threads called mycorrhizae that run through their hosts.\n  Mushrooms &#34;are not like plants,&#34; she says. &#34;They don&#39;t come up at the same time every year, and so sometimes it can be decades between when a fungus fruits&#34; \u2014 that is, when it produces a mushroom cap. Rossman says that&#39;s why it&#39;s so valuable to have people like Taylor Lockwood poking through the forest with a trained eye.\n  He gives me a flavor of what that&#39;s like by taking me back to the spot where he found the specimen a few years back.\n  &#34;Who knows where it could be at this point!&#34; he says, surveying an abundance of downed and rotting branches in a boggy hollow festooned with ferns. But then his eye catches something of interest.\n  He reaches down to get a close look at a downed branch that has turned a color you don&#39;t usually see in wood.\n  &#34;This blue-green is   Chlorociboria ,&#34; he says . &#34;It&#39;s not fruiting now, but it shows the blue-green color of the fungi in here. And when it has little fruit bodies coming out, they are beautiful blue-green little ears.&#34;\n  Lockwood has been drawn back to this spot for his latest effort \u2014 and this gets back to the story of his portable workshop and his &#34;Edison mode.&#34;\n  A few years ago, he decided still photos weren&#39;t enough. He decided to make time-lapse videos of mushrooms.\n  &#34;When I do time-lapse, you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s lots and lots of life going around the mushroom \u2014 insect life and worms, and all kind of things like that,&#34; he says.\n  His art involves not only photographing a mushroom over time, but also putting his camera in motion to create otherworldly videos.  One of his videos looks like it could be an outtake from the science fiction classic  Avatar. At a campsite, he sets up a curved track made out of PVC plumbing pipe and puts a motorized, wooden camera platform on top.\n  &#34;It&#39;s all handmade stuff,&#34; he says. He plugs the motor into some circuitry he&#39;s built so the platform moves at something slower than a snail&#39;s pace, while the camera is set to take a photo every six seconds.\n  This is a test run to try out new gear he has built.

These two technologies have been introduced recently for the Linux kernel and Suricata is one of the first well established and mature projects to make use of them. eBPF was introduced in the Linux kernel to be able to run user provided code safely inside the Linux kernel and XDP is running eBPF code on the network data path, as close as possible to the Network Interface Card.\n The initial support for eBPF and XDP was initially available in Suricata\u2019s 4.1, released in November 2018, and it has been greatly enhanced in Suricata 5.0. The development team at Stamus Networks, lead by \u00c9ric Leblond, has been the primary developer of eBPF and XDP support within Suricata. The latest additions, list of features and potential use cases enabled by eBPF and XDP are becoming more significant, even vital, making this an opportune time to provide a high level overview for the community. This is the purpose of this article written by \u00c9ric Leblond and Peter Manev.\n   Stamus Networks has created a Network Traffic Analyzer (NTA), which uses network communications as a foundational data source for detecting security events, and married it with an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which provides deep packet inspection of network traffic using a rules based engine. The combination of these two approaches, done simultaneously in a single solution, provides a level of correlated data never previously achieved. We then added a Threat Hunting interface to allow security practitioners the ability to quickly and efficiently search through this security data to examine, validate, and resolve the security incidents that they face on a daily basis.\n  Suricata is a free and open source, mature, fast and robust network threat detection engine. The Suricata engine is capable of real time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM) and offline pcap processing. Suricata inspects the network traffic using a powerful and extensive rules and signature language, and has powerful Lua scripting support for detection of complex threats.\n Suricata\u2019s fast paced community driven development focuses on security, usability and efficiency. The Suricata project and code is owned and supported by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF), a non-profit foundation committed to ensuring Suricata\u2019s development and sustained success as an open source project.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 13:14:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "xdp,ebpf,suricata", "title": "eBPF\u548cXDP\u652f\u6301\u5728Suricata\u4ecb\u7ecd ", "title_en": "Introduction to eBPF and XDP Support in Suricata", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.stamus-networks.com/blog/2019/07/16/whitepaper-introduction-to-ebpf-and-xdp-support-in-suricata", "via": "", "real_tags": ["xdp", "ebpf", "suricata"]}]
