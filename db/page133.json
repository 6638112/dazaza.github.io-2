With the $21 million investment from K1, Eltropy aims to expand its communication suite and more than double its employee headcount.  &#34;K1 is thrilled to partner with the Eltropy team as they transform the way consumers interact with its financial institutions,&#34; K1 Vice President Christian Grant said in the June 16 announcement. &#34;The company continues to see mass adoption of its software, with another record bookings month in May 2021, as customers look to automate historically manual communication and workflow tasks.&#34;  As of early May, K1 intended to raise nearly $4 billion for K5 Private Investors, its fifth flagship software fund and largest raise to date. The private equity firm\u2019s fourth fund raised less than half that amount, at $1.5 billion. That fund invested in enterprise software companies that had an annual revenue of up to $50 million.  Founded in 2010, K1 has worked with more than 150 enterprise software companies, including project management software company Clarizen; communication and collaboration platform Rave Mobile Safety;

the national expansion of its virtual behavioral health solution designed specifically to support children, teenagers, and their families.\n   GV (formerly Google Ventures) led\u00a0Brightline\u2019s series B round, with participation from new investors Optum Ventures, 7wireVentures, and Gaingels, the leading venture investment syndicate in support of diversity and representing the LGBTQ community and allies. Debra Lee, chairman and CEO Emeritus, BET Networks, also contributed to the round as an independent investor.\n  Returning investors in the round include Oak HC/FT, Threshold Ventures, Blue Shield of California, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, SemperVirens VC\u00a0and City Light Capital.\n The round includes $7 million of venture debt from Silicon Valley Bank. Brightline has now raised a total of nearly $100 million in funding to date.\n Brightline, formerly Emilio Healthcare, developed a technology-enabled behavioral health home for children and their families. The company&#39;s growth\u00a0comes at a time when rates of behavioral health conditions are skyrocketing across the country and having a disproportionate impact on working families\u2014leading to rampant productivity loss and employees leaving the paid workforce in droves, according to Brightline.\n  Around 10 million American mothers living with their school-age children were not working at the start of 2021, a 1.4 million increase over the previous year, according to data from the Census Bureau.\n Brightline\u2019s own survey of working parents and caregivers found that 50% reported losing significant productivity at work in caring for their children\u2019s behavioral health needs.\n There is a need for family-oriented solutions to deliver behavioral health care services, according to Brightline executives.\n \u201cIn the past year, families everywhere have felt the impact of the pandemic on their children and daily lives. We\u2019re seeing more children, adolescents, and teens than ever with behavioral health challenges\u2014now is the time for us to get ahead of the coming wave of need,\u201d said Naomi Allen, Brightline CEO and co-founder in a statement.\u00a0\u201cWe are fortunate to have incredible partners in GV and all of our investors who joined us to make a difference in the lives of children and families. The latest funding will allow us to innovate even more quickly, expand rapidly, and help more children and families get the care they deserve.\u201d\n Brightline will use the cash infusion to scale its virtual\u00a0care across the country\u2014fueling the company&#39;s\u00a0growth as it\u00a0partner with leading national employers and major health plans to bring behavioral health support to families, according to the company.\n \u201cCDC data shows that an estimated 1 in 5 U.S. children has a diagnosed mental or behavioral health condition\u2014yet 80% will not get the care they need. Pediatric behavioral health care is often less accessible and comprehensive than care for adults,\u201d said Ben Robbins, psychiatrist and venture partner at GV who is joining Brightline\u2019s board of directors. \u201cBrightline addresses the huge unmet need of pediatric behavioral health services and is uniquely positioned to provide multiple levels of care based on the needs of patients and families.\u201d\n Livongo founder Glen Tullman, now CEO of Transcarent and managing partner at 7wireVentures, and Laura Veroneau, partner at Optum Ventures, are joining Brightline as board observers.\n Brightline also announced that they are embarking on their biggest expansion to date, introducing new products with nationwide availability and expanding clinical services to new states.\n Launched in 2019, Brightline&#39;s platform offers multidisciplinary care teams, a family-focused approach and\u00a0evidence-based care delivery, and innovative technology, Brightline is able to support families with whatever challenges they&#39;re facing.\n Telehealth helps to make mental health care easier to access for kids by doing away with some of the logistical burdens\u00a0of getting to and from frequent appointments.\n  There are a few pediatric startups making inroads in the digital health market. Hazel Health operates virtual care clinics inside the school nurse&#39;s\u00a0office\u00a0to connect\u00a0students to a physician via telehealth and recently landed a $33 million funding round.\u00a0Sprout, a tech-enabled autism care and treatment program, launched in July\u00a0on the back of $10 million in seed funding.\n Daybreak Health is another startup\u00a0trying to tackle the gaps in mental health care for kids. The company launched in February 2020 and specializes in providing online counseling services, especially for teens.\n Brighline has launched new products with nationwide availability and is expanding\u00a0clinical services to new states.

What does it mean when the creator of a software package uses their social power - but not their legal power - to try and influence user behavior? Are they violating the spirit of open source? Or simply making requests that acknowledge open source realities?\n  The actual back-and-forth is in the  pull request discussion. The  citadel of internet debate that is Hacker News will give you a sense of the larger community response. Briefly, what happened was:\n The creator of an open source software package asked that the package not be incorporated into a larger project. The creator acknowledged that it was technically legal to incorporate the package, but asked that it not be included anyway.  As the author of the package that is being re-packaged here. I\u2019m against it being repacked into here.While licensing wise I cannot stop you, I do hope you can honor my request.Thank you for considering respecting the author\u2019s wishes.\n  When pushed by the project\u2019s maintainers, the package creator explained that they were worried that including the package in the larger project would result in many support requests from the community.  If users experiencing issues with [the package], they will knock on my door. And I\u2019m not willing to support that or accept that burden.\n  Downstream maintainers pushed for more information or explanation. The creator continued to express disinterest in having the package included and in a conversation about the decision\n  Eventually the creator threatened to relicense the package in a way that would make it legally incompatible with the project\n Online opinion is split on this situation. However, some substantial part of the community has responded with a  version of:\n  What can be learned from this? Is this kind of request really against the spirit of FOSS?\n  It is notable that the creator did not kick off this discussion with the threat of legal action. Instead, the creator simply requested that the package not be included. They then explicitly acknowledged that they did not have the legal power to prevent it.\n This was a request that no one had a legal obligation to respect. And yet, the creator made it because (presumably) they believed that the package maintainers lived in a world that was governed by more than black letter legal rules.\n This strikes me as a totally healthy response on behalf of the creator. They clearly understood the consequences of releasing software under an open source license and the potential consequences of being included in a popular software package. The creator expressed these concerns by way of a social request instead of a legal threat because part of living in society is being able to resolve disputes without going to court.\n We will never know, but it strikes me as entirely plausible that the creator may have been willing to leave it at that - as a request that may or may not be complied with - until the maintainers decided to follow up.\n To be clear, the maintainers\u2019 initial response also strikes me as a reasonable one. They probably wanted to understand the concerns that would motivate someone to make the request. They may have also hoped to be able to address those concerns and/or talk the creator out of the objection.\n Unfortunately, this very human response by the maintainers also happened to push the creator to do exactly what the creator was hoping to avoid by raising the concern - spend time talking to people that they do not know about their package. Eventually, after the discussion continued, the creator decided to threaten to relicense the package in a way that would legally prevent inclusion.\n It is important to recognize that this discussion ran on parallel tracks. One track was based on legal requests (or the lack of legal requests). The other was based on social/cultural requests.\n That social/cultural track has the potential to be just as powerful as the legal one (in fact, it is the basis for  this idea). Its existence illustrates that the reasonable resolution of the dispute did not have to rely on a strict interpretation of legal rights. Society is more than the law! The maintainers could have ignored the request and faced meaningful social/cultural consequences without any sort of legal enforcement. Social norms are real and create real change in the world. Even in open source.\n  On the flip side, the package in question is licensed under an MIT license. That license includes a pretty clear \u201canything that breaks is not my problem\u201d disclaimer (in all caps):\n THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n If the legal rules were all that mattered here, the text of the license makes this entire dispute a non-issue. The creator offers the software as-is and disclaims any responsibility for it. Why would anyone come back to them if the software had a bug?\n Of course, the text of the license does not match social expectations. Licensing terms aside, the creator recognizes that there is a social expectation in the open source software community that creators maintain packages - or, at a minimum, that it is acceptable for users to reach out to creators to ask for support and/or flag bugs.\n While the creator seems to have understood that they have no legal obligation to deal with these requests, they also understood that they might have a social/cultural obligation to deal with them. Or, at a minimum, that the tools available to open source software creators make it hard to ignore a flood of requests. No amount of pedantic textual analysis of the license terms changes that.\n  This fits in with a long list of stories about how small pieces of code are used by millions without any sort of support for maintainers of the code. In some ways, this is a success story - a random person can create something that is used by millions! In other ways, it is a tragedy - a random person can create something that will make millions of people angry if it breaks!\n Regardless of how you see this dynamic, it is pretty clear that it can create disincentives for individuals (and small groups) to strive for success in open source software. While companies like  Tidelift are working to help solve this problem, being aware of the problem - and wary of how the problem might impact you - is far from failing to understand the spirit of open source software. In fact, it may be an incredibly clear-eyed understanding of how the spirit of open source software interacts with the reality of open source software. Furthermore, framing concerns about that dynamic as a social objection instead of a legal objection seems deeply within the spirit of open source software.\n As a related community, this type of creator burden is something that the open source hardware community should be aware of and work to address. At the same time, I am not convinced that it is exactly the same type of problem in hardware as it is in software. To the extent that open source hardware includes open source software the problems are essentially identical. However, it is different when applied to the hardware itself.\n That difference rests in the fact that design and distribution of software is collapsed into a single step - just post it to the repo. In hardware those steps are quite distinct. Designing open source hardware is quite separate from distributing actual pieces of hardware. That may make it harder for a single person to be responsible for maintaining a piece that is incorporated into millions of projects without any sort of support. But that\u2019s another blog post for another day. Even if the dynamic is not identical, it is certainly similar enough to think about and try to avoid in open hardware.\n  This post originally appeared on the OSHWA blogToday we are excited to announce that the open hardware journal HardwareX is integrating O...\u2026  Continue reading", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:58:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5f00\u6e90,\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1,govern,\u521b\u9020\u8005", "title": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53d7\u884c\u4e3a ", "title_en": "Licenses Alone Do Not Govern Behavior in Open Source", "transed": 1, "url": "https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2021/06/17/licenses-and-social-norms/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u6e90", "\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1", "govern", "\u521b\u9020\u8005"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fc3c31c58253862ab75e5fa9215631c1.jpg", "infoid": 1066994, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8f6c\u5230\u5bfc\u822a\u8df3\u8f6c\u4ee5\u641c\u7d22\u80a1\u7968\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7684\u56de\u5fc6\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f5c\u5bb6EdwinLef\u00e8vre\u76841923\u5e74\u7f57\u9a6c\u00e0\u8c31\u53f7\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u4e2d\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4eba\u7269\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5609\u5408\u6770\u897f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u7075\u611f\u5230\u90a3\u4e00\u70b9\u3002 [1]\n \u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u4ecd\u5728\u6253\u5370\u4e2d\uff08ISBN 0471770884\uff09\u3002 2009\u5e7412\u6708\uff0cWiley\u5728Holdcover\u4e2d\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ce8\u91ca\u7248\uff0cISBN 0-470-48159-5\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86Lef\u00e8vre\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u56fe\u4e66\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4eba\u548c\u5730\u533a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u7ecf\u7406Paul Tudor Jones\u7684\u524d\u8a00\u3002 [2]\n    1890-1910\uff1a\u5229\u6c83\u7f57\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4e0d\u6d3b\u52a8\u80a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51fa\u4ef7\u80a1\u7968\uff0c\u6760\u6746\u961f\u5728\u94f2\u6597\u5546\u5e97\u6760\u6746\u7387\u4e3a100\u81f31\u7684\u5c55\u793a\u6765\u6613\u4e8e\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002\n 1910-1920\uff1aLivermore\u662f\u7ebd\u7ea6\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u80a1\u7968\u4ea4\u6613\u5546\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u4ed6\u4e00\u904d\u53c8\u4e00\u904d\u5730\u7206\u53d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7528\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6760\u6746\u3002\n 20\u4e16\u7eaa20\u5e74\u4ee3\uff1a\u5229\u5f17\u96f7\u4ece\u4e8b\u5e02\u573a\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u6536\u8d39\u768425\uff05\u7684\u88ab\u64cd\u7eb5\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u57281934\u5e74\u521b\u5efa\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bc1\u5238\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\n  \u57282008\u5e74\u7684\u4e66\u4e2d\uff0c\u9a9a\u52a8\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u827e\u4f26\u683c\u6797\u65af\u6f58\u53eb\u4e66\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4e2a\u6295\u8d44\u667a\u6167\u7684\u5b57\u4f53\u3002\u5e76\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u7684\u62a5\u4ef7\u5982\uff06\uff0334;\u516c\u725b\u548c\u718a\u8d5a\u94b1;\u732a\u88ab\u5c60\u6740\uff06\uff0334;\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u8c1a\u8bed\u3002 [3]\n 2005\u5e743\u6708\u7684\u8d22\u5bcc\u6587\u7ae0\u5728\uff06\uff0334\u4e2d\u5217\u51fa\u4e86\u5b83;\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u6700\u806a\u660e\u7684\u4e66\u7c4d\u548c\uff0334;\u5173\u4e8e\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002 [4] \n\u5728Jack D.

It is told in the first person by a character inspired by the life of  stock trader  Jesse Livermore up to that point.  [1]\n The book remains in print (  ISBN\u00a0 0471770884). In December 2009,  Wiley published an annotated edition in  hardcover,   ISBN\u00a0 0-470-48159-5, that bridges the gap between Lef\u00e8vre&#39;s fictionalized account and the actual people and places referred to in the book. It also includes a foreword by  hedge fund manager  Paul Tudor Jones.  [2]\n    1890-1910: Livermore was able to make easy money by taking advantage of the  bid\u2013ask spread on inactive stocks with leverage of 100-to-1 at  bucket shops.\n 1910-1920: Livermore was a  stock trader on the  New York Stock Exchange, where he went bust over and over again because he used too much leverage.\n 1920s: Livermore engaged in  market manipulation, charging fees of 25% of the market value of the manipulated stock.

At the time,\u00a0KAERI\u00a0initially confirmed and then denied that the attack occurred.\n In a  statement and press conference held yesterday by\u00a0KAERI, the institute has officially confirmed the attack and apologized for attempting to cover up the incident.\n  KAERI states the attack\u00a0took place on June 14th after North Korean threat actors breached their internal network using a VPN vulnerability.\n KAERI\u00a0states that they have updated the undisclosed VPN device to fix the vulnerability. However,\u00a0access logs show that thirteen different unauthorized IP addresses gained access to the internal network through the VPN.\n One of these IP addresses is linked to a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group known as &#39;Kimsuky&#39; that is believed to work under the North Korean Reconnaissance General Bureau intelligence agency.\n  In October 2020, CISA issued an  alert on the\u00a0Kimsuky\u00a0APT group and stated\u00a0that they are &#34;likely tasked by the North Korean regime with a global intelligence gathering mission.&#34;\n More recently, Malwarebytes has issued a report on how Kimsuky\u00a0(aka Thallium, Black Banshee, and Velvet Chollima) has been actively targeting the South Korean government using the &#39;AppleSeed&#39; backdoor in phishing attacks.\n &#34;One of the lures used by Kimsuky named \u201c\uc678\uad50\ubd80 \uac00\ud310 2021-05-07\u201d in Korean language translates to \u201cMinistry of Foreign Affairs Edition 2021-05-07\u201d which indicates that it has been designed to target the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of South Korea,&#34; explains  Malwarebytes&#39; report on the threat actor&#39;s recent activities.\n &#34;According to our collected data, we have identified that it is one entity of high interest for Kimsuky.&#34;\n Malwarebytes states that Kimsuky\u00a0has targeted other South Korean government agencies in recent phishing attacks, including:\n  KAERI\u00a0states that they are still investigating the attack to confirm what information has been accessed.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 13:22:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f3a\u9677,korea,\u671d\u9c9c", "title": "\u97e9\u56fd\u7684\u6838\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u6784\u4f7f\u7528VPN\u7f3a\u9677\u653b\u51fb ", "title_en": "South Korea's Nuclear Research agency hacked using VPN flaw", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/south-koreas-nuclear-research-agency-hacked-using-vpn-flaw/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f3a\u9677", "korea", "\u671d\u9c9c"]}]
