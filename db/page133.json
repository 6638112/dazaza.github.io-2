Two years ago, an Amblin spokesperson publicly announced  that Spielberg intended to support changes to the Academy Awards that would reclassify Netflix films as TV movies, ineligible for Oscars like Best Picture.\n The push was planned during a time when Netflix-distributed film  Roma was poised to sweep the awards shows. But in the end, the Academy  rejected the calls from Spielberg and others to restrict eligibility.\n As is often the case, today&#39;s press release was accompanied by prewritten statements by various executives involved, including Spielberg himself. The quote attributed to him says:\n    At Amblin, storytelling will forever be at the center of everything we do, and from the minute [Ted Sarandos, Netflix co-CEO and chief content officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways. This new avenue for our films, alongside the stories we continue to tell with our longtime family at Universal and our other partners, will be incredibly fulfilling for me personally since we get to embark on it together with Ted, and I can\u2019t wait to get started with him, [Scott Stuber, Netflix Head of Global Film], and the entire Netflix team.\n Amblin is not new to streaming. The company has already produced films that have played prominently or exclusively on streaming platforms, perhaps most notably the Netflix original  The Trial of the Chicago 7 released last fall. Amblin has also produced a post-apocalyptic drama called  Finch that is scheduled to air on Apple TV+ later this year.\n Today&#39;s announcement could be a win for Netflix, which now faces numerous viable competitors (such as HBO Max or Disney+) in a streaming TV/film space that it has previously dominated.\n But if you&#39;re a fan of Spielberg&#39;s films, don&#39;t get too excited just yet: Amblin produces films made by directors other than Spielberg, so this deal is no guarantee that we&#39;ll be seeing the next Spielberg movie on Netflix.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:56:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ea4\u6613,spielberg,\u7535\u5f71", "title": "Steven Spielberg\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u516c\u53f8\u4e0eNetflix\u7b7e\u7f72Multifilm\u4ea4\u6613 ", "title_en": "Steven Spielberg\u2019s production company signs multifilm deal with Netflix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/steven-spielbergs-production-company-signs-multifilm-deal-with-netflix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ea4\u6613", "spielberg", "\u7535\u5f71"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "10ce5f01d343c28c065405b7956aee9f.jpg", "infoid": 1067299, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u97e9\u56fd\u8f66\u8f86\u5236\u9020\u5546\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u96c6\u56e2\u5ba3\u5e03\u6536\u8d2d\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u516c\u53f8\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u6743\u3002\n  \u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e7412\u6708\u542f\u52a8\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u8d2d\u4e708.8\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4efd\u989d\u3002\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u5c06\u6d89\u53ca\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ca\u5176\u9644\u5c5e\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6c47\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u683c\u6d1b\u6c83\u516c\u53f8\n \u73b0\u4ee3\u7535\u673a\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u6469\u6bd4\u65af\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u6765\u7684\u683c\u6d1b\u74e6\u548c\u6d8c\u6b27\u68ee\u8463\u4e8b\u957f\u5206\u522b\u670930\uff05\uff0c20\uff05\uff0c10\uff05\u548c20\uff05\u3002\n \u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u949f\u6b63\u5f0f\u63a5\u7ba1\u97e9\u56fd\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u3002\u6295\u8d44\u5c06\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u4ee3\u9686\u8d77\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5382\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u7269\u6d41\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\n    \u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7528\u4e8e\u91ca\u653e\u6280\u672f\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u72d7\u72b6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8SoftBank\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ef7\u503c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u4e3a11\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u6b64\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u8fd8\u65e8\u5728\u878d\u5165\u6d77\u62d4\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4e1a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5185\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\n M\uff06amp;\u4ea4\u6613\u9075\u5faa\u73b0\u4ee3\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u5347\u9ad8\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u8be5\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5360\u4e0a\u98ce\u3002 12\u6708\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u5ba3\u5e03\u5c06\u6295\u8d4460.1\u4e07\u4ebf\u97e9\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e2025\u5e74\u4ee5\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u3002 \n2019\u5e7410\u6708\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5176\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u5c06\u4e0e\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u8fd0\u80fd\u529b\u5360\u636e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5ea7\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002 ", "note_en": "South Korean vehicle manufacturer Hyundai Motor Group has  announced the acquisition of a controlling stake in the U.S robotics firm Boston Dynamics.\n  The deal was initiated last year in December, where the automaking firms will buy a share of $880 million.

In February 2020, he  said digital assets like Bitcoin ( BTC) lack the basic tenants of a stable currency and praised the Securities and Exchange Commission for \u201ccracking down\u201d on initial coin offerings.\n Kashkari is not a member of this year\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee, the group responsible for setting United States monetary policy. The Minneapolis branch of the Fed will  serve as an alternate FOMC member in 2022 before rotating back onto the committee as a voting member in 2023.\n While Kashkari isn\u2019t voting on monetary policy this year, he  opposes any measures to hike interest rates before 2023. The Fed\u2019s dot-plot summary of interest rate forecasts released last week suggests that policymakers are eyeing a resumption of rate hikes by the end of 2023, which is earlier than previously expected.\n  The revised forecast may have contributed to the sharp rise in the U.S. dollar at the expense of equities, commodities and even cryptocurrencies. Digital asset values were down across the board on Sunday, extending a sharp correction from  last week\u2019s mild recovery.\n Assets like DOGE burst into the mainstream earlier this year with retail-driven FOMO that was aided by favorable tweets from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The hype surrounding Dogecoin even eclipsed that of Bitcoin in January as  tweet volumes surged 1,800%. But as crypto values plunged, DOGE was hit especially hard. As Cointelegraph reported,  Dogecoin liquidations briefly surpassed those of Bitcoin in April.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 05:48:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u603b\u7edf,fed,\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a", "title": "\u660e\u5c3c\u963f\u6ce2\u5229\u65af\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u603b\u7edf\u5409\u5c14\u5361\u4ec0\u5361\u91cc\u547c\u5401Duge Ponzi\u8ba1\u5212 ", "title_en": "Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari Calls DOGE a Ponzi Scheme", "transed": 1, "url": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/minneapolis-fed-president-neel-kashkari-calls-doge-a-ponzi", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u603b\u7edf", "fed", "\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6b8de5bc2836042024ccee878a1f38e9.jpeg", "infoid": 1067296, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u8428\u514b\u62c9\u95e8\u6258\uff08AP\uff09 -  Gov.Gavin Newsom\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u5c06\u507f\u8fd8\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u6700\u5177\u4eba\u53e3\u7a20\u5bc6\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u79df\u91d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u7ed9\u79df\u623f\u65f6\u4f7f\u623f\u4e1c\u603b\u4f53\u878d\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53 \u6e05\u6d01\u677f\u5ca9\u3002 ", "note_en": "SACRAMENTO, Calif.

", "note_en": "I can no longer feel the top of my head. Apparently it takes 3-5 months to regain sensation up there, and some people never get the feeling back. Oh well, what do you need to feel things from the top of your head for anyway?\n But, it\u2019s truly bizarre touching the top of my head and only getting feedback from my hand. Almost like touching someone else\u2019s head except my brain knows where my hand is and seems to get confused, as if it doesn\u2019t know how to close the loop. Proof I guess of just how connected the body and the mind are.\n Anyway, you probably want to know, what its like? What does it feel like to be awake while someone is drilling deep inside your head? Well, let me walk you through it as best as I can.\n  The day began by getting this lovely looking frame bolted onto my skull. It didn\u2019t feel as bad as it looks. They froze the areas where the bolts go so other than the weight and some added pressure around my skull I couldn\u2019t really feel it. But, after they turned me into a cartoon supervillain, I learned that an emergency case had come in that would delay my surgery by an hour or two. So, I sat there in the cramped pre-op room staring at the other patients who were doing their best not to look horrified when we made eye contact.\n Eventually I got wheeled into the OR. Like a guest of honor there were many onlookers waiting for me when I got there. In addition to the surgical team itself of at least 7 or 8 people, there were a couple rows of students who had come to watch and learn.\n First I was laid out on the table and had the frame locked into a much larger contraption that would keep my head securely in place no matter how much I wriggled and writhed about. Then there was about half an hour of prep that the team did in a flurry of activity happening all around me. During which time my hair was cut, but only the parts that might get in the way of the procedure, giving me that classically handsome friar tuck look. Then all sorts of sterilizing ointments were applied. Between that, the oxygen, and the mild sedatives I was given it was almost starting to feel like a trip to a spa.\n    Throughout the morning I had felt very ready for what I was about to experience. I\u2019m not sure exactly what to attribute that to, but in the days preceding it my mind was completely at ease with what I was about to experience. One fear I thought I might have going in was that I would start to doubt the decision I had made.  As I wrote before, DBS was not the only option available to me. What if I got into the OR and started to second guess myself? Thankfully I never paid the thought much attention. Part of it was that I knew I was in great hands, Dr. Suneil Kalia and his team at Toronto Western Hospital are as good as it gets. It also helped that I knew I had done my homework.\n Four years earlier on a Friday morning in Jerusalem I was wandering the halls of Hadassah medical center looking for Prof. Hagai Bergman. Friday is the start of Shabbat, the day of rest when all of Jerusalem shuts down. I wandered through the empty halls of his building wondering if I had come at the wrong time, but there he was and he seemed anxious to see me.\n He ushered me into his office and spent the next three hours taking me on a guided private tour of the basal ganglia as well as a new therapy that he was helping make a reality \u2013 closed loop deep brain stimulation. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time but he was showing me my future.\n He also recommended to me a pair of books,  The Mind\u2019s I and  I Am A Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter. I\u2019ve had them close to me ever since and often return to them. I haven\u2019t read anything else that comes as close to explaining who and what we are, why we experience what we experience, and why we think the thoughts that we think. Some say we have no idea how DBS, or the brain for that matter, works. But, if closed loop DBS is successful, I think it would prove that while we may not ever know all the details, we do already have the right conceptual framework. We are a collection of strange loops and most of the neurological problems we face can be attributed to a break in one or more of those loops. Find the right loop or loops to close and we can fix just about anything that goes wrong.\n I haven\u2019t spoken to Prof. Bergman since, but will forever be grateful for those three hours he spent patiently explaining this new technique that I will soon be turning on inside my own head to me. Here is a taste of that lecture he gave me.\n    I\u2019ll have much more to say on closed loop DBS in the future. Back to the OR.\n Now, as much as I believed I was ready for what I was about to experience, nothing can really prepare you for what it is\u00a0like to be awake during it all. Every detail of that morning has been indelibly etched into my memory, yet I struggle to find the words to describe it. Language isn\u2019t really suited for such things and whatever words I\u2019ll choose to use won\u2019t really be able to capture it. Such is life I guess.\n I\u2019ll start with the pain, which there really isn\u2019t that much of. The only thing that really really hurt were all the needles used to freeze my scalp, after that I didn\u2019t really feel anything. So I was a little surprised when after the freezing they told me that they were ready to start drilling through my skull, meaning they had already sliced through all the various layers of my scalp.\n  Next came the drilling of the bore holes. If there is any part of this procedure that is likely to induce trauma it is this. I will never forget that sound. Usually sound is created by your ear picking up tiny vibrations of particles in the air. But in this case the sound comes more from your entire skull shaking violently to the rotating drill boring a hole through your head. I didn\u2019t hear it as much as I felt it, as if the entire universe was grinding together inside my skull.\n Once the brain is exposed the team covered themselves and me in protective gear so they can turn on the giant stereotactic imaging device that guides the surgeon through my brain deep into my subthalamic nucleus. All of that is displayed on a screen in front of you allowing yourself and the team to see everything happening in real time. This goes by surprisingly quickly and was somewhat uneventful, though I do remembered some murmured remarks between the surgeons about avoiding a particular vein somewhere along the way.\n I did wonder, what would it be like if something went wrong. What would the reactions of the surgeons have been if they tripped that vein? All through the procedure the team sounded very calm and business like. Would the tone of their words suddenly have turned to panic? And what would I experience? Would the world suddenly go dark? Would my conscious awareness and this chain of experience I call my self suddenly shift to something else?\n Anyway, once it looks like it is in the right spot, which you can tell by the lead penetrating the crosshairs on the screen, they began the microelectrode recording. They played the live sound on a speaker which emitted the different sounds of each cortical layer as it went deeper and deeper. Throughout the procedure I was talking and lucid. Lobbing question after question at the team, here Dr. Kalia had to tell me to shut up so they could listen and confirm they were in the right spot.\n The crescendo slowly builds until it reaches the target and then the sound of hundreds of thousands of your own neurons excitedly relaying the information they carry to one another fills the room. This was the most intimate moment of the day. My brain was speaking to me, though in a language \u201cI\u201d could not understand. And even though I knew there was some perturbation in that sound that was responsible for the symptoms I felt, I smiled thinking of all that was going right inside me.\n     Once they confirmed they were in the desired position the stimulation was turned on. It was in the left hemisphere of my brain which controls the right side of my body. I was asked to do a few simple movement tasks with my hands like tapping my index finger and thumb together as quickly as possible and pretending to turn a doorknob. It was roughly noon and I had not taken any medication up to that point. Normally if I had gone till noon without any medication I would have had a pronounced tremor, the tapping would have been very slow and labored, and I would have barely been able to turn my wrist over and back. But at that moment I felt as though I had travelled back in time eight years to before my diagnosis. My fingers and my wrist moved fluidly. It was liberating. I was back in control. Despite being strapped to a table with my head in a giant vice I felt euphoric. This disease had suddenly and magically dissipated. Nothing short of a modern medical miracle.\n But it was short lived as I was then reminded that the entire process needed to be repeated for the other side. Now the novelty of the whole experience wore off and I started to really feel the weight of the frame tying me down. I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth and got through it. But not without the whole thing taking its toll. A mix of nausea and a shearing headache crept over me that slowly grew in intensity. I wanted to tell them not to bother with getting this side as precise as possible, to just hurry up and get it all over with as quickly as they could.\n There is a lot more I could say about the whole ordeal, including the tunneling of the wires through my neck and the placement of the battery in my chest two days later, but I\u2019ll leave it at that for now. It has been 12 days since the operation and I am feeling much better than I would have expected, though not entirely like myself either. In less than a month I should begin programming the device which hopefully will make everything I experienced worthwhile. I\u2019m not sure exactly what I\u2019ll do if, once we get all the parameters right, they flick that switch and I get to permanently return to that state I felt when they turned on the stimulation in the OR, but suffice it to say that I am looking forward to getting there.\n The last thing I\u2019ll show is the MRI I had taken the day after. The white dots you see on the left is the inflammation surrounding the holes that were drilled. I close my eyes and wonder how all the cells surrounding that spot must be reacting, all the neurons trying to communicate with this foreign object, all the glial cells now busily forming the scar tissue that will lock those long leads you see on the right in place for the rest of my life.\n  Soon enough the stimulator will be turned on and the contacts will be activated, hopefully restoring mobility to this strange loop that I am.\n   I am very pleased that your operation appears to have gone welll; You will be looking foreward to switching it on no doubt. Keith\n    As usual. Great post! You are an inspiration and good luck turning on the juice soon, best wishes, Frank\n  This was a fascinating post to read as a neurosurgery resident. Thank you for sharing your experience, and I hope DBS works out for you.\n  The human body is an incredible, complex, designed piece of artistry.
