I appreciate that deep industry expertise is important in his area, especially, say, when designing remedies that make sense. Lacking a background in law or economics is not disqualifying. Nonetheless, I’d say Thompson’s readers are at risk of being misled if they rely too much on what he has to say about tech antitrust. For, as we shall see, his analysis relies too much on an idiosyncratic “digital markets are fundamentally different” thesis that really doesn’t hold up too well. Stated simply, I’d say he’s inducing his readers to drink too much of his “aggregation theory” Kool-Aid, as opposed to encouraging them to think more broadly or read more deeply to understand a slightly messier reality than he presents.</p><p>汤普森最近开始在科技反垄断领域发表声明并进行分析，但在这方面，他的依据并不扎实。我意识到深厚的行业专业知识在他的领域很重要，特别是在设计有意义的补救措施时。缺乏法律或经济学背景并不意味着取消资格。尽管如此，我还是要说，如果汤普森的读者过于依赖他关于技术反垄断的言论，他们就有被误导的风险。因为，正如我们将要看到的，他的分析过于依赖于一种特殊的“数字市场从根本上不同”的论点，这一论点真的站不住脚。简单地说，我想说他是在诱导他的读者喝太多他的“聚合理论”酷爱，而不是鼓励他们更广泛地思考或更深入地阅读，以理解比他所呈现的稍微混乱的现实。</p><p> I appreciate Wu’s article, both in terms of its specifics (which I disagree with), its goals (which are implied), and its means (which I value). Time to drink some Kool-Aid!</p><p>我欣赏吴的文章，无论是它的细节(我不同意)，它的目的(隐含的)，它的手段(我重视)。该喝点酷爱饮料了！</p><p>     According to Thompson, the Google case needs be understood primarily through what he calls aggregation theory, which is something of a specialized version of what economists call a two-sided markets theory. His theory asserts that 1) the quality of the user experience, rather than control over distribution, is what determines the winners in digital markets; and 2) a lead based on quality is self-reenforcing, because either more suppliers are attracted or the winner, with more customers, gets more feedback on what makes for a better product. (For those with a background in economics, Thompson’s aggregation theory is basically a mixture of a two-sided market theory with some positive feedback loop stuff thrown in.) Thompson says that “aggregators” (platforms, in economic, if not technological, parlance) are in this manner different than traditional monopolists, for they “win by building ever better products for consumers”…</p><p>根据汤普森的说法，谷歌的案例需要主要通过他所说的聚合理论来理解，这是经济学家所说的双边市场理论的某种专门版本。他的理论认为，1)用户体验的质量，而不是对分销的控制，决定了数字市场的赢家；2)基于质量的领先是自我强化的，因为要么吸引了更多的供应商，要么客户更多的赢家获得了更多关于如何创造更好产品的反馈。(对于那些有经济学背景的人来说，汤普森的聚合理论基本上是一个双边市场理论和一些正反馈循环的混合体。)。汤普森说，“聚合器”(如果不是技术上的平台，也是经济上的平台)在这方面与传统的垄断者不同，因为他们“通过为消费者制造更好的产品来取胜”…。</p><p> The problem is that his aggregation theory isn’t aspirational. Instead, it is presented as a description of how the internet has “fundamentally changed the plane of competition” in a world where “on the internet everything is just zero marginal bits.” It also takes as its assumptions: “Zero distribution costs. Zero marginal costs. Zero transactions.” In that, in some ways, it is like the older economic models from the 1960s, except that they were at least billed as models, not depictions of reality.</p><p>问题是，他的聚合理论并不是令人向往的。相反，它是对互联网如何“从根本上改变了竞争层面”的描述，在这个世界里，“互联网上的一切都只是零边际比特”。它还假设：“零分销成本。零边际成本。零交易。“。在某些方面，这就像20世纪60年代的旧经济模型，只是它们至少被标榜为模型，而不是对现实的描绘。</p><p> Wu appears to be serious in his statement that assertions about the importance of zero marginal costs are best understood by looking to the past; his analogy for Aggregation Theory reaches back to the 1920s:</p><p>吴在他的声明中似乎是认真的，他说，关于零边际成本重要性的断言，最好通过回顾过去来理解；他对聚集理论的类比可以追溯到20世纪20年代：</p><p> Here’s my send-up of aggregation theory: Imagine this is the 1920s and we were speaking of the invention of brand advertising, and someone says, “whichever brand has the most people attracting it will create a buzz that further favors the winner. Hence, traditional metrics of competition are out the window.” I think we’d all agree that brand matters, and indeed the invention of powerful brands did change competition. But it might be a little too easy to think competition actually has changed forever. And we can see Thompson falling into the novelty trap by asserting things like “the internet has made transaction costs zero” — a sentence that would make any serious economist howl with laughter.</p><p>以下是我对聚合理论的支持：想象一下，现在是20世纪20年代，我们在谈论品牌广告的发明，有人说，“哪个品牌吸引的人最多，它就会引起轰动，进一步有利于赢家。因此，传统的竞争指标已不复存在。我想我们都同意品牌很重要，事实上，强大品牌的发明确实改变了竞争。但认为竞争实际上已经永远改变可能有点太容易了。我们可以看到汤普森通过断言“互联网使交易成本为零”这样的话落入了新颖性陷阱--这句话会让任何严肃的经济学家哈哈大笑。</p><p> I can’t speak for serious economists — I’ve generally enjoyed my interactions with them, and have been treated with nothing but respect while presenting the idea of  Aggregation Theory — but the only thing I find humorous here is the idea that the Internet has  not had a massive impact on transactions costs.</p><p>我不能代表严肃的经济学家说话--我总体上很享受与他们的互动，在提出聚合理论的想法时，我得到的只有尊重--但这里唯一让我觉得幽默的是，互联网并没有对交易成本产生巨大影响。</p><p>  Consider various iterations of two-sided markets, of which Wu believes the companies I call Aggregators are a not particularly special version of. At the most basic level you might have something like a neighborhood flea market: on one side the market is a place for people to sell things, and on the other a place to buy things. Ultimately, though, every transaction entails sourcing supply, acquiring a customer, and executing the transaction itself. All three of those activities are costly.</p><p>考虑一下双边市场的各种迭代，吴认为，我称之为聚合器的公司并不是特别特别的版本。在最基本的层面上，你可能有一个类似于邻里跳蚤市场的东西：市场的一边是人们卖东西的地方，另一边是买东西的地方。不过，最终，每一笔交易都需要采购供应、获取客户，并执行交易本身。这三项活动的成本都很高。</p><p> Over the course of the 20th century, larger and larger firms became more and more efficient at managing these transaction costs. The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company, more commonly known as A&amp;P, was the best example of this. The company expanded rapidly in the late 1800s, which was critical in acquiring ever more customers (the company was also a pioneer in advertising and using low prices on select items to get customers into stores); meanwhile, A&amp;P built a back-end operation to match, vertically integrating into being a wholesaler, particularly of its own private label goods, which, combined with A&amp;Ps scale, helped it deliver on those low prices. By 1930 the company had 16,000 stores doing nearly $3 billion in sales, accounting for a 10% share of nationwide grocery stores.</p><p>在20世纪的过程中，越来越大的公司在管理这些交易成本方面变得越来越有效率。大大西洋太平洋茶叶公司(Great Atlantic&amp；Pacific Tea Company，俗称A&P)就是最好的例子。该公司在19世纪末迅速扩张，这对获得越来越多的客户至关重要(该公司也是做广告和利用精选商品的低价吸引顾客的先驱)；与此同时，A&P建立了一个后端业务来配合，垂直整合为批发商，特别是自己的自有品牌商品，再加上A&P的规模，帮助它实现了这些低价。到1930年，该公司拥有1.6万家门店，销售额接近30亿美元，占全国杂货店份额的10%。</p><p> By 1950 A&amp;P’s market share peaked at 15%, although by that time A&amp;P had transitioned to fewer, larger stores (around 4,500); the company was also facing an antitrust lawsuit, that it would eventually settle with a favorable consent decree. What ultimately doomed A&amp;P, though, was its inability to adjust to a grocery market increasingly dominated by national brands advertised on television, along with uncompetitive labor costs and a failure to expand from city centers to the exploding suburbs. Each of these entailed higher transaction costs, and A&amp;P couldn’t bear them.</p><p>到1950年，A&P的市场份额达到了15%的顶峰，尽管那时A&P已经过渡到更少、更大的门店(约4500家)；该公司还面临着一场反垄断诉讼，最终将以一项有利的同意法令达成和解。然而，最终注定A&P失败的是，它无法适应日益被电视广告中的民族品牌主导的食品杂货市场，以及缺乏竞争力的劳动力成本，以及未能从市中心扩张到爆炸性的郊区。每一项都会带来更高的交易成本，A&P无法承受。</p><p> A few decades later Walmart would follow in A&amp;P’s footsteps as far as dominance is concerned, although their strategy started with exurbs and suburbs and worked backwards; the fundamental limitations of needing to open stores to acquire customers, build out logistical networks to acquire and distribute goods at scale, and actually stock shelves and check out customers remained, though. Walmart too has reached about 15% market share (albeit of a larger general merchandise market).</p><p>几十年后，就主导地位而言，沃尔玛将追随A&P的脚步，尽管他们的战略始于远郊和郊区，并起到了倒退的作用；不过，需要开设门店来获得客户，建立物流网络来大规模采购和分销商品，以及实际进货和结账的基本限制仍然存在。沃尔玛的市场占有率也达到了15%左右(尽管是在一个更大的杂货市场)。</p><p> Amazon, meanwhile, has leveraged the Internet to dramatically decrease its customer acquisition costs in particular: the fundamental insight driving the retailer is that on the Internet shelf space is both infinite and available to anyone with an Internet connection; the company is still smaller than Walmart — 5% of general merchandise last year, although that number surely made a huge leap because of the pandemic — but it got there much more quickly: Amazon is only 26 years old, while Walmart is 58.</p><p>与此同时，亚马逊利用互联网大幅降低了客户获取成本：推动这家零售商的基本洞察力是，在互联网上，货架空间是无限的，任何有互联网连接的人都可以使用；该公司的规模仍然小于沃尔玛-去年占普通商品的5%，尽管这个数字肯定因为大流行而大幅跃升-但它实现的速度要快得多：亚马逊只有26岁，而沃尔玛已经58岁了。</p><p>  Here is the danger: If you think competition is all about flavor and buzz (in the 1890s) or Thompson’s aggregation theory (right now), you might end up overlooking all of the other strategies and factors that could also lead to a lasting advantage. Consider Amazon. Thompson says that “the internet has made distribution (of digital goods) free.” But, as implied, that hasn’t made the distribution of physical goods free. And that is why a company like Amazon can, and has, gained a major advantage by building up a large physical infrastructure (warehouses), not unlike a steel producer in the 20th century, and strongly relying on a loyalty program (Prime). So, it turns out Amazon’s competitive advantage isn’t all about the fact that “on the internet everything is just zero marginal bits.”</p><p>危险在于：如果你认为竞争就是味道和喧嚣(在19世纪90年代)，或者汤普森的聚合理论(现在)，你可能最终会忽视所有其他也可能带来持久优势的战略和因素。以亚马逊为例。汤普森说，“互联网使(数字产品)的分销变得免费。”但是，正如所暗示的那样，这并没有使实物商品的分发变得免费。这就是为什么像亚马逊这样的公司能够，而且已经通过建立大型实体基础设施(仓库)获得了重大优势，这与20世纪的钢铁生产商没有什么不同，并强烈依赖忠诚度计划(Prime)。因此，亚马逊的竞争优势并不完全在于“在互联网上，一切都是零边际的。”</p><p> I completely agree; that’s why I have stated — contra Wu’s assertion — that Amazon is  not an Aggregator. I mentioned Amazon specifically in 2017’s  Defining Aggregators: 1</p><p>我完全同意；这就是为什么我声明-反驳吴的断言-亚马逊不是一个聚合器。我在2017年的定义聚合器中特别提到了亚马逊：1。</p><p> Aggregators have all three of the following characteristics; the absence of any one of them can result in a very successful business (in the case of Apple, arguably the most successful business in history), but it means said company is not an Aggregator.</p><p>聚合器拥有以下所有三个特征：缺少其中任何一个都可能导致非常成功的业务(就苹果而言，可以说是历史上最成功的业务)，但这意味着该公司不是聚合器。</p><p>  This point is straight-forward, yet the linchpin on which everything else rests: Aggregators have a direct relationship with users. This may be a payment-based relationship, an account-based one, or simply one based on regular usage (think Google and non-logged in users).</p><p>这一点是直截了当的，但其他一切都依赖于此：聚合器与用户有直接的关系。这可能是一种基于支付的关系，一种基于账户的关系，或者简单地基于常规使用的关系(想想Google和未登录的用户)。</p><p>  Companies traditionally have had to incur (up to) three types of marginal costs when it comes to serving users/customers directly.</p><p>传统上，当涉及到直接为用户/客户服务时，公司不得不招致(最多)三种类型的边际成本。</p><p> The cost of goods sold (COGS), that is, the cost of producing an item or providing a service</p><p>商品销售成本(COGS)，即生产一件物品或提供一项服务的成本。</p><p> Distribution costs, that is the cost of getting an item to the customer (usually via retail) or facilitating the provision of a service (usually via real estate)</p><p>分销成本，即将商品送到客户手中(通常通过零售)或促进提供服务(通常通过房地产)的成本。</p><p> Transaction costs, that is the cost of executing a transaction for a good or service, providing customer service, etc.</p><p>交易成本，即为商品或服务执行交易、提供客户服务等的成本。</p><p>  The goods “sold” by an Aggregator are digital and thus have zero marginal costs (they may, of course, have significant fixed costs) 2</p><p>聚合器“销售”的商品是数字化的，因此边际成本为零(当然，它们可能具有显著的固定成本)2。</p><p> This characteristic means that businesses like Apple hardware and Amazon’s traditional retail operations are not Aggregators; both bear significant costs in serving the marginal customer (and, in the case of Amazon in particular, have achieved such scale that the service’s relative cost of distribution is actually a moat).</p><p>这一特征意味着，像苹果硬件和亚马逊传统零售业务这样的企业都不是聚合器；两者都承担着为边缘客户服务的巨大成本(尤其是亚马逊，它们的规模如此之大，以至于服务的相对分销成本实际上只是一条护城河)。</p><p>  Because Aggregators deal with digital goods, there is an abundance of supply; that means users reap value through discovery and curation, and most aggregators get started by delivering superior discovery.</p><p>因为聚合器与数字产品打交道，所以有大量的供应；这意味着用户通过发现和管理获得价值，而大多数聚合器都是从提供卓越的发现开始的。</p><p> Then, once an Aggregator has gained some number of end users, suppliers will come onto the Aggregator’s platform on the Aggregator’s terms, effectively commoditizing and modularizing themselves. Those additional suppliers then make the Aggregator more attractive to more users, which in turn draws more suppliers, in a virtuous cycle.</p><p>然后，一旦聚合器获得了一定数量的最终用户，供应商将按照聚合器的条件进入聚合器的平台，有效地将自己商品化和模块化。然后，这些额外的供应商会使聚合器对更多的用户更具吸引力，从而在良性循环中吸引更多的供应商。</p><p> This means that for Aggregators, customer acquisition costs decrease over time; marginal customers are attracted to the platform by virtue of the increasing number of suppliers. This further means that Aggregators enjoy winner-take-all effects: since the value of an Aggregator to end users is continually increasing it is exceedingly difficult for competitors to take away users or win new ones.</p><p>这意味着，对于聚合器来说，客户获取成本会随着时间的推移而降低；边缘客户会因供应商数量的增加而被吸引到平台。这进一步意味着，聚合器享有赢家通吃的效应：由于聚合器对终端用户的价值不断增加，竞争对手要夺走用户或赢得新用户极其困难。</p><p> This is in contrast to non-Aggregator and non-platform companies that face  increasing customer acquisition costs as their user base grows. That is because initial customers are often a perfect product-market fit; however, as that fit decreases, the surplus value from the product decreases as well and quickly turns negative. Generally speaking, any business that creates its customer value in-house is not an Aggregator because eventually its customer acquisition costs will limit its growth potential.</p><p>这与非聚合器和非平台公司形成鲜明对比，这些公司面临着随着用户基础的增长而面临不断增加的客户获取成本。这是因为最初的客户通常是完美的产品市场匹配度；然而，随着匹配度的降低，产品的剩余价值也会减少，并迅速转为负值。一般来说，任何在内部创造客户价值的企业都不是聚合器，因为最终其客户获取成本将限制其增长潜力。</p><p> Google is the canonical example of this definition, and the difference from Amazon, much less non-Internet two-sided markets, is profound. Start with the transaction costs: while scaling an Internet service is a profoundly difficult thing to do, requiring tremendous ingenuity, invention, and investment, the marginal transaction costs for serving one additional customer are zero. That is why Google, from the moment it launched, could be used by anyone in the world. Like Amazon, the company didn’t need to build out physical stores, but unlike Amazon, the company didn’t need to build out delivery infrastructure either. And unlike every retailer in existence it didn’t need to pay for supply. And — this is the part that makes Google truly unique — it didn’t even need to generate supply. The web already existed!</p><p>谷歌是这一定义的典范，与亚马逊的区别是深远的，更不用说非互联网的双边市场了。从交易成本开始：虽然扩展互联网服务是一件非常困难的事情，需要极大的独创性、创造性和投资，但为多一个客户提供服务的边际交易成本为零。这就是为什么谷歌，从它推出的那一刻起，就可以被世界上的任何人使用。与亚马逊一样，该公司不需要建设实体店，但与亚马逊不同的是，该公司也不需要建设配送基础设施。而且，与现有的所有零售商不同，它不需要为供应付费。而且--这是使谷歌真正独一无二的部分--它甚至不需要产生供应。网络已经存在了！</p><p> This is why Google can achieve 88 percent market share in the U.S. search market (according to the  Department of Justice lawsuit), and achieve a similar level of share all over the entire world. The company’s scalability is effectively infinite, because serving additional customers is a function of fixed costs, not transaction costs; it really is not comparable to Amazon at all, in this regard, as the companies’ respective market shares demonstrates.</p><p>这就是为什么谷歌可以在美国搜索市场获得88%的市场份额(根据司法部的诉讼)，并在整个世界实现类似的份额水平。该公司的可扩展性实际上是无限的，因为服务额外的客户是固定成本的函数，而不是交易成本的函数；在这方面，正如两家公司各自的市场份额所表明的那样，它真的根本无法与亚马逊相提并论。</p><p> The same reality applies to Google’s marginal costs (including distribution); while Google spends a tremendous amount of fixed costs on its data centers and networking, any one search is “free”, including Google accepting the search term, computing the result, and delivering it to the user. Moreover, this same principle applies to Google’s advertising business: the vast majority of advertising on Google is acquired via self-service portals that price ads automatically via real-time auctions. Yes, the infrastructure necessary to enable this business requires substantial investment, but the only transaction costs on any one specific advertising purchase are credit card fees.</p><p>同样的现实也适用于谷歌的边际成本(包括分销)；虽然谷歌在其数据中心和网络上花费了大量的固定成本，但任何一次搜索都是“免费的”，包括谷歌接受搜索词，计算结果，并将其交付给用户。此外，同样的原则也适用于谷歌的广告业务：谷歌上的绝大多数广告都是通过自助门户网站获得的，这些门户网站通过实时拍卖自动为广告定价。是的，实现这项业务所需的基础设施需要大量投资，但任何一次特定广告购买的唯一交易成本都是信用卡费用。</p><p> This is a business that requires more analysis than calling it a “two-sided market…with some positive feedback loop stuff thrown in”; for one, I would argue that  all two-sided markets have positive feedback loops. Any market that touches the physical world, though, accumulates an ever increasing number of tiny costs along the way, whether that be labor costs, shipping costs, rent costs, etc.; moreover, the logistical challenges entailed in managing those costs incur their own cost in managerial complexity, and every investment to overcome those challenges become sunk costs, making it difficult to adjust when the market changes (this is particularly acute because it takes time to make these investments).</p><p>这是一项需要更多分析的业务，而不是称之为“双边市场…”加上一些正反馈循环的东西“；首先，我认为所有的双边市场都有正反馈循环。然而，任何触及实体世界的市场，都会在一路上积累越来越多的微小成本，无论是劳动力成本、运输成本、租金成本等；此外，管理这些成本所带来的物流挑战本身也会招致管理复杂性的成本，而克服这些挑战的每一项投资都会成为沉没成本，使其难以在市场变化时进行调整(这一点尤其严重，因为进行这些投资需要时间)。</p><p> Google, on the other hand, faces none of these natural drags on scale. More search means better search, thanks to the ongoing feedback of billions of users ranking every Google search result (by clicking on the best result); more advertisers means better advertising results, for the same reason. This matters greatly for antitrust because at some point you need a theory of harm: how exactly is Google making things worse for users or advertisers?</p><p>另一方面，谷歌没有面临这些规模上的自然拖累。更多的搜索意味着更好的搜索，这要归功于数十亿用户对每个谷歌搜索结果的持续反馈(通过点击最好的结果)；出于同样的原因，更多的广告商意味着更好的广告结果。这对反垄断非常重要，因为在某种程度上，你需要一个危害理论：谷歌到底是如何让用户或广告商的情况变得更糟的？</p><p>   Whether this is core to his theory or not, Thompson also takes a highly anti-empirical approach to switching costs. He endorses the old 1990s idea that “competition is just one click away,” which may have been true in 1999, but that can’t be taken seriously now — if what he means is that the costs of leaving Google or Amazon or Facebook are close to zero. The real question is whether there are, for the average person, costs to switching from Facebook or Google to use something else — leaving behind Gmail, friends, and so on. The assertion that those costs are near zero is magical thinking. Indeed, one of Google’s most important strategies over this decade — its tell — has been to increase those switching costs, those barriers to entry.</p><p>不管这是不是他理论的核心，汤普森也对转换成本采取了一种高度反经验的方法。他赞同20世纪90年代的老观点，即“竞争只需点击一次”，这在1999年可能是正确的，但现在不能当真-如果他的意思是离开谷歌、亚马逊或Facebook的成本接近于零。真正的问题是，对于普通人来说，从Facebook或Google转而使用其他东西-离开Gmail、朋友等等-是否有成本。断言这些成本接近于零是一种神奇的想法。事实上，谷歌近十年来最重要的战略之一--Tell--就是增加那些转换成本，那些进入壁垒。</p><p> Consider Google specifically: the company’s core product, Search, has for its supply the open web. Indeed, that is what let the company be at scale, instantly, in a way no other company ever has. It follows, though, that every other search engine — including Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. — have access to the exact same supply.</p><p>具体来看谷歌：该公司的核心产品搜索为其提供了开放的网络。事实上，这就是让公司立即规模化的原因，这是其他公司从未有过的。因此，所有其他搜索引擎--包括必应(Bing)、DuckDuckGo等--都可以获得完全相同的资源。</p><p> Admittedly, Google does have its own local results in particular; Yelp  has an entire website complaining about this fact, arguing that the search engine should be forced to include third-party content in its local search results because those results are better for consumers. That, though, is a mark in the competition’s favor: is Wu’s position that Google’s allegedly inferior local search results is lock-in?</p><p>诚然，谷歌确实有自己的本地搜索结果；Yelp有整个网站都在抱怨这一事实，认为应该强制搜索引擎在其本地搜索结果中包括第三方内容，因为这些结果对消费者更有利。然而，这对竞争对手来说是一个有利的标志：吴的立场是不是锁定了谷歌所谓的劣质本地搜索结果？</p><p> Meanwhile, I am puzzled by the reference to Gmail; it is unclear to me why it is a competition concern when a user chooses to use a free email service that is quite obviously locked to the service provider. The relevant market here is not Gmail, it is email, and not only is there a huge amount of competition for hosted email, it is fairly simple to set up your own email server. Critically, there is absolutely nothing Google can do to stop you from doing so, even if they wanted to.</p><p>与此同时，我对提到Gmail感到困惑；我不清楚为什么用户选择使用显然锁定在服务提供商手中的免费电子邮件服务会引起竞争担忧。这里的相关市场不是Gmail，而是电子邮件，不仅托管电子邮件的竞争非常激烈，而且设置自己的电子邮件服务器也相当简单。最重要的是，谷歌绝对无法阻止你这么做，即使他们想这样做。</p><p> This drives at the biggest reason why I believe a distinct definition for “Aggregators” is important; while Wu casually conflates Aggregators and platforms (“in economic, if not technological, parlance”), I believe the distinction is substantial, and crucial. I explore that distinction at length in  A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet, but the critical point goes back to the email example:</p><p>这就是为什么我认为“聚合器”的明确定义很重要的最大原因；虽然吴随意地将聚合器和平台混为一谈(“如果不是在经济上，如果不是在技术上的话”)，我认为这两者之间的区别是实质性的，也是至关重要的。我在“规范互联网竞争的框架”一书中详细探讨了这一区别，但关键还是回到了电子邮件的例子上：</p><p> Platforms are essential to their value chains. You can’t have a Windows app, for example, without the Windows API.</p><p>平台对它们的价值链至关重要。例如，如果没有Windows API，你就不能拥有Windows应用程序。</p><p> Aggregators, in contrast, are not essential, but they are convenient. You can go to a website directly — just type in its URL — but for most consumers, for most pieces of information, it is far easier to search.</p><p>相比之下，聚合器不是必需的，但它们很方便。你可以直接进入一个网站--只需输入它的URL--但是对于大多数消费者来说，对于大多数信息来说，搜索要容易得多。</p><p> What is fascinating about many of Google’s most ardent critics is that they themselves aspire to be Aggregators. Yelp, for example, doesn’t operate any local businesses. It doesn’t prepare the food, or cut the hair, or teach the class: its business model is to aggregate so many users that local businesses feel compelled to be on Yelp, the better to reach more customers than they could on their own. The same applies to Trip Advisor, or Expedia, or any other vertical search company. All of those sites are only a click away.</p><p>许多谷歌最热心的批评者吸引人的是，他们自己都渴望成为聚合者。例如，Yelp没有在当地经营任何业务。它不做饭，不理发，也不授课：它的商业模式是聚集如此多的用户，以至于当地企业觉得有必要加入Yelp，这样就比他们自己更好地接触到更多的客户。这同样适用于Trip Advisor或Expedia，或任何其他垂直搜索公司。所有这些网站只需点击一下即可。</p><p> And, critically, so are the entities that actually provide the services or information that the user is seeking. Airlines and hotels invest heavily in loyalty programs, for example, because they want their best customers to come to them directly, not via an Aggregator, whether that Aggregator be Google or Booking.com. That not only sounds like competition, it also sounds like an exceptionally customer-friendly outcome.</p><p>而且，至关重要的是，实际提供用户正在寻找的服务或信息的实体也是如此。例如，航空公司和酒店在忠诚度计划上投入了大量资金，因为他们希望最好的客户直接找到他们，而不是通过聚合器，无论这个聚合器是谷歌还是Booking.com。这不仅听起来像是竞争，而且听起来也是一个对客户非常友好的结果。</p><p>  Where I think Wu and many tech critics go wrong is missing how the question of zero marginal costs and zero switching costs intersect. First, because Wu does not believe that Google is unique as far as scalability is concerned, he appears to assume that the company must be doing something nefarious to command such market share. And, by the same token, there must be some sort of unfair lock-in, because again, companies ought not be so dominant. This is a sure recipe for lazy arguments that end up criminalizing the basics of business.</p><p>我认为吴和许多科技评论家的错误之处在于错过了零边际成本和零转换成本的问题是如何相交的。首先，因为吴不相信谷歌在可伸缩性方面是独一无二的，他似乎认为该公司一定是在做一些邪恶的事情来夺取这样的市场份额。而且，出于同样的原因，肯定存在某种不公平的锁定，因为同样，公司不应该如此占据主导地位。这肯定是懒惰争论的秘诀，最终会将商业基础定为刑事犯罪。</p><p> How does all this relate to antitrust? Antitrust should be dealing with the reality of anticompetitive behavior in markets, not ideals of how companies work. And it is the difficult job of the law to determine which of these durable advantages just described are part of fair competition (for example, a better user experience) and which are not (for example, buying out dangerous rivals, or exclusionary deals that keep out competitors)…</p><p>这一切与反垄断有何关系？反垄断应该处理的是市场中反竞争行为的现实，而不是公司如何运作的理想。法律很难确定刚才描述的这些持久优势中哪些是公平竞争的一部分(例如，更好的用户体验)，哪些不是(例如，收购危险的竞争对手，或将竞争对手拒之门外的排他性交易)…。</p><p> We may summarize the problem for Thompson this way: Why, exactly, did Google pay Apple billions to gain control over distribution rights? And why, to bring the law into it, hasn’t Google settled the case? If aggregation theory is right — if competition has changed in the digital market and the best user experience wins — then Google doesn’t need to spend that money.</p><p>我们可以这样总结汤普森的问题：为什么谷歌向苹果支付数十亿美元来获得发行权的控制权？为什么，为了将法律纳入其中，谷歌还没有了结这起案件？如果聚合理论是正确的-如果数字市场的竞争已经改变，最好的用户体验获胜-那么谷歌就不需要花费这笔钱。</p><p> I honestly don’t think this is too complicated: defaults do matter, and given the fact that Google makes  somewhere north of $250 in revenue per U.S. user it is well worth sharing some of that revenue to ensure it gets as many users as possible. Consider iOS specifically:</p><p>老实说，我不认为这太复杂：违约确实很重要，考虑到谷歌为每个美国用户赚取的收入超过250美元的事实，分享其中的一些收入是非常值得的，以确保它获得尽可能多的用户。具体考虑IOS：</p><p> According to the Department of Justice “This agreement covers roughly 36 percent of all general search queries in the United States”; assuming that share of search queries is inline with share of revenue (which is almost certainly  not the case, given the relative spending power of Apple’s userbase), the agreement covers $26.9 billion worth of revenue.</p><p>根据司法部(Department Of Justice)的说法，“这项协议覆盖了美国大约36%的一般搜索查询”；假设搜索查询的份额与收入份额一致(考虑到苹果用户群的相对购买力，几乎可以肯定不是这样)，该协议涵盖价值269亿美元的收入。</p><p> Further assume that, were Google not the default, the company would lose 25% of Apple device searches it might have gained otherwise; this equates to a revenue loss of $6.7 billion for the U.S. alone, and again, this number is almost certainly conservative given the relative spending power of Apple users.</p><p>进一步假设，如果谷歌不是默认的，该公司将失去25%的苹果设备搜索，否则它可能会获得；这相当于仅在美国就损失了67亿美元的收入，再一次，考虑到苹果用户的相对购买力，这个数字几乎肯定是保守的。</p><p> Moreover, those searches would go to Google’s competitors, not only giving valuable data that would help make their search engines better, but also increasing the efficiency and relative attractiveness of their ad products.
