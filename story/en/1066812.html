According to  one survey, 68% of American millennials &#34;agree&#34; or &#34;strongly agree&#34; that they have &#34;more, tougher financial obstacles than previous generations&#34; and 49% believe that they are &#34;living in the worst economic environment in the last century.&#34;</p><p>作为第一代Z的成员，我觉得我有权在今天在美国的年轻人中抱怨一定的民众信仰。根据一项调查，68％的美国千禧年和＃34;同意＆＃34;或＃34;强烈同意＆＃34;他们有＆＃34;更多，比以前的几代人更加艰难的财务障碍; 49％的人认为它们是＆＃34;生活在上个世纪最严重的经济环境中。＆＃34;</p><p> To be clear, this perception isn&#39;t based on literally  nothing—there are some dimensions along which young people have it worse. But as far as I can tell, this belief, when taken as a whole, is completely, ludicrously false. Pants on fire. It&#39;s not even close to being right.</p><p> 要清楚，这一感知是基于字面意思 - 没有一些尺寸，年轻人越来越糟糕。但据我所知，这种信念，当一个整体时，完全是幽默的假。紧张不安。它＆＃39;甚至没有接近正确。</p><p> Not only are young people not worse off than previous generations, they are better off along nearly every meaningful economic axis.</p><p> 年轻人不仅比以前几代更糟糕，而且几乎每个有意义的经济轴都更好。</p><p>   The first most obvious thing to point out is that real GDP per capita—meaning, adjusted for costs of living—is  up about 374% since 1950. If GDP is calculated correctly, it should correspond to mean income levels, which means that the mean income among people alive today is nearly four times higher than it was in 1950.</p><p>   最明显的是要指出的最明显的事情是，自1950年以来调整了居住费用的真正的GDP-in令人涨幅约为374％。如果正确计算GDP，则应对应于平均收入水平，这意味着平均值今天活着的人民收入比1950年高于4倍。</p><p>  We can also look at the  growth in average personal consumption, which has risen about 950% since 1950, clearly indicating that Americans today have far more  disposable income than in the past.</p><p>  我们还可以看看平均个人消费的增长，自1950年以来已上涨约950％，显然表明美国人今天的可支配收入远远超过过去。</p><p>  Mean statistics might be misleading of course, since outliers can skew the data (see also the section in this post on inequality). But when you look at statistics tracking median income, you see a similar trend. The U.S. Census Bureau  reports that median household income in 1984 was $52,679, but was $68,703 in 2019, a 30% gain.</p><p>  当然，平均统计可能会误导，因为异常值可以歪斜数据（另请参阅本帖子中的部分）。但是当您查看统计追踪中位数收入时，您会看到类似的趋势。美国人口普查局报道，1984年的中位家庭收入为52,679美元，但2019年的68,703美元，收益30％。</p><p> Now, there is a legitimate question of whether these gains have been felt by the younger generations. The National Center for Education Statistics  reveals that real incomes have only increased slightly—about 9%—in the last 25 years for people between the ages of 25 and 34.</p><p> 现在，有一个合法的问题是年轻几代人感受到这些收益。国家教育中心统计数据显示，实际收入只有在过去25岁之间的过去25年略有增加 - 约9％-IN。 </p><p>  My first reply is that it’s important to note that median income data can understate the true increases of living standards. That&#39;s because data sources oftentimes only include people&#39;s after-tax take-home pay, after deducting worker benefits like health insurance. When you try to include these benefits, the  growth in real income has been much larger than these statistics generally show.</p><p>我的第一个答复是重要的是要注意中位收入数据可以低估生活标准的真正增加。因为扣除了人员的福利，因为扣除了人们的税收，所以数据来源的数据来源只包括人＆＃39;扣除的人。当您尝试包含这些福利时，实际收入的增长通常比这些统计数据大得多。</p><p> My second reply is that, ethically speaking, even if these gains merely reflected the fact that old people are getting richer, rather than young people, it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference to my general argument, as millennials will eventually get older, and thus benefit from these gains just as old people do now.</p><p> 我的第二个答复是，道德上讲，即使这些收益仅仅反映了老人越来越富裕的事实，而不是年轻人，它不会与我的一般论证有很大的差异，因为千禧一代最终将得到随着老人现在所做的，从而从这些收益中受益。</p><p> To some, these statistics aren’t enough to show that millennials aren’t doing better. In the face of these statistics, lots of people will still argue that young people are worse off in more subtle ways. Here are some of the most common of these objections and my rebuttals:</p><p> 对于一些，这些统计数据不足以表明千禧一代并没有更好地做得更好。面对这些统计数据，很多人仍然会争辩说，年轻人以更细微的方式更糟糕。以下是这些异议中的一些最常见的异议和我的反驳：</p><p>  Yes, but it&#39;s not clear that those things imply that standards of living are declining in any meaningful way. Arguably, the main reason why costs have gone up in these areas is because society is richer, and thus more willing to bear the cost of better facilities and higher wages for healthcare and education workers. This effect is known as  Baumol&#39;s cost disease.</p><p>  是的，但它并不清楚这些事情意味着生活水平的方式是以任何有意义的方式下降。可以说，在这些领域成本上涨的主要原因是因为社会更富裕，因此更愿意承担更好的设施和更高的医疗保健和教育工作者的工资。这种效果称为Baumol＆＃39;成本疾病。</p><p> Health care and education are in many ways  positional goods, though it would probably take a book to compellingly argue for this thesis (here are two:  education and  health care). In this sense, rising costs in these areas don’t necessarily indicate lowering standards of living—quite the opposite in fact.</p><p> 医疗保健和教育是在许多方面的位置商品，尽管它可能会拿到本论文（这里有两个：教育和医疗保健）。从这个意义上讲，这些地区的成本上升并不一定表明生活标准 - 事实上相反。</p><p> As an analogy, imagine if the cost of jewelry went up. Which of the following is more likely to have been the cause of this rise in price: that some combination of greed and exploitation caused sellers to raise their prices, or that people have more disposable income now, and therefore demand more expensive jewelry?</p><p> 作为一个类比，想象如果珠宝的成本上升了。以下哪一项更有可能成为这个价格上涨的原因：贪婪和剥削的一些结合导致卖家提高价格，或者人们现在有更多可支配收入，因此需求更昂贵的珠宝？</p><p> Consistent with this thesis, healthcare spending and costs  tend to strongly correlate with disposable income. If you believed that rising healthcare costs were indicative of a lowering standard of living, then you should also probably believe that people in the poorest nations on Earth have the highest standards of living—which is obviously absurd.</p><p> 与本论文一致，医疗保健支出和成本往往与可支配收入密切相关。如果您认为的医疗保健费用上升表明居住的降低标准，那么您也应该认为地球最贫穷国家的人具有最高的生活标准 - 显然是荒谬的。 </p><p>   If the main reason why college and healthcare is so expensive is because society is now richer than it was before, then that would imply the opposite of what people normally claim here: that young people have it worse than previous generations.</p><p>如果大学和医疗保健的主要原因是如此昂贵的是，因为社会现在比之前更丰富，那么这意味着与这里人们正常索赔的相反：那个年轻人比以前的几代更糟糕。</p><p> But today people need a college degree in order to survive. Back in my parent&#39;s days, you could just get a well paying job as a factory worker right out of high school.</p><p> 但今天人们需要大学学位以生存。回到我的父母＆＃39;好天，你可以在高中出厂工人的工作良好的工作。</p><p> Yes, credential inflation is a real problem (and one whose  solution is precisely the  opposite of &#34;we need to encourage more people to go to college&#34;), however, the National Center for Education Statistics  data shows almost no difference in median incomes among non-college graduates over the last 25 years. It seems that it has at least not gotten harder recently to enjoy a minimum standard of living without a college degree.</p><p> 是的，凭证通货膨胀是一个真正的问题（以及一个解决方案正是与＆＃34相反的问题;我们需要鼓励更多人去大学和＃34;），但是，国家教育统计数据中心几乎没有区别在过去的25年中，非大学毕业生中位数。似乎最近至少没有变得更加困难，但没有大学学位享受最低的生活水平。</p><p>  The average cost of housing  has gone up over time, but this trend is mainly driven by the fact that modern houses are larger and built better than houses in the past. For example, the average house size has  more than doubled since the 1950s, and new housing must pass stringent regulation to ensure that e.g. there is no lead paint. What matters most is whether people can afford the same quality of housing than their parents and grandparents were able to afford. And the  Zillow mortgage affordability index has tracked the affordability of housing relative to people&#39;s real incomes and  finds that people today have an easier time buying housing relative to their incomes than the previous generations.</p><p>  住房的平均成本随着时间的推移而上升，但这种趋势主要是由于现代房屋更大，而且比过去的房屋更好地制造。例如，自20世纪50年代以来的平均房屋尺寸增加了一倍多，新的住房必须通过严格的调节，以确保例如没有铅漆。最重要的是人们是否能负担与父母和祖父母能够负担得起的相同质量。 Zillow抵押贷款负担能力指数跟踪了住房相对于人的负担能力，并发现今天的人们更容易地购买了相对于前几代收入的住房。</p><p> The decline of home ownership is also overblown. Overall, the home ownership rate has actually  slightly risen since the 1960s, though it did enter a decline after peaking in the early 2000s. During nearly this whole period, home ownership rates have stayed within a narrow 6% window from 63% to 69%.</p><p> 屋屋拥有的衰落也是超越的。总体而言，自20世纪60年代以来，屋主率实际上实际上略微上涨，尽管在2000年代初期达到峰值后确实进入了下降。在几乎这整个时期，居民主率率在狭窄的6％窗口中留在63％至69％。</p><p>  [Note: In an illustration of just how nuanced debates about housing prices can get, a user on Reddit pointed out that  the median age of homebuyers has gone from 31 to 47 in the last 4 decades as evidence that the above chart was misleading. But that’s  all homebuyers. When you look at the age of first-home buyers, the trend has  barely budged, rising by a few years since 1981. So, lots people are buying more than one home now—not exactly economic decline.]</p><p>  [注意：在一个图示的情况下，关于房价有细微辩论，Reddit上的用户指出，在过去的4年中，房屋福尔斯的中位数已经从31到47到47处于上述图表误导的证据。但那是所有购房者。当你看看第一家买家的年龄时，这一趋势几乎没有萌芽，自1981年以来几年。所以，很多人现在正在购买不止一个家 - 而不是经济下降。]</p><p> That said, I agree with people who have complained about  burdensome regulations unnecessarily restricting the supply of housing, thus raising prices, and I do hope millennials can be wise enough to eventually repeal this bad policy.</p><p> 也就是说，我同意抱怨繁琐的法规的人不必要地限制住房的供应，从而提高价格，我确实希望千禧一代可以聪明地倾向于最终废除这种不良政策。 </p><p>  Not right now, no. Although student loan debt has increased greatly in recent decades,  the generation with the most debt is technically Generation X. The baby boomers aren&#39;t that far behind either.</p><p>不是现在，没有。虽然近几十年来学生贷款债务大大增加，但债务最多的一代是技术生成X.婴儿潮一代又在落后于此。</p><p>   Debt is also more affordable than it was 40 or 50 years ago. For example, mortgage interest rates have  declined sharply.</p><p>   债务也比40或50年前更具实惠。例如，抵押贷款利率急剧下降。</p><p>  In the future, millennials will likely take on more debt than their parents, but this won’t necessarily be a bad thing. One of the main functions of debt is to smooth consumption over time. The basic idea is that if you expect to be much richer in the future, it makes sense to take out a lot of debt so that you can enjoy a high standard of living right now, and pay the debt off later. In fact,  nations with the highest average household debt also tend to be the richest. Therefore, rising levels of debt often indicate rising standards of living, not the opposite.</p><p>  未来，千禧一代可能会比父母更多的债务，但这并不一定是一件坏事。债务的主要功能之一是随着时间的推移顺利消耗。基本思想是，如果您未来期望要更加丰富，因此取出了很多债务，以便您现在可以享受高度的生活水平，以后支付债务。事实上，具有最高的家庭债务的国家也往往是最富有的。因此，债务水平上升往往表明生活水平上升，而不是相反的。</p><p> I should note that this argument can also neatly explain why I’m not worried about the slight decline in relative net worth among millennials as, for instance, talked about in  this recent Bloomberg article.</p><p> 我应该注意到这个论点也可以整齐地解释为什么我不担心千禧一代相对净值的轻微下降，例如，在这个最近的彭博文章中谈到了。</p><p>  Firstly, economic inequality does not directly determine standards of living. You can have a highly unequal society with high median standards of living, just as you can have a highly equal society with low median standards of living.</p><p>  首先，经济不平等没有直接确定生活水平。您可以拥有高度不平等的社会，具有高中中位数的生活水平，正如您所拥有的高级社会，生活标准低位。</p><p> Secondly, whether inequality has gotten worse depends on which statistics you are looking at. The most common measure used to determine inequality is the  Gini coefficient of pre-tax income. In my opinion, this is a bad measure of inequality, as it doesn&#39;t take into account the redistributive effects of taxes and government transfers. It also doesn’t take into account the fact that people&#39;s income will grow over time as their career progresses; a society in which everyone receives the same amount of lifetime income, but in which young people earn lower wages than older people, will be seen as unequal by this measure, which seems ethically arbitrary.</p><p> 其次，是否已经变得更糟的不等式取决于您正在研究的统计数据。用于确定不平等的最常见的措施是税前收入的基尼系数。在我看来，这是一种糟糕的不平等衡量标准，因为它没有考虑到税收和政府转移的重新分配影响。它还没有考虑到人们随着时间的推移而随着时间的推移而增长的事实;一个每个人都收到相同数量的寿命收入的社会，但其中年轻人赚取较低的工资而不是老年人，这项措施将被视为不平等，这似乎是道德的任意。</p><p> Another bad measure is wealth inequality, which neglects the reality of consumption smoothing. Under this measure, old people who have saved money for retirement are counted as rich, even if they have a low standard of living, and young medical school graduates who took on a lot debt are counted as poor, even if they are in the top 1% of income earners. It’s not clear why we should care about inequality caused purely by people choosing to save money rather than spend it frivolously.</p><p> 另一个糟糕的措施是财富不平等，忽视了消费平滑的现实。在这一措施下，挽救退休金的老人被算成了富人，即使他们有一个低的生活水平，也占据了很多债务的年轻医学院毕业生，即使他们是最重要的1％的收入收入。尚不清楚为什么我们应该关心纯粹由选择省钱而不是轻浮花的人来关心不平等。 </p><p> Put another way, if Jeff Bezos spent $10 billion to personally fly to the moon and back, this would decrease national wealth inequality compared to just holding stock. And, investing does have social value,  even if it produces inequities.</p><p>另一种方式，如果杰夫贝斯在100亿美元的人身上飞向月球和背部，这将减少与股票相比减少国家财富不平等。并且，投资确实具有社会价值，即使它产生的不公平。</p><p> For these reasons, I think the only measure of inequality that you should be concerned about is  consumption inequality across one’s lifetime, that is, inequality between people in what they actually purchase to sustain their lifestyle during their lifespan. Numerous studies have found that consumption inequality has  stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.</p><p> 由于这些原因，我认为，唯一应该关注的不等式的衡量标准是一个人的一生中的消费不平等，即人们在他们实际购买在寿命期间维持其生活方式的不平等。许多研究发现，自20世纪60年代以来，消费不平等已经大致不变。</p><p>   It is true that the 2008 and 2020 economic crises were bad in terms of their effects on employment. However, it&#39;s not clear that this overall economic era is worse than prior eras in terms of employment. The early 1980s recession  saw an unemployment rate of 10.8%, exceeding the maximum experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 recession saw even greater unemployment at 14.8%, but this was an extremely acute effect of coronavirus lockdowns. By late 2020, unemployment had nearly returned to historically normal levels. Furthermore, before the 2020 recession, the unemployment rate was at the lowest point it had been in over 50 years.</p><p>   确实，2008年和2020年的经济危机在对就业的影响方面非常糟糕。然而，它并不清楚，这种整体经济时代比就业方式比现有时代差。 20世纪80年代初，经济衰退的失业率为10.8％，超过2008年金融危机期间的最大经验。 2020年经济衰退表现出更大的失业率为14.8％，但这是冠状病毒锁定的极其急性效果。到2020年底，失业率几乎恢复到历史上正常水平。此外，在2020年的经济衰退之前，失业率在50多年以上的最低点。</p><p>  Sure, but millennials were hit with the Great Recession, and now we’re hit with the coronavirus recession.</p><p>  当然，但千禧一代被衰退的巨大衰退，现在我们正在遭受冠心病衰退。</p><p> The Great Recession was bad relative to previous recessions following the Great Depression. But that’s not the greatest measure of whether quality of life was worse during that time period compared to the past.</p><p> 在大萧条之后，巨大的经济衰退是不好的。但这并不是最大的衡量此期间生活质量在过去的时间内更糟糕。</p><p> To start, the  frequency of recessions has declined over time in US history. Being hit with only two recessions in one generation actually a historical aberration, when you take a longer-view perspective. The period between 2009-2020 was in fact  the longest period of uninterrupted growth in US history.</p><p> 开始，在美国历史中，衰退的频率随着时间的推移而下降。当你采取更长的观点时，在一代中只有两个衰退，实际上是一个历史的像差。 2009  -  2012年期间的期限实际上是美国历史中不间断增长的最长时期。</p><p> Our expectations tend to warp our experience. Look, a recession is usually defined as some sort of decline in GDP or consumer spending. When GDP goes up by 2%, we don’t call that an anti-recession, or a “boom.” We just call it normal life, since growth rates like that are what we’ve been conditioned to accept.</p><p> 我们的期望倾向于经过我们的经验。看，经济衰退通常被定义为GDP或消费者支出的某种衰退。当GDP上涨2％时，我们不会称之为反衰退或“繁荣”。我们只是称之为正常的生活，因为增长率就像我们已经被调节的那样接受。 </p><p> When the norm is for things to get better, sometimes mere stagnation can make things seem like things are taking a nosedive. Humans seem to have a  persistent bias towards perceiving that things are getting worse. But it’s important to keep your mind open to the bigger picture. At the bottom of the Great Recession, in quarter 2 of 2009, real GDP per capita  declined to… the level it was previously at in 2004, just 5 years earlier.</p><p>当规范是为了让事情变得更好时，有时只有停滞可以让事情看起来像是事物正在冒险。人类似乎对认为事情变得更糟的持续偏见。但是要把你的思想开放到更大的画面很重要。在巨大经济衰退的底部，在2009年第2季度，人均真正的GDP拒绝了......它以前在2004年的水平，即在2004年，早在5年前。</p><p> I know that GDP per capita is not a perfect measure for measuring quality of life. Yet I also know of no other good aggregate measures which don’t follow something similar to this pattern.</p><p> 我知道人均GDP不是衡量生活质量的完美措施。然而，我也知道没有其他良好的聚合措施，不遵循类似于这种模式的东西。</p><p>  It’s true that the federal minimum wage   has  declined when adjusted for inflation since the 1970s.</p><p>  确实，自20世纪70年代以来调整通胀时，联邦最低工资已下降。</p><p>   However, the minimum wage establishes, as per its name, a  minimum wage level. It doesn&#39;t tell us much about average standard of living. Most states also set  their own minimum wages higher than the federal level.</p><p>   但是，根据其名称，最低工资建立了最低工资水平。它并不告诉我们平均生活水平。大多数州也设定了比联邦一级高的最低工资。</p><p> Furthermore, since the 1970s—the period of a declining minimum wage— welfare transfers to the poor went up, arguably raising the minimum standard of living. This rising minimum standard can be illustrated by, for example, the fact that the proportion of Americans who live in severely crowded housing has been  cut by over 75% since 1975, and that air conditioning is  seven times more prevalent among poor households now than in the 1960s.</p><p> 此外，自20世纪70年代 - 从最低的最低工资趋势转移到穷人的涨幅，可以说是提高最低生活标准。例如，这种上升的最低标准可以通过1975年以来，居住在严重拥挤的住房的美国人的比例超过75％，并且空调比现在的贫困家庭中普遍存在的七倍20世纪60年代。</p><p>  When I first learned in my high school textbooks about the &#34;booming&#34; economic environment of the 1950s, I gathered a sense that the US economy might have already peaked. This opinion was then, and still is, backed by common wisdom that boomers were handed the world on a silver platter and proceeded to ruin it. But when I started looking into real evidence, I found that this concept was based on little more than misconception and a handful of misleading statistics.</p><p>  当我第一次在我的高中教科书中了解了关于＆＃34;蓬勃发展的兴奋剂＆＃34; 20世纪50年代的经济环境，我收集了美国经济可能已经达到顶峰的感觉。这种意见是，仍然是，仍然被共同的智慧支持，潮流在银盘上递给了世界，并继续毁灭它。但是，当我开始研究真正的证据时，我发现这个概念基于误解和少数误导性统计数据。</p><p> This all makes sense from a psychological perspective. Many young people probably just find it convenient to believe that they have experienced undue economic hardship, since they can win sympathy that way. And most people naturally think that we should care about the plight of young folks more than old folks.</p><p> 这一切都是从心理上的角度造成意义。许多年轻人可能只是发现相信他们经历过不正当的经济困难，因为他们可以赢得那样的同情。大多数人自然认为我们应该关心年轻人的困境，而不是老人们。 </p><p> Nearly everyone is aware of new technological developments, and so they’re probably cognizant in some sense that things are better than before. Yet, most remain unaware that ordinary measures of standards of living are up too.
