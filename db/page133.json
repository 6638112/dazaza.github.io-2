Some of them are troubling, such as the conspiratorial prejudice that has fuelled QAnon and the recent surge in violence against those of Asian descent. Others are restorative: the immersive worlds of books, the virtual realities of video games, the hypnotic lull of binge-streamed television series.\n Many of the escapes that we use to nourish ourselves originated in Japan. The stunning success of Nintendo\u2019s Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which sold thirty-one million copies worldwide last year, is a striking example. Now we have another, in the form of an imported anime with a mouthful of a title: \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train.\u201d It d\u00e9buted in Japanese theatres in October of 2020, then arrived in American ones in April. It quickly set records for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a foreign film, as well as the highest-earning R-rated animated film. All of this has conspired to make it the planet\u2019s single  top-grossing film of 2020.\n This success might seem surprising, as anime has long been considered a fringe subculture, but the film\u2019s momentum was presaged by the enthusiasm of its reception in Japan. When \u201cMugen Train\u201d opened there, pandemic-weary audiences flocked to see it in theatres outfitted with socially distanced seating. By the end of the year, the film had emerged as more than simply a coronavirus phenomenon. It had done the unthinkable, unseating Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s 2001 epic, \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history. What Miyazaki\u2019s beloved film had earned over the course of nineteen years, \u201cMugen Train\u201d surpassed in just three months.\n It\u2019s tempting to frame the success of \u201cMugen Train\u201d as a passing of the torch from an elderly master to a younger generation\u2014and, indeed, Miyazaki has said that he considers the film a \u201c rival.\u201d (Miyazaki, who has announced his retirement numerous times over the decades, is currently working on what is purported to be his final film, titled \u201cHow Do You Live?\u201d) But \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the product of a very different creative process, and a very different media environment. Miyazaki\u2019s films are meditative, self-contained stories, created and financed independently, outside of the traditional corporate production committees that sustain Japan\u2019s commercial animation industry. He is an auteur who wears his politics on his sleeve, pens his own scripts, insists on checking nearly every frame himself, and long resisted merchandising his creations. In contrast, the hyperkinetic \u201cMugen Train\u201d is the latest installment in a series envisioned as a mass-market multimedia product from the very start. Tellingly, the vast majority of media coverage has focussed on its box-office success instead of its director, Haruo Sotozaki, or its writers, who aren\u2019t credited individually but under the name of the film\u2019s production company, Ufotable.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is the continuation of a hit television series called \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,\u201d which was, in turn, based upon a hit manga of the same title, by the artist Koyoharu Gotoge. The series is set in Japan\u2019s Taisho era, which lasted from 1912 to 1926; the precise date is never specified. The hero is Tanjiro Kamado, a boy who ekes out a living with his mother and siblings in the verdant mountains of a rapidly modernizing Japan. One day, Tanjiro returns from an errand to discover that his family has been slaughtered by demons: vicious monsters that roam the land in search of human blood. For these malevolent creatures, humans are both sustenance and a medium of reproduction, for once bitten, a human will inevitably turn demon. A blend of Western vampire lore and local Japanese folk traditions, the demons are dark mirrors of the human condition, their appearances varying wildly depending on whatever negative traits they possessed as humans. The lone survivor of this massacre is Tanjiro\u2019s sister Nezuko, who now teeters on the cusp of turning into a demon herself. Before Tanjiro can react, a mysterious warrior appears and tries to kill Nezuko; Tanjiro instinctively protects her. During the battle, it becomes clear that Nezuko has retained her human personality and is actively resisting her thirst for blood. The stranger fits Nezuko with a bamboo gag\u2014better safe than sorry\u2014then instructs Tanjiro to seek out a secret society called the Demon Slayer Corps. So it is that the siblings are thrust into a shadow war playing out between humanity and demon-kind.\n None of this context is explained in the film; instead, the backstory plays out across twenty-six blood-drenched television episodes, more than ten hours in total, available to stream on Netflix, Crunchyroll, and other platforms. \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d picks up precisely where the series leaves off. There is no recap, and nothing in the way of exposition. Theatregoers are presumed to have their tickets, so to speak, for the train ride on which most of the film\u2019s action unfolds. (\u201cIt\u2019s almost impressive how fast \u2018Mugen Train\u2019 is able to completely disorient anyone who doesn\u2019t already know where it\u2019s going,\u201d IndieWire  wrote.)\n  Expecting such familiarity with a large amount of source material would seem an obstacle to mainstream success, but \u201cMugen Train\u201d had some help. Trapped indoors by  -19 restrictions, a lot of us turned to streaming platforms for solace, and a great many of the shows that we watched were anime. Netflix reported a fifty-per-cent increase in viewership of the genre compared to the year before.\n  \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d d\u00e9buted as a print manga, in February, 2016, in the pages of a magazine called  Weekly Shonen Jump. Launched in 1968,  Jump is one of Japan\u2019s oldest and most successful manga weeklies; at its peak, in the nineties, it sold more than six million copies every week. Key to the publication\u2019s enduring popularity is a calculated approach to cultivating talent, honed over the decades by an editorial department that carefully directs the output of freelance comic creators. Every issue of  Jump contains a postcard asking readers to rank their favorite titles; this data is then used to shape the direction of story lines in real time. The  Jump formula has produced some of Japan\u2019s most enduring pop-cultural hits, including \u201cDragon Ball,\u201d \u201cNaruto,\u201d \u201cOne Piece,\u201d and \u201cMy Hero Academia.\u201d It could be argued that, by teasing out episodes of manga via the \u201calgorithm\u201d of reader feedback, and then compiling the most popular series into separately sold stand-alone volumes that could be \u201cbinged\u201d all at once,  Jump presaged the way the world consumes streaming entertainment today.\n  From an artist\u2019s perspective, working for  Jump is something like a comic-book boot camp. In a story now enshrined in manga-industry lore, an editor at the magazine compelled the manga artist Akira Toriyama to submit five hundred pages of concepts before finally accepting the one that became his d\u00e9but, the scatological sci-fi comedy \u201c Dr. Slump.\u201d Artists, even established ones, submit to such gruelling oversight because the stakes are enormous. Afterward, Toriyama went on to make \u201c Dragon Ball,\u201d a martial-arts epic inspired in turns from Jackie Chan movies and the Ming-era Chinese epic \u201cJourney to the West.\u201d It went on to sell two hundred and sixty million copies worldwide. Six out of the ten best-selling manga series of all time originated in the  Jump offices. Landing a sustained hit in the weekly magazine virtually guarantees that the comic will be animated, merchandised, and transformed into a lucrative global franchise. This makes  Weekly Shonen Jump more than a publication: it is a dream factory for creators and consumers both.\n  The word  shonen means \u201cboy,\u201d but  shonen manga, as boys\u2019 comics are called in Japan, are widely read by both boys and girls. In spite of this mixed readership, however,  Weekly Shonen Jump has never employed a  female editor in its more than fifty years of operation. Part of the boys\u2019-club atmosphere is tradition. But, in this day and age, it\u2019s easy to question whether institutional sexism might play a role. When, in 2019, the  HuffPost officially queried whether a woman might ever be named an editor at the magazine,  Jump\u2019s publisher, Shueisha, responded that, while it wouldn\u2019t be without precedent, \u201cit\u2019s important to understand the hearts of boys,\u201d a sort of circular-logic non-response. Other hints can be found in the pages of the weekly itself. \u201cBakuman,\u201d a 2008 series chronicling the efforts of two high-school boys to make their professional artistic d\u00e9but in  Jump, describes the protagonists\u2019 ambitions as \u201cdreams that women will never be able to understand.\u201d It\u2019s puzzling to encounter such a contemptuous sentiment in the pages of the magazine\u2014particularly when you consider how many of Japan\u2019s most successful cartoon franchises, including \u201cFullmetal Alchemist\u201d and \u201cSailor Moon,\u201d are the handiwork of female creators. And more than a few popular series by women, such as Katsura Hoshino\u2019s \u201cD. Gray-man,\u201d have even been published in  Jump.\n Part of the mainstream success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba\u201d may in fact lay in its refreshing lack of gender stereotypes. In spite of the fact that co-star Nezuko spends the majority of the series muzzled with a piece of bamboo, she is no silent damsel in distress; as often as not she comes to Tanjiro&#39;s rescue in battle. Nor are the demons faceless fiends to be casually vanquished, \u00e0 la the shambling zombies of so many Western horror series: some are virtually indistinguishable from normal humans, while others are revealed to have tragic backstories that cast their motivations in a sympathetic light. The series\u2019 reclusive creator, who goes by the gender-neutral pen name Koyoharu Gotoge, has never revealed their identity, but the news magazine  Shukan Bunshun quotes an unidentified  Jump employee who describes the author as a thirtysomething female. If true, this would mean that the single most popular boys\u2019 manga series in history was actually created by a woman.\n \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d represents many transitions: between generations of artists, of course, but also from financially unpredictable auteurism to focus-tested corporate formulas better suited to the streaming era\u2014and, perhaps, from a male-dominated to a more inclusive way of crafting anime. So, too, does the movie herald a shift in the way that the planet dreams. Part of the success of \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train\u201d is attributable to an unprecedented global situation that focussed the attention of so many millions on to the series via streaming platforms. But America is finally beginning to open up again, and \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d\u00a0\u2019s popularity shows no sign of flagging. Nor does the popularity of manga as a medium, the sales of which in America are significantly outstripping traditional American superhero fare. The film\u2019s reception seems to suggest that anime is finally poised to make its leap from the shadows of subculture into the mainstream. Streaming platforms have been quick to grasp the import. In December, Sony paid more than a billion dollars to acquire Netflix\u2019s biggest rival in streaming anime, Crunchyroll; Netflix, in turn, announced that it plans to fund and premi\u00e8re forty new anime series in 2021.\n In 1990, Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor of political science, first proposed a corollary to a nation\u2019s \u201chard power,\u201d its military forces or economic resources: \u201csoft power.\u201d He defined it in terms of \u201cwhen one country gets other countries to want what it wants.\u201d Most of his case studies focussed on the global proliferation of Western mores, ranging from democracy to rock and roll, but he also stressed that the currents of globalization flow both ways. \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d proves the point: when it comes to anime, at least, Japan has persuaded the world to want what it wants.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:12:15",

\n...... ", "note_en": "E ven before Seb had arrived at the prison, five weeks before my first visit, the staff had received a notification that he ought to be subject to close monitoring. While still in police custody, an out-of-hours forensic psychiatric assessment had been requested.\n Seb had been compliant with the arresting officers, but he had given the impression that he was unconcerned by what had happened \u2013 it seemed as though he didn\u2019t mind at all that he was being arrested. More bizarrely, there were flickers of apparent self-satisfaction. Seb had been arrested on suspicion of murdering his mother.\n  A nurse and the on-call doctor from the local forensic unit travelled to the police station, but Seb declined to come out of the cell to speak to them. Accompanied by police officers, the clinicians went to his cell to speak to him directly, but whatever they said, Seb stuck to the same line: he had nothing to say to them. He even resisted attempts to be drawn into casual conversation. The clinicians, along with the on-call consultant, agreed that Seb did not require admission to hospital. Having said that, this reticence, along with the particulars of the crime Seb had committed, left the assessors reluctant to rule out psychiatric issues completely.\n The next morning the doctor who had assessed Seb in the police station called the prison mental health team to recommend that, on arrival, he should be admitted to the healthcare wing for further monitoring. From their observations, the officers and nurses also felt that Seb was not quite right, though they found it difficult to put their finger on precisely why they felt that way. He kept a distance from everyone. When he spoke, he used as few words as possible to make his point, which was either a specific request \u2013 such as for clean towels \u2013 or more often to decline offers of help or support from the staff.\n He did not want to come out of the cell for meals or to relax in the day room. He seemed to be eating and sleeping well, and although he avoided contact, if they spoke to him he was not noticeably irritable and there had not been any aggression. That was, until the second night.\n  Just before the end of her long shift, one of the nurses went to check on Seb. She found him leaning on his sink looking into the small wall-mounted mirror. At first glance there was nothing unusual. During the debrief later, the nurse recalled that it was slightly odd that he did not react at all to her presence, but at the time she thought there was a mundane explanation; he seemed lost in his own thoughts.\n With only one foot in his cell, the nurse tried to get Seb\u2019s attention by calling his name. Then it was a bit of a blur. He must have sprung towards her and, as she made to leave the cell, wrapped his forearm around her neck, pulling her back. The staff heard her shout out, and the sound of her alarm, which she had activated by pressing the red button on her belt radio.\n Fortunately, it was only a few steps from the nurses\u2019 office to Seb\u2019s cell, but they were not expecting the strength with which Seb fought against their attempts to release his arm from their colleague\u2019s neck. A prison officer who arrived at the scene admitted that he felt he had no choice but to hit Seb on the head. With the help of officers who had run from other wings in response to the alarm, they were able to free the nurse and lock Seb back in his cell.\n After what was regarded as an attempted hostage-taking incident on the healthcare wing, Seb was assessed as too dangerous to remain there, and so when I visited him, I made my way to the segregation unit.\n  I  specialise in forensic psychiatry, a branch of medicine that deals with the assessment and treatment of offenders in prisons and secure hospitals, many of whom exhibit violent behaviour. I had been asked by Seb\u2019s legal team to offer an expert opinion on his mental state at the time of the offence. (To maintain patient confidentiality, Seb is not his real name and other identifiers have been altered.)\n As a regular visitor,  I knew the atmosphere on the unit was completely unpredictable; it could at times be eerily quiet, but frequently I had arrived in the \u201cseg\u201d to a cacophony of screams, shouts, howls and shuddering bangs that were made all the more unnerving by the sources of the noise being out of sight. The only opportunity for the residents of the bleak, single-occupancy cells to interact face to face with their fellow inmates was during their brief allotted time for exercise in individual caged pods running outside half the length of the building.\n Otherwise, communication was mostly done by shouting indiscriminately across the central space of the unit. Sometimes these were calls to welcome a new arrival who was in their fold, or to threaten ones who were not. Alternatively, the focus of their attention could be the officers; either to plead for something, or announce their aggressive intentions.\n Visitors to the unit often provoked renewed excitement. I used to wonder how the prisoners who already knew me could tell when I came on the wing, despite the doors and hatches being firmly shut. They\u2019d yell, \u201cDr Nathan, come here a minute, I need to speak to you,\u201d just after I passed their door. I realised later that they could spy through the narrow slit between the heavy metal door and its frame. When other prisoners heard about the presence of a doctor, they would shout out that they were ill and needed to see me urgently. Some probably required medical attention. Most were suffering from extreme isolation and craved any sort of interaction. The calls tended to subside once I had passed along the unit, or they would turn into other pleas and threats, as if the existence of other people also reminded them of their desires and grievances.\n  Seb was on what the officers call a \u201cthree-officer unlock\u201d. All segregation unit residents are only allowed out of their cells one at a time, but those who are considered particularly unpredictable, like Seb, require at least three officers to be on hand before the door to the cell can be opened.\n But when we got to his cell, Seb had covered himself entirely with his blanket and remained still. When the officer opened the door and announced why we were there, there was no sign of a response. Feeling self-conscious about talking to a blanket in front of an audience of three officers and a trainee doctor, I introduced myself to Seb and said that I was there to see if there was anything else that could be done to help.\n In the silence waiting for a response, I scanned his cell for anything of significance. During assessments of prisoners in the segregation unit, I have often found their cells to be in a state of disarray. The floor may be sodden after the occupant has blocked their lavatory as an act of dissent. Messages may be scrawled on fragments of paper or other surfaces. On occasion, faeces have been smeared on the walls in what is called a \u201cdirty protest\u201d. There were no such signs in Seb\u2019s cell. The very few possessions were arranged tidily on the floor against the furthest wall.\n As a last attempt to get his attention, the lead officer told Seb that soon there would not be another chance to speak to a doctor. It had no effect. Seb remained silent. Maintaining the direction of my gaze towards Seb, I carefully stepped backward out of the cell.\n My role in visiting prisoners like Seb is to help his legal team establish a picture of the defendant\u2019s mind so they can decide what plea he should enter. When I began practising forensic psychiatry 23 years ago, I quickly learned that anticipating questions that lawyers would ask required me to start thinking more deeply about the patient\u2019s mind than my psychiatric training had prepared me for. The court may be willing to take account of my evidence about the role of an unfortunate upbringing, or birth trauma on the actions of the defendant, but they would also need to hear how those particular factors are relevant \u2013 why their mental processes led them to commit this particular crime.\n Once I extended my practice beyond working on criminal trials and began appearing as an expert witness in family courts and in other types of legal proceedings, the limitations of an explanation based on a diagnosis or a list of causal factors became clear. It would be of little assistance to the family courts in deciding about the safe care of a child if I were to just present symptom names and the associated diagnostic label. From my assessment, I need to acquire an understanding of that person\u2019s subjective experience \u2013 their thoughts, feelings, emotions, perceptions \u2013 so that I can try to explain not only why they had behaved as they had, but also the circumstances that may increase the chances they would behave in that way again.\n  S eb\u2019s solicitor had requested an opinion on whether his client\u2019s mental state at the time of the offence amounted to insanity. The day after my unsuccessful assessment, I called his solicitor to let him know that Seb had refused to speak to me. Although the recent dramatic transformation of his personality with the development of eccentric behaviour, uncharacteristic violence and brooding reserve pointed to a \u201cdisease of the mind\u201d, until I could communicate with him, I was unable to determine whether that had caused him to not know what he was doing when he attacked his mother.\n Seb was not completely mute, but there was good reason to doubt his ability to make a proper defence to the charge of murder. My impression was that he was not being deliberately obstructive. I needed to come to a view on whether he could properly engage in the criminal proceedings; in other words, was he fit to plead? The final decision rests with the judge, having considered the evidence of two doctors. I filed my report to the solicitors stating that he was, in my opinion, unfit to plead.\n Until Seb agreed to speak, I was not going to be able to understand his mind. All the same, I was not content for him to stay in prison. There was enough evidence to make a case for assessment and treatment in hospital. Following liaison with a suitably secure forensic hospital and written recommendations to the Ministry of Justice, a warrant was issued for transfer.\n By the time we next met, six weeks later, Seb had been moved to a forensic hospital. I was reintroduced to him by a ward nurse who escorted him to the interview room. Before even having a chance to check whether he was any more communicative, I could see a change in his appearance. Many, but not necessarily all, of my patients who experience distressing psychotic experiences seem to gain significant benefit from antipsychotic medication, although unfortunately these often have side effects including weight gain. From Seb\u2019s heavier appearance, I suspected that he had been started on anti-psychotic medication.\n He told me that several months before his arrest he had started to feel overcome with waves of unease, which developed into a more relentless sense of foreboding and dread. Things around him didn\u2019t feel right. People had a dreamlike aura about them. He questioned whether they were who he thought they were. Then Seb\u2019s thoughts crystallised. It dawned on him that he was surrounded by imposters. The woman masquerading as his mother looked and behaved like her in every respect, but he could not shake his conviction that she was a charlatan, and that this imposter was involved in the abduction of his real mother. The usurper, who had cleverly adopted all his mother\u2019s characteristics, vehemently repudiated his allegations.\n He explained to me that he interpreted her protestations as a sign of how desperate she was to maintain the fraud. His tone became more earnest as he spoke about the offence, but he did not become overtly emotional. (It was as if his memory was not yet fully infused with emotion \u2013 whereas his words acknowledged responsibility for carrying out the offence, his tone was that of an objective spectator.) Seb had felt that his options were narrowing. He could not leave the charade unchallenged, but revealing to the imposter that he knew the truth could imperil his true mother. He wrestled with himself before the night when he finally stabbed the woman he believed was not his mother while she slept.\n Seb took the failure of his real mother to reappear to be a sign that the conspiracy ran deeper than he had previously thought. He decided that the best course of action was to avoid talking to anyone about what he knew. On the whole, he could suppress signs of his simmering frustration, but occasionally it became too much to bear \u2013 such as after the first couple of days on the healthcare wing, when he grabbed the nurse.\n The way Seb spoke to me showed that he was able to stand back from his former conspiracy-obsessed existence and question the veracity of his beliefs. I asked him when his perspective changed. He said he had acquired his new insights several weeks after his admission, around the same time that he started taking antipsychotic medication.\n  There was agreement about Seb\u2019s diagnosis. The presence of delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms such as voices or visions encouraged a diagnosis of delusional disorder, which falls within the same category as schizophrenia. There was also a term for the specific type of experience he had: Capgras syndrome, named after Joseph Capgras, who described the case of a middle-aged woman from Paris who, in June 1918, visited the local police commissioner to ask for two officers to accompany her and witness the evidence of a widespread crime. She reported that children were being illegally confined across Paris, including in the basement of her house. The police took her to an infirmary, from where she was admitted to Sainte-Anne mental asylum.\n After about a year, she was transferred to another asylum, Maison Blanche. There she came to the attention of Capgras, a psychiatrist who was interested in the themes of substitutions and disappearances that ran through her delusional beliefs. She believed she had been the victim of an abduction, and that she and others had identical doubles. She thought that \u201cthe theatre played out by these doubles is unbelievable\u201d. With a colleague, the psychiatrist published a report on this case, which they termed  illusion des sosies, or illusion of doubles.\n My medical training had taught me that, having found a term for a patient\u2019s condition and one for his symptoms, I had achieved sufficient understanding and the assessment was complete. But these terms only describe, they do not explain.\n To get to the underlying mechanisms that explain why Seb was experiencing symptoms, we needed to listen in detail to exactly what he was saying.\n  K nowing a little about the workings of the brain could help us interpret Seb\u2019s words. Seb claimed that the woman he killed appeared to have the same form as his mother, but a different identity. He acknowledged that he could not detect any difference in appearance between the imposter and his mother, but even so, he was sure this was not his mother.\n We know from brain scans on both humans and other primates that recognising other people relies heavily on facial images, and involves a number of different brain pathways. Disruption in this neural network can interfere with a person\u2019s ability to recognise the face of a familiar person, a condition that is known as prosopagnosia, literally meaning \u201cface ignorance\u201d.\n Seb\u2019s problem was not prosopagnosia. He could recognise the form of his mother\u2019s face. It was her identity that he questioned. Before the definable paranoid beliefs took hold, his perception of the world was accompanied by a general sense of doubt. He emphasised feelings of unreality; he was sure of nothing. Seb could not grasp a clear meaning, but there was an undertone of danger.\n Seb spoke of a jump from this early feeling of ambiguity and nebulous threat to the arrival of certainty. An idea came to him that helped resolve his confusion about the reality of the world around him (including his mother\u2019s identity) and to him it was consistent with his conspiratorial feelings. But while this idea \u2013 that his mother had been replaced by an imposter \u2013 matched his reality, it was out of kilter with everyone else\u2019s. And so, instead of rejecting the idea, Seb interpreted others\u2019 actions in a way that supported this idea. The belief that his mother\u2019s replacement was part of a wider plot gave meaning to his experiences and he selected evidence consistent with that meaning. In reaction to a loss of the sense of familiarity that had previously accompanied the visual image of his mother, Seb accepted a coherent yet false narrative.\n Neurobiological studies have improved our understanding of the origins of psychotic distortions of the sort experienced by Seb. But using only the language of brain chemicals and neuronal pathways is not sufficient. We have to retain the subjective perspective to truly understand human experience and behaviour. To explain violence, we must contextualise the physiology with psychological abstractions, such as impulses, urges and motives.\n  T he narrative that Seb had created was obviously a delusional one, but sometimes the basis of a narrative that supports a violent act is more difficult to judge. Most patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are not violent. By chronicling forensic psychiatric cases, there is a risk of reinforcing the media cliche of the violent schizophrenic.\n On the contrary, my view is that such stereotypes are broken down by sympathetically examining real-life cases while emphasising their rarity. The diagnosis of schizophrenia relies in part on the identification of psychotic experiences such as delusional beliefs or hallucinatory voices. It comes as a surprise to many that these experiences are not uncommon among the general population.\n A clinical diagnosis requires the unusual experiences to be accompanied by high levels of distress and dysfunction. Some individuals suffering in this way may have periods when, to the observer, their behaviour appears bizarre. What has become increasingly clear to me in my practice is that diagnosis is not a particularly informative way of understanding behaviour. I have been involved in too many trials in which the central issue has been whether the criteria for a specific diagnosis were met.\n At the core of most motives for violence are assumptions about the intentions of others. Seb believed that a sinister collective was intent on keeping his mother hidden against her will.\n Understanding motivation is certainly important, but we also need to think about why hostile feelings are so seldom translated into homicidal actions. For most of us, even a flickering awareness of the consequences of our imagined aggression triggers negative feelings that prevent us from going through with a violent act. And since we are programmed to avoid negative feelings, we are inclined to suppress or resist the thoughts that cause them. If you were to imagine being the perpetrator of a violent attack on the person you love or care for most in the world, it is likely that you are immediately repulsed by the thought \u2013 that you imagine the horror in their reaction, the pain they would feel, the feelings of shock, betrayal, confusion. Thus adopting the emotional perspective of the victim is, for most people, enough to stop a violent impulse in its tracks. When we imagine a violent act from the perspective of the victim, we are demonstrating a type of empathy \u2013 we are imagining the mind of another.\n Empathy is a critical human ability and, when it comes to violence, it is powerfully inhibiting. So crucial are these processes that they do not even require conscious effort: they run behind the scenes, constantly inhibiting myriad counterproductive impulses.

"note_en": "We\u2019ve all heard this riddle: if you dig down deep enough in Windows 10, you\u2019ll find elements that date from Windows 3.x days. But is it actually true? In this article we\u2019ll discover just how many UI layers are in Windows and when they were first introduced.\n For the purpose of this experiment, I chose the latest Windows 10 Insider Build (as of February 6th, 2021), which is Windows 10 build 21301.\n   First, we begin with the latest and greatest, Fluent Design. Announced in 2017 and introduced with Windows 10 1803 update, Fluent Design is a major redesign of the Modern Design Language 2 (MDL2), aimed at bringing elements like Light, Depth, Motion, Material, and Scale. It also introduces the Reveal effects and the Acrylic translucent background.\n As of now, most of the inbox (UWP) applications have been upgraded to take use of Fluent elements, as well as some of the more front-facing elements, like the Start Menu, Activity Center and the Login Screen.\n Although Fluent Design was well appreciated, most of the enthusiasts considered this move too little, too late, as only a small subset of features have been enhanced with this new design style.\n   Just as we dig a bit deeper into the OS, we can see elements that haven\u2019t been upgraded since Windows 8/8.1.\n Some of these are glaring omissions, like the volume flyout, the USB flyout as well as some elements from the login screen.\n  Other Metro elements, although not as prominent, are the boot screen (which will soon be replaced with a newer one) and WinRE\n   Did you know: the first time the spinning dots were introduced was in Windows 8 build 7989.\n  Just like Windows 10, Windows 8 was also plagued with inconsistency issues (for better or for worse). However, Windows 8 added meaningful enhancements to major user elements, like the Windows Explorer or Task Manager. Although they would receive some quality-of-life improvements in subsequent Windows 10 updates, changes would be minimal.\n Also, an important change brought by Windows 8 was the redesign of the File Transfer dialogs.\n  Some of these changes started in Windows 7, which brings us to the fourth layer:\n  Windows 7 is without doubt one of the most beloved versions of Windows of all time, praised for its great enhancements over Windows Vista. It brought many new features that, although weren\u2019t as significant as those that Vista introduces, made Windows 7 a very solid OS, and a true successor to Windows XP. However, one of the most infamous changes brought with Windows 7 is the Ribbon UI, which is a feature ported from Office 2007. Some of the apps that got updated with the new Ribbon UI are Paint and Wordpad.\n Although at some point Microsoft decided to deprecate the classic Paint in favor of the new Paint 3D (introduced with Windows 10 Creators Update), after major backlash, they reversed their decision.\n  Other features that were updated in Windows 7 and remained the same ever since are: Windows Media Player 12, Remote Desktop Connection and some file dialogs.\n   Windows Vista was a monumental Windows release, one that brought much needed modernization to the platform. Almost all of the fundamentals of the OS have been in some way or another improved, from the bootloader to the driver model. However, as we all know by now, Windows Vista would come to be one of the worst Windows releases ever, plagued with issues from the beginning. One of the few features that were praised, though, was the UI. It redesigned some of the fundamentals that haven\u2019t been updated since Windows 95. One of the main promotors of this change was the introduction of the so-called Aero Wizards, replaced the previous wizard standard, Wizard97.\n  Other features that were redesigned in Windows Vista and are basically the same in Windows 10: the Control Panel, the Search program, Windows Fax and Scan.\n  Speaking of Windows Vista: did you know that in certain special circumstances Windows 10 falls back to the Vista boot screen? It happens when your video card doesn\u2019t support the video mode that the standard boot screen uses.\n  Believe it or not, there are not that many XP elements embedded into Windows 10. That\u2019s probably because most of the fundamentals were updated already into Windows 2000. However, Windows 10 contains some file dialogs from XP, which are seen when one is installing a driver.\n   Windows 2000 was a big milestone for the NT lineup of operating systems from Microsoft. It also was the stepping stone that would signal the start the transition to a new, unified Windows vision. However, Windows 2000 was still a business-oriented OS, which means that it brought a lot of new features designed for experts.\n One of the most significant addition is the Management Console (MMC), whose UI elements are basically the same ever since.\n  Another feature introduced by default in Windows 2000 is Windows Installer, which still has the same icon from when it was first introduced!\n  Another UI element that hasn\u2019t changed (apart from branding, of course) is winver, whose design was introduced in Windows 2000 build 1946.\n  While Windows 2000 introduced lots of features aimed for power users, Windows 95 is probably the most significant Windows release to date. It introduced fundamental paradigms that still hold to this day. It introduced features like the Start Menu, context menus, the taskbar and recycle bin. While these features were of course updated over the course of many years, some remained almost exactly the same.\n  An element that is basically a relic of the older computing habits, where one had to protect their precious CRT screen is the screensaver settings.\n    One more common UI element that passed the test of time is the folder properties screen.\n  And there are so many more UI elements that haven\u2019t been touched since Windows 95. Is this a case of timeless design? I\u2019ll let you judge for yourself.\n  Well, this is not really a \u201cUI layer\u201d, as I haven\u2019t been able to find any interface elements predating Windows 95 (although I have a feeling that there certainly are). However, there is a peculiar file in Windows 10, called moricons.dll, which contains a lot of old icons from the DOS days. Take a look:\n  Well, that\u2019s pretty much it. As you may know, Microsoft is planning on overhauling the UI of Windows with their \u201cSun Valley\u201d update, which aims to unify the design of the OS. However, as we can see, Windows is one behemoth of an operating system. Will their efforts to finally make a cohesive user experience succeed? Only time will tell.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 10:29:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "windows,windows-10", "title":

", "note_en": "When dabbling with the laws of motion in the 17th century, Isaac Newton first realized that it\u2019s indeed possible to send an object out of Earth, into space. As long as an object is shot away from Earth with a high enough velocity, it  will reach space and orbit our planet.\n With the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957 onboard a powerful rocket, the Soviet Union achieved exactly that. For the first time in four billion years of life on Earth, something was intentionally sent to space.\n  Give a satellite another speed boost, by either launching it on a more powerful rocket or using thrusters onboard, and it can escape from Earth\u2019s gravitational hold completely. That\u2019s how you can send missions to  Venus,  Mars,  Saturn and beyond. But one of these two things is not like the other.\n  The rocket equation is what allows scientists and engineers to quantify and compare the energy required to reach various destinations in space. Its implications are far-reaching but not intuitive so I shall attempt to explain them without use of any math.\n  The rocket equation tells us that the amount of energy a rocket must expend to go from the Earth\u2019s surface to an orbit 250 kilometers above, called low Earth orbit, is almost thrice as much as going from that low Earth orbit to the Moon! Likewise, getting to low Earth orbit costs twice as much energy than what is required to reach Mars from that same orbit. 1\n Even if we include the energy expenditure to land on the Moon instead of just reaching it from low Earth orbit, getting to Earth orbit itself turns out to be about 50% more expensive. In other words, attaining Earth orbit is the first and the most significant barrier to space exploration.\n  The giant leap for humanity was not stepping on the Moon but getting to Earth orbit.\n The rocket equation doesn\u2019t just dictate how much energy you must spend to reach various destinations in space but also if you can reach space at all.\n  The satellite is but a small fraction of the total mass of the rocket that lifts it and yet has an effect on the rocket itself. Therein lies the core problem of rocket science.\n Increasing the satellite\u2019s mass, to make it more useful perhaps, also means more rocket fuel is required to put the satellite in the desired orbit. But more fuel makes the system weigh more. This means some more fuel is required to launch the now-heavier system into space. As a thumb rule, fuel requirements increase  exponentially with every step increase in mass added to the satellite.\n This is how we end up with rockets being mostly fuel and then some metal. Even the mighty Saturn V that sent astronauts to the Moon was 85% fuel, 13% rocket\u2014including the rocket body, its plumbing and parts\u2014and the rest 2% being the Moonbound spacecraft with astronauts sitting inside!\n  At this point, if we were to make Earth more massive, a rocket would have to expend an enormous amount of energy against a more gruesome gravity well. More fuel would be required to get to space, and your rocket might be something akin to 9 times more fuel than metal. Increase Earth\u2019s mass further and the fuel-to-mass ratio would start  skyrocketing to a point where it\u2019s simply not possible to engineer such a near-all-fuel rocket!\n Crunching the numbers in this manner, it turns out that if the Earth was 50% more massive, you simply wouldn\u2019t be able to get to space even with the most energetic fuel combination\u2014liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen\u2014available in chemical rockets.\n Such a massive rocky planet is not imaginary, several of its kind exist. Of the over 4,000 planets around other stars we\u2019ve discovered to date in our galaxy, about a thousand are something scientists call \u2018Super Earths\u2019. These are planets which are up to 10 times more massive than Earth and up to twice as large. Beyond that limit, planets don\u2019t remain rocky and start turning into  Uranus- or  Neptune-like gas giants.\n  Many of these Super Earths lie in the respective habitable zones around their stars i.e. conditions there could support life as we know it. Given that we\u2019ve only searched a small fraction of our galaxy for planets, it\u2019s fair to say there could be millions of Super Earths, many of which could host life.\n If intelligent life were to develop on these Super Earths, they\u2019d have a hard time building rockets that get things off-planet. Since even the most energetic chemical rockets won\u2019t get them to space, they\u2019d be incentivized to build something with more thrust that can, like nuclear propulsion based rockets. These will likely be far more expensive than chemical rockets but sometimes nature doesn\u2019t give you a choice.\n  Just like the rocket equation makes it exponentially harder to get off a planet with added mass to the planet, it also makes it exponentially easier to get off objects with lesser gravity. Now if only we had an object less massive than Earth that is accessible and resourceful.\n  In order for humanity to survive and thrive long term, it makes sense to have a permanent human settlement on Mars as it offers us a relatively benign environment. Doing so would require sending hundreds to thousands of tons of material from Earth to the martian surface via dozens to hundreds of huge rocket launches. That\u2019s pretty much exactly what  SpaceX\u2019s Starship hopes to do. Here\u2019s where our celestial neighbor, the Moon, can make things better.\n The Moon has a much weaker gravity than Earth, allowing rockets to take off with ease. This was most notable during the Apollo missions, when even a spacecraft hosting two astronauts  could make its way to lunar orbit. Moreover, the Moon lies at the outer edge of Earth\u2019s gravity well, meaning it\u2019s easy to escape our planet\u2019s pull completely if launched from the Moon. Almost five times easier in fact.\n If we establish a vast, permanent settlement on the Moon first, we can eventually tap into its resources to launch rockets from the Moon itself. NASA and ISRO missions have discovered  plenty of water ice on the Moon\u2019s poles. It\u2019s possible that future human habitats built from mining the metal-rich lunar soil tap into this water ice for consumption needs. This water can also be split into hydrogen and oxygen for use as rocket fuel. Rockets taking off from an industrially enabled Moonbase can ride the lunar interplanetary highway to reach Mars more efficiently than from Earth.\n  Sure, it would be expensive to build an industrial Moonbase but if the goal is to expand sustainably into the solar system, we\u2019re playing the game on the scale of hundreds to thousands of years. In this large scheme of things, the Moon can be  the rocket platform to build and expand a sustainable Mars presence for much cheaper than an equivalent one done from Earth.\n The Moon\u2019s accessibility, low gravity barrier, and resource potential are the reason why its proponents vouch for a sustainable return to the Moon first rather than targeting Mars. As the saying within the lunar circles goes:\n     The Moon\u2019s advantages may extend to making homes for ourselves in the outer solar system as well. The rocket equation tells us that even if objects in the outer reaches of the solar system may be closer to Mars than the Moon, the more massive red planet\u2019s deeper gravity well means more energy is required to get out of it than to reach those destinations from there.\n Getting to the asteroid belt from the Moon\u2019s surface is at least 40% less energy demanding for a rocket than from Mars\u2019 surface\u2014even though Mars is about  75 million kilometers closer to the belt! This is the difference gravity makes, and which the rocket equation allows us to see. The Moon can accelerate expanding our settlements to these resource-rich asteroids. Some of these objects, like Ceres and Vesta, can in turn play the same role as the Moon can for Mars and the asteroid belt, and expand human settlements to moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond.\n  This finally brings us to the single most important takeaway from the rocket equation. The ability to extract and harness raw materials from low-gravity, resourceful space objects would free us from the tyranny of dragging everything out of Earth\u2019s gravitational pull.\n We cannot hope to be traveling among the stars if we don\u2019t even expand into the solar system in an Earth-independent way and avail for ourselves a much larger resource pool. In-space manufacturing and industrialization is not just a good-to-have but a fundamental requirement for  expansion into the solar system. Only then humanity will be in an adequate position to venture to the nearest star and hopefully do it  before the Sun doesn\u2019t shine.\n   This article was made possible thanks to\u00a0 Dr. Gordon Roesler and  Justin Alva supporting me on Patreon.\n   Like what you read?\u00a0All my articles are free, with no ads.\u00a0 Support me\u00a0to keep me going.\n  1 Technically, energy expenditure is not the same as delta-v, which is the actual measure of work required by rockets to reach different destinations.
