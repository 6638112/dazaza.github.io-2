After the redesign of a flight control system, the aircraft has been re-certified by the US FAA and EU EASA and is returning to the skies. Several US and international airlines have already returned their MAX aircraft to scheduled service with others to quickly follow.</p><p>737 MAX在几次坠机事故后被搁置至今已经快两年了。重新设计了飞行控制系统之后，该飞机已获得美国联邦航空局和欧盟EASA的重新认证，并正在重返天空。一些美国和国际航空公司已经将MAX飞机与其他飞机一起恢复了预定服务，以便快速跟进。</p><p>   One of the requirements for the return to service of this aircraft is that pilots undergo a training session in a simulator. The purpose of the sim ride is to familiarize pilots with the behavior and possible failure modes of various flight control and indication systems. The ride included demonstrations of the normal function of the speed trim system (STS) and Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) during a stall and failure scenarios of angle of attack (AOA) and airspeed indicators. Runaway stabilizer trim malfunctions and flight with manual trim were also included. Failures of the MCAS subsystem, which is unique to the MAX, were implicated as contributing causes in two crashes prior to the aircraft being grounded.</p><p>   该飞机恢复服务的要求之一是，飞行员必须在模拟器上接受训练。模拟飞行的目的是使飞行员熟悉各种飞行控制和指示系统的行为和可能的故障模式。这次飞行包括在失速和迎角（AOA）和空速指示器失速情况下的速度调整系统（STS）和操纵特性增强系统（MCAS）正常功能的演示。失控的稳定器饰板故障和手动饰板飞行也包括在内。 MAX所特有的MCAS子系统的故障是飞机着陆前两次坠机的成因。</p><p>   Preparation for the ride included an extensive computer based refresher course on MAX systems and procedures and a detailed pre-brief on the planned simulator training events. Flight in high fidelity flight simulators is considered equivalent to flight in an actual aircraft, but superior as a training device as many maneuvers and failure scenarios can not be safely accomplished in an aircraft. That said, the devices cost tens of millions of dollars and training time is scarce and valuable. My airline has procured nine MAX simulators for the purpose of re-qualifying all their pilots in as short a time as possible.</p><p>   这次骑行的准备工作包括针对MAX系统和程序的全面的基于计算机的复习课程，以及计划的模拟器培训活动的详细预告。高保真飞行模拟器中的飞行被认为等同于实际飞机中的飞行，但是作为训练设备更胜一筹，因为在飞机中无法安全地完成许多机动和故障情况。也就是说，这些设备耗资数千万美元，培训时间稀少且价值不菲。我的航空公司已购买了9台MAX模拟器，目的是在尽可能短的时间内重新验证其所有飞行员的资格。</p><p>    The events surrounding the grounding of the MAX center on the stabilizer trim system. I am going to attempt to keep my explanations in reach of a general audience with some basic understanding of the dynamics of flight. There are many online resources available for those who wish for a more in depth explanation of aerodynamics.</p><p>    MAX接地周围的事件以稳定器装饰系统为中心。我将通过对飞行动力学的一些基本了解，使我的解释保持在广大读者的理解范围内。有许多在线资源可供那些希望对空气动力学进行更深入说明的人使用。</p><p>  The horizontal wing on the tail of a conventional aircraft is known as the horizontal stabilizer (stab). The elevator is attached to the back of the horizontal stabilizer and is a primary flight control. It moves to change the pitch of the aircraft. The horizontal stabilizer itself also moves a bit to “trim” the aircraft for a particular airspeed. Change the speed of the aircraft, and the trim will need to be changed to prevent the pilot (or autopilot) from having to hold constant force on the controls. A pilot can release the controls of a well-trimmed aircraft without it wanting to climb or descend. This condition is also the most aerodynamically efficient configuration resulting in a smaller fuel burn.</p><p>  传统飞机尾翼上的水平机翼被称为水平稳定器（防撞）。电梯安装在水平稳定器的背面，是主要的飞行控制器。它移动以改变飞机的俯仰角。水平稳定器本身也会移动一点，以针对特定的空速“修剪”飞机。更改飞机的速度，将需要更改装饰条，以防止飞行员（或自动驾驶仪）必须在控件上保持恒定的力。飞行员可以释放经过精心修剪的飞机的控制，而无需爬升或下降。这种情况也是空气动力学效率最高的配置，可减少燃油消耗。</p><p>   On the 737, stab trim is normally controlled electrically by switches on the control column which are activated with the thumb. The switches (two for redundancy) control an electric motor which spins a large wheel next to the pilot’s knee on the center stand. This wheel is mechanically connected to a jack screw which physically moves the stab. The motor has two speeds determined by flap position. The slow speed is used for flaps up and the fast speed activates when the flaps are extended. This wheel also serves as a manual crank to be used if the electric motor fails. Accidentally leaving the crank handle extended is a self-critiquing error as the handle hurts like heck when it hits your knee (so I’ve been told).</p><p>   在737上，防刺装置通常由控制柱上的开关（通过拇指激活）进行电控。开关（其中两个用于冗余）控制着一个电动机，该电动机使中心支架上飞行员膝盖旁边的一个大轮子旋转。该轮机械地连接至顶起螺钉，顶起螺钉物理地移动刺刀。马达有两个速度，取决于襟翼位置。当襟翼伸展时，低速用于襟翼上升，而快速度被激活。如果电动机发生故障，该轮还可以用作手动曲柄。意外地将曲柄手柄伸开是一个自责错误，因为手柄在碰到膝盖时会像he地一样疼（所以有人告诉我）。</p><p>  It is impossible to miss this wheel turning as it has stripes painted on it. While flying manually (without the autopilot), the pilot will use the thumb switches to activate the electric trim, but when the autopilot is engaged, the autopilot keeps the aircraft in trim using the same system. Therefore, the trim wheel will be seen moving on occasion in automatic flight as the autopilot adjusts the trim.</p><p>  不可能错过这个车轮转弯，因为上面涂有条纹。在手动飞行（没有自动驾驶仪）时，飞行员将使用指拨开关激活电动内饰，但是当使用自动驾驶仪时，自动驾驶仪将使用同一系统将飞机保持在内饰状态。因此，自动驾驶仪会在自动飞行中调整配平时，偶尔会看到配平轮在移动。 </p><p>   Starting in the 80s on the “Classic” version of the 737 (models 300 through 500), Boeing introduced a trim subsystem known as “speed trim”. Speed trim would operate in manual flight under certain conditions should the aircraft deviate from the trimmed airspeed. As mentioned above, trim correlates to airspeed. This system would make trim inputs in opposition to any speed deviation to encourage a return to the originally trimmed airspeed. The important thing to note here is that the trim wheel might now be seen moving in manual flight un-commanded by the pilot.</p><p>从80年代开始，737的“经典”版本（型号300至500）开始使用，波音公司引入了一种称为“速度调整”的调整子系统。如果飞机偏离调整后的空速，则在某些情况下，速度调整将在手动飞行中进行。如上所述，微调与空速相关。该系统将与任何速度偏差相反地进行微调输入，以鼓励返回到最初微调的空速。这里要注意的重要一点是，现在可以看到装饰轮在飞行员未命令的情况下以手动飞行运动。</p><p>    MCAS or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, is another trim subsystem which was introduced on the MAX aircraft. It was found during certification of the MAX that the aircraft had some unwanted handling characteristics when approaching a stall. Specifically, just before stall entry, and well below any normally encountered airspeed, control column pitch forces became lighter when they are required by certification rules to become heavier. MCAS was designed to run the trim forward under these specific conditions to counter this tendency. It uses the high speed rate of the trim motor regardless of flap position.</p><p>    MCAS或机动特性增强系统是MAX飞机上引入的另一个配平子系统。在MAX的认证过程中，发现飞机接近失速时有一些不良的操纵特性。特别是，在失速进入之前且远低于任何正常遇到的空速时，当认证规则要求控制柱变桨力变大时，控制柱变桨力变轻。 MCAS旨在在这些特定条件下向前进行调整以应对这种趋势。无论襟翼位置如何，它都会使用微调电机的高转速。</p><p>  Why did the MAX handle differently than its predecessors? The aerodynamics is complex, but the larger engines on the MAX had to be placed further forward on the wing to ensure ground clearance. This and other design factors likely caused the handling differences. This is the source of some controversy about whether the MAX should have been given a separate type certificate, but reviewing that subject is not the purpose of this report.</p><p>  为什么MAX处理的方式与前代有所不同？空气动力学很复杂，但是MAX上的大型发动机必须放在机翼的更前方，以确保离地间隙。此设计因素和其他设计因素可能导致处理方面的差异。这是关于是否应该为MAX授予单独的类型证书的一些争议的源头，但是复查该主题不是本报告的目的。</p><p>  One point I’d like to make about flight control augmentation systems in general is that they are ubiquitous and date back to the 1950s. The existence of an augmentation system does not ipso facto indict the underlying design, but rather is an engineering solution that enhances the flight characteristics of nearly all modern high performance aircraft. I have experience flying aircraft which were virtually un-flyable without augmentation. Even fly-by-wire aircraft flight control systems, which are common today, can be thought of as augmentation systems with 100% control authority.</p><p>  我想对飞行控制增强系统进行总体说明，这一点无处不在，其历史可以追溯到1950年代。增强系统的存在实际上并不指示基础设计，而是一种工程解决方案，可增强几乎所有现代高性能飞机的飞行特性。我有飞行过的飞机的经验，这些飞机在不增加的情况下几乎无法飞行。即使是如今很常见的电传飞机飞行控制系统，也可以被视为具有100％控制权限的增强系统。</p><p> Lastly, the most important part of the entire electric stab trim system is that it can be deactivated at any time through the use of two stab trim cutout switches located on the center stand directly behind the throttles. These switches remove power from the electric trim system and all subsystems including speed trim, autopilot trim, and MCAS. Following deactivation, the aircraft can still be trimmed by manually cranking the trim wheel.</p><p> 最后，整个电动防刺系统的最重要部分是可以通过使用位于油门正后方的中央支架上的两个防刺开关来随时将其停用。这些开关可切断电动微调系统和所有子系统的电源，包括速度微调，自动驾驶仪微调和MCAS。停用后，仍然可以通过手动摇动尾轮来对飞机进行修剪。</p><p>   The simulator session was scheduled for a two hour training event preceded by a one hour pre-brief. The session was designed to cover both normal and non-normal flight profiles. The normal profile included a demonstration of the speed trim system on a routine departure and the expected annunciations and flight control behavior during an approach to stall.</p><p>   模拟器课程安排为两个小时的培训活动，然后是一个小时的简短预告。该会议旨在涵盖正常和非正常飞行情况。正常状况包括例行起飞时的速度调整系统演示，以及在进近失速期间的预期通告和飞行控制行为。</p><p>  The non-normal profiles demonstrated trim system failures and angle of attack (AOA) and airspeed indicator failures. The trim system failures included the use of the Runaway Stabilizer non-normal checklist and immediate action items, and subsequent flight using only manual trim. The AOA and airspeed failure profiles were designed to replicate the startle effect and confusion that can manifest from multiple annunciations and aural warnings during this type of malfunction. Subsequent use of the Airspeed Unreliable non-normal checklist and known pitch and power settings were required.</p><p>  非正常剖面显示了微调系统故障，迎角（AOA）和空速指示器故障。修剪系统故障包括使用失控稳定器非正常检查清单和立即采取的措施，以及随后仅使用手动修剪进行的飞行。 AOA和空速失灵曲线的设计旨在复制这种类型的故障期间，可能会因多次通知和听觉警告而表现出惊吓效应和困惑。随后需要使用“空速不可靠”非正常检查清单以及已知的螺距和功率设置。 </p><p> The simulator used was a CAE 7000XR series high fidelity simulator with full motion and daylight wrap-around visuals. All of the training events were flown from SeaTac airport in VFR conditions. The sim was initialized for takeoff on RWY 16L with all preflight items having been accomplished. I was paired with a line first officer for the training event.</p><p>所使用的模拟器是具有完整运动和日光环绕视觉效果的CAE 7000XR系列高保真模拟器。所有培训活动都是在VFR条件下从SeaTac机场起飞的。 sim卡已初始化为在RWY 16L上起飞，且所有飞行前项目均已完成。我与一线警务人员结对参加培训活动。</p><p>   A normal takeoff and RNAV departure to 10,000 ft were accomplished. During the climb in manual flight, deviations from trimmed flight were purposely introduced through the use of increased or decreased pitch inputs on the control column. The speed trim system was then observed to make trim inputs opposite of the speed deviations to encourage the aircraft to return to its originally trimmed airspeed. Once the originally trimmed airspeed was re-achieved, the speed trim inputs were automatically removed by the system.</p><p>   正常起飞，RNAV起飞至10,000英尺。在手动飞行的爬升过程中，通过在控制柱上使用增加或减小的俯仰输入来故意引入与平飞偏离的偏差。然后观察到速度调整系统做出与速度偏差相反的调整输入，以鼓励飞机返回其原始调整后的空速。重新达到最初调整的空速后，系统会自动删除速度调整输入。</p><p> The speed trim inputs were accomplished by the slow rate of the trim motor as the flaps were already up. The effect of these inputs was subtle and easily overridden if needed.</p><p> 速度微调输入由襟翼已经抬起的微调电机的慢速完成。这些输入的影响是微妙的，如果需要，可以很容易地忽略。</p><p>   After level off, we each were directed to pull the power to idle but to maintain altitude in manual flight through pitch control to observe the annunciations and flight control behavior during a stall. The approach to stall maneuver has been a staple of airline training for many years, but typically the maneuver would terminate with the activation of the stick shaker stall warning followed by a recovery. It was felt that exploring actual stall characteristics was unneeded and possibly negative training as this situation would never theoretically materialize in actual line operations. A recovery would always be made upon the activation of the stick shaker.</p><p>   降平后，我们每个人都被指示将动力拉至怠速状态，但要通过俯仰控制在手动飞行中保持高度，以观察失速期间的提示和飞行控制行为。失速操纵的方法已成为航空公司培训的主要内容，但通常该操纵会随着操纵杆振动筛失速警告的激活而终止并随后恢复。有人认为，不需要研究实际的失速特性，并且可能是负面的培训，因为从理论上讲，这种情况在实际的生产线操作中永远不会实现。始终在操纵杆振动器上进行恢复。</p><p>  In the aftermath of the Colgan and some other crashes which served to highlight concern about deficiencies in manual flight skills, the FAA introduced extended envelope training (EET). This training went beyond traditional airline flight training to explore flight handling characteristics in areas of the flight envelope that would never be expected to be seen in line flying. The new thinking was that having some experience in these unusual situations might be of use in case one ever developed.</p><p>  在科尔干（Colgan）和其他一些坠机事故的后果之后，美国航空局引入了扩展包络线训练（EET），这突显了人们对手动飞行技能不足的担忧。该培训超越了传统的航空公司飞行培训，旨在探索在航线飞行中永远不会出现的包络区域的飞行操纵特性。新的想法是，在一个不寻常的情况下，拥有一些在这些异常情况下的经验可能会有用。</p><p> We were asked to make nose up trim inputs down to the lowest flaps up maneuver speed and afterward to continue to maintain altitude through control column pressure alone. A number of visual and aural alerts displayed and sounded as airspeed continued to decrease. The aural “Airspeed Low” alert sounded followed by the “Buffet Alert” FMC advisory message. The pitch limit indication appeared showing that we were within 5 degrees angle of attack to stick shaker activation. The stick shaker activated upon reaching the airspeed where natural stall warning buffet is computed to commence by the stall warning yaw damper (SWYD) computer.</p><p> 我们被要求将机头向上调整输入降低到最低的襟翼操纵速度，然后仅通过控制柱压力继续保持高度。随着空速的持续降低，显示并发出了许多视觉和听觉警报。发出声音“空速不足”警报，然后发出“自助警报” FMC咨询消息。出现音高极限指示，表明我们在摇杆振动的迎角处于5度以内。达到空速时操纵的摇杆振动器，由失速警告偏航阻尼器（SWYD）计算机计算出自然失速警告自助餐的开始时间。</p><p>  During this demonstration, rearward control column forces continued to increase. As airspeed decreased below minimum maneuver speed, the speed trim High AOA mode activated thereby adding nose down trim at the slow rate of speed (because the flaps were retracted). This served to increase the necessary force to maintain altitude. Note that the high AOA speed trim feature is not unique to the MAX, but is included on older 737 models.</p><p>  在演示过程中，后控制柱的力量持续增加。当空速降到最低机动速度以下时，高速度AOA模式被激活，从而以较低的速度增加机头向下修整（因为襟翼已缩回）。这有助于增加维持高度所需的力量。请注意，高AOA速度修整功能并非MAX独有，但较旧的737机型已包含。 </p><p> Eventually, the trim wheel made an abrupt twitch forward at the high rate, but only for a fraction of a turn. This, our instructor told us, was the MCAS system becoming active or “waking up”. What was happening behind the scene was the MCAS logic took a “snapshot” of the existing trim position when its threshold AOA was reached. It then calculated a maximum amount of trim that could be added. Should the trim ever meet this computed limit, the speed trim and MCAS system becomes inhibited for the remainder of the flight. A short time later, MCAS activated adding additional nose down trim at the high rate of trim motor speed. The control forces were now heavier, but still manageable.</p><p>最终，装饰轮以高速率突然向前抽动，但仅转了一小部分。我们的讲师告诉我们，这是MCAS系统处于活动状态或“醒来”的时候。幕后发生的事情是，当达到其阈值AOA时，MCAS逻辑对现有修剪位置进行了“快照”。然后，计算出可以添加的最大修剪量。如果纵倾达到此计算的极限，则在其余飞行中，速度纵倾和MCAS系统将被禁止。不久之后，MCAS启动，以高修整马达速度增加了额外的机头向下修整。现在的控制力量较重，但仍可控制。</p><p>  Finally, the Elevator Feel Shift (EFS) module increased the system ‘A’ hydraulic pressure to the elevator feel and centering unit as the AOA approached its stall value. The elevator feel and centering unit is how any elevator force is transmitted to the pilots through the control column. Changes in trim go through this unit before they are felt by the pilot. This hydraulic pressure increase dramatically increases forward pressure on the controls and felt like someone was trying to jerk the controls out of my hands. Again, it should be noted that the EFS module is not unique to the MAX but is also included on earlier 737 models.</p><p>  最后，随着AOA接近其失速值，电梯感觉转换（EFS）模块将系统“ A”液压增加到电梯的手感和对中单元。电梯感觉和对中单元是如何将任何电梯力通过控制柱传递给飞行员的。内饰的变化会在飞行员感觉到之前通过本机。液压压力的增加极大地增加了控件上的向前压力，感觉就像有人试图将控件从我手中移开。同样，应该注意的是，EFS模块并非MAX所独有，但也包含在早期的737型号中。</p><p>  At this point the aircraft was in a full stall with strong buffet being felt. The controls could still be held aft, but only with two hands on the yoke and significant effort. We were then instructed to release back pressure and to let the aircraft recover and accelerate. The aircraft recovered quickly. The inputs previously made by MCAS and speed trim were automatically removed as airspeed increased and AOA decreased.</p><p>  此时，飞机已经完全失速，感觉到强烈的自助餐。仍然可以将控制装置保持在船尾，但只有两只手在操纵架上并且需要很大的努力。然后，我们被指示释放背压，让飞机恢复和加速。飞机很快就恢复了。随着空速的增加和AOA的减小，MCAS先前输入的信息和速度调整将自动删除。</p><p> This was the end of the demonstration. Both of us ran through this event several times so that we were familiar with the sequence of alerts and flight control inputs. 737 stall behavior is benign with no significant roll or wing drop being noted. Recovery was prompt with back pressure release and flying airspeed was quickly reestablished.</p><p> 演示到此结束。我们俩都多次执行了此事件，因此我们熟悉了警报和飞行控制输入的顺序。 737失速行为是良性的，没有发现明显的侧倾或机翼下降。背压释放迅速恢复，迅速恢复了空速。</p><p>   All aircraft with a powered trim system are subject to a condition known as runaway trim. Recall that elevator trim repositions the horizontal stabilizer in order to “trim” the aircraft to a particular airspeed. When properly trimmed, elevator stick forces are minimized. “Trim to relieve stick pressure” was the mantra when I was in USAF pilot training in 1982. It is still true.</p><p>   所有带有动力修剪系统的飞机都会受到失控修剪的影响。回想一下，升降机装饰板将水平稳定器重新定位，以便将飞机“修剪”到特定的空速。正确修整后，电梯操纵杆力将降至最低。 1982年我在美国空军进行飞行员训练时，口头禅是“缓解粘滞压力”。现在仍然如此。</p><p> The converse that a badly untrimmed aircraft is difficult or impossible to fly is also true. An inoperative trim system is sub-optimal, but one that continues to trim after the trim switch is released, or trims on its own can quickly create a dangerous situation. Stick forces will quickly become so unmanageable that continued controlled flight is not possible. This may manifest as either nose down or nose up trim. Neither is good.</p><p> 相反的事实是，严重失调的飞机很难或不可能飞行。无效的修剪系统不是最佳选择，但是在释放修剪开关后继续修剪的系统，或者自行修剪会很快造成危险情况。操纵杆力将很快变得难以控制，以致无法继续进行受控飞行。这可能表现为鼻子向下或鼻子向上修剪。都不是好事。</p><p> Fortunately, Boeing has always included a non-normal checklist (NNC) to address runaway trim. If correctly followed, this checklist will result in the runaway trim malfunction being corrected, or the electric trim system being deactivated. Recall that the electric system, including speed trim, autopilot trim, and MCAS, has always been able to be deactivated through the use of the stab trim cutout switches located on the center stand.</p><p> 幸运的是，波音公司始终包括非正常检查清单（NNC），以解决失控的情况。如果正确遵循此检查表，则将导致失控的内饰故障得到纠正，或者电动内饰系统被停用。回想一下，始终可以通过使用位于中央支架上的止动微调开关来关闭电气系统，包括速度微调，自动驾驶仪微调和MCAS。 </p><p> Our demonstration started with the instructor introducing a runaway nose down rapid rate trim malfunction. The most important step of any non-normal event in an aircraft is identifying the malfunction correctly and then applying the correct non-normal checklist. Many an accident has been the result of a wrong assessment of the problem or the application of the wrong checklist.</p><p>我们的演示始于讲师介绍了失控的机头下降，快速修整故障。飞机上任何非正常事件的最重要步骤是正确识别故障，然后应用正确的非正常检查表。许多事故是由于对问题的错误评估或对错误清单的应用导致的。</p><p> Recall that it is now normal for the trim wheel to spin un-commanded by the pilot in manual flight due to inputs by either the speed trim system or MCAS. Since the flaps were up and the aircraft was not in a stall situation, the fast rate trim activation immediately telegraphed a malfunction.This is how an MCAS malfunction might present along with some nuisance alerts. At this point, accomplishing the immediate action items (IAIs) of the Runaway Trim checklist on the Quick Reference Card (QRC) followed by the remaining steps listed in the Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) left us in a situation with the aircraft in manual flight with the electric trim disconnected by the stab trim cutout switches.</p><p> 回想一下，由于速度微调系统或MCAS的输入，在手动飞行中，微调轮在飞行员未命令的情况下旋转是正常的。由于襟翼已升起且飞机未处于失速状态，因此快速修整功能立即显示出故障，这就是MCAS可能出现故障以及一些令人讨厌的警报的方式。此时，完成快速参考卡（QRC）上失控修剪清单的即时操作项目（IAIs），然后完成快速参考手册（QRH）中列出的其余步骤，使我们处于飞机手动飞行的情况下电动装饰通过防刺装饰开关断开。</p><p> Immediate action items are steps on a non-normal checklist that must be performed from memory due to their urgent nature. The Runaway Trim checklist contains several of these steps which include disengaging the autopilot and autothrottles, controlling aircraft pitch and airspeed, and disconnecting the stab trim cutout switches if necessary. This checklist has remained largely unchanged over the many different models of the 737.</p><p> 立即行动项目是非正常清单上的步骤，由于其紧急性质，必须从内存中执行。 “失控修剪”清单包含其中几个步骤，其中包括使自动驾驶仪和自动油门脱离接合，控制飞机的俯仰和空速以及在必要时断开防刺装置的保险开关。在737的许多不同型号上，此清单基本上保持不变。</p><p> At this point, the aircraft had to be flown and trimmed manually using the trim wheel. There is a note in the checklist which emphasizes that reducing airspeed helps to relieve the air loads on the stabilizer which reduces the efforts needed to manually trim. Our malfunction was introduced at about 250 knots. Manual trim at this speed took some effort, but was easily achieved. Slowing to 210 kts allowed the flying pilot to easily fly and trim without assistance from the non-flying pilot.</p><p> 此时，必须使用装饰轮手动飞行和修剪飞机。清单中有一条注释强调，降低空速有助于减轻稳定器上的空气负荷，从而减少了手动调整所需的工作量。我们的故障以大约250节的速度被引入。以这种速度进行手动修整需要一些努力，但很容易实现。速度降至210 kts，使飞行飞行员可以轻松飞行和调整，而无需非飞行飞行员的帮助。</p><p> Close crew coordination is of course required to split the duties of trimming and flying depending upon the situation. Flight in instrument conditions might require the flying pilot to direct the non-flying pilot to manipulate the trim. Instructive to me was the ease with which trim changes through the configuration process were able to be made. We were directed to go around on short final to see the trim changes needed for that maneuver. Using less than full power for the go-around made the maneuver very smooth and controllable.</p><p> 当然，需要根据情况密切协调机组人员，以分担修剪和飞行的职责。在仪表状态下飞行可能需要飞行飞行员指挥非飞行飞行员操纵修剪。对我来说，很容易进行配置过程中的修整更改。我们被指示去参加简短的决赛，以了解该演习所需的内饰变化。使用不到全部动力的复飞操作非常平稳且可控。</p><p>  One of the most disconcerting and dangerous malfunctions any pilot can face is the loss of reliable airspeed. Airspeed is the oxygen of controlled flight, and loss of reliable airspeed must be quickly recognized and corrected or ameliorated for a successful outcome. The importance of this instrument is why there is a lot of redundancy built in. The 737 has two primary and one auxiliary pitot probes used to measure dynamic air pressure which is then converted to airspeed measurement for the pilot’s primary airspeed indicators along with an auxiliary airspeed indicator.</p><p>  任何飞行员可能面临的最令人不安和危险的故障之一就是可靠的空速损失。空速是受控飞行的氧气，必须迅速识别和纠正或改善可靠空速的损失，以取得成功的结果。该仪器的重要性在于内置大量冗余的原因。737飞机有两个主要和一个辅助皮托管探头，用于测量动态气压，然后将其转换为飞行员的主要空速指示器以及辅助空速的空速测量值指示符。</p><p> In addition to the direct measurement of airspeed, the 737 has displays of groundspeed derived from the air data inertial reference unit (ADIRU). While airspeed and groundspeed are not the same, at low altitudes, they are close enough to be useful.</p><p> 除了直接测量空速之外，737还显示了从空中数据惯性基准单元（ADIRU）得出的地面速度。虽然空速和地面速度不一样，但在低空时，它们足够接近以至于有用。 </p><p> Our demonstration simulated a bird strike or similar damage on takeoff which disabled the captain’s alpha vane AOA transmitter though we were not informed of this beforehand. Immediately after rotation, a cacophony of alerts sounded accompanied by numerous messages on the displays. The indications included AOA Disagree, ALT Disagree, IAS Disagree, Speed Trim Fail, Feel Diff Press, along with erroneous airspeed, altitude, and flight director indications. The stick shaker sounded and did not cease for the entire demonstration.</p><p>我们的演示模拟了起飞时的鸟击或类似损坏，使机长的Alpha叶片AOA发射器失效，尽管我们事先未获悉。旋转后立即发出响亮的警报声，并在显示屏上显示大量消息。这些指示包括AOA不同意，ALT不同意，IAS不同意，速度修整失败，感觉差压，以及错误的空速，高度和飞行方向指示。摇杆摇了起来，整个演示并没有停止。</p><p> As I mentioned above, the most important thing in any non-normal situation is to recognize what has failed and more importantly, what has not failed. A quick scan of the first officer’s and auxiliary airspeed indicators told us that it was my instruments that had failed as the other two instruments were in agreement. I transferred control of the aircraft to the first officer who continued the climbout as I then referenced the Unreliable Airspeed checklist.</p><p> 如上所述，在任何非正常情况下，最重要的是识别失败的内容，更重要的是，确认没有失败的内容。快速扫描副驾驶的空速和辅助飞行指示器，告诉我们，正是我的仪表出现故障，因为其他两个仪表都达成了一致。我将飞机的控制权交给了继续进行爬升的副驾驶，然后我参考了“不可靠的空速”清单。</p><p> This checklist is fairly straightforward directing the autopilot and autothrottles to be disengaged if engaged. The flight directors are not to be used as they may also give erroneous information, and lastly for complete airspeed failure, some known pitch and power settings are given which are calculated to keep the aircraft from stalling or overspeeding.</p><p> 该清单非常简单，指示自动驾驶仪和自动油门在接合时要脱离。不要使用飞行控制器，因为它们也可能会提供错误的信息，最后，对于完全的空速故障，给出了一些已知的俯仰和功率设置，这些设置可以防止飞机失速或超速。</p><p> We explored setting these values to see the performance of the aircraft with flaps both retracted and extended. The checklist values will keep the aircraft safe until a more detailed chart in the quick reference handbook, which uses aircraft weight, altitude, and phase of flight to set pitch and power, can be referenced.</p><p> 我们探索了设置这些值的方法，以查看襟翼缩回和伸展的飞机性能。清单值将确保飞机安全，直到可以参考快速参考手册中更详细的图表为止，该手册使用飞机的重量，高度和飞行阶段来设置俯仰和功率。</p><p> Since our situation resulted in useable airspeed indications for the first officer, returning the aircraft to the airport was a matter of accounting for the nuisance stick shaker and other alerts, accomplishing the appropriate checklists and landing. We had been advised to bring ear protection for this segment, and it was worthwhile advice.</p><p> 由于我们的情况导致了副驾驶可用的空速指示，因此将飞机返回机场需要考虑烦人的摇床和其他警报，并完成适当的检查清单并着陆。有人建议我们为这一部分提供耳保护，这是值得建议的。</p><p>  The changes made to the MAX center around added redundancy to the Speed Trim System (including MCAS), and the Flight Control Computer. Input is now used from both AOA vanes and compared before being routed to the MCAS system. Previously, MCAS received input from only one AOA vane. A difference between input values from the two sensors will inhibit the system. New logic has been added which limit</p><p>  对MAX所做的更改集中在为速度调整系统（包括MCAS）和飞行控制计算机增加了冗余方面。现在可以同时使用两个AOA叶片的输入，并在将其路由到MCAS系统之前进行比较。以前，MCAS仅从一个AOA叶片接收输入。来自两个传感器的输入值之间的差异将抑制系统。添加了新逻辑，该逻辑限制</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.avgeekery.com/pilot-report-my-737-max-simulator-ride/">https://www.avgeekery.com/pilot-report-my-737-max-simulator-ride/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/simulator/">#simulator</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/飞行/">#飞行</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
