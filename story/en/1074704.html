This essay describes a conversation I had in 2017 with one of those advisees. I will call him Daniel.</p><p>在我任教的美国大学，我的一项任务是为本科生（主要是大一和大二）提供建议。这篇文章描述了我在2017年与其中一位顾问的对话。我会叫他丹尼尔。</p><p> Daniel was a sophomore at the time. He had been an advisee of mine for a year already, and I’d come to understand that he was a prodigy. I’d also formed a hypothesis, based on a certain bluntness and lack of social tact he exhibited, that Daniel might be on the autism/Asperger’s spectrum. He seemed weak on interpersonal skills and narrowly, even obsessively, focused on math and science. During his first year of university studies, Daniel had taken a number of upper-level math and physics courses that none of my other advisees had taken, and had earned flat As in almost all of them. His GPA probably would have been a perfect 4.0 if the university had allowed him to take  only math and science courses. As it was, it was a 3.85.</p><p>丹尼尔当时是大二学生。他当我的顾问已经一年了，我逐渐明白他是个神童。基于丹尼尔表现出的某种直率和缺乏社交技巧，我还形成了一个假设，即丹尼尔可能属于自闭症/阿斯伯格综合症。他似乎在人际交往能力方面很弱，并且狭隘地、甚至痴迷地专注于数学和科学。在大学学习的第一年里，丹尼尔修了许多我的其他顾问都没有修过的高级数学和物理课程，而且几乎所有课程的成绩都一样。如果学校只允许他选修数学和科学课程，他的平均绩点可能会达到完美的4.0。实际上是3.85。</p><p> At the end of his freshman year, Daniel applied for admission to a competitive honors program that our university runs, but he was rejected. He came to my office to discuss this—or, rather, to complain about it. I soon realized that he was not just disappointed; he was angry. Daniel believed he’d been treated unfairly. He believed he was the victim of reverse racism.</p><p>大学一年级结束时，丹尼尔申请了我们学校开办的一个竞争性荣誉项目，但他被拒绝了。他来我办公室讨论这件事，或者说是抱怨这件事。我很快意识到他不仅仅是失望；他很生气。丹尼尔认为他受到了不公平的对待。他认为自己是反向种族主义的受害者。</p><p> I told Daniel that I understood why he was upset, but I reminded him that the program he’d applied to is highly competitive. The admissions committee presumably received many strong applications. There is always some subjectivity in admissions decisions, I noted, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Subjectivity isn’t the same as unfairness.</p><p>我告诉丹尼尔，我理解他为什么不高兴，但我提醒他，他申请的项目竞争激烈。招生委员会大概收到了许多强有力的申请。我注意到，录取决定总是有一些主观性，但这不一定是坏事。主观性和不公平是不同的。</p><p> Daniel said he wouldn’t be upset if he believed that the applicants who’d been admitted to the program were as strong as him, or stronger. But he said he had reason to believe they were not.</p><p>丹尼尔说，如果他相信被录取的申请者和他一样强壮，或者更强壮，他不会感到不安。但他说他有理由相信他们不是。</p><p> I asked him what he meant by that. He then pulled a laptop out of his backpack and opened up a spreadsheet.</p><p>我问他那是什么意思。然后他从背包里拿出一台笔记本电脑，打开了一个电子表格。</p><p> Daniel proceeded to explain that he and a friend had both applied to the same honors program and had both been rejected. Afterwards, they wondered who had been accepted. They scrutinized the social-media accounts of fellow students and found several dozen applicants who’d posted about being accepted. A lot of them, they noticed, were either African American or Hispanic. Daniel and his friend then asked around and identified several dozen students who had been rejected, many of whom were Caucasian or Asian. This made Daniel and his friend suspicious. They decided to create a spreadsheet—the one Daniel was showing me—to organize the data they’d collected; and then they decided to gather more.</p><p>丹尼尔接着解释说，他和一个朋友都申请了同一个荣誉项目，但都被拒绝了。后来，他们想知道谁被录取了。他们仔细检查了同学们在社交媒体上的账号，发现有几十位申请者发了关于被录取的帖子。他们注意到，他们中的很多人要么是非裔美国人，要么是西班牙裔。丹尼尔和他的朋友随后四处打听，确认了几十名被拒绝的学生，其中许多是白种人或亚洲人。这让丹尼尔和他的朋友产生了怀疑。他们决定创建一个电子表格——丹尼尔给我看的那个，用来组织他们收集的数据；然后他们决定收集更多。</p><p> Daniel explained that he and his friend wanted to find a measure of academic achievement that they could track statistically. A student’s GPA is not public information, but the Dean’s List  is; so they were able to use that as a discrete variable—Dean’s List, yes or no—as a rough proxy for achievement. Daniel explained to me that it would have been better to use a continuous variable (like GPA), but he and his friend had to work with what they had.</p><p>丹尼尔解释说，他和他的朋友想找到一个衡量学术成就的指标，他们可以从统计学上进行跟踪。学生的GPA不是公开信息，但院长的名单是；因此，他们能够将其作为离散变量迪恩列表，是或否作为成就的粗略代表。丹尼尔向我解释说，使用一个连续变量（比如GPA）会更好，但他和他的朋友必须使用他们所拥有的。</p><p> Daniel explained that he and his friend had performed various kinds of statistical analysis on the data, and had concluded that admission to the honors program was closely related to Dean’s List status  within certain groups. However, there were large differences in acceptance rates  across those groups. Overall, he told me, the factor that explained the most variance in admissions outcomes was (as he’d suspected) the race or ethnicity of the applicant. The patterns were quite stark. African Americans who weren’t on the Dean’s List had a better overall chance of being admitted to the honors program than whites or Asians who  were on the Dean’s List.</p><p>丹尼尔解释说，他和他的朋友对数据进行了各种统计分析，并得出结论，荣誉项目的录取与院长在某些群体中的名单地位密切相关。然而，这些群体的接受率有很大差异。他告诉我，总体而言，解释入学结果差异最大的因素是（正如他所怀疑的）申请人的种族或民族。这些图案非常鲜明。与院长名单上的白人或亚洲人相比，不在院长名单上的非裔美国人有更好的机会被荣誉项目录取。</p><p>  Daniel went on talking. He told me he was thinking of filing a protest with the admissions committee and challenging them with the data he’d gathered. He was also thinking about sending his data to the university newspaper as a way of exposing the unfairness of the committee’s decisions.</p><p>丹尼尔继续说。他告诉我，他正在考虑向招生委员会提出抗议，并用他收集的数据向他们提出挑战。他还考虑将自己的数据发送给校报，以揭露委员会决定的不公平性。</p><p> As I listened, I began to think about what I might tell Daniel once he stopped talking.</p><p>当我听着的时候，我开始思考一旦丹尼尔停止说话，我可能会告诉他什么。</p><p> Should I tell him what I thought—that he might well be right about why he was not admitted to the honors program?</p><p>我是否应该告诉他我认为他可能是对的，为什么他没有被荣誉项目录取？</p><p> Should I tell him that I had heard some talk among the faculty that seemed to confirm his suspicions? A few months earlier, I’d heard a dean saying that the honors program was too “traditional” in its make-up. What the university needed to do, this dean said, was “make the program look more like America as a whole.” Having been in academia for several years, I had a pretty good idea what that might mean.</p><p>我是否应该告诉他，我在教员中听到的一些谈话似乎证实了他的怀疑？几个月前，我听到一位院长说荣誉项目的组成过于“传统”。这位院长说，这所大学需要做的是“让这个项目看起来更像整个美国”在学术界工作了几年后，我对这可能意味着什么有了一个相当好的想法。</p><p> Should I try to make the case for affirmative action, explaining that the policies are well-intentioned and designed to make up for real injustices, including slavery, segregation, and racism?</p><p>我是否应该尝试提出平权行动的理由，解释这些政策是善意的，旨在弥补真正的不公正，包括奴隶制、种族隔离和种族主义？</p><p> Should I tell Daniel that sometimes in life one just has to accept this kind of unfortunate outcome as part of a larger process of social transformation?</p><p>我是否应该告诉丹尼尔，在生活中，有时一个人不得不接受这种不幸的结果，作为更大的社会转型过程的一部分？</p><p> Should I introduce him to the concept of “taking one for the team”?</p><p>我应该向他介绍“为团队拿一个”的概念吗？</p><p>  Should I tell him about the time when I applied for an internal position at our university, only to learn that it was actually a “targeted” search? I came to understand that the faculty members doing the hiring were determined to hire a candidate from an under-represented minority. This meant that I, as a white male, had almost no chance of being selected.</p><p>我是否应该告诉他我申请我们大学内部职位时，却发现这实际上是一个“有针对性的”搜索？我开始了解到，从事招聘工作的教职员工决心从代表人数不足的少数族裔中招聘一名候选人。这意味着，作为一名白人男性，我几乎没有被选中的机会。</p><p> Should I tell Daniel about the time when I interviewed with a small college, and the woman I was interviewing with came right out and told me that she and her colleagues were really hoping to hire an African-American candidate—but, unfortunately, there were not all that many African-American candidates in the applicant pool, so she wasn’t convinced that her school would be able to achieve this goal?</p><p>我应该告诉丹尼尔我在一所小型大学面试时的经历吗？我面试的那位女士直接出来告诉我，她和她的同事真的希望雇用一名非裔美国人候选人，但不幸的是，申请者中没有那么多非裔美国人候选人，所以她不相信她的学校能够实现这个目标？</p><p> Should I tell him about what happened afterwards, when I spoke to some other graduate students about this interview? One of the graduate students said that what the interviewer had done was wrong: she shouldn’t have said what she did.</p><p>当我和其他一些研究生谈论这次面试时，我应该告诉他后来发生了什么吗？其中一名研究生说面试官的做法是错误的：她不应该说出自己的所作所为。</p><p> Wait a minute, I said. What is it that upsets you about this whole thing? Are you upset that the committee members are so focused on the race of the applicants? Or are you upset that this woman was honest enough to tell me the truth? (That turned out to be an awkward conversation.)</p><p>等一下，我说。这整件事让你不安的是什么？委员会成员如此关注申请人的种族，你感到不安吗？还是你对这个女人诚实地告诉我真相感到不安？（那是一次尴尬的谈话。）</p><p> Should I tell Daniel about the colleague I’d spoken with just a few weeks earlier, who’d told me, with much frustration and a touch of anger in his voice, that he was getting out of academia because he’d concluded that it is now virtually impossible for a white male to get a tenure-track position in his field? This young man had finished his PhD and published a book. He had applied for scores of tenure-track jobs, but had finally concluded he was not likely to get one. “Picking me,” he explained, “won’t do anyone any good. It won’t help the institution show that it is combatting racism, and it won’t allow any of the members of the hiring committee to assuage their white liberal guilt.” Shortly thereafter, this colleague took a non-academic job as a computer programmer.</p><p>我是否应该告诉丹尼尔几周前与我交谈的那位同事，他带着沮丧和些许愤怒的声音告诉我，他正在退出学术界，因为他得出结论，现在白人男性几乎不可能在自己的领域获得终身职位？这个年轻人已经完成了博士学位并出版了一本书。他申请了几十份终身职位，但最终得出结论，他不太可能得到一份。“选择我，”他解释说，“对任何人都没有任何好处。这无助于该机构表明它正在打击种族主义，也不允许招聘委员会的任何成员减轻白人自由主义者的罪恶感。”不久之后，这位同事做了一份非学术性的计算机程序员工作。</p><p> Should I tell Daniel that, over the years, I had grown more and more frustrated with the way in which the academics I work among approach hiring? I’d seen plenty of searches in which members of the hiring committee went out of their way to try to hire persons of color, or members of under-represented minority groups, but nobody would ever admit publicly that this is what was going on. Nor did anyone want to admit that their efforts to boost minority candidates made job-seeking more difficult for members of other, non-preferred groups. Over and over, we were encouraged to celebrate the hiring of a minority candidate, but nobody ever said anything about the persons who were passed over as a result. Everybody seemed to look at these hiring decisions with one eye open and one eye strategically closed. To me, this seemed dishonest.</p><p>我是不是应该告诉丹尼尔，这些年来，我对自己在大学里工作的方式越来越失望？我见过很多招聘委员会成员不遗余力地试图招聘有色人种或代表性不足的少数群体成员的搜索，但没有人会公开承认这是正在发生的事情。也没有人愿意承认，他们提振少数族裔候选人的努力让其他非首选群体的成员更难找到工作。一次又一次，我们被鼓励去庆祝一位少数族裔候选人的录用，但从来没有人谈论过因此而被淘汰的人。每个人似乎都睁一只眼，策略性地闭一只眼来看待这些招聘决定。在我看来，这似乎是不诚实的。</p><p> In the end, I didn’t tell Daniel about any of my own experiences.</p><p>最后，我没有告诉丹尼尔我自己的任何经历。</p><p> I told him that I thought he might be right about why he hadn’t been accepted into the program. It looked to me like the push for diversity might have been the cause, or at least a key factor, in regard to the decision—though it was impossible to be certain. I then briefly (and perhaps half-heartedly) outlined the usual justification for affirmative-action programs.</p><p>我告诉他，我认为他没有被录取的原因可能是对的。在我看来，对多样性的推动可能是这个决定的原因，或者至少是一个关键因素，尽管不可能确定。然后，我简要（也许是半心半意地）概述了平权行动计划的通常理由。</p><p> But what I emphasized most was that I thought it would be unwise for Daniel to launch a campaign against the admissions committee, even if his data was as strong as he seemed to think it was. I told him that a campaign of the sort he was considering would almost certainly fail. He might get some catharsis out of it in the short run, but it would probably do no good in the long run. The committee was unlikely to revisit its decisions or change its procedures going forward. Support for affirmative action is almost universal among academics. Very few are even willing to express hesitations or second thoughts on this issue, lest they be deemed racists. The people who make these decisions feel good about the people who benefit from affirmative action, and they avert their gaze, as much as possible, from the people who are harmed by it. They might be embarrassed by Daniel and his friend’s data, but they would probably not abandon their approach.</p><p>但我最强调的是，我认为丹尼尔发起反对招生委员会的运动是不明智的，即使他的数据和他似乎认为的一样强大。我告诉他，他正在考虑的那种竞选几乎肯定会失败。从短期来看，他可能会得到一些宣泄，但从长远来看，这可能没有什么好处。委员会不太可能重新考虑其决定或改变其未来的程序。学术界几乎普遍支持平权行动。很少有人愿意在这个问题上表示犹豫或重新考虑，以免被视为种族主义者。做出这些决定的人对那些从平权行动中受益的人感觉良好，他们尽可能地将目光从那些受到平权行动伤害的人身上移开。他们可能会对丹尼尔和他的朋友的数据感到尴尬，但他们可能不会放弃他们的方法。</p><p> I warned Daniel that I thought his plan might end up doing him a lot of harm. If he chose to make his exposé public, the most likely outcome would be that some student or faculty member would accuse him of being a racist. Publishing his data would probably end up hurting him rather than helping him.</p><p>我警告丹尼尔，我认为他的计划最终可能会对他造成很大伤害。如果他选择公开自己的言论，最有可能的结果是，一些学生或教师会指责他是种族主义者。公布他的数据可能最终会伤害他，而不是帮助他。</p><p> When Daniel heard me use the word “racist,” even in this conjectural, non-accusatory way, he responded angrily. He told me that he was not a racist. He had voted for Democrats in the 2016 election and hated Donald Trump. And as it happens, I had reason to believe this was true. The morning after that election, Daniel had come to visit me in my office, deeply troubled by what a Trump presidency might mean for scientific research and funding.</p><p>当丹尼尔听到我用“种族主义者”这个词时，即使是用这种推测的、非指责的方式，他也愤怒地回答。他告诉我他不是种族主义者。他在2016年选举中投票给民主党人，憎恨唐纳德·特朗普。碰巧，我有理由相信这是真的。那次选举后的第二天早上，丹尼尔来到我的办公室拜访我，对特朗普担任总统对科学研究和资金的意义深感不安。</p><p> Daniel told me that he believed affirmative-action policies were justified for college admissions, but he did not think they should be used to filter out qualified applicants to honors programs and graduate programs.</p><p>丹尼尔告诉我，他认为平权行动政策对大学招生来说是合理的，但他不认为应该用这些政策来筛选合格的申请人，以获得荣誉课程和研究生课程。</p><p> He then spoke for several minutes about his own ethnic background. He reminded me that he was Jewish, and told me that both of his parents had put up with a lot of antisemitic discrimination in their universities and workplaces. Back then, they were regarded as “non-white” and were discriminated against as a result; now (ironically) he was considered “white” and was being discriminated against on that basis.</p><p>然后，他讲了几分钟自己的种族背景。他提醒我他是犹太人，并告诉我他的父母在大学和工作场所都忍受了很多反犹太主义的歧视。当时，他们被视为“非白人”，因此受到歧视；现在（讽刺的是）他被认为是“白人”，并因此受到歧视。</p><p> I listened with real sympathy. The situation seemed unfair to me, too. To be honest, I’ve never been quite clear on how we’re supposed to get over centuries of judging people by their skin color or ethnicity by paying more and more attention to skin color and ethnicity.</p><p>我满怀同情地听着。这种情况似乎对我也不公平。说实话，我从来都不太清楚，我们应该如何通过越来越多地关注肤色和种族，来通过肤色或种族来判断人们。</p><p> In the past few years, in fact, I’ve increasingly had the sense that affirmative action may be backfiring. Policies meant to correct historical iniquities seem to be stoking racial resentment. Like Daniel, I dislike Trump intensely. I don’t have much in common with his followers, and I certainly don’t think of myself as one of them. But I do, increasingly, understand some of the grievances that motivate them. I wish I didn’t, but I do.</p><p>事实上，在过去几年里，我越来越觉得平权行动可能适得其反。旨在纠正历史罪孽的政策似乎正在煽动种族仇恨。和丹尼尔一样，我非常讨厌特朗普。我和他的追随者没有太多共同之处，我当然也不认为自己是他们中的一员。但我确实越来越理解激励他们的一些不满情绪。我希望我没有，但我做到了。</p><p> In the end, as I’ve mentioned, I didn’t tell Daniel about any of my personal experiences or private thoughts. I assured myself that doing so might be counterproductive: after all, my goal was to calm Daniel down, not rile him up.</p><p>最后，正如我所提到的，我没有告诉丹尼尔我的任何个人经历或私人想法。我向自己保证，这样做可能会适得其反：毕竟，我的目标是让丹尼尔冷静下来，而不是激怒他。</p><p> I told Daniel that he could still succeed at our university, and get accepted by a top graduate school, even if he never made it into the honors program—as long as he just kept on taking challenging math and science classes and posting good grades. That would carry the day. He would move ahead, while the unqualified would fall by the wayside, unable to do the heavy intellectual lifting that advanced courses required.</p><p>我告诉丹尼尔，他仍然可以在我们的大学取得成功，并被顶尖的研究生院录取，即使他从未进入荣誉项目，只要他继续上具有挑战性的数学和科学课，并取得好成绩。那将是成功的一天。他会继续前进，而不合格的人则会半途而废，无法完成高级课程所要求的沉重的智力负担。</p><p> Daniel must not have been entirely convinced by my arguments, because he proceeded to tell me about a “plan” he had come up with to ensure he would be accepted by a good graduate school. He told me that two of his four grandparents were descended from Sephardic Jews who’d fled Spain in the 1500s. This, he said, made him “technically, part Hispanic”—and thus eligible for preferential admission to graduate-school programs.</p><p>丹尼尔一定没有完全被我的论点说服，因为他接着告诉我他想出了一个“计划”，以确保他能被一所好的研究生院录取。他告诉我，他的四位祖父母中有两位是16世纪逃离西班牙的塞法德犹太人的后裔。他说，这让他“从技术上讲，部分是西班牙裔”——因此有资格获得研究生院项目的优先录取。</p><p> I tried to discourage Daniel from putting this plan into action. I told him I thought it was deceptive and dishonest. He might be accepted by a university, but eventually the faculty members would learn that he was not the sort of Hispanic they’d intended to admit. As with his idea of publishing his data, I thought this idea would probably end up hurting him rather than helping.</p><p>我试图阻止丹尼尔把这个计划付诸实施。我告诉他我认为这是欺骗和不诚实的。他可能会被一所大学录取，但最终教职员工会发现，他不是他们打算承认的那种西班牙裔。和他公布数据的想法一样，我认为这个想法最终可能会伤害他，而不是帮助他。</p><p> Daniel eventually calmed down and left my office. He went on with his studies and did not publish his numbers.</p><p>丹尼尔最终平静下来，离开了我的办公室。他继续他的研究，没有公布他的数据。</p><p> In some ways, I think I gave Daniel good advice. Publishing the data he collected would probably not have helped him in the long run. Neither would presenting himself as Hispanic for the sake of graduate admissions. Those actions would probably have led to some unpleasant consequences.</p><p>在某些方面，我认为我给了丹尼尔很好的建议。从长远来看，公布他收集的数据可能对他没有帮助。也不会为了研究生入学而把自己打扮成西班牙裔。这些行动可能会导致一些不愉快的后果。</p><p> On the other hand, maybe it would have done some good to let the world know just how far the admissions committee was willing to go to admit under-represented minorities and make that honors program “look more like America as a whole.” By the same token, maybe there is something cowardly about not challenging current practices because it’s not in one’s own self-interest to make trouble. Maybe the world would be a better place if some people did challenge these preferential policies.</p><p>另一方面，也许让全世界知道招生委员会愿意在多大程度上接纳代表性不足的少数民族，并让该荣誉项目“看起来更像整个美国”，会有一些好处出于同样的原因，不挑战当前的做法可能有点懦弱，因为制造麻烦不符合个人的私利。如果有人挑战这些优惠政策，也许世界会变得更好。</p><p> So what do you think, reader? Did I give Daniel good advice? Or would you have told him something different?</p><p>读者，你觉得怎么样？我给丹尼尔提了好建议吗？或者你会告诉他一些不同的事情吗？</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/种族主义/">#种族主义</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/student/">#student</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/丹尼尔/">#丹尼尔</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
