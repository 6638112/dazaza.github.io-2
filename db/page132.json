Ford, the first of a new class of advanced aircraft carriers, in the Atlantic Ocean about 100 miles off the coast of Florida last Friday.\n  Some common naval mines are about 2,000 pounds and can cause serious damage if detonated close enough to the hull.\n The explosive the Navy set off in testing last week, while much farther from the ship than a naval mine would be, was much larger. It was almost twice as large as the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, a rarely-used heavy munition commonly known as the &#34;Mother of All Bombs&#34; because it is the most powerful non-nuclear weapon the US has.\n     The blast, which was identified as an &#34;experimental explosion&#34; by the US Geological Survey,  was so powerful that it clocked a 3.9 on the Richter scale, the equivalent of a small earthquake.\n  The Navy declined to provide any additional information on the configuration of the explosive used in the trials, how far it was from the ship when it was detonated, or why the specific yield was chosen.\n The  Navy explained in a recent Facebook post on the explosive testing that it &#34;conducts shock trials of new ship designs using live explosives to confirm that our warships can continue to meet demanding mission requirements under harsh conditions they might encounter in battle.&#34;\n In the aftermath of the first explosive event,  the Ford&#39;s official social media pages said that &#34;the leadership and the crew demonstrated Navy readiness fighting through the shock, proving our warship can &#39;take a hit&#39; and continue our mission.&#34;\n     The Ford is the Navy&#39;s most expensive warship and features a lot of new technology, such as an electromagnetic launch system, advanced arresting gear, and advanced weapons elevators.\n The ongoing shock trials, which the Navy was ordered to carrier out before the Ford could deploy, test the survivability of these systems and others in combat.\n The Navy is making sure that the shock from a nearby ordnance detonation will not incapacitate the ship by knocking critical systems offline, including everything from the ship&#39;s radars and self-defense systems to its four hefty propellers.

So now, BioNTech plans to measure how well the vaccine, in concert with the medication Libtayo, works as a treatment for severe cases of skin cancer \u2014 and that\u2019s a big deal, because the hope\u00a0is that it will be able to treat patients who would have previously been considered terminal.\n Just like  the COVID-19 vaccine that BioNTech developed in collaboration with Pfizer, the experimental cancer vaccine  relies on mRNA technology to teach a patient\u2019s immune system how to fight off cancer. But there are some key differences between testing a vaccine for cancer and a highly-infectious virus.\n Namely, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to test a vaccine on healthy patients and then wait around to see if they happen to eventually develop severe cancer. Rather, BioNTech is recruiting existing patients with stage three or four melanoma and then tracking their progress after they\u2019re inoculated.\n   \u201cOur vision is to harness the power of the immune system against cancer and infectious diseases,\u201d BioNTech cofounder \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci  said in a press release. \u201cWe were able to demonstrate the potential of mRNA vaccines in addressing COVID-19.

with a query, it can take forever to get the job done. Take ICICI Bank, India\u2019s third largest bank and until recently my only banking partner for over six years, for an example.\n It is now in its third month in figuring out who exactly in its relationship with Amazon is supposed to re-issue me a credit card. I have moved on with my life, and it looks like they did, too, likely before they even looked at my query.\n  Small and medium-sized businesses aren\u2019t a big fan of banks, either. If you operate an early-stage startup, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess if you will ever be able to convince a bank to issue you a corporate account. So of course, startups \u2014 Razorpay and Open \u2014 took it upon themselves to fix this experience.\n For consumers, too, in recent years, scores of startups have arrived on the scene to improve this banking experience. Whether  you are a teenager, or  just out of college, or a working professional, or  don\u2019t have a credit score, there are firms that can get you a credit card and loan.\n But even these services have a ceiling limit of some sort. And customers aren\u2019t loyal to any startup.\n \u201cA customer\u2019s relationship is always with the entity where they park their savings deposit,\u201d said  Jitendra Gupta, a high-profile entrepreneur who has spent a decade in the fintech world. Since these customers are not parking their money with fintech, \u201cthe startups have been unable to disrupt the bank. That\u2019s the hard reality.\u201d\n So what\u2019s the alternative? Gupta, who co-founded CitrusPay (sold to  Naspers\u2019 PayU) and served as managing director of PayU, has been thinking about these challenges for more than two years.\n \u201cIf you really want to change the banking industry, you cannot operate from the side. You have to fight from the centre, where they deposit their money. It\u2019s a very time-consuming process and requires a lot of initial capital and experience with banks,\u201d he told TechCrunch in an interview.\n After more than a year and a half of raising about $24 million \u2014 from Sequoia Capital India, 3one4 Capital,  Amrish Rau,  Kunal Shah,  Kunal Bahl, Tanglin Venture Partners, Rainmatter and others \u2014 Gupta is ready to launch what he believes will address a lot of the issues individuals face with their banks.\n His new startup, called  Jupiter, wants to bring \u201cdelight\u201d to the banking experience, and it will launch in India on Thursday.\n \u201cWe believe that a bank account should be a smart account, where it gives you insight, shares personalized tips and guides you through attaining some financial discipline,\u201d he said.\n  To be sure, Jupiter, too, will offer loans and other financial services to customers. But instead of making irrelevant calls to customers, it will assess which of its customers are running short on money and give the option to take a credit line from its app itself, he said. \u201cThe upsell doesn\u2019t need to happen by way of spam. It needs to happen by way of contextualization and personalization.\u201d\n \u201cJupiter has been built in a deep integration with the underlying bank, allowing the consumer to have a frictionless experience for all their banking needs,\u201d said Amrish Rau, chief executive of Pine Labs, co-founder of CitrusPay and longtime friend of Gupta.\n The startup, which employs 115 people, has developed a number of products for customers joining on day one. The products include the ability to buy now and pay later on UPI, a feature first offered in the market by Jupiter, and a mutual fund portfolio analyzer. A debit card, in-app chat with a customer service agent, expense categorisation, finding the right card, determining the existing health insurance coverage, and more are ready to ship, the startup said.\n Jupiter is currently working on providing zero mark-up on forex transactions, and frictionless two-factor authentication. The startup has  published a public Trello page where it has outlined the features it is working on and when it expects to ship them, as well as features suggested by its beta-testing customers. \u201cI want to establish full transparency in what we are working on to build trust with customers,\u201d said Gupta.\n Jupiter will have its own customer relationship team that will engage with the startup\u2019s users. The startup, which last month opened a waiting list for customers to sign up, had amassed more than 25,000 applications as of two weeks ago.\n Even Jupiter, which one day wishes to disrupt the banking sector, currently has to partner with banks. Its partners are Federal Bank and Axis Bank.\n I asked Gupta about the excitement his investors see in Jupiter. \u201cEveryone believes, as you see with fintech giants such as Nubank globally, that we will become a full bank,\u201d he said.\n But for the time being, Gupta said he is not looking to partner with more banks. \u201cI don\u2019t want Jupiter to attract customers because they want to bank with Federal or Axis. I want them to come to Jupiter because they want to bank with Jupiter,\u201d he said.\n In the next 12 months, the startup hopes to serve more than 1 million customers.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:19:01", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "jitendra,veteran,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "Fintech Veteran Jitendra Gupta\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e3a\u4ed6\u7684\u65b0\u5c40 - \u73b0\u5728\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u94f6\u884c\u8ffd\u968f ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFintech veteran Jitendra Gupta is ready for his new inning \u2014 now he is going after banks in India\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/jiten-gupta-jupiter-launch/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["jitendra", "veteran", "\u94f6\u884c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6361d67daf86c2f1041c852802602933.png", "infoid": 1067330, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u867d\u7136\u5728\u51e1\u4eba\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\u8f7b\u677e\u6253\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u4e3a\u8b66\u5bdf\u5236\u9020\u90a3\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5df2\u7ecf\u7531\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8\u73b0\u4ee3\u8d2d\u4e70\u3002\n    \u6839\u636e\u73b0\u4ee3\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a11\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u6089\u8fbe\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e8680\uff05\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80a1\u6743\u3002\u8f6f\u94f6\u884c\u5c06\u4fdd\u755920\uff05\u7684\u80a1\u4efd\u3002\u57282017\u5e74\u8f6f\u94f6\u6536\u8d2d\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ee5\u524d\u7531Google\uff06\uff0339;\u7236\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u62e5\u6709\u3002\n  \u5f88\u96be\u544a\u8bc9\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e0c\u671b\u4ece\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8131\u79bb\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8f7d\u6709Technobabble\u7684\u3002\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u65b0\u9c9c\u4e8b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u58eb\u8868\u793a\u6536\u8d2d\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u79fb\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\uff06\uff0334;\u5982\uff06\uff0334;\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\uff0c\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u79fb\uff08UAM\uff09\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u5de5\u5382\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u91ce\u5fc3\u4ea4\u8c08\u3002\u8d85\u8d8a\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u7684\u91ce\u5fc3\u3002\u73b0\u4ee3\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5e0c\u671b\uff06\uff0334;\u5236\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u547d\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u6027\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n  \u663e\u7136\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff06\uff0334;\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u7684\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e86\u795d\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0cHyundai\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u53ea\u5947\u5f02\u7684\u7092\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u53ea\u770b\u7740\u773c\u775b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\u7684\u62a4\u58eb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff0c\u4e00\u53ea\u5e26\u6709\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\u7684\u62a4\u58eb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u60a3\u8005\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5730\u65b9\u7684\u533b\u751f\u70b9\u5934\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8df3\u821e\u5728\u8857\u4e0a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u6362\u53e5\u8bdd\u8bf4\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u51dd\u805a\u529b\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5b64\u72ec\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u7cdf\u7cd5\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6709\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u53ea\u770b\u5230\u773c\u775b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u72d7\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u72d7\u8d85\u8d8a\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n  \u4ec0\u4e48\uff06\uff0339;\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6ce2\u58eb\u987f\u52a8\u6001\uff06\uff0339;\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u603b\u90e8\u7684\u62a4\u536b\u72ac\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8b66\u5bdf\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u5bb6\u53ef\u5f52\u8005\u8425\u5730\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u5de1\u903b\u5458\u3002\u672c\u524d\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5448\u73b0\u3002 ", "note_en": "Boston Dynamics, the company that makes   those dystopian dancing robot dogs that also   work for the cops despite being   easily defeatable in mortal combat, has been purchased by the car company Hyundai.\n    The deal values Boston Dynamics at $1.1 billion, according to   a Hyundai press release, and sees Hyundai assume an 80 percent controlling stake in the robot company. Softbank will retain a 20 percent stake. Before the Softbank acquisition in 2017, the company was previously owned by Google&#39;s parent company Alphabet.\n  It is hard to tell what Hyundai wants out of Boston Dynamics from the press release, which is laden with technobabble. Robots in car manufacturing are nothing new, but Hyundai says the acquisition is &#34;another major step toward its strategic transformation into a Smart Mobility Solution Provider&#34; such as &#34;autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), Urban Air Mobility (UAM), smart factories and robots,&#34; which seems to speak to the company&#39;s ambitions beyond car manufacturing. Hyundai says it hopes to &#34;develop advanced technologies that enhance people&#39;s lives and promote safety, thereby realizing the progress for humanity.&#34;\n  Apparently, the &#34;progress of humanity&#34; means a lot less of it. To celebrate the purchase, Hyundai released   a bizarre hype video featuring a seeing-eye robot dog, a nurse robot dog with a tablet mounted on its head that allows the patient to nod at a doctor who is somewhere else, and a teen dancing with a robot in the street. In other words, Hyundai envisions a lonely future in which social cohesion between humans has broken down and robots are our only friends. That&#39;s all bad enough, but why anyone would want a seeing eye robot dog instead of a real dog is beyond comprehension.\n  What&#39;s important to remember is that some of Boston Dynamics&#39; robot dogs&#39; most notable implementations are as guard dogs at   corporate headquarters, as police tools, and as dystopian patrollers of homeless encampments.

These companies\u2019 market capitalizations, as of May 6 of this year, range from $2.8 billion (Yelp) to $2.1 trillion (Apple); our financial data is current as of June 14.\n Thirty-seven technology giants responded to our queries and agreed to participate in the project. Stripe and Roku declined to participate, and Tesla, SpaceX, and Coinbase did not respond to repeated requests. For companies that did not participate, we searched for any public information about commitments or policy changes, and included those findings in the final project.\n Pieces of this data set, which encapsulates the public financial commitments made by these companies, as well as the changes made to their policies and procedures in the last year, are highlighted in data visualizations, which you can see  here. But it\u2019s worth unpacking this data more.\n  One of the biggest trends in tech over the last year is financial commitments to improving racial equity both within individual tech companies\u2019 walls, as well as across the country at large. While some companies have made commitments to racial justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) before, it has never happened collectively on the same scale it did in 2020. Notably, after police killed Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson in 2014, no major tech companies  made any statements or donations (though Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey, who was executive chairman at the time, did tweet about it and attended the protests in person).\n Cumulatively, the tech giants we surveyed have committed a total of $3.8 billion toward DEI in 2020 and 2021, in various forms. The largest chunk of these funds\u2014$2.9 billion, or 75%\u2014have gone toward initiatives that support Black-owned businesses. That includes venture capital funding deployed specifically toward Black founders, as well as funds earmarked for Black-owned suppliers.\n Eleven percent of the commitments, a total of $422.5 million, is going toward racial justice organizations, often taking the form of direct donations to nonprofits. About 10% of the commitments, $375.1 million, were committed to educational initiatives. These sorts of commitments are sometimes framed as an effort to solve the  \u201cpipeline problem\u201d\u2014the  often-contested\u00a0claim that tech\u2019s diversity woes are due to a lack of qualified Black people to hire. The remaining money has been allocated to undesignated or internal commitments; very few companies shared their internal DEI spend. In addition, a few companies, including Microsoft, Netflix, and Yelp, included loans and deposits into Black-owned banks as part of their commitments.\n  While these numbers seem substantial, it\u2019s important to compare companies\u2019 commitments to their operating income. We took a look at companies which answered our survey that had an operating income of over $100 million in 2020, and analyzed how many days it would take for their profits to surpass their total commitments to racial equity. The results were stark.\n Apple, which committed $100 million, will make that money in profit in less than a day. But even the largest tech companies that committed substantially more\u2014like Microsoft ($772.5 million), Alphabet/Google ($418 million), and Facebook ($347 million)\u2014make their commitments back in profit in between three and six days.\n There are some standouts on the list. PayPal, which made $3.3 billion in operating income in 2020, would take almost two months of profit to pay for its substantial $535 million commitment. In addition, Salesforce, which made $422 million in operating income in 2020, has committed the vast majority of it\u2014$402.2 million\u2014to various diversity and equity initiatives.\n  These comparisons reveal how companies\u2019 financial commitments are best understood in the context of how much money they make; even some of the largest dollar amounts begin to look small in this context. As surveillance expert Chris Gilliard  puts it, \u201ci t\u2019s not even couch-cushion money to them.\u201d\n  Along with asking companies about their financial commitments to equity, we also asked them a range of questions about their policies that can indicate a company is attempting to improve its DEI. (It\u2019s important to note that not all policy changes are equal. Critics have suggested that some moves, like making Juneteenth a holiday, don\u2019t result in a systemic change to company culture).\n One movement that\u2019s taken place is a push to bring more Black people on to boards of directors, and we found this reflected in the data. While 71% of companies surveyed currently have a Black board member, 37% of those companies appointed their first Black board member in 2020 or 2021. Twenty-nine percent of companies surveyed do not currently have a Black board member.\n  We found that tech companies are split on requiring anti-bias or anti-racism training. According to our survey, 48% of companies require it for all employees. Thirty-one percent made it mandatory for all employees starting in 2020 or 2021. It is not mandatory for all employees at 35% of companies. Included in this bucket are companies that have made the decision to make it mandatory for all managers, or all hiring managers, but not for all employees. For instance, an Uber spokesperson told us it has mandatory training on unconscious bias and microaggressions for leaders and has a training program focused on anti-bias for new employee and manager onboarding, but doesn\u2019t require that training for all employees because  research suggests it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cdesired impact.\u201d\n One noteworthy shift that\u2019s just starting to take place is who a company\u2019s DEI head reports to; for the vast majority of the companies who responded to our survey, the DEI head reports to the chief people officer, or equivalent. A small handful\u2014including Facebook, Pinterest, Peloton, and Etsy\u2014have their head of DEI reporting to either the CEO or the head of operations. These changes were made in 2020 or 2021, after the racial justice protests. Only one company\u2014Yelp\u2014had this kind of reporting structure in place before the protests. Its head of DEI has reported to the COO since 2016.\n Giving employees Juneteenth as a paid company holiday is another change that\u2019s occurred in the last year. About half of companies surveyed now close their offices for Juneteenth, starting in 2020. No company had offered Juneteenth as a holiday previously.\n  Overall, we found that about two-thirds of companies had made some kind of DEI policy change after the summer 2020 protests. It should be noted that several companies already had the policies we asked about in place before 2020.\n A year isn\u2019t a long time to create systemic change, and it\u2019s still unclear if any of the changes we\u2019ve catalogued will end tech\u2019s long track record of undervaluing and exploiting Black employees. Based on the interviews featured in the  Black in Tech project, workers just want to be paid and treated fairly; if companies can\u2019t meet those basic requirements, having a Black board member, giving everyone a paid holiday, or donating millions certainly won\u2019t solve the problem.\n We are publishing and analyzing this data to hold these companies accountable for their promises, since without transparency change will be even further out of reach.  Fast Company will continue to follow how these commitments impact tech workers and users in the years to come.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

the Big Four firm will not be obligated to work from the office for a minimum number of days per week, as has been a typical response of Deloitte\u2019s competitors.\n Some 15,000 Deloitte staff responded to an internal survey about the future of work at the Big Four firm, with more than 80 per cent of those saying they expected to work from a Deloitte office for two days or fewer per week.\n     More than 90 per cent of Deloitte\u2019s workforce said \u2018choice\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 should be at the heart of how the business operates in future.\n Deloitte senior partner and chief executive Richard Houston said: \u201cThe impact of the pandemic has profoundly changed our way of life, not least in the way we work. The last year has really shown that one size does not fit all when it comes to balancing work and personal lives.\n \u201cIt has also shown that we can trust our people to make the right choice in when, how and where they work.\u201d\n He continued: \u201cOnce the Government has lifted all of the Covid-19 restrictions and we\u2019re back up to full office capacity, we will let our people choose where they need to be to do their best work, in balance with their professional and personal responsibilities.\u201d\n Deloitte said when restrictions are eased its offices will principally be used for team collaboration, training and client meetings.\n     Many City companies have announced plans to adopt a hybrid structure post-pandemic, with staff asked to spend some time in the office each week.\n Competitors KPMG and EY have said staff will spend on average two days in the office each week, while rival PwC estimated staff will be in the office between two and three days.\n The government is currently consulting on plans that could prevent employers from forcing staff to come into the office unless they can prove it is essential.\n A Whitehall source told The Mail: \u201cWe are looking at introducing a default right to flexible working. That would cover things like reasonable requests by parents to start late so they can drop their kids at childcare.\n \u201cBut in the case of office workers in particular it would also cover working from home \u2013 that would be the default right unless the employer could show good reason why someone should not.\u201d\n   The government has shot down the reports, with the Prime Minister understood to be against large-scale working from home beyond final lockdown restrictions.\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:  Big Four", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u544a\u8bc9,tells", "title": "\u5fb7\u7f57\u7279\u544a\u8bc9\u5458\u5de5\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6c38\u8fdc\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Deloitte tells staff they can work from home forever", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cityam.com/deloitte-tells-staff-they-can-work-from-home-forever/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u544a\u8bc9", "tells"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "da6fa34e42e38144809834f25b88e043.jpg", "infoid": 1067324, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u54c7\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cfApp Backhannel\uff06amp\u4e2d\u542f\u7528\u4e86@Clubhouse\u7684\u610f\u5916\u66f4\u65b0;\u4ea4\u6362\u4fa7\u680f\uff06amp;\u5168\u9762\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\n \u4f3c\u4e4e\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u56de\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6211\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u662f\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\uff01\n  \u821e\u53f0\uff06gt;\u8d70\u5411\u8d70\u5eca\uff06gt;\u70b9\u51fb\u7bad\u5934\uff06gt;\u540e\u9891\u5f39\u51fa\uff01 @jowyang @garylhenderson pic.twitter.com/5bjfvlg7t5.\n \u867d\u7136BackChannel\u5c4f\u5e55\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u7a7a\u767d\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5982\u6b64\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6846\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Paul Davison\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u804a\u5929\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u5e02\u653f\u5385\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fc7\u3002\n \u201c......\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u4eba\u4e00\u76f4\u52aa\u529b\u505aDM\u80cc\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u52a0\u6df1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7684\u53cb\u8c0a\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u4e1c\u897f - \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u8be5\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u201c\u6234\u7ef4\u68ee\u8bf4\u3002\n \u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba@pdavison\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e02\u653f\u5385\u671f\u95f4\u4e3a@clubhouse\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9@clubhouse\u7684\u5907\u4efd\uff08\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u76f8dm\u7684exthelnesel\u3002\n Clubhouse\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bf4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7acb\u5373\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u6dfb\u52a0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00DMS\u6216\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u7ec4\u6587\u672c\u804a\u5929\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ed6\u8fd8\u62d2\u7edd\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\u3002 \n\u5f53\u8fbe\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u65f6\uff0c\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u9662\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4ece\u5047\u8bbe\u62d0\u70b9\u56f4\u7ed5\u89d2\u843d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u529d\u963bTechCrunch\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86COY\u58f0\u660e\u3002  \u201c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4ea7\u54c1\u5efa\u8bbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0cClubhouse\u7ecf\u5e38\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u201d\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u6210\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u3002\u201d  Spotify\u7684\u65b0\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8HodeCat App Greentroom\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u76f4\u64ad\u6587\u672c\u804a\u5929\u5ba4\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u6ed1\u52a8\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u5c4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002 \u4eceClubhouse Backhannel\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u663e\u7136\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002 ", "note_en": "Wow looks like accidental update of  @clubhouse enabled in app backchannel &amp; switch of side bar &amp; full experience.\n Seems it\u2019s rolled back now but from what I saw it was beautiful!!\n  On stage &gt; move to hallway &gt; hit arrow &gt; back channel popped up!

Amid surface temperatures of up to 471 \u00b0C and surface pressures 100 times greater than those on Earth, new research suggests the planet might still be geologically active. That\u2019s encouraging news to people who think it\u00a0 could once have hosted life\u00a0( or that it might still be able to).\n  Earth\u2019s lithosphere (its crust and upper mantle) is made of \u201cplates\u201d that move around and crash into each other, resulting in mountains, deep ocean trenches, and volcanic and seismic activity. This tectonic activity also plays an important role in the carbon cycle, the processes in which carbon is released and reabsorbed in the ecosystem; by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it has helped keep the planet cool and comfortable this whole time.\n  Thus far, scientists have never observed anything similar on Venus. But we\u2019ve never been able to rule it out, because it\u2019s hard to make scientific observations of the planet (its thick clouds obscure its surface, and any spacecraft we\u2019d land there would most likely melt in a matter of hours). In the new findings,  published in PNAS today, scientists think they\u2019ve finally spotted evidence of a new type of tectonic activity on Venus.\n   The team used observations made by the Magellan probe, which orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and mapped the surface using radar. The features it spotted have been analyzed before, but the new study uses a new computer model that can recognize surface deformations indicating large block structures in the lithosphere. These blocks, each about the size of Alaska, seem to have been sluggishly jostling against each other like broken pack ice on a pond or lake.\n  This is quite different from the current type of plate tectonics on Earth. But if confirmed, it would nonetheless be evidence of heat currents and molten material in Venus\u2019s interior\u2014something that\u2019s never before been observed. The authors think parallels with Earth\u2019s geology during the Archean Eon (2.5 to 4 billion years ago) suggest that the \u201cpack ice\u201d patterns could be a transition from an earlier period of plate tectonics on Venus when the planet was more Earth-like.\n    This movement \u201cis widespread across the Venus lowlands, and argues for a previously unrecognized style of global tectonics,\u201d says Sean Solomon, a research scientist at Columbia University and a coauthor of the new study.\n  The findings only fuel more excitement behind  the new Venus missions\u00a0recently approved by NASA and the European Space Agency. Solomon says he and his team hope all three can provide \u201ccritical data for testing the ideas we\u2019ve described in our paper.\u201d Those missions won\u2019t be ready to launch till closer to the end of the decade, so let\u2019s hope the excitement doesn\u2019t wane over the next several years.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 08:21:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

"note_en": "The European Central Bank (ECB) is better suited than private companies to protect user privacy for the eventual adoption of a digital euro, according to an executive board member.\n In an interview with the  Financial Times on June 14 and  published Sunday, Fabio Panetta said his institution had no commercial interest in storing, managing or monetizing user data.\n The issue over privacy in the digital euro is a focal point for Europeans as are concerns of security, according to a  recent survey by the ECB.\n By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and

\u201cWe\u2019re not like private companies.\u201d\n The banker also said people felt safer when their information was handled by a public institution, adding the bank would do a better job.\n \u201cThere are many ways in which we can protect confidential data while allowing the checks foreseen by law to avoid illicit transactions, such as those linked to money laundering, the financing of terrorism or tax evasion, said Panetta.\n   Asked whether he perceived a threat from cryptocurrencies or other central bank digital currencies, the executive said there existed an external \u201cpotential threat\u201d including the issuance of a global stablecoin that could change the way people view digital instruments.\n \u201cI think this is a fundamental change to how payments will function in the future, both for the financial system and for society at large,\u201d said Panetta. \u201cIt is generating huge interest.\u201d\n ECB President Christine Lagarde said a digital euro would likely launch at the  middle of this decade while experimentation has begun using  distributed ledger technology.\n   Disclosure The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital

A primary key is an Ed25519 key that is usually kept offline; and the signing subkeys are the keys that actually sign the repo. Both may be the same key.    A *public signing key* as used is a concatenation of the following things:     Verification: When a client checks an updated Release file, it MUST fail validation if one of the signing subkeys has a lower serial number than it saw for the primary key in the previous release file(s). This effectively means that as soon as a client sees a new subkey for the repository, all previous subkeys are revoked.    Signing: For signing static repositories, such as Ubuntu stable releases, or a Debian stable release, it is advisable to use a one-time signing subkey that is thrown away after signing.    Subkeys may reuse/share serial numbers provided that they will never be used for the same repository. For example, a -security and an -updates suite may both be signed by the same primary key, but different subkeys with the serial 0.    apt-sign signatures are part of the Release file directly, and can hence co-exist with/inside detached Release.gpg or clearsigned  ?InRelease files.    Support for OpenPGP signatures will be removed after Debian and Ubuntu shipped one stable (in case of Ubuntu: LTS) release with warnings for missing apt-sign signatures.    Once a repository provides Ed25519 signatures from trusted keys, OpenPGP signatures will no longer be verified.    Rough draft:    First party repository signing keys are likely configured by apt.conf snippets defining trusted keyrings. There&#39;ll be like a default keyring, and zero or more named keyrings, and they can be referred to by the signed-by field. Each keyring is a list of base64-encoded Ed25519 public keys.    Third party repositories will likely be configured by a list of base64-encoded Ed25519 keys being listed directly in the Signed-By field in a deb822 sources.list file, instead of using a keyring.    This is similar to the untrusted comment approach used by signify(1) and minisign(1). We have opted to include the full public key instead of a key identifier in our signatures, in order to be able to validate repositories without having to have the public key on a separate channel, e.g. for linting repositories and to ensure that repositories do not just break for some users whose keys have wrong signatures.    Furthermore, our signatures are in a single line, and the signature algorithm is encoded in the field name instead of the value.    We have tools to convert apt signatures to signify-openbsd public keys and signatures, allowing Release files to be validated by a second set of tools.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 08:20:26",

from having to shut down after the board of directors at its parent company agreed on Monday to make a final decision on the matter on Friday pending an appeal to have the group\u2019s assets unfrozen.\n    Next Digital\u2019s board sent a letter to Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for security, John Lee, requesting that some of the company\u2019s assets be unfrozen so that employees can be paid.\n  If the decision is taken on Friday to cease operations, the online news section of Apple Daily is expected to stop updating on Saturday morning at the earliest, while the final print edition will also be published on Saturday.\n  Next Digital is due to pay its staff at the end of the month, which leaves fewer than 10 days before the company risks being in breach of labor laws due to salary arrears.\n  On Thursday, HK$18 million worth of assets held by three Next Digital companies were frozen, with the police warning seven local banks not to deal with the assets.\n  The freezing of the assets occurred as 500 police officers carried out a search at Next Digital\u2019s headquarters in Tseung Kwan O and arrested five company executives on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces or external elements to endanger national security.\n    Two of the five, Next Digital CEO Cheung Kim-hung and Apple Daily Editor-in-Chief Ryan Law, were charged with this offense and were denied bail on Saturday.\n      Apple Daily\u2019s all-new English Edition is now available on the mobile app:  bit.ly/2yMMfQE", "posttime": "2021-06-22 08:20:13", "source_domain":

we need to go to offices? Work 9 to 5? At this unique moment in history, employers can rethink everything\n   T here have been few moments in the history of work as pivotal as the one we find ourselves in now. It took a pandemic to normalise remote working, and, despite the fears of many CEOs, most organisations saw no demonstrable loss of productivity. Now, the global workforce is demanding its right to retain the autonomy it gained through  increased flexibility as  societies open up again. Pre-pandemic, it was not uncommon for an employer to ask staff to justify their need to work from home. Post-pandemic, employees may ask employers to justify the need to come into the office.\n Yet many organisations are still resisting this more flexible future. They argue that employees\u2019 wellbeing is compromised by remote working, and that unless they are brought back into the office, many more will suffer from \u201c Zoom fatigue\u201d.\n  But remote work itself is not the problem. The problem is that, though most office workers are currently working from home, the way we work is still inherently office-centric. For the past nine months, my team and I have been researching how maintaining this way of working in a remote environment is actually what is causing significant damage to employees. It\u2019s never a good idea to force a square peg into a round hole. In today\u2019s context, office-centric work is a square peg and the remote environment is a round hole.\n Pretty much all of our work practices \u2013 when we work, where we work, how we work \u2013 are designed around location. Worse still, they were designed decades ago, and it is only now, with the pandemic forcing change, that we have been given the unique opportunity to question those structures.\n Take the \u201cwhen\u201d of work. By default, our days are organised around 9-5, a system that was formalised for factory workers by Henry Ford in the US in 1926. Many of us do not work in factories however. Why are we hanging on to this linear day as the only schedule in which work can be done? More importantly, the linear day is unsuitable for the remote environment where we do not have concrete signals to start or end our work day, such as the commute or the dress code: 40% of the remote workforce are  working longer hours as a result.\n What would happen if organisations looked outside this way of working, and trusted employees to set a non-linear schedule, based on their individual circumstances, that kept them healthy, sane and productive?\n How about the \u201cwhere\u201d of work? It is apparent just from the language we use that the office is still viewed as the headquarters for work. Even the term \u201cremote\u201d implies that you are away from the place work is usually done. The dominance of the office was necessary in a time without home internet or laptops, but we are long past needing to prove that work can be done outside an employer-owned space.\n The \u201chow\u201d of work was perhaps the most worrying discovery of our research. There is a long-held assumption that the hallowed meeting is the best way for us to collaborate. This culture of meetings was established in the 1950s, before methods of work that allowed us to collaborate outside meetings (back then, that meant memos passed from one secretary to the next) had today\u2019s speed and efficiency (email, instant messaging, shared drives).\n Virtual meetings are cognitively draining \u2013 when was the last time someone held a mirror in front of you during your in-person chat so your brain had to process your every physical move? Forcing us into more meetings to compensate for the lack of office \u201cwater-cooler moments\u201d is only increasing fatigue \u2013 our study found that  employees are 24% more likely to be emotionally drained by additional meetings. What would happen if we were to work asynchronously by default, and set limits on time spent together during a day, or even a week?\n It is these outdated, office-centric work designs that are making us tired. We are not working within systems that are built for the environment we are in. And until organisations stop to reassess why we work the way we do, and fundamentally change those aspects that are significantly outdated and not fit for purpose, fatigue will continue to rise. Bringing people back into the office full time isn\u2019t the answer \u2013 workers don\u2019t want to give up the flexibility that gives them greater control of their lives. They want systems that work for the environment they are operating in.\n In essence, we need to stop designing work around location, and start designing work around human behaviour. Employees will work better, stay at their organisation longer and keep healthier if they are placed at the centre of work design \u2013 trust me, we have the data that proves it.\n This is what we should be asking ourselves: if 9-5 had never been invented; if \u201coffice\u201d were a foreign term; if the concept of a meeting sounded like gibberish \u2013 in short, if today were day one of the history of work \u2013 how would you design how you work?\n Alexia Cambon is a research director at Gartner.

First, more e-commerce sales will be on mobile phones this year than desktops (as much as 70% by some estimates), people tend to read text messages almost immediately and consumers spend upwards of  30 minutes a day engaging with mobile messaging apps.\n Via also insists that unlike an expanding pool of startups that are focused on helping retailers and others broadcast their marketing messages in SMS, there\u2019s room for a player to better address the many other pieces that add up to a happy consumer experience, from delivering coupon codes to starting the returns process.\n  Indeed, according to co-founder and CEO Tejas Konduru \u2014 a Brigham Young grad whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from India and who have themselves worked at tech startups \u2014 one insight his now 50-person company had early on was that despite that so many of their customers now use the mobile browser to visit and shop from their stores, many retailers use website builders like Shopify or BigCommerce to \u201ccram everything everything into mobile, leaving only enough space for, like, one picture and a Buy button.\u201d Konduru figured there must be a way to take the  shopping experience that all these customers have with brands on their website and make them happen in a quick, mobile-native way.\n Via\u2019s solution, he says, is to help those businesses interact with customers on the devices and apps they use most often. \u201cWhen someone uses Shopify or BigCommerce or any of those platforms,\u201d says Konduru, \u201cwe also connect it to Via, and it basically takes the entire shopping experience and allows [customers] to quickly swipe right through a menu or like through a catalog on, for example, Facebook Messenger. Via will also create like a native iOS Android app by taking a website, cloning it into a native iOS Android app, then sell the push notification in-app chat layer. Essentially,\u201d he adds, \u201canytime someone shops on the phone and they\u2019re not using the browser is what Via is handling.\u201d\n The \u201cmessage\u201d seems to be getting through to the right people. Via, which launched last year, says it now employs 54 people on a full-time basis, has 190 brands as customers and just secured $15 million in Series A funding led by Footwork, the new venture firm co-founded by former Stitch Fix COO Mike Smith and former Shasta Ventures investor Nikhil Basu Trivedi.\n  Other participants in the round include Peterson Ventures, where Konduru once interned; famed founder Josh James of Domo, where Konduru also once interned; and a long list of other notable individual investors, including Ryan Smith of Qualtrics and Lattice co-founder and CEO Jack Altman.\n As for how the company charges, it doesn\u2019t ask for a monthly or yearly fee, as per traditional SaaS companies, but instead charges per interaction, whether that\u2019s an SMS or a voice minute or video or a GIF.\n It\u2019s starting to add up, according to Konduru, who says that Via\u2019s average customer is seeing 15 times return on its investment and that from May of 2020 \u2014 when the company\u2019s service went live \u2014 through December, the company generated $51 million in sales. Konduru declined to say exactly how much Via saw from those transactions, but says the company is on track to reach $10 million in annual recurring revenue this year.\n As for how brands get started with Via, it\u2019s pretty simple, by the company\u2019s telling. As long as a company is using a commerce platform \u2014 from Shopfiy to WooCommerce to Salesforce \u2014 it takes just five minutes or so to produce a mobile app with a menu featuring the types of interactions the brand can enable via Via\u2019s platform, says Konduru.\n  Konduru, who dabbled in investment banking before deciding to launch Via, says he isn\u2019t surprised by the startup\u2019s fast traction, though he says he has been taken aback by the breadth of conversations the company sees. While he imagined Via would be a strong marketing channel for brands that use the platform to push out notifications about abandoned shopping carts and upcoming deliveries, it\u2019s more of a two-way street than he\u2019d imagined.\n \u201cEvery month, there are maybe 15,000 people who start the returns process through Via and will get a notification from a channel that Via supports. But suddenly \u2014 let\u2019s say the customer gets the wrong T-shirt size \u2014 people start communicating with the brand. You see everything from fan appreciation to address changes to messaging about bad discount codes to where\u2019s-my-order type exchanges. That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t expect,\u201d says Konduru, who says that before raising its Series A round, Via raised $4.2 million in seed funding led by Peterson Ventures.\n \u201cI thought that people would just look at the notification and, like, move it into the abyss somewhere. Instead, people start interacting with the brand.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 07:37:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5546\u52a1,series", "title": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5546\u52a1\u542f\u52a8\u901a\u8fc7\u7b79\u96c61500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d44\u91d1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMobile commerce startup Via rounds up $15 million in Series A funding\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/via-a-mobile-commerce-startup-that-claims-51-million-in-sales-in-its-first-six-months-just-closed-its-a-round/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5546\u52a1", "series"]}]
