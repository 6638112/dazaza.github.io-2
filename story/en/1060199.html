On Monday morning, the top questions on its homepage, as decided by its users, included whether the Democratic Party would eventually initiate some kind of genocide, whether Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were really in love, why small dogs were “the most aggressive seeming,” and “What’s the last thing that entered your nose by mistake?”</p><p>雅虎答案不是大多数人都会称之为良好的信息来源。星期一早上，由其用户决定的主页的最高问题包括民主党是否最终会发起某种种族灭绝，无论是哈利和梅根·克莱尔真正恋爱的，为什么小狗是“最具侵略性的似乎” “和”错误地进入鼻子的最后一件事是什么？“</p><p>   Still, when Yahoo made the  unceremonious announcement earlier this month that the site would be wiped from the face of the web on May 4, with little explanation beyond the fact that “it has become less popular,” there was a general outcry and a wave of nostalgia.  The Verge gathered up “ the best” material from Yahoo Answers’ 16 years of operation, including such classics as “Is it illegal to kill an ant????????!?” and “Is there a spell to become a mermaid that actually works?”   BuzzFeed eulogized a website that “died as it lived, needlessly and stupidly.” Twitter was crowded with screenshots; one  popular email newsletter started a series of commemorative illustrations. “Yahoo’s still out there doing what they do best: deleting an unimaginable amount of internet history with 30 days’ notice,”  tweeted Andy Baio, a web developer who worked at the company from 2005 to 2007.</p><p>   尽管如此，当雅虎本月早些时候提出了令人无法立即宣告的时候，该网站将于5月4日从网络的面对擦拭，但没有少于“它变得不那么受欢迎”的原因，存在一般兴起和波浪怀旧。边缘收集了雅虎答案的“最好的”材料，其中16年的运作，包括这样的经典“是杀死一个蚂蚁的杀戮????????！” “有没有咒语成为实际工作的美人鱼？” Buzzfeed阐述了一个“像生活一样死亡，不必要地和愚蠢”的网站。 Twitter挤满了截图;一个流行的电子邮件时事通讯开始了一系列纪念插图。 “雅虎还在那里做了他们所做的事情：从2005年到2007年工作的Web开发人员删除了30天的通知，删除了30天的互联网历史。</p><p>  When Baio was at the company, Yahoo Answers was one of the biggest things it had going. “The volume of activity was extraordinary,” he told me. “This doesn’t mean it was good quality; a lot of it was always questionable.” But deleting it still means scrapping a huge archive of the ways that people look for and try to provide knowledge. Baio had already watched a website that he’d made and sold to Yahoo, called Upcoming, get marked for death with less than  two weeks’ warning in 2013. Over the years, the company has rubbed out GeoCities, where many people made their first bonkers-looking  personal websites; Yahoo Groups, where a generation joined their first listservs and forums sorted by subculture; and all the NSFW content on Tumblr.</p><p>  当Baio在公司时，雅虎答案是它的最大的东西之一。 “活动量非常非凡，”他告诉我。 “这并不意味着它质量很好;很多它总是有问题。“但删除它仍然意味着克服人们寻找和尝试提供知识的方式的巨大档案。 Baio已经观看了一个网站，他将被称为雅虎，被称为即将到来的，在2013年的警告不到两周的警告中被标记为死亡。多年来，该公司已经摧毁了地理位置，许多人在哪里首先邦克斯看个人网站;雅虎团体，一代人加入了他们的第一个由亚文化排序的Listservs和论坛;和Tumblr上的所有NSFW内容。</p><p>  Plenty of tech companies make acquisitions and then shut those acquisitions down. Plenty of tech companies dispose of “user-generated content” without fanfare. And plenty of tech companies get dragged for  holding on to users’ information a little  too tightly—even when they ought to be erasing it. Yet one tech company in particular has been made into a running joke, and has sparked genuine outrage, over bad decisions, indecipherable motivations, and seemingly bottomless disregard for the feelings of people who have shared something on the internet.</p><p>  大量的科技公司赚取收购，然后关闭这些收购。大量的科技公司在没有Fanfare的情况下处置了“用户生成的内容”。并且许多科技公司被拖延地拖延了用户的信息，即使他们应该抹去它也是如此。然而，一家技术公司特别是在一个跑步的笑话中，并引发了真正的愤怒，过度的决定，甲型难以理解的动机，看似无底忽略了在互联网上分享某些东西的人的感受。</p><p>  A spokesperson for Verizon Media, Yahoo’s parent company, told me in an emailed statement that customer needs had changed during a time of “unprecedented demand for premium trusted content,” and that Verizon would be investing in “professionally-produced content and high-quality journalism.” She declined to comment on the choice to pull down Yahoo Answers entirely, rather than archiving it.</p><p>  雅虎父母公司的verizon Media发言人在一封电子邮件的声明中告诉我，客户需求在“前所未有的高级信任内容的需求”时，并且verizon将投资“专业生产的内容和高质量新闻。“她拒绝对选择完全拉下雅虎答案的选择来评论，而不是归档。</p><p> After almost 30 years in business, Yahoo has come to be known as a straight-up villain. According to Ian Milligan, an  internet historian at the University of Waterloo, the company’s most notable characteristic at this point is “the sheer amount of destruction they’ve done to the historical record.” Whether or not one company really deserves to hold that reputation on its own, this latest dustup indicates that Yahoo is not about to change its ways.</p><p> 经过近30年的业务后，雅虎已被称为直接恶棍。据Ian Milligan称，Waterloo大学的互联网历史学家，该公司此时最值得注意的特征是“他们为历史记录所做的纯粹销毁量”。无论一家公司是否真的值得拥有这种声誉，最新的灰尘表明雅虎不仅要改变其方式。</p><p>  Once upon a time, Yahoo was young and filthy rich. Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo, two Stanford classmates, the site was the first portal to the web for millions of people. Before the dawn of search engines, it functioned as a directory—and a guide—to the amorphous everythingness of  online, making the internet feel manageable, even homey. The site’s ad revenue swelled and swelled, through the dot-com boom and beyond, from $70.4 million in 1997 to $3.5 billion in 2004.</p><p>  曾几何时，雅虎年轻而肮脏的富裕。建于1994年，由Jerry Yang和David Filo，两个斯坦福同学，该网站是万维网的第一个门户网站。在搜索引擎的曙光之前，它用作目录 - 以及在线的无定形一切，使互联网感到可管理，甚至是职业。该网站的广告收入通过DOT-COM Boom及以后膨胀并膨胀，从1997年的7040万美元到2004年的35亿美元。 </p><p>  By the end of the 1990s, though, the internet was starting to change. Yahoo was looking for a way to fit in with Web 2.0, where static pages and gate-keeper-funneled attention had been displaced by community-generated content and interactive tools. Being filthy rich, Yahoo decided the obvious answer was to buy a bunch of companies. “They had a huge appetite for social apps,” Baio said. “They knew for them it was a cheap way of getting content that they could put advertising on.” Let the users make the pages, then rake up all the money.</p><p>但到20世纪90年代末，互联网开始改变。雅虎正在寻找一种适合Web 2.0的方法，其中静态页面和门保持漏斗的注意力被社区生成的内容和交互式工具流离失所。肮脏的富裕，雅虎决定了明显的答案是买一堆公司。 “他们对社交应用程序有了很大的胃口，”Baio说。 “他们知道他们这是一个廉价的方式，让他们可以将广告放在上面。”让用户制作页面，然后耙上所有的钱。</p><p>  Yahoo’s first major acquisition to this end was GeoCities, in 1999, for  $3.6 billion. “They paid over $100 per GeoCities user, and that’s still one of the most expensive deals in internet history,” says CJ Reynolds, a doctoral candidate and media researcher at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who considers herself a lifelong Yahoo fan. Reynolds has studied the relationship between GeoCities and Yahoo, and the culture clash between the site’s existing users and the corporate giant’s business interests. (Following the sale, users led a  huge, successful boycott called the “Haunting” to protest Yahoo’s terms of service.) Ten years later, after a series of failed integrations and lackluster attempts at synergy, Yahoo abandoned ship. The cost of maintaining GeoCities’ extremely simple webpages is difficult to know, but it was likely small, Reynolds says. “Shutting down GeoCities was a way to shut down a product that looked old, dated, and still wasn’t strongly associated with the Yahoo brand.”</p><p>  雅虎的首次重大收购是在此目的是地理位，1999年，以36亿美元。 “他们每只地理位置超过100美元，这仍然是互联网历史上最昂贵的交易之一，”希伯来耶路撒冷大学的博士候选人和媒体研究员CJ雷诺兹表示，他认为自己是一场终身的雅虎粉丝。 Reynolds研究了地理和雅虎之间的关系，以及网站现有用户与企业巨头业务利益之间的文化冲突。 （在销售后，用户带领了一个巨大的，成功的抵制，称为“困扰”抗议雅虎的服务条款。）十年后，经过一系列失败的集成和Synergy的巨大尝试，雅虎被遗弃的船。 Reynolds说，维护地理位极其简单的网页的成本很难知道，但很可能很小。 “关闭地理位置是一个封闭产品看起来老，日期的产品的一种方式，仍然与雅虎品牌无关。”</p><p>  In 2005, Yahoo went on a Web 2.0 buying spree, picking up Baio’s event-calendar site, Upcoming, as well as the photo-sharing app Flickr, known for its exuberant user community, and the bookmarking site Delicious, which mainstreamed the idea of letting people write their own tags and organize their own content. Maciej Ceglowski, a web developer who was hired by the Flickr co-founder Caterina Fake to work at Yahoo’s in-house incubator, told me he remembers feeling like he was in the “late Byzantine empire.” At that point, Yahoo had a ton of history, a ton of wealth, and nowhere to go.</p><p>  2005年，雅虎继续购买狂欢，挑选Baio的活动日历网站，即将到来的，并为其旺盛的用户社区而以闻名的方式而闻名，并将其融合的书签网站暗示让人们写自己的标签并组织自己的内容。 Maciej Ceglowski是由Flickr联合创始人Caterina聘请的Web开发人员在雅虎的内部孵化器上工作，告诉我他记得他在“晚拜占庭帝国”中的感觉。此时，雅虎有一大吨历史，大量的财富，无处可去。</p><p> Then Ceglowski paused and started a new metaphor: “You know those 1950s Jell-O molds where it’s clear and there’s a raisin over here and a chicken leg over there? That was kind of what Yahoo was. Embedded in it were these little things with no clear plan or connection.”</p><p> 然后ceglowski停了起来并开始了一个新的比喻：“你知道那些20世纪50年代的果冻模具，这里有一个葡萄干，那边有鸡腿？那种雅虎是什么样的。没有明确的计划或联系，嵌入有这些小​​事。“</p><p> In 2011, Yahoo  sold the raisin that was Delicious to the YouTube co-founders Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, who later  pawned it off to a marketing company, which  sold it to an SEO-optimization expert, who  sold it to Ceglowski in 2017 for just $30,000. “Now it lives as a museum,” Ceglowski told me. (Flickr was sold to a company called SmugMug, which started  mass-deleting photos in 2019; Baio was able to buy Upcoming back from Yahoo  in 2017 and has preserved an archived version.)</p><p> 2011年，雅虎卖掉了对Youtube联合创始人乍得Hurley和Steve Chen的葡萄干，他后来将其销售给营销公司，将其卖给SEO优化专家，他于2017年将其卖给Ceglowski只需30,000美元。 “现在它作为一个博物馆，”Ceglowski告诉我。 （Flickr被卖给了一个名为Smugmug的公司，该公司于2019年开始大规模删除照片; Baio能够在2017年从雅虎开始购买，并保留了归档版本。）</p><p>  In fact, Yahoo’s bad reputation may be thanks, in part, to the fact that it had such a  good eye for acquisitions 15 or 20 years ago. It kept buying things that people really cared about, cool companies that could have had more interesting futures if their founders hadn’t sold them to a megacorporation that would eventually pull them from public view. Ceglowski started a third metaphor with a sadder tinge: “Yahoo put everything behind glass, locked the door, and then walked away,” he said. Then he laughed. “I hope to buy them one day, that’s all I can tell you.”</p><p>  事实上，雅虎的糟糕的声誉可能会感谢，部分原因在于它有15或20年前具有如此良好的收购。如果他们的创始人没有将他们卖给最终将他们从公众视图销售给巨大的公司，那就保留了人们真正关心的东西，这种情况会有更有趣的期货。 Ceglowski与一个悲伤的色调开始了第三个比喻：“雅虎把一切都放在玻璃后面，锁着门，然后走开了，”他说。然后他笑了。 “我希望有一天能买到他们，这就是我能告诉你的全部。”</p><p>  Before Yahoo Answers disappears, a group of volunteers will try to archive tens of millions of its questions and responses. The Archive Team, an ad hoc group led by the Internet Archive’s Jason Scott and loosely affiliated with that organization, has hundreds of people running a specialized program on their computer to open millions of individual pages and save them as compressed-web-archive files, in a format called WARC. But Scott’s team doesn’t even know how many pages there might be. So far, it has managed to store 110 million questions and their answers. “I’d love to get them all, but we’ll never know,” Scott told me.</p><p>  在雅虎答案消失之前，一群志愿者将试图归档成千上万的问题和回应。 Archive团队是由Internet Archive的Jason Scott领导的Ad Hoc集团，并与该组织松散地关联，有数百人在其计算机上运行专门的程序，以开销数百万个单个页面，并将其保存为压缩Web档案文件，以一种名为WARC的格式。但斯科特的团队甚至没有知道有多少页。到目前为止，它已经设法储存了1.1亿个问题及其答案。 “我很乐意让他们全部，但我们永远不会知道，”斯科特告诉我。 </p><p>  It helps that the Archive Team has previously rescued so much Yahoo content. The team’s biggest and messiest preservation project was in 2009, when it tried  to save GeoCities. “That was incredibly difficult,” Scott said. “We didn’t know how big it was. It turned out it was eight terabytes. We only got one of them and it took us nine months.” The most recent large-scale effort was on behalf of  Yahoo Groups, bolstered by members of various fandoms who were highly motivated to save their fan fiction. “I can’t stand when things just disappear,” Dorawen, one of the leaders of the  Yahoo Groups Fandom Rescue Project, told me. If Yahoo Groups was a burning building, she ran out with thousands upon thousands of pseudonymous stories from the  Lord of the Rings, Sims, and  X-Men communities. Then she helped other fans save 300,000 more groups. (She asked to remain anonymous, because she is a teacher and doesn’t want her students to know her fan-fiction pen name.) “This is  our history. We created this information in all this detail.”</p><p>它有助于归档团队以前救出了如此多的雅虎内容。该团队最大和最具混乱的保存项目于2009年，试图拯救地理信息。 “这非常困难，”斯科特说。 “我们不知道它有多大。它结果是八个terabytes。我们只有其中一个，花了9个月。“最近的大规模努力是代表雅虎团体，被各种幻像成员挥霍，这些粉丝的成员被高度动力拯救他们的风扇小说。 “当事情刚刚消失时，我无法忍受，”雅虎群体巡回项目的领导人之一，告诉我。如果雅虎团体是一座燃烧的建筑，她遇到了数千次来自戒指，SIMS和X-MEN社区的成千上万的伪故事。然后她帮助其他粉丝节省了30万个群体。 （她要求保持匿名，因为她是老师，不希望她的学生知道她的粉丝小说笔名。）“这是我们的历史。我们在所有这些细节中创建了这些信息。“</p><p>   The whole situation is kind of funny, but only because it is so bleak. Yahoo made its first fortune from ads placed on its own static webpages, then  attempted to make its second fortune off of ads placed next to the things that people posted. Opinions may vary on whether that means Yahoo owes it to those people—or to posterity—to maintain those posts forever. But even if the company has chosen to abandon all the material on Yahoo Answers, Yahoo Groups, and GeoCities, you’d think it might at least do something to help the archivists who are trying to preserve that content in their free time.</p><p>   整个情况都是有趣的，但只是因为它如此凄凉。 Yahoo从其静态网页上放置的广告首次幸运，然后试图将其第二次财富从被张贴的人旁边放置在旁边。意见可能会有所不同，这是否意味着雅虎归于那些人 - 或者后期 - 永远保持这些帖子。但即使公司选择放弃雅虎答案的所有材料，Yahoo Group和Geocities，您也​​可能认为它可能至少做一些事情来帮助那些试图在空闲时间保持这种内容的档案家。</p><p> That’s not the case. Yahoo could provide basic information to the archivists, such as how many posts or pages there are in total—but it doesn’t. It could also try to stop the volunteers from getting automatically blocked. When hundreds of computers start pulling up pages that haven’t been accessed in years, Yahoo could see that as an attack, and a drain on the company’s resources. In practice, the archivists often find themselves locked out for big chunks of time as they rush to do their work. This was a particularly bad problem with the Yahoo Groups rescue project, because Yahoo Groups was made up of millions of different sites, Scott said. “It slowed down our process, and we were on a tight deadline.”</p><p> 那不是这种情况。雅虎可以向档案馆提供基本信息，例如有多少总帖子或页面 - 但它没有。它也可以试图阻止志愿者自动阻止。当数百台计算机开始拉上尚未访问的页面时，雅虎可以将其视为攻击，并在公司的资源上排水。在实践中，档案馆经常发现自己锁定了大块时间，因为他们急于做到他们的工作。斯科特说，这是雅虎团体救援项目的一个特别糟糕的问题，因为雅虎团体由数百万不同的网站组成。 “它放慢了我们的过程，我们的截止日期紧张。”</p><p>  A Verizon Media spokesperson declined to tell me why the company has been unwilling to address the volunteers’ concerns, and pointed me back to the need to focus on “premium trusted content.” That’s understandable, in a sense. Scrolling through the percolating conversations on Yahoo Answers confirms that much of this material is less than premium, at best. But the company has now decided that it’s junk. People like Andy Baio can’t forgive that casual disregard for the historical value of the stupidest stuff, mixed in with the sublime.</p><p>  Verizon Media Shokesperson拒绝告诉我为什么公司一直不愿意解决志愿者的担忧，并指出我恢复了关注“高级信任内容”的必要性。从某种意义上说，这是可以理解的。通过对雅虎答案的渗透对话滚动证实，许多这些材料少于溢价。但该公司现在已经决定它是垃圾。像Andy Baio这样的人不能原谅愚蠢的东西的历史价值，与崇高混合在一起。</p><p> To Yahoo, a question—“How is babby formed?” or “Can babies see ghosts?” or “Am I too old to have a baby?”—is the same thing as a moment on the stock ticker, or an AP headline popping up in a sidebar, or a weather widget, or an ugly font. “To them it’s indistinguishable,” Baio argued. “If people aren’t looking at it anymore, then you shut it off.”</p><p> 对雅虎，一个问题 - “巴比如何形成？”或者“婴儿可以看到幽灵吗？”或者“我太老了，不能生孩子？” - 在股票机上的时刻，或者在侧边栏中弹出的AP标题，或天气小部件或丑陋的字体。 “对他们来说是难以区分的，”Baio争辩说。 “如果人们不再看它，那么你就会关闭它。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/">https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/how-yahoo-became-internet-villain/618681/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/雅虎/">#雅虎</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/yahoo/">#yahoo</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
