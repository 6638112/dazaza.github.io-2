So feel free to consult your leaders, your team, you peers, what have you. However, it\u2019s on you to put the vision together, or else your management career will devolve into a series of reactions.\n Having said all that, a vision without a strategy is a work of fiction. A fancy idea that will stay an idea. Think of small incremental steps that follow your paths of least resistance to get to your vision. Those small incremental steps become your strategy. Some steps you\u2019ll get right, others you will get wrong. Fail fast, learn, then iterate.\n A strategy without execution is still akin to a work of fiction, more of hard fiction though as opposed to a fancy idea. Execution is taking action, following the steps of your strategy, making things happen, and bringing the vision to reality piece by piece. Believe it or not, but there is a big difference between planning to build a piece of software vs actually building it!\n This is much easier said than done. Orgs change, priorities shift, and no vision is set in stone. You need to be acutely aware of this simple fact &amp; to be ready to change when change is needed. Your strategy will then have to adapt. As in, you\u2019ll have to salvage whatever you can from the existing strategy, then build newer incremental steps that align with the new vision. If you wait for too long, you\u2019ll become stagnant, a slow wheel! Who wants that?!\n  You are responsible for the success and the growth of the people who report to you. You must deeply understand and know your people. The first thing you should know is what motivates them. Some people are motivated by praise, others are motivated by cash, others like to have big impacts. Humans are very sophisticated creatures, we don\u2019t always know what we need or what we want.\n You have to stretch your people a bit and get a feeling for their boundaries. They may be hesitant to make moves, because they might be worried of failure or blame. You have to supply an environment where it was ok to fail, but fail fast and iterate quickly. As your people grow, you grow, your team grows, and your org grows.\n Stretching your people doesn\u2019t mean pushing against their paths of most resistance. You have to align your strategy with your people. For example, if in your strategy you plan to execute heavy user outreach, don\u2019t assign the task to an engineer who\u2019d much prefer to stay awake at 3 AM to figure out a software bug! And no, not all engineers like to do engineering work at the wee hours of the night. And yes, some engineers actually do enjoy user outreach.\n Don\u2019t assume your people are happy. You have to take steps to first know whether they are happy, and then take steps to make them happy if they are not.\n  You have to figure out how build alignments beyond your team. This not only includes other teams, but also key stakeholders, and with neighboring orgs. Key stakeholders are not just other leaders, or your customers. Key stakeholders include the scrappy technician, the genius engineer, the experienced product manager, the passionate program manager, the data driven project manager..etc. They are the ones who can actually make things happen, because they possess the \u2018street knowledge\u2019. They are the ones who know the limitations, the gotchas &amp; the shortcuts in the technology and in the process. If your strategy does not offer wins to other teams or key stakeholders, then your strategy is wrong. Building efficient and ongoing alignment with other stakeholders and organizations is so important for your team\u2019s growth and evolution.\n You need to identify the win-wins, and incorporate it in your strategy , even if it\u2019ll theoretically take a bit of more time. That is because win-win strategies are the most likely to happen. Win-wins mean that you win &amp; others win too, even if you don\u2019t get every single thing that you want. Once you identify the win-wins, share them with other stakeholders, then iterate and evolve. Make stakeholders feel included. Don\u2019t assume they will feel included, you need to make some efforts.\n   Standard", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:44:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

popular belief among young people in the United States today. According to  one survey, 68% of American millennials &#34;agree&#34; or &#34;strongly agree&#34; that they have &#34;more, tougher financial obstacles than previous generations&#34; and 49% believe that they are &#34;living in the worst economic environment in the last century.&#34;\n To be clear, this perception isn&#39;t based on literally  nothing\u2014there are some dimensions along which young people have it worse. But as far as I can tell, this belief, when taken as a whole, is completely, ludicrously false. Pants on fire. It&#39;s not even close to being right.\n Not only are young people not worse off than previous generations, they are better off along nearly every meaningful economic axis.\n   The first most obvious thing to point out is that real GDP per capita\u2014meaning, adjusted for costs of living\u2014is  up about 374% since 1950. If GDP is calculated correctly, it should correspond to mean income levels, which means that the mean income among people alive today is nearly four times higher than it was in 1950.\n  We can also look at the  growth in average personal consumption, which has risen about 950% since 1950, clearly indicating that Americans today have far more  disposable income than in the past.\n  Mean statistics might be misleading of course, since outliers can skew the data (see also the section in this post on inequality). But when you look at statistics tracking median income, you see a similar trend. The U.S. Census Bureau  reports that median household income in 1984 was $52,679, but was $68,703 in 2019, a 30% gain.\n Now, there is a legitimate question of whether these gains have been felt by the younger generations. The National Center for Education Statistics  reveals that real incomes have only increased slightly\u2014about 9%\u2014in the last 25 years for people between the ages of 25 and 34.\n  My first reply is that it\u2019s important to note that median income data can understate the true increases of living standards. That&#39;s because data sources oftentimes only include people&#39;s after-tax take-home pay, after deducting worker benefits like health insurance. When you try to include these benefits, the  growth in real income has been much larger than these statistics generally show.\n My second reply is that, ethically speaking, even if these gains merely reflected the fact that old people are getting richer, rather than young people, it wouldn&#39;t make much of a difference to my general argument, as millennials will eventually get older, and thus benefit from these gains just as old people do now.\n To some, these statistics aren\u2019t enough to show that millennials aren\u2019t doing better. In the face of these statistics, lots of people will still argue that young people are worse off in more subtle ways. Here are some of the most common of these objections and my rebuttals:\n  Yes, but it&#39;s not clear that those things imply that standards of living are declining in any meaningful way. Arguably, the main reason why costs have gone up in these areas is because society is richer, and thus more willing to bear the cost of better facilities and higher wages for healthcare and education workers. This effect is known as  Baumol&#39;s cost disease.\n Health care and education are in many ways  positional goods, though it would probably take a book to compellingly argue for this thesis (here are two:  education and  health care). In this sense, rising costs in these areas don\u2019t necessarily indicate lowering standards of living\u2014quite the opposite in fact.\n As an analogy, imagine if the cost of jewelry went up. Which of the following is more likely to have been the cause of this rise in price: that some combination of greed and exploitation caused sellers to raise their prices, or that people have more disposable income now, and therefore demand more expensive jewelry?\n Consistent with this thesis, healthcare spending and costs  tend to strongly correlate with disposable income. If you believed that rising healthcare costs were indicative of a lowering standard of living, then you should also probably believe that people in the poorest nations on Earth have the highest standards of living\u2014which is obviously absurd.\n   If the main reason why college and healthcare is so expensive is because society is now richer than it was before, then that would imply the opposite of what people normally claim here: that young people have it worse than previous generations.\n But today people need a college degree in order to survive. Back in my parent&#39;s days, you could just get a well paying job as a factory worker right out of high school.\n Yes, credential inflation is a real problem (and one whose  solution is precisely the  opposite of &#34;we need to encourage more people to go to college&#34;), however, the National Center for Education Statistics  data shows almost no difference in median incomes among non-college graduates over the last 25 years. It seems that it has at least not gotten harder recently to enjoy a minimum standard of living without a college degree.\n  The average cost of housing  has gone up over time, but this trend is mainly driven by the fact that modern houses are larger and built better than houses in the past. For example, the average house size has  more than doubled since the 1950s, and new housing must pass stringent regulation to ensure that e.g. there is no lead paint. What matters most is whether people can afford the same quality of housing than their parents and grandparents were able to afford. And the  Zillow mortgage affordability index has tracked the affordability of housing relative to people&#39;s real incomes and  finds that people today have an easier time buying housing relative to their incomes than the previous generations.\n The decline of home ownership is also overblown. Overall, the home ownership rate has actually  slightly risen since the 1960s, though it did enter a decline after peaking in the early 2000s. During nearly this whole period, home ownership rates have stayed within a narrow 6% window from 63% to 69%.\n  [Note: In an illustration of just how nuanced debates about housing prices can get, a user on Reddit pointed out that  the median age of homebuyers has gone from 31 to 47 in the last 4 decades as evidence that the above chart was misleading. But that\u2019s  all homebuyers. When you look at the age of first-home buyers, the trend has  barely budged, rising by a few years since 1981. So, lots people are buying more than one home now\u2014not exactly economic decline.]\n That said, I agree with people who have complained about  burdensome regulations unnecessarily restricting the supply of housing, thus raising prices, and I do hope millennials can be wise enough to eventually repeal this bad policy.\n  Not right now, no. Although student loan debt has increased greatly in recent decades,  the generation with the most debt is technically Generation X. The baby boomers aren&#39;t that far behind either.\n   Debt is also more affordable than it was 40 or 50 years ago. For example, mortgage interest rates have  declined sharply.\n  In the future, millennials will likely take on more debt than their parents, but this won\u2019t necessarily be a bad thing. One of the main functions of debt is to smooth consumption over time. The basic idea is that if you expect to be much richer in the future, it makes sense to take out a lot of debt so that you can enjoy a high standard of living right now, and pay the debt off later. In fact,  nations with the highest average household debt also tend to be the richest. Therefore, rising levels of debt often indicate rising standards of living, not the opposite.\n I should note that this argument can also neatly explain why I\u2019m not worried about the slight decline in relative net worth among millennials as, for instance, talked about in  this recent Bloomberg article.\n  Firstly, economic inequality does not directly determine standards of living. You can have a highly unequal society with high median standards of living, just as you can have a highly equal society with low median standards of living.\n Secondly, whether inequality has gotten worse depends on which statistics you are looking at. The most common measure used to determine inequality is the  Gini coefficient of pre-tax income. In my opinion, this is a bad measure of inequality, as it doesn&#39;t take into account the redistributive effects of taxes and government transfers. It also doesn\u2019t take into account the fact that people&#39;s income will grow over time as their career progresses; a society in which everyone receives the same amount of lifetime income, but in which young people earn lower wages than older people, will be seen as unequal by this measure, which seems ethically arbitrary.\n Another bad measure is wealth inequality, which neglects the reality of consumption smoothing. Under this measure, old people who have saved money for retirement are counted as rich, even if they have a low standard of living, and young medical school graduates who took on a lot debt are counted as poor, even if they are in the top 1% of income earners. It\u2019s not clear why we should care about inequality caused purely by people choosing to save money rather than spend it frivolously.\n Put another way, if Jeff Bezos spent $10 billion to personally fly to the moon and back, this would decrease national wealth inequality compared to just holding stock. And, investing does have social value,  even if it produces inequities.\n For these reasons, I think the only measure of inequality that you should be concerned about is  consumption inequality across one\u2019s lifetime, that is, inequality between people in what they actually purchase to sustain their lifestyle during their lifespan. Numerous studies have found that consumption inequality has  stayed roughly constant since the 1960s.\n   It is true that the 2008 and 2020 economic crises were bad in terms of their effects on employment. However, it&#39;s not clear that this overall economic era is worse than prior eras in terms of employment. The early 1980s recession  saw an unemployment rate of 10.8%, exceeding the maximum experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. The 2020 recession saw even greater unemployment at 14.8%, but this was an extremely acute effect of coronavirus lockdowns. By late 2020, unemployment had nearly returned to historically normal levels. Furthermore, before the 2020 recession, the unemployment rate was at the lowest point it had been in over 50 years.\n  Sure, but millennials were hit with the Great Recession, and now we\u2019re hit with the coronavirus recession.\n The Great Recession was bad relative to previous recessions following the Great Depression. But that\u2019s not the greatest measure of whether quality of life was worse during that time period compared to the past.\n To start, the  frequency of recessions has declined over time in US history. Being hit with only two recessions in one generation actually a historical aberration, when you take a longer-view perspective. The period between 2009-2020 was in fact  the longest period of uninterrupted growth in US history.\n Our expectations tend to warp our experience. Look, a recession is usually defined as some sort of decline in GDP or consumer spending. When GDP goes up by 2%, we don\u2019t call that an anti-recession, or a \u201cboom.\u201d We just call it normal life, since growth rates like that are what we\u2019ve been conditioned to accept.\n When the norm is for things to get better, sometimes mere stagnation can make things seem like things are taking a nosedive. Humans seem to have a  persistent bias towards perceiving that things are getting worse. But it\u2019s important to keep your mind open to the bigger picture. At the bottom of the Great Recession, in quarter 2 of 2009, real GDP per capita  declined to\u2026 the level it was previously at in 2004, just 5 years earlier.\n I know that GDP per capita is not a perfect measure for measuring quality of life. Yet I also know of no other good aggregate measures which don\u2019t follow something similar to this pattern.\n  It\u2019s true that the federal minimum wage   has  declined when adjusted for inflation since the 1970s.\n   However, the minimum wage establishes, as per its name, a  minimum wage level. It doesn&#39;t tell us much about average standard of living. Most states also set  their own minimum wages higher than the federal level.\n Furthermore, since the 1970s\u2014the period of a declining minimum wage\u2014 welfare transfers to the poor went up, arguably raising the minimum standard of living. This rising minimum standard can be illustrated by, for example, the fact that the proportion of Americans who live in severely crowded housing has been  cut by over 75% since 1975, and that air conditioning is  seven times more prevalent among poor households now than in the 1960s.\n  When I first learned in my high school textbooks about the &#34;booming&#34; economic environment of the 1950s, I gathered a sense that the US economy might have already peaked. This opinion was then, and still is, backed by common wisdom that boomers were handed the world on a silver platter and proceeded to ruin it. But when I started looking into real evidence, I found that this concept was based on little more than misconception and a handful of misleading statistics.\n This all makes sense from a psychological perspective. Many young people probably just find it convenient to believe that they have experienced undue economic hardship, since they can win sympathy that way. And most people naturally think that we should care about the plight of young folks more than old folks.\n Nearly everyone is aware of new technological developments, and so they\u2019re probably cognizant in some sense that things are better than before. Yet, most remain unaware that ordinary measures of standards of living are up too. This is all unfortunate however, since the rise in both minimum and average standards of living in the United States\u2014and the world more generally\u2014is one of the most important historical facts you can know.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:44:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5343\u79a7,don,\u751f\u6d3b", "title":

", "note_en": "Today is a doubly important day: it marks the final day of the  PEARL campaign and it is a celebration of another victory for the life extension community.\n PEARL smashed its initial fundraising goal and sailed through its two stretch goals, raising just under $183k thanks to the generous support of the community.\n  The Participatory Evaluation (of) Aging (with) Rapamycin (for) Longevity Study, or PEARL, will launch the first large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine the effects of rapamycin on human aging. The principal investigator is Dr. James P. Watson based at UCLA.\n   Rapamycin is a naturally occurring antifungal antibiotic produced by soil bacteria originally discovered on Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui.\n While most people know it as a drug used in high doses for organ rejection during transplants, it has potential as a drug to slow down aging in far lower doses. It was the first drug proven to  extend the lifespan of mice, even when given late in life, and has been shown to reliably increase the lifespan of yeast, worms, and rats.\n Rapamycin works through the  mTOR signaling pathway, a master regulator of cellular and energy metabolism, and a potent trigger of  autophagy, the ultimate cellular recycling mechanism.\n Recent research shows that it also  improves how our DNA is stored which helps combat  genomic instability resulting from DNA damage and harmful  epigenetic alterations to gene expression which drive the aging process.\n Until now, there has not been a proper clinical trial to evaluate if rapamycin can slow down aging in humans. PEARL is going to change that thanks to our supporters.\n   This large-scale clinical trial will allow the researchers to find out if the effects of rapamycin will translate to people. If that were to happen, then the potential impact could be massive. Having a drug that demonstrably slows down human aging confirmed by large-scale clinical trial data would really open doors. The data could help garner wider public support for life extension therapies as well as support dialogue with policymakers and healthcare regulatory bodies.\n Also, rapamycin is a relatively cheap, off-patent, generic drug and widely available. It has been a registered drug for decades with a well-known safety profile and characteristics. If longevity benefits are confirmed, then it could potentially start being used in healthcare to address aging almost immediately.\n  This has been the most successful crowdfunding campaign we have ever hosted on Lifespan.io, and it is all thanks to you, our amazing life extension community.\n  Over 409 of you have donated just under $183k to the campaign since its launch on May 17th, helping to make this one of the largest, if not the largest, crowdfunded aging focused biology projects in the world.\n This successful fundraising really showcases the growing power of the life extension community, and part of this power comes from the cryptocurrency community. In the last few years, thanks to people like Vitalik Buterin, there has been an increasing level of support from the cryptocurrency community, which is greatly appreciated.\n  The PEARL team and Lifespan.io are incredibly grateful to everyone who donated to PEARL and would like to give special thanks to  Vitalik Buterin, Tom Moya Schau, Micah Zoltu, and Brad Armstrong, who contributed to the campaign with large donations. Thank you so much for your wonderful support; you have really helped to drive this project to success!\n   Due to the huge success of the crowdfunding campaign, the PEARL team wanted to let you all know how the additional funds would be used. The extra money will allow the researchers to measure additional important biomarkers, which will further strengthen the data.\n     Once again from the PEARL team and Lifespan.io, thank you to everyone who has helped make this project possible! For  people in the U.S. interested in participating, please get in touch with\u00a0 Agelessrx and a trial administrator should get back to you.\n Please connect with us on   social media, like and share our content, and help us build grass-roots support for healthy life extension:", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:43:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

\u21a9\u21a92 ", "note_en": "Almost exactly 2 years ago, with the release of v0.7.3,  I announced that Shattered would be dropping support for Android 2.2 Froyo. Now, unfortunately, it\u2019s time to say goodbye to more legacy Android versions.\n v0.9.3 will be the last version of Shattered Pixel Dungeon to support  Android 2.3 Gingerbread, and the less popular  Android 3 Honeycomb. I\u2019ll try to keep support for  Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich going as long as I can, but that one may be near the end of its support life as well.\n Just like with Froyo, I wanted to write a little blog post to summarize why this is happening, and to reminisce a bit on these versions of Android from 2010 and 2011.  1\n  Android 2.3 - 4.0 represents a period of major technical changes for the Android platform. Android 4.0 also brought a complete UI refresh called \u2018holo\u2019, which was the first time Android had a consistent visual design.\n Phones were also roughly doubling in processing power each year during this period. Phones from 2010 topped out at around a single core 1ghz processor, such as my first phone, a  Nexus S. In 2011 though  their successors could easily have dual core 1.2ghz processors.\n Supporting these old Android versions means supporting all of the hardware and software from just before this major transition, which can often cause some technical trouble.\n For Shattered specifically, two game libraries dropped support for Android 2.3 and 3 in mid 2020:  libGDX and  Google Play Billing. For now I\u2019ve been making do with using outdated versions, but as I look to  release on new platforms, and as an  update deadline by Google starts to loom, I\u2019d really like to update to the latest versions. Some parts of libGDX also recently dropped support for Android 4.0, but for the moment I should be able to work around that.\n  Just like with Android 2.2, it\u2019s important to also look at how many devices this change will actually impact.\n Firstly, let\u2019s take a look at the proportion of all devices on Google Play running a particular Android version at five key dates:\n   When PD originally launched these legacy versions where almost the entire Android ecosystem! Even when Shattered launched they were still at almost 25% of all devices. However, today only Android 4.0 has enough devices left to even register in this data. Shattered\u2019s legacy comes from an era where supporting these Android versions was absolutely necessary, but in 2021 the number of devices on these versions is extremely tiny.\n What about the device share for Shattered in particular though? Here\u2019s a chart showing Shattered\u2019s device share for Android 2.2 to 4.0 starting in October 2016:\n  In October 2016 these legacy Android versions were almost 4% of Shattered installs combined, twice the rate they had in Google Play overall! From more approximate data around when Shattered launched (Aug 2014), Android 2.2 was somewhere around 2.5% of all devices and 2.3 and 4.0 were both about 8%.\n As time has gone on usage of these legacy Android versions have fallen substantially though, especially after 2018. Let\u2019s zoom in 2019 and onward for a better look at where things are today:\n  After their drop in 2018, all of the legacy versions were steady for a while. 2.2 and 3 faded first and went toward 0% in late 2020. Android 2.3 lasted longer, but has been dropping sharply over this year. 4.0 has held on a bit better, even growing in 2020, but is now falling away at a slower rate.\n Just like with Android 2.2 in 2019, it seems that the vast majority of the devices which I am ending support for have already stopped playing Shattered.\n  Even just going up to Android 4.1 bumps the user count considerably. Here\u2019s the current proportion of each Android version, first for all apps, then for Shattered, and then the % difference between those:\n   One thing that interests me here is that Shattered used to have a much higher proportion of old android devices than the average. This made sense, if most apps had stopped supporting an Android version, Shattered would have more devices on that version than the average. This doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s the case anymore though. Shattered now has a meager lead for Android 4.3 and older, but otherwise has  LESS old android devices than average!\n In fact, Shattered has more than twice the average number of devices on Android 11! It seems that the days of Shattered having a large number of players on ancient devices have passed. Nowadays the game\u2019s more complex nature causes it to skew heavily toward more dedicated users, who tend to use more modern devices.\n I\u2019ll keep support going as long as I can for each Android version, but it\u2019s nice to know that Shattered has largely outlasted the older devices that it used to support.\n  I\u2019m going to be making another blog post soon, to talk more about the next update. I\u2019m currently planning for this post to be late this month, or possibly early July. If you want quicker, shorter updates about what I\u2019m working on, consider following me on  Twitter!\n If you enjoy Shattered and want to help me keep making it,  please consider supporting me on Patreon! Patrons get access to exclusive weekly mini blogs about upcoming updates, a monthly Q&amp;A livestream, and also help determine content direction through community polls!\n   The title image for this blog was taken from Google\u2019s Android history page, which has wonderful graphics for each version up to 6.0. It\u2019s unfortunately no longer online, but can be accessed (with a little jank) via the  wayback machine.\u00a0 \u21a9\n  The AppBrain\u2019s charts aren\u2019t perfectly accurate to all devices on Google Play, but it\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got since Google stopped reporting their own numbers. From looking at past data, it seems AppBrain skews slightly in favor of more modern Android versions, which only strengthens the points I made in this post.\u00a0 \u21a9\u00a0 \u21a9 2", "posttime": "2021-06-19 09:43:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "android,\u544a\u522b,goodbye", "title": "\u544a\u522bAndroid 2.3\u59dc\u997c ", "title_en": "Saying Goodbye to Android 2.3 Gingerbread", "transed": 1, "url": "https://shatteredpixel.com/blog/saying-goodbye-to-android-2.3-gingerbread.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["android", "\u544a\u522b", "goodbye"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066809, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u62e5\u6709\u5e76\u559c\u6b22\u6211\u7684USB\u952e\u76d8\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u201cLenovo ThinkPad Compact USBKeyboard\u4e0eTrackPoint\u201d\uff08KU-1255\uff09\u3002\u5b83\u5f88\u5c0f\u4e14\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u5b83\u7684\u6258\u67b6\uff0c\u4f60\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u952e\u76d8\u79fb\u52a8\u4f60\u7684\u624b\u6765\u79fb\u52a8\u9f20\u6807\u6307\u9488\u3002\u4e0d\u5e78\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8054\u60f3\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u51fa\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u6709\u7528\u7684\uff1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6eda\u52a8\u4e86\u9f20\u6807\u6eda\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u534a\u6298\u53e0\u3002\n  \u952e\u76d8\u56fa\u4ef6\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7981\u7528\u6216\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e2d\u9f20\u6807\u6309\u94ae\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u88ab\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u9f20\u6807utton\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u9f20\u6807\u6eda\u52a8\uff1a\u53ea\u8981\u662f\u6309\u94ae\uff0c\u5782\u76f4\u6258\u7ba1\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u88ab\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210Scrollevents\u3002\u4f46\u53ea\u662f\u5782\u76f4\u548c\u771f\u6b63\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4f60\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u624d\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u7ebf\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u63a5\u8fd1\u50cf\u7d20\u660e\u667a\u3002\n \u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u6eda\u52a8\u89e6\u53d1\u540e\u91ca\u653e\u4e2d\u9f20\u6807\u6309\u94ae\u89e6\u53d1Middlemouse\u5355\u51fb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u7834\u574f\u6eda\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n Linux\u5728\u6b64\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u952e\u76d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Windows\u6216FreeBSD\u4e0a\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u4e22\u5931\u3002\n \u8054\u60f3\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7ed9\u6211\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u952e\u76d8\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u786c\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n  \u5f00\u59cb\u5427\uff01\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u952e\u76d8\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u91cc\u9762\u6709\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1aSonix SN8F2288FG\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a8\u4f4d\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u670912k\u5b57ROM\uff0c512 BRAM\u548c\u5947\u602a\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\n  \u5728Lenovo\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u952e\u76d8\u7684Updater\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u56fa\u4ef6\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u9996\u5148 \n\u5728\u73a9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u56fa\u4ef6\u3002\u5b83\u4e0e0x5a.Search ......

It is small and with its trackpoint, youdon\u2019t even need to move your hands from the keyboard to move the mouse pointer.Unfortunately, Lenovo went far beyond what\u2019s useful: They implementedmiddle-mouse button scrolling in hardware, but half-broken.\n  The keyboard firmware supports different modes, on of them disables or activatesthe middle mouse button. If it is activated, you can use the middle mousebutton. As a bonus, you get a kind-of middle-mouse scrolling: As long as youpress the button, vertical trackpoint movements are translated to scrollevents. But just vertical and in a really coarse way, so that you can onlyscroll line-wise, but not close to pixel-wise.\n In addition, releasing the middle mouse button after scrolling triggers a middlemouse click event, ruining the scroll feature totally.\n Linux works around this, for this particular keyboard, but on Windows orFreeBSD, you\u2019re lost.\n Lenovo didn\u2019t recognise the problem, but sent me a new keyboard instead,assuming it was a hardware issue.\n  Let\u2019s start! First, we take the keyboard apart and look what\u2019s inside:A Sonix SN8F2288FG. It\u2019s an 8-bit microcontroller with 12k words ROM, 512 BRAM and a weird architecture.\n  On Lenovo\u2019s website, you can download the updater for the keyboard. It containsthe firmware binary. Download it first: tp_compact_usb_kb_with_trackpoint_fw.exe (MD5 2c128084412b917449a2c01da3c49451, SHA256 7116a3819ee094857d21e4671cb6cf953d582372126f0f6728f6b2421eda7bd4), then put itinto the free version of IDA Pro.\n After playing around a bit, I found the firmware. It is XORed with 0x5A.Search for  Auto .....a..2015051111591234567817EF60478521SN8F2288 to find it.\n Then, put that firmware binary into the free SN8 disassembler  dissn8.When I started, I had to add a few instructions and patch some others to decodethe binary correctly. To verify, I cross-checked by assembling and disassemblingwith SN8 C Studio.\n Then, it was time to print the assembly on paper, sit down and understand it.\n After a while, I found the place that implements the \u201cfeature\u201d I disliked andpatched it out. I also bumped the firmware version to be discern my modifiedversion from the original:\n --- orig/firmware-annotated-SN8CStudio.asm\t2019-06-10 22:06:46.782287000 +0200+++ patched/firmware.asm\t2019-06-10 22:06:54.378983000 +0200@@ -2188,13 +2188,16 @@ label_06d5: ; &lt;- 06d3 CALL iic_stop ; only apply speed factor if !middle_button_pressed (i.e. scrolling):- BTS0 flag_middle_button_pressed- JMP tp_skip_apply_speed+; BTS0 flag_middle_button_pressed+; JMP tp_skip_apply_speed+\tNOP+\tNOP CALL tp_apply_speed_x CALL tp_apply_speed_y CALL copy_clamp_tp_mouse_pos ; tp_mouse_d? -&gt; mouse_d? tp_skip_apply_speed: ; &lt;- 06d7- BTS1 flag_middle_button_pressed+; BTS1 flag_middle_button_pressed+ BSET 0x14.6 ; cool, enough space to fit that. so that button 3 is reported reported properly.

causing \u00a325,000 worth of damage to Shell\u2019s HQ in London despite the defendants admitting that they caused the damage and the judge informing the jury that the defendants had no legal defence. In other words, if the law were applied correctly, the jury had no choice but to find them guilty. When juries deviate from the law and \u201cgo rogue\u201d like this, it is known as  \u201cnullification\u201d. But when, if ever, should juries behave in this way?\n On April 15 th 2019, seven Extinction Rebellion protestors  damaged Shell\u2019s London HQ in an attempt to draw attention to Shell\u2019s role in the climate emergency. A quick refresher: Shell has  undermined action on climate change and the magnitude of its  continuing investment in fossil fuels is incompatible with safe levels of global warming.\n Six of the seven protestors pled not-guilty and their case recently came to trial. At the trial the defendants, representing themselves, admitted their actions but claimed it was a \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cproportionate\u201d response to the serious injury and death being caused by Shell. The weakness of this defence is that it has no basis in law. Nevertheless the jury acquitted, presumably convinced that, although the defendants acted illegally, they were morally right or, at least, not blameworthy. That\u2019s to say, the jurors followed their consciences rather than applying the law.\n Are juries allowed to behave i  n this way? The short answer is \u2018yes\u2019 but they are strongly discouraged from even considering it. Juries are typically instructed by the judge to determine the veracity and significance of the evidence,\u00a0apply that evidence to the law, and reach a verdict without allowing sympathy to compromise their evaluation. They aren\u2019t supposed to question the law itself. Furthermore, if the lawyers arguing the case suggest to the jury that they are not required to apply the law when coming to a verdict, they are in contempt of court and a mistrial may be declared.\n The laws governing jury behaviour are mainly concerned with restricting the jury to the evidence presented in court. If, prior to the verdict, jurors seek information or discuss the case outside of court, they are in contempt of court. Jurors swear an oath which varies, but in the UK it is to \u201c faithfully try the defendant and give a true verdict according to the evidence\u201d. There isn\u2019t, however, any legal requirement governing the reasoning that the jury must use in coming to a decision. In part, this is because the jury\u2019s deliberation should be free from manipulation and any policing of it would compromise that. \u00a0So, the laws governing the jury leave jurors the freedom to ignore the law or the judge\u2019s guidance on how the law should be applied.\n Because the jury\u2019s reasoning is not in question, their verdict is taken at face value with some very rare exceptions. For example, a jury for a murder trial in Kentucky agreed to  flip a coin to settle on their guilty verdict after nine hours of deliberation. The judge somehow found out about it and declared a mistrial but, if the jurors had kept it secret, presumably there would have been no investigation into how the verdict was reached. In some jurisdictions, a judge can  overrule a guilty verdict if he or she thinks that no reasonable jury could have some to such a conclusion. This is to protect defendants from malicious juries.\n Given that juries have the power of nullification, should they use it? There is a reason to nullify when one believes the defendant is morally blameless (all things consider  ed) so that they would be unjustly punished if convicted. Assuming one should act to defend another from unjust harm where one can easily do so, then one should act to prevent the conviction of a blameless defendant (Huemer 2018). This reasoning (perhaps implicit) was presumably driving the jury\u2019s decision in the Shell case. Indeed, there was a symmetry here in that the defendants were aiming to prevent Shell causing unjust harm to third parties due to climate change.\n As an aside, this suggests an interested legal defence strategy for environmental and social justice activists \u2013 one mightn\u2019t be able to suggest to the jury that they have the power of nullification but one might model the reasoning that you want the jury to adopt by emphasising how the defendant acted to prevent unjust harm to third parties.\n Jurors might hesitate to nullify when they consider the possibility of prejudiced juries. Might, for example, a jury of racist whites ignore the law to acquit a white person who had murdered a black person?\u00a0 A jury of prejudiced whites may mistakenly [1] judge that the punishment for murder is disproportionate when a white man kills a black man. (Although, as it happens, juries tend to mitigate the racism of police, prosecutors and judges, see Clay [1998 and comment below] and the  Lammy Review.)\n One reason in favour of applying the law rather than following one\u2019s conscience, is that the laws have been established by a liberal democracy [2] and represent a tested store of knowledge. For example, the typical person wouldn\u2019t necessarily come up with the standard of \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019 on their own, but we have settled on it as a good standard through generations of collective critical reflection. Therefore, if one\u2019s conscience clashes with the law, that should give one pause. Is the defendant really blameless? Perhaps their punishment would not be unjust after all? Do I have reason to think that my personal moral judgment is superior to the accumulated wisdom of the law?\n This line of reasoning suggests that nullification is more justifiable when the process by which a law has been developed leaves it out of step with morality. Consider just two ways this might happen: First, the moral landscape might shift quickly, leaving the relatively slow process of legislation behind. When this happens, the existing law can begin to deliver perverse outcomes. Second, the law might be undemocratic because powerful lobbyists have had an undue say in designing that law.\n Both factors are arguably at play in the Shell case. The existential threat of climate change has created new moral demands to quickly change the societal structures locking us in to self-destructive practices. When people were developing property law they (understandably) didn\u2019t consider that people might target the property of companies pushing humanity towards social collapse. Shell has also lobbied to prevent policies that would limit climate change thereby contributing to the urgency and desperation of people trying to prevent social collapse. So, in the Shell case, the jurors had good reasons to favour their consciences over the law.\n In contrast, the prejudiced white jury considering whether to acquit the white murderer of a black man should consider the principle of \u201cequality before the law\u201d. According to this principle the colour of a murderer\u2019s or a victim\u2019s skin should have no bearing on the punishment for the crime. There is little ground to doubt this well-established principle; it has been carefully considered and it is nearly universally agreed to be a cornerstone of liberal society. Furthermore, this kind of racially charged case is exactly what legislators were thinking about when settling on the principle, so it is highly unlikely that there will be any morally relevant differences in this particular case that would justify an exception.\n In short, when considering going rogue, jurors should aim to strike a balance between following their own sense of justice and respecting the accumulated cultural knowledge represented by the law. This certainly leaves room for justified (even morally obligatory) nullification and we might expect to see much more of it in the near future in relation to environmental protests and other social justice movements.\n  [1] Of course, these juries might not be making mistakes but rather be deliberately aiming to impose their world view on others without any regard for justice. I set these cases aside and focus only on cases where the jury is sincerely motivated by justice.\n   Conrad, Clay S.

", "note_en": "Smartphone and smartwatch data provided crucial evidence that led yesterday to a man confessing to murdering his wife. The data showed that his story about what happened could not have been true\u2026\n  Greek helicopter pilot Babis Anagnostopoulos originally claimed that his wife was killed by robbers during a home invasion. However, data from his own phone, his wife\u2019s smartwatch and their home surveillance system all contradicted his version of events.\n  A 33-year-old pilot has confessed to the killing of his young British wife, Caroline Crouch, police say, in a crime that shocked Greece. Anagnostopoulos originally claimed three robbers had broken into the couple\u2019s Athens home and tied him up. But after a lengthy investigation, police said his story did not add up.\n Then they checked a range of technical devices to corroborate his account. Caroline Crouch\u2019s biometric watch revealed her pulse readings on the day she died. Babis Anagnostopoulos\u2019s movements were also tracked via his mobile phone, and the couple\u2019s surveillance system also highlighted discrepancies [\u2026]\n Caroline Crouch\u2019s smart watch showed that her heart was still beating at the time her husband claimed she was murdered. The activity tracker on his phone showed him moving around the house while he said he was tied up; and the recorded time at which data cards were removed from the home security camera also told a different story to his version of events [\u2026]\n Detectives approached him after the memorial service on Alonnisos on Thursday, asking him to go with them to Athens, saying there had been a breakthrough in the inquiry and they wanted to identify a suspect. It was only when he arrived in the capital he was told that he was the suspect.\n It\u2019s not the first time that data from a smartphone has helped to solve a crime. iPhone data also proved crucial in  a very similar case in 2018, when a man again claimed that his wife had been killed by intruders.\n A pharmacist in the UK murdered his wife, then tried to make it look like intruders had broken into the home and carried out the killing [\u2026] but activity data from the iPhones of both murderer and victim showed what really happened.\n Patel\u2019s deception was uncovered after police examined the iPhone health app, which tracks the user\u2019s steps throughout the day, on his and his wife\u2019s phones.\n In the minutes that followed Jessica\u2019s death, Patel\u2019s phone monitored frantic activity, racing around the house as he staged the burglary and running up and down the stairs.

Specifically, 21 cats belonging to 2 breeds (Maine Coon and European Shorthair) have been repeatedly exposed to three different stimuli that were expected to induce the emission of meows:\n Brushing - Cats were brushed by their owners in their home environment for a maximum of 5 minutes;\n  Isolation in an unfamiliar environment - Cats were transferred by their owners into an unfamiliar environment (e.g., a room in a different apartment or an office). Distance was minimized and the usual transportation routine was adopted so as to avoid discomfort to animals. The journey lasted less than 30 minutes and cats were allowed 30 minutes with their owners to recover from transportation, before being isolated in the unfamiliar environment, where they stayed alone for maximum 5 minutes;\n  Waiting for food - The owner started the routine operations that preceded food delivery in the usual environment the cat was familiar with. Food was given at most 5 minutes after the beginning of the experiment.\n The dataset has been produced and employed in the context of an interdepartmental project of the University of Milan (for further information, please refer to this  doi). The content of the dataset has been described in detail in a scientific work currently under review; the reference will be provided as soon as the paper is published.\n  Files containing meows are in the  dataset.zip archive. They are PCM streams (.wav). Naming conventions follow the pattern\u00a0C_NNNNN_BB_SS_OOOOO_RXX, which has to be exploded as follows:\n C = emission context (values: B =\u00a0brushing; F =\u00a0waiting for food; I: isolation in an unfamiliar environment);\n      SS = sex (values: FI = female, intact; FN: female, neutered; MI: male, intact; MN: male, neutered);\n  The  extra.zip\u00a0archive contains excluded recordings (sounds other than meows emitted by cats) and uncut sequences of close vocalizations.\n   The authors require to acknowledge their work and, in case of scientific publication,\u00a0to cite the most suitable reference among the following entries:\n Ntalampiras, S., Ludovico, L.A., Presti, G., Prato Previde, E., Battini, M., Cannas, S., Palestrini, C., Mattiello, S.: Automatic Classification of Cat Vocalizations Emitted in Different Contexts.

After the May 17, 2021 announcement of Siemens acquiring SupplyFrame (which include Hackaday and Tindie), we reached out to Siemens  via Twitter and email to interview the new owners at Siemens. Here are the questions we sent over. Special thanks to Noah at Siemens for getting these back over to us, and the electronics and engineering community. As a matter of disclosure, I started Hackaday and designed the logo/site design over 17 years ago, and had nothing to do with this sale in any way to SupplyFrame in 2013, or Siemens in 2021.\n Adafruit: SupplyFrame is a search/advertising and data company, it was purchased for $700m (reported), with the estimated 2021 revenue for SupplyFrame for 2021 of $70m \u2013 how does SupplyFrame and specifically findchips.com fit into Siemens? Where do Hackaday (the editorial site), hackaday.io (community projects/events), and Tindie fit?\n The Siemens  press release says the acquisition strengthens the Siemens portfolio through Software as a Service (SaaS) \u2013 not only in the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) and Printed Circuit Boards (PCB), but also scaling into other domains and technology fields. Can you tell us more about the vision for the Siemens portfolio? How do SupplyFrame and Avatar fit together, for example (Avatar being a recent acquisition as well).\n  Siemens\u2019 vision relative to this planned acquisition is clear: Supplyframe will be the nucleus, competence center and strategic core for future Siemens Digital Industries marketplace offerings. Acquiring Supplyframe provides Siemens with an outstanding opportunity to accelerate our marketplace vision and to complement and expand Siemens\u2019 ecosystem of digital services, software and platform offerings. Supplyframe\u2019s SaaS solutions are ideally positioned to bridge the chasm between manufacturer and supplier \u2013 the buy side and the supply side \u2013 resulting in cost optimization, increased agility, and highly informed decisions. And finally, Supplyframe offers Siemens the opportunity enhance a range of Siemens DI products.\n  Adafruit: For the businesses and events that SupplyFrame owned, will Siemens continue to hold Hackaday SuperCon? Will Siemens continue to develop and support Tindie? And will there be a Hackaday Prize in 2022 (and beyond)? How independent does Siemens intend to keep SupplyFrame from the rest of its operations? Will Tindie and Hackaday continue to be subsidiaries of SupplyFrame, or will they move under the Siemens umbrella? Who does Steve, the CEO of SupplyFrame, report to, Mike, the Editor at Hackaday?\n  Although it\u2019s too early to speak to many of the specifics of your question, we can tell you that our plans call for Supplyframe to remain a separate, standalone unit within Siemens Digital Industries Software under the continued leadership of Supplyframe\u2019s CEO Steve Flagg, who will report directly to Siemens Digital Industries Software\u2019s president and CEO Tony Hemmelgarn. And speaking more broadly, Siemens is committed to keeping the DNA of Supplyframe as an entrepreneurial entity. Over the past decade, Siemens has successfully integrated 40 acquisitions within Digital Industries Software, including the recent integration of Mendix (www.mendix.com), which has accelerated their growth and substantially improved their market position as they\u2019ve remained a separate organization and the intention with SupplyFrame is similar.\n  Adafruit: Hackaday.io hosts a variety of unusual projects. Will Siemens exert any content restrictions over independent creators there? Will Siemens provide staff to care for and manage the Hackaday community?\n    Adafruit: Under which data policies/privacy policies/terms of service will Hackaday and Tindie fall under after the acquisition is completed? Will there be any changes to what the users own and what Siemens owns?\n    Adafruit: This is primarily a question for the current staff since they may not know, or probably would want me to ask \u2013 Will Siemens do due diligence around equity in shares, salaries, and titles around roles at Supplyframe, Hackaday, and Tindie?\n  Until the deal closes it\u2019s too early to answer all the specifics of this question. But we can tell you that Siemens strongly believes that the people at Supplyframe are the main reason for Supplyframe\u2019s success; therefore, we are highly focused on retaining its world class employees.\n  Adafruit: Siemens has a new CEO as of February (Roland Busch). How does Roland perceive the hacker/maker community, especially compared to the traditional engineering industry Siemens has historically serviced?\n  Roland has been quite clear in his commitment to continuing Siemens\u2019 digital transformation, and to expanding Siemens to new segments and to reach new customers including makers. Siemens has invested over ten billion euros acquiring new software and has plans to continue with additional acquisitions. Acquisitions add value for Siemens and our customers and SupplyFrame is a prime example for such an acquisition.\n  Adafruit: Has any Siemens staff posted on Hackaday, a project on hackaday.io, purchased or sold something on Tindie?\n    Adafruit: Will the DesignLab space in Pasadena continue to host community events and residency programs?\n    Adafruit: Altium acquired Octopart and Ciiva, Mouser (owned by TTI) acquired CrowdSupply, Avnet acquired hackster.io and Dragon Innovation, Autodesk acquired Instructables, Upchain, and EAGLE, Newark is element14, so it appears there is a consolidation for electronic tools, community, and mind share\u2026 What other types of \u201cmaker\u201d type companies or technologies is Siemens looking for acquisition?\n    Adafruit: Seventeen years ago, I started Hackaday, the site, the mission, and designed the logo that is still in use today; please take good care of it \u2013 the SupplyFrame folks did a pretty good job.

G \n...... ", "note_en": "I am often asked in emails how to go about learning the necessary mathematics for getting a job in quantitative finance or data science if it isn&#39;t possible to head to university. This article is a response to such emails. I want to discuss how you can become a mathematical  autodidact using nothing but a range of relatively reasonably priced textbooks and resources on the internet. While it is far from easy to sustain the necessary effort to achieve such a task outside of a formal setting, it is possible with the resources (both paid and free) that are now available.\n  We&#39;ll begin by discussing the reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics, be it career-driven, to gain entrance into formal education or even as a hobby. We&#39;ll then outline the time commitment required for each stage of the process, from junior highschool (UK GCSE equivalent) through to postgraduate/research level work. I will then present the different study materials available for the equivalent of an undergraduate course, how to access them and how to make the best use of them. Finally, I will describe a mathematical syllabus that takes you all the way through a modern four-year Masters-level UK-style undergraduate course in mathematics, as applicable mainly to quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  In this particular article we will consider the first year of an undergraduate course. The remaining articles will each discuss subsequent years.\n    The first question to ask yourself is why you want to learn mathematics in the first place. It is an extremely serious undertaking and requires substantial long-term commitment over a number of years, so it is absolutely imperative that there is a strong underlying motivation, otherwise it is unlikely that you will stick with self-study over the long term.\n  For the majority of you on this site, it is because you wish to gain employment and/or further formal study in the field of quantitative finance, data science or scientific software development.\n  You might be an individual at the beginning of your educational career, deciding whether to take a formal university program in mathematics. You might have worked in a technical industry for 10-15 years, but seek a new role and wish to understand the necessary prerequisite material for the career change. You might also enjoy studying in your own time but lack a structured approach and want a reasonably linear path to follow.\n  One of the primary reasons for wanting to learn advanced mathematics is to become a &#34;quant&#34;. However, if your sole reason for wanting to learn these topics is to get a job in the sector, particularly in an investment bank or quantitative hedge fund, I would strongly advise you to carry out mathematics in a formal setting (i.e. at university). This is not because self-study will be any less valuable or teach you less than in a formal setting, but because the  credential from a  top university is, unfortunately, what often counts in getting interviews, at least for those early in their career.\n  An alternative reason for learning mathematics is because you wish to gain a deeper understanding of how the universe works. Mathematics is ultimately about formalising systems and understanding space, shape and structure. It is the &#34;language of nature&#34; and is utilised heavily in all of the quantitative sciences. It is also fascinating in its own right. If you are heavily interested in learning more about deeper areas of mathematics, but lack the ability to carry it out in a formal setting, this article series will help you gain the necessary mathematical maturity, if you are willing to put in the effort.\n    I want to emphasise that studying mathematics from the level of a junior highschooler to postgraduate level (if desired) will require a huge commitment in time, likely on the order of 10-15  years. Clearly this is a staggering commitment to undertake and, without a strong study-plan, will likely not be completed due to the simple fact that &#34;life often gets in the way&#34;.\n  However, chances are if you are considering studying advanced mathematics you will already have formal qualifications in the basics, particularly the mathematics learnt in junior and senior highschool (GCSE and A-Level for those of us in the UK!). In this instance it is likely that you might be able to begin learning at the start of the undergraduate level, or possibly at the level of an advanced highschool student.\n  Even if you have the equivalent qualifications in A-Level Mathematics or A-Level Further Mathematics, you will still have a long road ahead of you. I estimate that it will take approximately 3-4 years of full-time study or 6-8 years of part-time study, in order to have an equivalent knowledge base gained by an individual who has carried out formal study in a UK undergraduate mathematics program to masters level.\n  While I don&#39;t think it is necessary to have postgraduate qualifications to become a quant, it is useful and can certainly put you ahead of the competition. However, do not be put off by the time commitment for postgraduate study. It isn&#39;t absolutely necessary and is likely to be carried out in a formal, full-time setting regardless.\n  If you are happy with this overall level of commitment, then the broad path that you will follow should look something like this:\n    As you can see, a mathematics education to a high level can take anywhere from 3 years to approximately 15 years (or more!) depending on your chosen path. Hence this is not something to be undertaken lightly. You must give it serious consideration and make sure that the payoff (financial or otherwise) from study will be worth the serious effort required.\n    These days it is possible to study from a mixture of freely available video lectures, lecture notes and textbooks. There are those who learn better from watching videos and making notes, while others enjoy working methodically through a textbook. I&#39;ve listed what I consider to be the most useful resources below.\n    At the undergraduate level, I am a big fan of the  Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series of textbooks, which cover pretty much every major course you will find on a  top-tier mathematics undergraduate degree in the UK. I will go into detail regarding choices of books for specific modules below.\n  I&#39;ve also found the  Schaum&#39;s Outlines series of books to be extremely helpful, particularly for those who like to learn by answering questions. While they don&#39;t go into the detail that others might (particularly the SUMS books above), they do help consolidate the basics by working through a lot of questions. I highly recommend them if you&#39;ve not seen any of the material before.\n    Many Universities provide publicly accessible course pages that contain freely available lecture notes, often in PDF format, typeset in LaTeX or similar. Where appropriate, I&#39;ve listed freely available lecture notes for particular courses. However, I prefer to recommend textbooks as they tend to cover a wider set of material. They aren&#39;t &#34;cherry picking&#34; material in a way that a lecturer will have to do so in order to fit the material into semester-length courses. Despite this issue, there are some extremely good lecture notes available online.\n    The rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has fundamentally changed the way students now interact with lecturers, whether they are enrolled on a particular course or not. Leaders in the field include  MIT Open Courseware,  Coursera and  Udacity. Some MOOCs are free, while others charge. On the whole, I&#39;ve found MOOCs to be a great mechanism for learning as they are similar to how students learn at University, in a lecture setting.\n  They provide the added benefits of being able to pause videos, rewind them, interaction with lecturers on online portals as well as easy access to supplementary materials. Some have suggested that the quality of MOOCs is not as good as that which can be found in a University setting, but I disagree with this. On the whole, most MOOCs are actually  lectures filmed in University settings, so I feel this point is somewhat moot.\n  There are some extremely good MOOCs available in data science, machine learning and quantitative finance. However, I have found there to be a lack of more fundamental courses and as such you&#39;ll see me recommending textbooks for the majority of the courses listed here. As the focus turns to quantiative finance (in Year 3 and 4, as well as at the MFE level), I will be able to recommend more MOOCs in addition to traditional textbooks.\n    At this stage of your mathematical career you will be familiar with the basics of differential and integral calculus, trigonometric identities, perhaps some elementary linear algebra and possibly some elementary group theory, gained from highschool or through self-study.\n  However, there is a substantial shift in mindset when moving from A-Level/highschool mathematics to that studied in a typical UK undergraduate program. The methods for teaching mathematics at highschool level are largely mechanical in nature and do not require a deep level of thinking. At University, mathematics becomes largely about formal systems of axioms and an emphasis on formal proofs.\n  This means that ones thinking is shifted from mechanical solution of problems, utilising a &#34;toolbox&#34; of techniques, towards deep thought about disparate areas of mathematics that can be linked in order to prove results. It is the fundamental difference between highschool mathematics and undergraduate mathematics.\n  In fact, it is this particular mode of thinking that makes mathematics such a highly sought after degree in the quantitative finance world.\n  Self-study of university level mathematics is not an easy task, by any means. It requires a substantial level of discipline and effort to not only make the cognitive shift into &#34;theorem and proof&#34; mathematics, but also to do this as a full autodidact.\n  For those of you who are unable or unwilling to carry out formal study in a university setting and wish to tackle a full syllabus of undergraduate mathematics, I have created a comprehensive study plan below to take you from high school level mathematics to the equivalent of a four-year Masters in Mathematics undergraduate course. I have presented it in a year-by-year, module-by-module format with plenty of further reference materials to study at your own pace.\n  Since a degree course is often tailored to the desires of the individual in the latter two years, I have created a syllabus which broadly reflects the topics that a prospective quant should know. However, you can obviously add your own choices for your own particular situation. To this end, I have made suggestions where appropriate.\n  This article will concentrate on Year 1 of a degree program, with subsequent articles each covering an entire year.\n    The first year in an undergraduate mathematics education is primarily about shifting your mindset from the &#34;mechanical&#34; approach taught at highschool/A-Level into the &#34;formal systems&#34; approach that is studied at university. Hence, there is a much more rigourous emphasis on  mathematical foundations, including formal descriptions of  sets,  maps/functions,  continuity and  symmetry, as well as  theorems and  proofs.\n  The courses found in a first year largely reflect this transition, whereby the following core topics are emphasised:\n          Most  top-tier UK undergraduate courses have a &#34;Foundations&#34; module of some description. The goal of the course is to provide you with a detailed overview of the nature of university mathematics, including the notions of proof (such as  proof by induction and  proof by contradiction), the concept of a  map or  function, as well as the differing types such as the  injection,  surjection and  bijection.\n  In addition to these topics, the concept of a  set is formally outlined, as well as the induced structure on such sets by  operations, leading to the concept of  groups. These core topics and ideas will prepare you for the deeper topics of analysis, linear algebra and differential equations that form the remainder of a first year undergraduate syllabus.\n  Self-study of mathematical foundations can be challenging, as it is often the first time you will have seen the concept of a proof. It can be bewildering at the beginning to understand how proofs can be constructed, but as with everything else in life, it is possible to learn how to structure proofs through a lot of reading and practice.\n  Perhaps the best way to learn mathematical foundations is through &#34;bedside reading&#34;, or perhaps more rigourous study, of some of the better known textbooks. I myself learnt from the following two books listed under  Study Materials below. I can highly recommend them as they certainly provide a good taste as to what university mathematics is all about.\n        Real Analysis is a staple course in first year undergraduate mathematics. It is an extremely important topic, especially for quants, as it forms the basis for later courses in stochastic calculus and partial differential equations. The subject is primarily about  real numbers and functions between sets of real numbers. The main topics discussed include  sequences,  series,  convergence,  limits,  calculus and  continuity.\n  The primary benefit of studying real analysis is that it provides a gentle introduction to proofs, using examples that aren&#39;t too unfamiliar from A-Level (highschool equivalent) mathematics. In this way, real analysis courses teach not only the &#34;mindset&#34; of forming proofs, but also introduce more abstract concepts such as &#34;proper&#34; definitions of  infinity,  axioms (such as the  axiom of completeness) and some good experience manipulating  continuous functions and their  derivatives.\n  In order to learn Real Analysis by yourself, I would suggest taking a look at the textbook  Numbers and Functions: Steps into Analysis \r listed below. I used this to learn Real Analysis when I was at university and I found it extremely helpful. The book teaches you by getting you to carry out a large number of questions, rather than throwing a huge amount of text at you. In this way you  learn by doing. In addition to that book, I have listed a few others that are helpful. Finally, I&#39;ve listed a  YouTube playlist series from Harvey Mudd College, by Professor Francis Su. The video quality is not great, but the content is extremely good.\n        Linear Algebra is one of the most important, if not the most important, subjects to learn for a prospective quant or data scientist.\n  In an abstract sense Linear Algebra is about the study of  linear maps between  vector spaces. It teaches us that in certain cases linear maps and  matrices are actually equivalent. This latter result makes it extremely useful when dealing with matrix equations, of which there are many within quantitative finance and data science.\n  The majority of  statistical machine learning methods are based on the principles of linear algebra and calculus, as are many quantitative finance theories, such as the  covariance matrix and the  capital asset pricing model. Hence, it is imperative for prospective quants to learn it well.\n  Thankfully, Linear Algebra has such a wide applicability in mathematics, physics, engineering and science in general, that there are many great resources available for learning it. One of the best books to learn about it is by  Gilbert Strang, a professor at MIT. In addition to his textbook, you can also find a set of video lectures presented by him on MIT Open Courseware.\n        The subject of differential equations permeates wide areas of quantitative finance. They are an extremely important subject for a prospective quant to learn, as stochastic differential equations play a large part in options pricing theory.\n  Formally, a differential equation is a relationship between a function and its derivatives. Informally, they are equations, which describe how rates of change of the function, with respect to some other quantity, affect the function itself.\n  Ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the first type considered at university (as well as A-Level/Highschool). An ODE is a differential equation where the underlying function has one independent variable. For instance, an ODE could represent the  rate of change of population growth as a function of the population level itself.\n  As a quant, it is necessary to understand the basics of ODEs and how to solve them. Since the more complicated partial differential equations (PDE) and stochastic differential, equations (SDE) are widely found in quantitative analysis and trading, understanding the solution of the more simpler ODEs helps with understanding solutions of these problems.\n  Some ODEs can be solved  analytically, that is, with a closed-form solution, using elementary functions. However, the solution to many ODEs can only be written as a series or integral relationship. ODEs can be solved &#34;numerically&#34;, on the computer, using approximate methods. A large part of quantitative finance involves numerically solving differential equations in this manner.\n  There is no lack of study materials available for ODEs as they are a staple of the first year undergraduate mathematics program. I used the book written by my lecturer at University, and I found it to be approachable for a first year undergraduate (see Robinson, below). In addition, there is the famous &#34;Boyce &amp; DiPrima&#34; (now in its 10th edition!), which is the staple of many ODE courses. In addition there is a free video lecture series on MIT Open CourseWare:\n    Textbook/~$150 (although you&#39;ll get it much cheaper second-hand) -  Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems  by William Boyce and Richard DiPrima\n    Geometry is one of the most fundamental areas of mathematics. It is absolutely essential for many areas of deeper mathematics, including those related to quantitative finance. Many undergraduate courses introduce Euclidean geometry to students in their first year, and it is also an appropriate place to start for the autodidact.\n  The primary setting is often Euclidean Geometry in three-dimensions, namely the geometry of &#34;everyday life&#34;. You will learn a lot about constructing proofs from studying geometry, particularly with regards to projective geometry in the plane and geometry of the sphere.\n  In highschool (or at GCSE!) students are often taught about triangular geometry, and an introductory university module in Geometry will formalise these concepts, ultimately with the idea of gaining practice understanding and writing geometric proofs.\n  Euclidean Geometry eventually leads on to more general geometries such as Spherical Geometry or Hyperbolic Geometry, where familiar results from Euclidean Geometry are shown not to hold. In addition, and perhaps more relevant to the quant, having a good understanding of trigonometry is essential for later courses such as Fourier Analysis, which plays a substantial role in signals analysis and time series analysis.\n    Geometry is a tricky subject to introduce as it is extremely broad and covers such a diverse area of mathematics. However, I have found the following book, part of the Springer Undergraduate Mathematics Series, to be very helpful:\n      Groups are one of the most important algebraic structures found in mathematics. They provide the basis for studying more complex structures such as rings, fields, vector spaces (which we mentioned above in Linear Algebra). They are also strongly related to the idea of mathematical symmetry.\n  While it might be considered that groups are more of a &#34;pure mathematics&#34; topic, and thus are less applied, this is actually not the case.

Life was rich until I tried to quit. This is the story of why I had to pay $300K to unshackle myself.\u00a0  There\u2019s surprisingly little coverage on this topic, maybe because nobody is incentivized to reveal the unsavory truth, or because VCs and founders get a lot more airtime.  Here\u2019s everything I wish I knew before I joined a startup. I hope it can save you from burning piles of money like I did.\u00a0 \u200d\n  For all the talk around \u201cdisruption\u201d, startups exert a surprising inertia over employees.   \u201cGolden handcuffs\u201d is most often used to describe the inertia experienced by big tech employees who make a ton of money and have a hard time leaving. It also applies to startup employees who make a ton of  paper gains and have a hard time coming up with  real money to keep them.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Working at a startup generally requires taking a salary cut. The deal is sweetened with equity \u2014 an ownership stake that can mint millions.   The most common equity vehicle is the stock option. It\u2019s the  option to  buy a certain # of shares at a set price, aka the strike price. That\u2019s right.  You don\u2019t own shares of the company, you own the right to  buy them.    There are two more catches:\n Options usually expire within 90 days of your leaving \u2014 so you have to either pay up or give them up\n If you pay up, you also owe taxes on your  paper gains \u2014 the difference between your strike price and the current valuation\n #2 is dangerous because your taxes grow with the valuation. Even if you have a cheap strike price, your tax burden can be multiples higher. In fact, your total bill can end up costing more than the startup has ever paid you in cash! Yes, it is actually possible to be net negative after devoting years of your life as an employee.   In my case, the price tag for my vested shares was $100K, but the tax bill will be another $200K. That\u2019s a ton of cash just to  keep the shares I worked for, with no guarantees that they will be worth real money.  \u200d\n  The financial defaults are terrible for startup employees, but they don\u2019t need to be this way. You can and should negotiate the fine print, where all the devils lie. Exceptions are never granted unless you ask. Especially true if you are a strong hire and/or the startup really needs to fill the position (which is more common than you think).   First order of business is the exercise window.  Instead of taking the punishing 90 day window, ask for 10 years. You can frame it like this: \u201cI believe in the potential of X and I\u2019m excited to take part in the upside. It\u2019s important that I can do that regardless of my cash position at a specific moment in time.\u201d  Best time to ask is before you sign the offer. This is when you have peak leverage, and if you make it the final sticking point, you\u2019re more likely to get it. To gain an upper hand, try to secure competing offers that have more favorable terms.\u00a0  Does negotiating make you look petty? No, if anything, it shows you\u2019ve done your homework.  Not negotiating terrible terms betrays your naivete \u2014 like me when I signed my offer.  Whatever you settle on, make sure to get it in writing. Many a verbal promise is broken when there\u2019s large sums of money at stake.   If you still wind up with a crazy bill, see if the next company you join is willing to pay your switching cost. I forgot to do this when  negotiating with Instagram, but it can work, especially with bigger companies. The downside is that if you need the new company to bail you out of your old one, you are at their mercy.\u00a0  More points you can negotiate for:\n RSUs instead of stock options: restricted stock units have a strike price of $0, but early-stage startups may not offer this\n Even if you don\u2019t get everything you want, you\u2019ll still develop a better understanding of how accessible your equity  really is. Sometimes a higher salary is better than heaps of \u201clife-changing\u201d stock options you can never afford.  One more escape valve that just came to my attention:  83b election. If you believe in the growth potential of your shares AND you expect to stay and vest, you can choose to pay taxes on your full grant upfront, rather than on your paper gains down the line. This may save you a lot on taxes, but also comes with a dose of downsides:\n You can end up worse off if the shares decline in value OR you don\u2019t fully vest  \u200d\n  As much as startups talk about growing the pie, the finite pool of shares is treated as zero sum. There are only ever 100 points on a cap table. When you give up your options, they go back into the company pool. Your unused options can then be recycled to fund new employee packages.\u00a0\u00a0  Here&#39;s how a VC  sums it up: extending the exercise window prioritizes the well-being of former employees over existing ones. What startup in its right mind would do that?! Probably one that recognizes it was built, brick by brick, from the hands of early employees. Sadly,  91.4% do not recognize this.\u00a0  It\u2019s also hard to decipher the terms in your offer package. If every startup had to walk employees through how the numbers play out, a lot of offers would go unsigned because they\u2019re absurd. Instead, we&#39;re sold on the opportunity to \u201cmake a dent in the universe\u201d.   It\u2019s rarely about the money until the money becomes real.\u00a0 \u200d\n  Most people advised me to give up some shares, or find a third-party to front the cash and split the upside \u2014 both more rational choices than the one I took.\u00a0  In the end, watching years of hard work evaporate in 90 days far exceeded the pain of just paying for the damn lottery ticket. I\u2019m lucky I had access to that cash. Many people don\u2019t. They are forced to give up their shares or stay shackled to a company in hopes of liquidity some day.  I never joined a startup to get rich. But I did naively assume that if all went well, I would ride off into the sunset, having paid for the equity in sweat. I didn\u2019t comb through the fine print because I didn\u2019t know any better.\u00a0  Now you do! Maybe I should rebrand my $300K bill as a premium MBA \u2014 it\u2019s sure taught me a lot, and I hope it brings you a wealth of lessons too.  \u200d\n   I still believe the  right startup offers endless amounts of learning, and a serious shot at earning. But the pot of gold at the end of Unicorn Road is littered with hidden minefields.

I figured it would be a great read but at the same time, it&#39;s a useful exercise for me to see if there are any services we can get rid of or downgrade.\n Just to give you an idea of scale Prezly is an 18 person SaaS product. Fully bootstrapped (no outside capital) and serving about 500 customers globally.\n   If you break that down by the number of staff we&#39;re looking at a cost of 1250 \u20ac/month but this includes the server cost. Excluding server costs, the tooling per staff member (excluding hardware) is around  712  \u20ac/month\n  We&#39;re a software company so obviously, this is the main cost (outside of salaries). These are the minimal infrastructure we need to run the app.\n  Without any of those tools customers would start complaining. Only AWS, Sendgrid, Uploadcare and Algolia are mission-critical.

Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group, Carrier Strike Group One, in response to a massive build-up of Russian naval forces currently operating roughly 300 miles west of Hawaii.\n Multiple U.S. Defense officials speaking on background told\u00a0  The Debrief  that sailors assigned to the Carl Vinson Carrier Group found out at the end of May they would be leaving for an unscheduled deployment within the next 11 days. Reportedly, the carrier group had been previously scheduled to deploy at the end of the summer.\n Officials say the reason for the rapid deployment was large-scale movements by Russian naval forces seen heading towards the vicinity of Hawaii.\n \u201cDeployment cycles are typically very routine, highly coordinated, and scheduled well in advance,\u201d said one current Navy official who was not cleared to speak on the record. \u201cTo pull ahead of a previously scheduled deployment for a classified mission set is extremely rare.\u201d\n So far, the Navy and Department of Defense have not acknowledged the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden quiet deployment. Instead, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Command released an\u00a0  article \u00a0simply announcing the group was currently in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area. Framing its sudden appearance as \u201cintegrated training operations with the U.S. Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.\u201d\n \u201cOperating in Hawaii provides unique opportunities for Vinson to train jointly while positioned to respond if called,\u201d Commander of the U.S. 3rd Fleet, Vice Adm. Steve Koehler, said cryptically, while avoiding mention of there being any real-world element to the group\u2019s activities. \u201cThey train to a variety of missions, from long-range strikes to anti-submarine warfare, and can move anywhere on the globe on short notice.\u201d\n   On June 13, Russian state-run media\u00a0  announced \u00a0Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet would be conducting large-scale naval drills in the Pacific Ocean.\n According to Russian news outlet\u00a0  TASS , exercises include all of Russia\u2019s \u201cPrimorye Flotilla\u201d (Pacific Fleet), auxiliary vessels, and up to 20 aircraft, including long-range bombers. \u201cThe drills involve up to 20 surface combatants, submarines, and support vessels,\u201d specified the Russian Defense Ministry.\n CBS News   reports \u00a0that Russian officials call the maneuvers the \u201clargest exercise in the Pacific Ocean since the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n On Sunday, June 13, Three F-22 Raptors and a KC-135 refueling tanker were\u00a0  scrambled  from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. Initially, Air Force officials only said the scramble was an \u201cirregular patrol\u201d in response to a request by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The FAA released a short message about the incident through Public Affairs spokesperson Ian Gregor, saying only, \u201cThe F.A.A. has a close working relationship with the military.\u201d\n Citing U.S. defense officials, CBS News   reports \u00a0the scrambling of the three stealth fighters and refueling aircraft were in response to Russian bombers that were picked up flying in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands. Reportedly, Russian bombers never entered the U.S.\u2019s Air Defense Identification Zone, and the F-22s did not intercept the aircraft.\n On May 26, several news outlets\u00a0  revealed \u00a0that a Russian Navy surveillance ship was seen lingering off the western coast of Hawaii. Believed to be the Vishnya-class signals intelligence ship the Kareliya (SSV-535), the spy vessel was reportedly set up 13 miles from the Hawaiian island of Kauai, roughly one nautical mile outside U.S. territorial waters.\n From its vantage point, the Russian spy vessel had a front-row seat to a failed air defense test by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency near Hawaii on May 27. According to reports, a pair of Standard Missile 6 Dual II (SM-6) air defense missiles failed to intercept a simulated ballistic missile attack during the test.\n Popular Mechanics Defense reporter, Kyle Mizokami,\u00a0  theorized \u00a0Russia might have been tipped off about the classified missile tests from Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and Notice to Mariners (NOMAR/HYDROPAC) warning aircraft or ships to avoid the area.\n Conversely, observation of the failed missile test may have been simply a bonus. The Kareliya- which specializes in intercepting and deciphering an adversary\u2019s transmissions \u2013 may have actually been trying to measure the U.S.\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s Pacific Fleet, which was currently heading towards the area.\n On Tuesday, CBS News   reported  that the U.S.S. Carl Vinson Carrier Group was \u201coperating about 200 miles east of Hawaii, conducting a strike group certification exercise.\u201d According to CBS, the certification exercise had been pre-planned but was moved closer to Hawaii in response to Russia\u2019s presence.\n Multiple defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief\u00a0 that planned exercises or deployment for the Carl Vinson Carrier Group had been previously scheduled for around September. These same officials said that in the last week of May, sailors were notified that plans to go underway had been moved up from months away to less than two weeks.\n   Defense officials tell\u00a0  The Debrief \u00a0that sailors assigned to Carrier Strike Group One reported to their ships on June 6. Live\u00a0  web cameras \u00a0of San Diego Harbor show the U.S.S. Carl Vinson left port around 10:30 am local time on June 7. Absent from its departure appears to be the usual fanfare. Namely \u201cmanning the rail\u201d or having the crew \u201cat quarters,\u201d with sailors lining up at regular intervals along the weather deck rails in ceremony as the ship enters or leaves port.\n Navy public affairs offices have declined to confirm, deny, or comment on the aircraft carrier group\u2019s deployment so far. After beginning with Naval Air Forces Command on June 10,  The Debrief\u2019s request made it up to 3rd Fleet Command\u2019s public affairs office on June 15.\n Instead of replying to media requests, on June 17, U.S. Pacific Fleet Command released a\u00a0  short article \u00a0and two images saying Carrier Strike Group One had arrived in the Hawaiian Islands Operating Area.\n Rather than acknowledging the atypical nature of the carrier group\u2019s arrival near Hawaii, Pacific Fleet Command\u2019s article seemed to be a veiled notice to Russian forces operating nearby that the U.S. Navy was prepared to respond to any aggression towards U.S. interests in the Pacific.\n The Navy mentioned that along with its flagship, the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson, the entire Carrier Strike Group One, which includes  \u2014 Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2, Destroyer Squadron 1, the guided-missile destroyers U.S.S. O\u2019Kane (D.D.G. 77), U.S.S. Howard (D.D.G. 83), U.S.S. Chafee (D.D.G. 90), U.S.S. Dewey (DDG 105) and U.S.S. Michael Murphy (D.D.G. 11  \u2014 was all operating near Hawaii.\n   The Navy also reminded anyone who wasn\u2019t aware or had forgotten, the U.S.S. Carl Vinson is the first aircraft carrier equipped to support F-35C Lightning II and CMV-22B Osprey aircraft. Pointing out, the group also brought with it three U.S. Navy F/A-18 Strike Fighter Squadrons, and EA-18G Growler Electronic Attack Squadron, and E-2D Hawkeye Airborne Command &amp; Control Squadron, Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron, and Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron.\n \u201cWith its recent modifications, no other weapons platform has the responsiveness, endurance, multi-dimensional capacity, inherent battlespace awareness or command and control capabilities of CSG-1,\u201d reads the release by Pacific Fleet Command.\n CSG-1 isn\u2019t the only U.S. naval force that rapidly deployed to the Pacific in early June.\n As part of a training drill dubbed\u00a0  Exercise Agile Dagger , one-third of the Pacific Submarine Force deployed from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on June 3.\u00a0  According \u00a0to the Navy, submarines from Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Bremerton, Washington; and San Diego, California; are participating in Exercise Agile Dagger to \u201cdeploy on short notice to demonstrate their readiness, agility, and lethality.\u201d\n There have been evident tensions between the United States and Russia in recent months. Russia has been accused of committing numerous cyber attacks against the U.S., and several months ago, Russia amassed 100,000 troops on the border with Western-allied Ukraine.\n However, there are no indications that any discussions regarding naval maneuvers in the Pacific came up during a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin in Geneva on June 17.\n In a\u00a0  statement to CBS News , U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson, Captain Mike Kafka said, \u201cU.S. Indo-Pacific Command is monitoring the Russian vessels operating in international waters in the Western Pacific.\u201d\n Ultimately, why the Navy and DoD are so cagey about the Carl Vinson Carrier Group\u2019s sudden deployment or what is going on in the Pacific isn\u2019t entirely clear. It is, however, doubtful that things would ever escalate to the U.S. and Russia coming to blows.\n Nevertheless, with so many American and Russian naval forces currently operating in the vicinity of Hawaii, one defense official told\u00a0  The Debrief , \u201cThings could get pretty tense.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:21:47", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "John Carter has only an hour to decide. The most important auto race of the season is looming; it will be broadcast live on national television and could bring major prize money. If his team wins, it will get a sponsorship deal and a chance to start making some real profits for a change.\n There\u2019s just one problem. In seven of the past twenty-four races, the engine in the Carter Racing car has blown out. An engine failure live on TV will jeopardize sponsorships\u2014and the driver\u2019s life. But withdrawing has consequences, too. The wasted entry fee means finishing the season in debt, and the team won\u2019t be happy about the missed opportunity for glory. As Burns\u2019s First Law of Racing says, \u201cNobody ever won a race sitting in the pits.\u201d\n  One of the engine mechanics has a hunch about what\u2019s causing the blowouts. He thinks that the engine\u2019s head gasket might be breaking in cooler weather. To help Carter decide what to do, a graph is devised that shows the conditions during each of the blowouts: the outdoor temperature at the time of the race plotted against the number of breaks in the head gasket. The dots are scattered into a sort of crooked smile across a range of temperatures from about fifty-five degrees to seventy-five degrees.\n   The upcoming race is forecast to be especially cold, just forty degrees, well below anything the cars have experienced before. So: race or withdraw?\n This case study, based on real data, and devised by a pair of clever business professors, has been shown to students around the world for more than three decades. Most groups presented with the Carter Racing story look at the scattered dots on the graph and decide that the relationship between temperature and engine failure is inconclusive. Almost everyone chooses to race. Almost no one looks at that chart and asks to see the seventeen missing data points\u2014the data from those races which did not end in engine failure.\n   As soon as those points are added, however, the terrible risk of a cold race becomes clear. Every race in which the engine behaved properly was conducted when the temperature was higher than sixty-five degrees; every single attempt that occurred in temperatures at or below sixty-five degrees resulted in engine failure. Tomorrow\u2019s race would almost certainly end in catastrophe.\n  One more twist: the points on the graph are real but have nothing to do with auto racing. The first graph contains data compiled the evening before the disastrous launch of the space shuttle Challenger, in 1986. As Diane Vaughn relates in her account of the tragedy, \u201cThe Challenger Launch Decision\u201d (1996), the data were presented at an emergency   teleconference, scribbled by hand in a simple table format and hurriedly faxed to the Kennedy Space Center. Some engineers used the chart to argue that the shuttle\u2019s O-rings had malfunctioned in the cold before, and might again. But most of the experts were unconvinced. The chart implicitly defined the scope of relevance\u2014and nobody seems to have asked for additional data points, the ones they couldn\u2019t see. This is why the managers made the tragic decision to go ahead despite the weather. Soon after takeoff, the rubber O-rings leaked, a joint in the solid rocket boosters failed, and the space shuttle broke apart, killing all seven crew members. A decade later, Edward Tufte, the great maven of data visualization, used the Challenger teleconference as a potent example of the wrong way to display quantitative evidence. The right graph, he pointed out, would have shown the truth at a glance.\n In \u201cA History of Data Visualization and Graphic Communication\u201d (Harvard), Michael Friendly and Howard Wainer, a psychologist and a statistician, argue that visual thinking, by revealing what would otherwise remain invisible, has had a profound effect on the way we approach problems. The book begins with what might be the first statistical graph in history, devised by the Dutch cartographer Michael Florent van Langren in the sixteen-twenties. This was well into the Age of Discovery, and Europeans were concerned with the measurement of time, distance, and location. Such measurements were particularly important at sea, where accurate navigation presented a considerable challenge. Mariners had to rely on error-prone charts and faulty compasses; they made celestial observations while standing on the decks of rocking boats, and\u2014if all else failed\u2014threw rope overboard in an attempt to work out how far from the seabed they were. If establishing a north-south position was notoriously difficult, the spin of the Earth made it nearly impossible to accurately calculate a ship\u2019s east-west position.\n In 1628, van Langren wrote a letter to the Spanish court, in an effort to demonstrate the importance of improving the way longitude was calculated (and of giving him the funding to do so). To make his case, he drew a simple one-dimensional graph. On the left, he drew a tick mark, representing the ancient city of Toledo, in Spain. From this point, he drew a single horizontal line on the page, marking across its length twelve historical calculations of the longitudinal distance from Toledo to Rome. The estimates were wildly different, scattered all across the line. There was a cluster of estimates at around twenty degrees, including those made by the great astronomer Tycho Brahe and the pioneering cartographer Gerardus Mercator; others, including the celebrated mathematician Ptolemy, put the distance between the two cities closer to thirty degrees. All the estimates were too large\u2014we now know that the correct distance is sixteen and a half degrees. But the graph was meant to show just how divergent the estimates were. Depending on which one was used, a traveller from Toledo could end up anywhere between sixty miles outside Rome and more than six hundred miles away, on the plains of eastern Bulgaria.\n Van Langren could have put these values in a table, as would have been typical for the time, but, as Friendly and Wainer observe, \u201conly a graph speaks directly to the eyes.\u201d Once the numbers were visualized, the enormous differences among them\u2014and the stakes dependent on those differences\u2014became impossible to ignore. Van Langren wrote, \u201cIf the Longitude between Toledo and Rome is not known with certainty, consider, Your Highness, what it will be for the Western and Oriental Indies, that in comparison the former distance is almost nothing.\u201d\n  Van Langren\u2019s image marked an extraordinary conceptual leap. He was a skilled cartographer from a long line of cartographers, so he would have been familiar with depicting distances on a page. But, as Tufte puts it, in his classic study \u201cVisual Explanations\u201d (1997), \u201cMaps resemble miniature pictorial representations of the physical world.\u201d Here was something entirely new: encoding the estimate of a distance by its position along a line. Scientists were well versed in handling a range of values for a single property, but until then science had only ever been concerned with how to get rid of error\u2014how to take a collection of wrong answers and reduce its dimension to give a single, best answer. Van Langren was the first person to realize that a story lay in that dimension, one that could be physically seen on a page by abstracting it along a thin inked line.\n The originality of van Langren\u2019s graph attests to a long history of missed opportunities to arrive at the same idea. Friendly and Wainer offer an example from the banks of the Nile, which, before the Aswan Dam was built, in the nineteen-sixties, flooded each year. \u201cEgyptians, who knew that their prosperity depended on the river\u2019s annual overflow, had been keeping the Nile\u2019s high-water mark for more than three millennia,\u201d they write. The records helped farmers track the level of flooding in the recent past and decide when and where to plant crops. But, over thousands of years, nobody realized the significance of the data in aggregate\u2014until the nineteen-fifties, when William Popper used it to chart the Nile\u2019s flood levels in the course of thirteen centuries. Friendly and Wainer write, \u201cNo one thought to make a graph of the high-water level over time or compare the average water level in the last decade to what might occur in the next.\u201d Popper\u2019s work showed, for the first time, the surprisingly wide variation in silting across different periods\u2014and silting was an important factor in fertilizing crops. Fat years and lean years didn\u2019t just happen.\n It was another hundred and fifty years after van Langren\u2019s letter before the next significant advances in visualizing data arrived, courtesy of a 1786 book by the Scottish engineer William Playfair, \u201cThe Commercial and Political Atlas.\u201d Despite the title, it didn\u2019t contain a single conventional geographical map. Instead, it displayed Playfair\u2019s great ability to chart out the shape of an object that existed only in his mind, cementing his place in the history of data graphics: he gave us the line graph of a time series, the bar chart, and, eventually, the pie chart\u2014practically the entire suite of Excel charting options.\n  Playfair explained his approach using a graph that showed the expenditure of the Royal Navy over the preceding decades. Time is on the horizontal x-axis, money is on the vertical y-axis; the line wiggles up and down from left to right. With the advantage of a few centuries\u2019 worth of perspective, it\u2019s hard to believe that this kind of image would be anything other than intuitive to grasp. But Playfair, introducing the time-series graph to the world for the first time, had to work hard to get people to understand what they were seeing. He asked his readers to imagine that he had taken the money spent by the Navy in a single year and laid it out neatly, in guineas, in a straight column on a table. To the right, he would create another column of guineas, to correspond to the amount paid out in the following year. If he continued doing this, creating a column of guineas for each year, \u201cthey would make a shape, the dimensions of which would agree exactly with the amount of the sums.\u201d\n  Where van Langren had abstracted the range of longitudinal estimates into a line, Playfair had gone further. He discovered that you could encode time by its position on the page. This idea may have come naturally to him. Friendly and Wainer describe how, when Playfair was younger, his brother had explained one way to record the daily high temperatures over an extended period: he should imagine a bunch of thermometers in a row and record his temperature readings as if he were tracing the different mercury levels; from there, it was only a small step to let the image of the thermometer fade into the background, use a dot to represent the top of the column of mercury, and line up the dots from left to right on the page. By visualizing time on the x-axis, Playfair had created a tool for making pictures from numbers which offered a portal to a much deeper connection with time and distance. As the industrial age emerged, this proved to be a life-saving insight.\n Back when long-distance travel was provided by horse-drawn stagecoaches, departure timetables were suggestive rather than definitive. Where schedules did exist, they would often be listed alongside caveats, such as \u201cbarring accidents!\u201d or \u201cGod permitting!\u201d Once passenger railways started to open up, in the eighteen-twenties and thirties, train times would be advertised, but, without nationally agreed-on time and time zones, their punctuality fell well shy of modern standards. When George Hudson, the English tycoon known as the Railway King, was confronted with data showing how often his trains ran late, he countered with the data on how often his trains were early, and insisted that, in net terms, his railway ran roughly on time.\n As train travel became increasingly popular, patience was no longer the only casualty of this system: head-on collisions started to occur. With more lines and stations being added, rail operators needed a way to avoid accidents. A big breakthrough came from France, in an elegant new style of graph first demonstrated by the railway engineer Charles Ibry.\n  In a presentation to the French Minister of Public Works in 1847, Ibry displayed a chart that could show simultaneously the locations of all the trains between Paris and Le Havre in a twenty-four-hour period. Like Playfair, Ibry used the horizontal axis to denote the passing of time. Every millimetre across represented two minutes. In the top left corner was a mark to denote the Paris railway station, and then, down the vertical axis, each station was marked out along the route to Le Havre. They were positioned precisely according to distance, with one kilometre in the physical world corresponding to two and a half millimetres on the graph.\n With the axes set up in this way, the trains appeared on the graph as simple diagonal lines, sweeping from left to right as they travelled across distance and time. In the simplest sections of the rail network, with no junctions or crossings or stops, you could choose where to place the diagonal line of each train to insure that there was sufficient spacing around it. Things got complicated, however, if the trains weren\u2019t moving at the same speed. The faster the train, the steeper the line, so a passenger express train crossed quickly from top to bottom, while slower freight trains appeared as thin lines with a far shallower angle. The problem of scheduling became a matter of spacing a series of differently angled lines in a box so that they never unintentionally crossed on the page, and hence never met on the track.\n   These train graphs weren\u2019t meant to be illustrations\u2014they weren\u2019t designed to persuade or to provide conceptual insight. They were created as an instrument for solving the intricate complexities of timetabling, almost akin to a slide rule. Yet they also constituted a map of an abstract conceptual space, a place where, to paraphrase the statistician John Tukey, you were forced to notice what you otherwise wouldn\u2019t see.\n Within a decade, the graphs were being used to create train schedules across the world. Until recently, some transit departments still preferred to work by hand, rather than by computer, using lined paper and a pencil, angling the ruler more sharply to denote faster trains on the line. And contemporary train-planning software relies heavily on these very graphs, essentially unchanged since Ibry\u2019s day. In 2016, a team of data scientists was able to work out that a series of unexplained disruptions on Singapore\u2019s MRT Circle Line were caused by a single rogue train. Onboard, the train appeared to be operating normally, but as it passed other trains in the tunnels it would trigger their emergency brakes. The pattern could not be seen by sorting the data by trains, or by times, or by locations. Only when a version of Ibry\u2019s graph was used did the problem reveal itself.\n Until the nineteenth century, Friendly and Wainer tell us, most modern forms of data graphics\u2014pie charts, line graphs, and bar charts\u2014tended to have a one-dimensional view of their data. Playfair\u2019s line graph of Navy expenditures, for instance, was concerned only with how that one variable changed over time. But, as the nineteenth century progressed, graphs began to break free of their one-dimensional roots. The scatter plot, which some trace back to the English scientist John Herschel, and which Tufte heralds as \u201cthe greatest of all graphical designs,\u201d allowed statistical graphs to take on the form of two continuous variables at once\u2014temperature, or money, or unemployment rates, or wine consumption\u2014whether it had a real-world physical presence or not. Rather than featuring a single line joining single values as they move over time, these graphs could present clouds of points, each plotted according to two variables.\n Their appearance is instantly familiar. As Alberto Cairo puts it in his recent book, \u201cHow Charts Lie,\u201d scatter plots got their name for a reason: \u201cThey are intended to show the relative  scattering of the dots, their dispersion or concentration in different regions of the chart.\u201d Glancing at a scatter allows you to judge whether the data is trending in one direction or another, and to spot if there are clusters of similar dots that are hiding in the numbers.\n A famous example comes from around 1911, when the astronomers Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell independently produced a scatter of a series of stars, plotting their luminosity against their color, moving across the spectrum from blue to red. (A star\u2019s color is determined by its surface temperature; its luminosity, or intrinsic brightness, is determined both by its surface temperature and by its size.) The result, as Friendly and Wainer concede, is \u201cnot a graph of great beauty,\u201d but it did revolutionize astrophysics. The scatter plot showed that the stars were distributed not at random but concentrated in groups, huddled together by type. These clusters would prove to be home to the blue and red giants, and also the red and white dwarfs.\n In graphs like these, the distance between any two given dots on the page took on an entirely abstract meaning. It was no longer related to physical proximity; it now meant something more akin to similarity. Closeness within the conceptual space of the graph meant that two stars were alike in their characteristics. A surprising number of stars were, say, reddish and dim, because the red dwarf turned out to be a significant category of star; the way stars in this category clustered on the scatter plot showed that they were conceptually proximate, not that they were physically so.\n But if you could find clusters of dots in two dimensions, why not three? Friendly and Wainer discuss a three-dimensional scatter plot that improved our understanding of Type 2 diabetes. In 1979, two scientists, Gerald\u00a0M. Reaven and R.\u00a0G. Miller, plotted blood-glucose levels against the production of insulin in the pancreas for a series of patients. Along a third axis, they added a metric for how efficiently insulin is used by the body. What emerged was a three-dimensional structure that looks a little like an egg with floppy wings. It allowed Reaven and Miller to split participants into three groups\u2014those with overt diabetes, those with latent diabetes, and those who were unaffected\u2014and to understand how patients might transition from one state to another. Previously it had been thought that overt diabetes was preceded by the latent stage, but the graph showed that the only \u201cpath\u201d from one to the other was through the region occupied by those classified as normal. Because of this and evidence from other studies, they are now considered two separate disease classes.\n  If three dimensions are possible, though, why not four? Or four hundred? Today, much of data science is founded on precisely these high-dimensional spaces. They\u2019re dizzying to contemplate, but the fundamental principles are the same as those of their nineteenth-century scatter-plot predecessors. The axes could be the range of possible answers to a questionnaire on a dating Web site, with individuals floating as dots in a vast high-dimensional space, their positions fixed by the responses they gave when they signed up. In 2012, Chris McKinlay, a grad student in applied mathematics, worked out how to scrape data from OkCupid and used this strategy\u2014hunting for dots in a similar region, in the hope that proximity translated into romantic compatibility. (He says the eighty-eighth time was the charm.) Or the axes could relate to your reaction to a film on a streaming service, or the amount of time you spend looking at a particular post on a social-media site. Or they could relate to something physical, like the DNA in your cells: the genetic analysis used to infer our ancestry looks for variability and clusters within these abstract, conceptual spaces. There are subtle shifts in the codes for proteins sprinkled throughout our DNA; o\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-19 08:15:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u56fe\u8868,matter,\u706b\u8f66", "title": "\u5f53\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u751f\u6b7b\u6538\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u5019 ", "title_en": "When Graphs Are a Matter of Life and Death", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/when-graphs-are-a-matter-of-life-and-death", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u56fe\u8868", "matter", "\u706b\u8f66"]}]
