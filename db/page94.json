mental health have a threefold increased risk of being diagnosed with depression.\n  And while working long hours is a risk factor for dying from cardiovascular disease or having a stroke, poor management practices pose a greater risk for depression, the researchers found.\n  The University of South Australia study, published in the  British Medical Journal today, is led by UniSA&#39;s Psychosocial Safety Climate Observatory, the world&#39;s first research platform exploring workplace psychological health and safety.\n  Psychosocial safety climate (PSC) is the term used to describe management practices and communication and participation systems that protect workers&#39; mental health and safety.\n  Lead author, Dr Amy Zadow, says that poor workplace mental health can be traced back to poor management practices, priorities and values, which then flows through to high job demands and low resources.\n  &#34;Evidence shows that companies who fail to reward or acknowledge their employees for hard work, impose unreasonable demands on workers, and do not give them autonomy, are placing their staff at a much greater risk of depression,&#34; says Dr Zadow.\n  Internationally renowned expert on workplace mental health, ARC Laureate Professor Maureen Dollard, says the study found that while enthusiastic and committed workers are valued, working long hours can lead to depression. Men are also more likely to become depressed if their workplace pays scant attention to their psychological health.\n  Due to the global burden of depression, which affects an estimated 300 million people worldwide and shows no sign of abating despite available treatments, more attention is now being paid to poorly functioning work environments which could contribute to the problem.\n  High levels of burnout and workplace bullying are also linked to corporations&#39; failure to support workers&#39; mental health.\n  A second paper co-authored by Professor Dollard and published in the  European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology earlier this month, found that low PSC was an important predictor of bullying and emotional exhaustion.\n  &#34;Lack of consultation with employees and unions over workplace health and safety issues, and little support for stress prevention, is linked to low PSC in companies.\n  &#34;We also found that bullying in a work unit can not only negatively affect the victim, but also the perpetrator and team members who witness that behaviour. It is not uncommon for everyone in the same unit to experience burnout as a result.\n  &#34;In this study we investigated bullying in a group context and why it occurs. Sometimes stress is a trigger for bullying and in the worst cases it can set an &#39;acceptable&#39; level of behaviour for other members of the team. But above all bullying can be predicted from a company&#39;s commitment to mental health, so it can be prevented,&#34; Prof Dollard says.\n  The global costs of workplace bullying and worker burnout are significant, manifested in absenteeism, poor work engagement, stress leave and low productivity.\n  The extent of the problem was recognised in 2019 with the International Labour Organization (ILO) implementing a Global Commission on the Future of Work and calling for &#34;a human-centred approach, putting people and the work they do at the centre of economic and social policy and business practice&#34;.\n  &#34;The practical implications of this research are far reaching. High levels of worker burnout are extremely costly to organisations and it&#39;s clear that top-level organisational change is needed to address the issue,&#34; Prof Dollard says.\n  Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 01:57:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "workplaces", "title": "\u6709\u6bd2\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u589e\u52a0\u4e86300\uff05\u7684\u6291\u90c1\u98ce\u9669 ", "title_en": "Toxic workplaces increase risk of depression by 300%", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-06/uosa-twi062221.php", "via": "", "real_tags": []}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e46e8b29842d84203a82086fc7d34633.jpg", "infoid": 1068280, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9053\u6b49\uff0c\u524d3\u5206\u949f\u5185\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c89\u788e\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u3002 \u5b83\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u4e86\uff01 ", "note_en": "Apologies that there's a fan blowing on the mic for the first 3 minutes.

", "note_en": "She says the response just over a century ago prompted the rise of interventional medicine \u2014 treating illness through surgery or medicine only after symptoms manifest. Today, interventional medicine is the dominant mindset in Western healthcare. And, Melton, a lead investor in health tech startups including Livongo, Tia, and Calibrate, says the care pathway ages well.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in our society? Chronic diseases, chronic pain, diabetes, and obesity,\u201d she said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t require a magic pill and there\u2019s not just a surgery. Oftentimes, there\u2019s therapeutic components, behavior changes, and movable touchpoints.\u201d\n Enter personalized medicine. The buzzy yet powerful framing is growing in popularity among Silicon Valley startups. It\u2019s a delivery system in which patients receive more holistic care that takes into account multiple symptoms or co-morbidities. In hormonal health, for example,  personalized medicine could add more data and specificity to which birth control someone takes, instead of the usual process of trial and error. Essentially, it\u2019s the opposite of interventional medicine.\n \u201cWe\u2019re not just an arm or a leg, we\u2019re not just obese or a diabetic or a pain sufferer,\u201d Melton said. \u201cHow do we treat you as a whole person?\u201d\n A number of companies are using this approach to reinvent care for patients with musculoskeletal (MSK) medical conditions and chronic pain. These conditions are commonly treated with addictive opioids, a major public health concern. As an estimated 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain, entrepreneurs are working on solutions that don\u2019t resemble the cookie-cutter status quo. And the money market is certainly there: in 2017, the global MSK medical market  was valued at $57.4 billion; the market for chronic pain, which overlaps with MSK medicine, is expected to  hit $151.7 billion in value by 2030.\n \u201cOftentimes it\u2019s not new ideas, it\u2019s conflating a number of factors that come together at one moment in time that allow exponential change,\u201d that makes a startup work,\u201d Melton said, of the boom and recent activity in MSK medicine. Today, we\u2019ll focus on three startups taking different approaches to help people suffering from chronic pain and MSK-related conditions: Clearing, Peerwell, and Hinge Health.\n  Avi Dorfman says going direct to consumers is the most effective way to treat chronic pain, so he founded  Clearing. The digital health startup worked with a medical advisory board of physicians and researchers from Harvard, John Hopkins, and NYC\u2019s Hospital for Special Surgery to create an opioid-free solution for people struggling with pain.\n Last month, Clearing raised a $20 million seed round led by Bessemer and Founders Fund. Melton also invested in the round on behalf of Threshold.\n Clearing offers four products: prescription compound cream that includes FDA-approved ingredients, CBD cream for topical discomfort, nutraceuticals to supplement joint health, and a directory of pre-recorded, at-home exercises. It currently is available to patients in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 01:20:59",

", "note_en": "The London-based company describes itself as \u201ca crypto infrastructure company\u201d that aims to make blockchain useful for businesses via its \u201cdigital asset payment gateway.\u201d Specifically, it aggregates various payment solutions and provides fiat and crypto payments and payouts for businesses.\n Put more simply,  Mercuryo aims to use  cryptocurrencies as a tool for putting in motion next-gen cross-border transfers or as it puts it,  \u201cto allow any business to become a fintech company without the need to keep up with its complications.\u201d\n  \u201cThe need for fast and efficient international payments, especially for businesses, is as relevant as ever,\u201d said Petr Kozyakov, Mercuryo\u2019s co-founder and CEO. While there is no shortage of companies enabling cross-border payments, the startup\u2019s emphasis on crypto is a differentiator.\n \u201cOur team has a clear plan on making crypto universally available by enabling cheap and straightforward transactions,\u201d Kozyakov said. \u201cCryptocurrency assets can then be used to process global money transfers, mass payouts and facilitate acquiring services, among other things.\u201d\n Mercuryo began onboarding customers at the beginning of 2019, and has seen impressive growth since with annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April surpassing over $50 million. Its customer base is approaching 1 million, and the company has partnerships with a number of large crypto players including Binance, Bitfinex, Trezor, Trust Wallet, Bithumb and Bybit.  In 2020, the company said its turnover spiked by 50 times while run-rate turnover crossed $2.5 billion in April 2021.\n To build on that momentum, Mercuryo has begun expanding to new markets, including the United States, where it launched its crypto payments offering for B2B customers in all states earlier this year. It also plans to \u201cgradually\u201d expand to Africa, South America and Southeast Asia.\n Target Global led Mercuryo\u2019s Series A, which also included  participation from a group of angel investors and brings the startup\u2019s total raised since its 2018 inception to over $10 million.\n  The company plans to use its new capital to launch a  cryptocurrency debit card (spending globally directly from the crypto balance in the wallet) and continuing to expand to new markets, such as Latin America and Asia-Pacific.\n Mercuryo\u2019s various products include a multicurrency wallet with a built-in crypto exchange and digital asset purchasing functionality, a widget and high-volume cryptocurrency acquiring and OTC services.\n Kozyakov says the company doesn\u2019t charge for currency conversion and has no other \u201chidden fees.\u201d\n \u201cWe enable instant and easy cross-border transactions for our partners and their customers,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, the money transfer services lack intermediaries and require no additional steps to finalize transactions. Instead, the process narrows down to only two operations: a fiat-to-crypto exchange when sending a transfer and a crypto-to-fiat conversion when receiving funds.\u201d\n Mercuryo also offers crypto SaaS products, giving customers a way to buy crypto via their fiat accounts while delegating digital asset management to the company.\n \u201cWhether it be virtual accounts or third-party customer wallets, the company handles most cryptocurrency-related processes for banks, so they can focus more on their core operations,\u201d Kozyakov said.\n Mike Lobanov, Target Global\u2019s co-founder, said that as an experiment, his firm tested numerous solutions to buy Bitcoin.\n \u201cDoing our diligence, we measured \u2018time to crypto\u2019 \u2013 how long it takes from going to the App Store and downloading the app until the digital assets arrive in the wallet,\u201d he said.\n Mercuryo came first with 6 minutes, including everything from KYC and funding to getting the cryptocurrency, according to Lobanov.\n \u201cThe second-best result was 20 minutes, while some apps took forever to process our transaction,\u201d he added. \u201cThis company is a game-changer in the field, and we are delighted to have been their supporters since the early days.\u201d\n Looking ahead, the startup plans to release a product that will give businesses a way to send instant mass payments to multiple customers and gig workers simultaneously, no matter where the receiver is located.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 01:20:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5bc6\u7801,\u8de8\u5883,payments", "title": "MercuySo\u5728\u6cbf\u774050\u7c73\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8d8a\u8fc7\u8d8a\u8fc7\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u8de8\u5883\u4ed8\u6b3e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.5\u7c73 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMercuryo raises $7.5M for crypto-focused cross-border payments after crossing $50M in ARR\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/mercuryo-raises-7-5m-for-crypto-focused-cross-border-payments-after-crossing-50m-in-arr/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5bc6\u7801", "\u8de8\u5883", "payments"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3c039aa2326c56d4766bba35777c9890.jpg", "infoid": 1068277, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u63a2\u9669\u961f\u690d\u6839\u4e8e\u73bb\u7483\u8461\u8404\u9152\u7d22\u5fb7\u5c14\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u8bf4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u8d44\u672c\u5141\u8bb8\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u5728\u7b79\u96c6\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217A\u7684\u7b79\u7801\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u8fdf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6e\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540e\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u9636\u6bb5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7b2cB\u8f6e\u8fc5\u901f\u8fc5\u901f\u5730\u9075\u5faa\u666e\u904d\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n  \u4e0eSeseri\u804a\u5929\u540e\u66f4\u591a\u548c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u98ce\u9669\u8d44\u672c\u5bb6\u5173\u4e8e\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u3002\u5373\u201c\u5178\u578b\u7684\u201d\u65e9\u671f\u8d44\u91d1\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6b63\u5982Seseri\u6240\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u662f\u201c\u6210\u4e3a\u975e\u5178\u578b\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5148\u53d1\u5236\u4eba\u7684\u5faa\u73af[\u5176\u4e2d]\u5bf9\u7a97\u5916\u7684\u5178\u578b\u671f\u671b\u8d70\u51fa\u7a97\u5916\u3002\u201d\n  \u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u63a2\u7d22\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u3002\u6bcf\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u90fd\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7d27\u7f29\u6216\u6bcf\u5468\u516d\u83b7\u5f97\u4ea4\u6362\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n  Series\uff0c\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u79cd\u5b50\u4ea4\u6613\u540e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\u6765\uff0cB\u578b\u961f\u4f0d\u770b\u5230\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6536\u5165\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u5730\u70b9\u662f\u201c\u5df2\u7ecf\u4e0b\u8dcc\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7403\u5458\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5178\u578b\u7684VCS\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4ea7\u54c1 -

But that after those founders did raise that A, their Series B round could rapidly follow thanks to later-stage money showing up in earlier-stage deals in hopes of snagging ownership in hot companies.\n  After chatting with Seseri more and a number of other venture capitalists about the concept, a second dynamic emerged. Namely that the \u201ctypical\u201d early-stage funding round, as Seseri described it, was \u201cbecoming the atypical because of the rise of preemptive rounds [in which] typical expectations on metrics go out the window.\u201d\n  The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.   Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  Series As, she said, could come mere months after a seed deal, and Series B rounds were seeing expected revenue thresholds tumble in part to \u201clarge, multi-asset players that have come down market and are offering a different product than typical VCs \u2014 very fast term sheets, no active involvement post-investment, large investments amounts and high valuations.\u201d\n Focusing on just the Series A dynamic, the old rule of thumb that a startup would need to reach $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) is now often moot. Some startups are delaying their A rounds until they reach $2 million in ARR thanks to ample seed capital.\n While some startups delay their A rounds, others raise the critical investment earlier and earlier, perhaps with even a few hundred thousand in ARR.\n What\u2019s different between the two groups? Startups with \u201celite status\u201d are able to jump ahead to their Series A, while other founders spend more time cobbling together adequate seed capital to get to sufficient scale to attract an A.\n The dynamic is not merely a United States phenomenon. The two-tier venture capital market is also showing up in Latin America, a globally important and rapidly expanding startup region. (Brazilian fintech startup Nubank, for example,  just closed a $750 million round.)\n This morning, we\u2019re diving into the Latin American venture capital market and its early-stage dynamics.

Data voids, search engine queries that have little to no results, can often lead to fringe claims being given undue prominence \u2013 a particular concern for breaking news.\n In a blogpost, Danny Sullivan, public liaison for search at Google, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve trained our systems to detect when a topic is rapidly evolving and a range of sources hasn\u2019t yet weighed in. We\u2019ll now show a notice indicating that it may be best to check back later when more information from a wider range of sources might be available.\u201d\n The warning tends to appear for searches with a lot of recent hits, but few from reputable sites. For instance, a recent report of a UFO sighting in Wales had spread rapidly among conspiracy theorists, but had little mainstream attention. That meant that a search for the terms \u201cufo 106 mph\u201d briefly brought up the warning, Sullivan  told the tech site Recode.\n \u201cSomeone had gotten this police report video released out in Wales, and it\u2019s had a little bit of press coverage. But there\u2019s still not a lot about it,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cBut people are probably searching for it, they may be going around on social media \u2013 so we can tell it\u2019s starting to trend. And we can also tell that there\u2019s not a lot of necessarily great stuff that\u2019s out there.

", "note_en": "I just want to share my thoughts on Kafka after using it for a few months, always from a practical point of view. I don\u2019t know anything more than the basics about Kafka internals. I knew the principles of log processing and so on but had never got my hands dirty. So this is just the opinion of a newcomer, not an expert.\n  Everything began because we started seeing event-gathering use cases: a website, with a reasonably high amount of traffic that wants to gather events, to measure in real-time what\u2019s going on. Like a customized version of Google analytics but without sampling. We\u2019ve spent the last few months working on an integration with Kafka to cover these use cases.\n  I have to admit that I was biased against Kafka, I thought it was a large, complex piece of technology that added nothing but an extra layer of complexity.\n  I still think the same, it is complex, adding Kafka to your stack will add a bunch of services and some extra decisions to make about configuration and so on. In most cases, a single process app sending data to a file and a small HTTP server serving it will perform much better with less downtime. If you compare the burden of understanding, setting-up, configuring and starting to use compared to, for example, Redis, it\u2019s a massive amount of work.\n  Of course, when things get difficult is when Kafka shines and all that complexity gives you the flexibility to tackle massive amounts of load and complex producer, consumer, processor use cases. But even in this situation, you\u2019ll need to know much more than just Kafka 101.\n  To be honest, this is true no matter what tech you use, a simple load balancer can become a nightmare to maintain under certain circumstances. High-load software projects always get complex somehow, in the same way that an F1 car needs a highly complex system, a good bunch of engineers and mechanics, and constant maintenance to go fast, so does a software project.\n  The key here is how soon you hit the complexity; ideally, a tool should become complex as your project does.\n  Anyway, the most interesting thing about Kafka is that it enables something pretty useful for projects at scale: a clear way to coordinate and measure and scale data consumption. I\u2019m wondering why HTTP load balancers didn\u2019t get the consumer approach of Kafka. And the same kind of metrics. And a non-HTTP protocol and a way to coordinate workers :)\n  Coordinate: Kafka doesn\u2019t only rely on the server to do things, clients know things like \u201cWhat partition I should consume.\u201d or load-balancing between brokers.\n  Scale: when consuming it is clear when you need more computing power just by looking at the number of unprocessed messages. This sounds obvious to do but it\u2019s not, at least to me. This is a pretty old queueing problem that is useful to understand and measure (there is a lot of theory written about queueing from the early days in telecommunication systems) but it\u2019s usually hidden in most pieces of software.\n  Kafka is not the only tool that does these things, I guess all message brokers do this but I never used them.\n  Anyway, some practical information that I didn\u2019t know but wish I had known:\n  You need to know more things than I expected to be able to use it: partitions, messages, assignments, brokers, consumers, different kinds of timeouts\u2026 and that\u2019s just the surface.\n  Setting up a cluster by yourself is a pain in the ass. Using Confluent cloud is expensive but it just works, that\u2019s why people use it.\n  Even for a local install, Kafka is a PITA. I recommend using  Redpanda, a single command and you have a Kafka compatible API up and running. No Zookeeper, no docker-compose up, no Kubernetes.\n  Kafka does not have a good HTTP interface (for a good reason). HTTP Proxy is the default choice but Confluent cloud does not provide it (Redpanda does). I think using a custom protocol is the right choice but there is an impedance mismatch between HTTP based systems and Kafka (although not in all cases).\n    Managing errors in consumers is hard. The good part is that the data is in Kafka so you can replay it but the bad part is that if the problem is a logic problem (not a temporal glitch) you are in bigger trouble.  This article explains it pretty well.\n  So, if you ask me, you need to know what you are doing before you add Kafka to your stack but it does bring really good architectural patterns when your platform usage starts to grow.\n  We have been happily ingesting millions of events per minute for some months now, without any major problems. Actually, Kafka saved us from some complicated situations. Probably a fast HTTP server writing batches to a file would also have worked but I think that when you want to scale things up without much pain Kafka is a good solution.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 01:13:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "kafka,starting", "title": "\u4eceKafka\u5f00\u59cb ", "title_en": "Starting with Kafka", "transed": 1, "url": "https://blog.tinybird.co/2021/06/25/starting-with-kafka/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["kafka", "starting"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068274, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528cookie\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002  \u4f3c\u4e4e\u60a8\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5e76\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7f51\u7ad9\u529f\u80fd\u3002 ", "note_en": "We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website.\n  It seems your browser doesn&#39;t support them and this affects the site functionality.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 01:13:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5b58\u50a8,storage,\u786e\u4fdd", "title": "\u6211\u7684256 GB\u53bb\u4e86\u54ea\u91cc\uff1f \u79fb\u52a8\u5b58\u50a8\u5206\u6790 ", "title_en": "Where did my 256 GB go?

", "note_en": "TL;DR   By using special HTML tags that leverage HTML parsing logic, it is possible to achieve cross-site scripting (XSS) even in instances where lexical parsers are used to nullify dangerous content. The primary goal in exploiting these types of XSS vulnerabilities is to get the sanitizing lexical parser to view the data as text data and not computer instructions (e.g., JavaScript instructions). This type of attack is possible when the HTML parser and the sanitizing lexical parsing do not parse the data in the same manner.\n   Note: this blog post assumes some previous knowledge of XSS (better described as JavaScript injection) and a basic understanding of HTML. For a high-level primer,  head over to our XSS overview writeup.\n  XSS protections come in many forms. In the early days of preventing XSS and occasionally still today, regular expressions (regex) were used to examine user input for &#34;dangerous&#34; strings. A simplified example is that if a user provided input containing   &lt;script&gt; , the regex would match that exact string and remove it. However, this type of regex-based XSS protection often misses the mark, as there are many ways to formulate a JavaScript string of code to bypass the protection. In the same simplified example, simply capitalizing a letter in   &lt;scRipt&gt;\u00a0would bypass the filter and result in XSS. It is therefore not advisable to attempt a regex filter to prevent XSS.\n So, let&#39;s talk about a better solution. Contextual output encoding is a form of XSS protection that transforms special characters such as &#34; &lt;&#34; and &#34; &gt;&#34; into harmless HTML encoded output (e.g., &#34;  &amp;lt;&#34; and &#34;  &amp;gt;&#34;). This form of protection places the user&#39;s input within the source to ensure any JavaScript or HTML-usable characters that could result in JavaScript execution or HTML rendering are transferred into a non-dangerous, HTML entity encoded form. This is a great way to handle user input that renders in the application; in fact, many contemporary front-end frameworks will now perform output encoding by default (e.g., ReactJS and Angular). However, this form of protection can limit an application\u2019s ability to allow users to include some types of HTML-enabled rich text.\n What if users require the ability to include some HTML such as images, links, and rich text? This is where lexical parsing comes into play.\n  Lexical parsing is a very sophisticated way of preventing XSS because it evaluates whether the data is instructions or plaintext before performing additional logic such as blocking or encoding the data. At a high level, lexical parsing can be described as parsing that will separate user data (i.e., non-dangerous textual content) from computer instructions (i.e., JavaScript and certain dangerous HTML tags). In instances where the user is allowed a subset of HTML by design, this type of parsing can be used to determine what is allowed content and what will be blocked or sanitized.\n Some examples that allow a subset of HTML by design are rich-text editors, email clients, What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors like TinyMCE or Froala, and sanitization libraries such as DOMPurify. Among these examples, this form of lexical parsing protection is commonplace.\n However, lexical parsing as a form of XSS protection can be exploited when the HTML parser and sanitizing lexical parser do not process the data in the exact same manner. This blog post focuses on how in some cases it is possible to trick lexical parsers by leveraging the HTML parsing logic to inject JavaScript despite the sophisticated protections. In order to understand how to exploit these XSS issues, we must first examine how HTML is parsed; caveats and special cases during processing of data; and how the sanitizing parsers work.\n   To understand how we can achieve XSS in an application that uses lexical analysis on HTML input, we first must look at how HTML is parsed and how content is determined to be either data or instructions. The figure below is a visualization of the HTML parser&#39;s order of operations:\n  Network \u2013 This stage refers to the transfer of input as bytes to the parser.\n Tokenizer \u2013 Tokenization is where the lexical parsing occurs. The parser will separate text data from computer instructions. To do this, the tokenizer will switch contexts between data states depending on the element it encounters and return the values as tokens. This is covered in more detail in the Context State section.\n Tree Construction \u2013 The tokens returned from the tokenization stage are placed in a tree structure; each of the tree branches is known as a node. For a clearer picture of what this looks like in practice, let&#39;s examine the following HTML snippet:  The figure below shows what this looks like in the document object model (DOM) tree structure:    Our goal as an attacker is to control the node in this stage of HTML parsing.  As my mentor Joe DeMesy once described it to me, if you can control a node&#39;s context and content, you will have XSS.\n Script Execution \u2013 This stage refers to when JavaScript alters the DOM. Additional details about this stage are out of the scope of this blog post.\n DOM \u2013 The end state of the processing where the document object model is built.\n KEY TAKEAWAY:   Now you should have a high-level understanding of how data flows through the HTML parsing process and how the information is organized, which will come into play during exploitation.\n  During the    tokenization stage, the HTML parser will sort the HTML elements into different categories of data states known as the   Context State. The  HTML specification lists the   Context State\u00a0switching elements as follows:\n Set the state of the\u00a0 HTML parser &#39;s\u00a0 tokenization \u00a0stage as follows, switching on the\u00a0  context \u00a0element:    title    textarea  Switch the tokenizer to the\u00a0 RCDATA state .    style   xmp   iframe   noembed    noframes  Switch the tokenizer to the\u00a0 RAWTEXT state .    script  Switch the tokenizer to the\u00a0 script data state .    noscript  If the\u00a0 scripting flag \u00a0is enabled, switch the tokenizer to the\u00a0 RAWTEXT state . Otherwise, leave the tokenizer in the\u00a0 data state .   plaintext  Switch the tokenizer to the\u00a0 PLAINTEXT state .   Any other element  Leave the tokenizer in the\u00a0 data state .\n The visualization below shows what some of these context states look like in practice:     RCDATA\u00a0example:\n                            Note that the   data state\u00a0is the only state that attempted to load an image. This is because data is a computer instruction and not simply text data.\n KEY TAKEAWAY: Different supplied elements alter how data in those elements is parsed and rendered by switching the   Context State of the data.\n   The browser\u2019s HTML parser understands more than just HTML; it can switch between three distinct namespaces: HTML, MathML, and SVG.\n During HTML parsing, if either a   &lt;svg&gt; or   &lt;math&gt;\u00a0namespace element (tag) is encountered, the parser will switch context to the respective namespace. What this context switch means to us is the parser is no longer parsing as HTML but rather MathML or SVG.\n This namespace context switch results in unexpected behavior when HTML is embedded in MathML/SVG, as each namespace has its own distinct elements and parses slightly differently. As penetration testers, we can exploit this logic in some instances to confuse the parser into allowing XSS.\n Micha\u0142 Bentkowski&#39;s DOMPurify   bypass  writeup provides a more in-depth look on namespace confusion, including cutting-edge research and a great example.\n KEY TAKEAWAY:  The HTML parser will context switch to separate namespaces when it encounters MathML or SVG elements, which can be used to confuse the parser.\n   To exploit sanitizing lexical parsers, we need to understand the general flow of how they work. At a high level, the general flow is as follows:\n    The goal of exploitation is to provide HTML that will trick the sanitizing parser into believing the provided input is non-dangerous text data (  RCDATA,   PLAINTEXT , or   RAWTEXT) when it is actually computer instructions (  data state). This is often possible for several reasons: HTML is not designed to be parsed twice; slight variations in parsing can occur between the initial HTML parser and the sanitizing parser; and sanitizing parsers often implement their own processing logic.\n   TinyMCE is a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) HTML text editor and JavaScript library. It is typically included in third-party websites to provide text editing functionality, including HTML text.\n CVE-2020-12648 (XSS in TinyMCE), which was discovered by George Steketee and I, will serve as a test case for how HTML parsing caveats can be leveraged to gain XSS in cases where a sanitizing parser is used. In the TinyMCE advisory, XSS was achieved with the following payload:\n   This payload was successful because of an issue in the tokenization and tree construction phases. In particular, when the HTML was reparsed by the lexical parser, it did not properly account for the order of elements before assigning the context state.\n The   &lt;iframe&gt;\u00a0element caused the context state to switch to   RAWTEXT, which meant that the data following the   iframe was considered not dangerous and did not require sanitization. This context switch ended at the closing tag of   &lt;/iframe&gt;. However, the   &lt;textarea&gt;\u00a0element also instructed the parser to switch to the   RCDATA\u00a0context, another form of non-dangerous text data. The context switch to   RCDATA was contained within the   iframe\u00a0elements when they were processed by the HTML parser. This containment is what the TinyMCE parser failed to realize.\n When this was parsed, the TinyMCE parser failed to consider the proper order of operations and context switches. Therefore, the DOM tree construction performed by the final post-sanitization HTML parser looked like this:\n   Note that the   img element with the active content   onerror\u00a0 event is within the   text\u00a0context in the DOM tree; when lexically parsed, this would register as non-dangerous and not be stripped or output encoded. Since the   textarea element was contained in the   iframe , the   img element was not actually within a   textarea\u00a0element. Therefore, the active content (JavaScript) executed and XSS was achieved.\n   Froala is a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) HTML text editor and JavaScript library that is similar in functionality to TinyMCE. For a second test case, we will review an XSS vulnerability that was found as a part of this research ( CVE-2021-28114). In the advisory for this CVE, I detailed how XSS was achieved using the following payload:\n  This payload is functionally the same as the TinyMCE XSS discussed in Test Case 1 of this blog post with one caveat. Entering the   MathML namespace to cause parsing confusion (in Froala&#39;s instance, restricting a comment within   iframe\u00a0elements) was not enough to confuse the Froala parser. However, Froala&#39;s parser did not understand   MathML namespace tags and would drop the tags but continue parsing the remaining content. The result was the HTML parser creating nodes with the payload restricted to text data, as shown in the tree below:\n  However, since Froala&#39;s parser omitted the    &lt;math&gt; element, it would still incorrectly view the    img\u00a0element payload as a non-dangerous comment. When the JavaScript payload was processed by the final-stage HTML parser and placed into the DOM, it would do so as follows:\n  The result was the XSS payload execution. This can be further visualized by examining the post-exploitation source code:\n   The Froala parser removed the    &lt;math&gt; element and added a    --&gt; to close what it believed was a comment. The final-stage HTML parser viewed the opening comment as contained within   iframe\u00a0elements and set the closing comment element added by the Froala parser to the    RCDATA\u00a0state, ignoring it as a valid closing tag. The result was active content execution (XSS).\n   When implementing applications that allow some user-controlled HTML by design, the key to avoiding these types of bugs is to process the HTML as close to the original parse as possible. While doing so, it is important to account for the order of elements and embed the elements\u2019 context. These XSS issues within lexical analysis will arise if there is a variation in how the HTML parser views a node versus how the sanitizing parser views a node. It is also advisable to blacklist MathML and SVG namespace elements when they are not required and completely drop any request containing these (i.e., do not continue to write the data into the DOM).\n For organizations that are not creating these types of solutions but rather including them in their applications, a good patch policy will go a long way in preventing exploitation. I recommend checking for the latest versions of these libraries and patching them on a regular and organizationally defined basis.\n In addition to security controls at the code/application level, organizations should consider implementing a content security policy (CSP) into the application. A well-defined CSP can block JavaScript injection at a browser-defined level, creating a defense-in-depth security posture. Additionally, the CSP should avoid directives such as     unsafe-inline or    unsafe-eval, as these can allow user-defined inline JavaScript execution. For more on CSP, please refer to this informative  article.\n   Even when input is lexically analyzed, XSS may still be possible by exploiting caveats in how HTML is parsed and reparsed by whatever sanitization library is in use. When testing for this type of XSS, I recommend fuzzing inputs with various namespace and context switching elements, recording any interesting results, and working off those results.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "Most terminal user interfaces can be used by blind users pretty easily. But why is that, actually? After all, the content of a terminal is pretty much unstructured data. A rectangular grid of characters with no extra information except colours. But is that really true?\n The most important bit of metadata for a terminal screen reader is actually the cursor location. This is the one bit of information that is required to make a unstructured grid of characters surprisingly useful to a person mostly constraint to linear reading.\n The terminal cursor acts as the focus. It indicates which part of the screen is currently being edited or selected. For editors, this is a pretty well understood concept. Where the cursor is, the next character will be inserted. However, there is more to a  text-based user interface then just editing fields. And the cursor is not always visible.\n  A while ago, I looked at the  brick terminal UI library for Haskell. When I tried its various  demo programs, I noticed that  my screen reader was reporting the cursor being in the lower right corner of the application when a menu item was selected. I had to manually investigate the screen and look at attributes (colours) to figure out which item in a list was currently selected. Amongst BRLTTY developers, we\u2019ve decided long ago to not work around these issues on the screen reader side, rather try and make use of open source and fix the problems whenever we see them in the wild. Behind the scenes, we have fixed a bunch of frameworks and applications to place the cursor at the locus of focus. So I set out to understand brick internals to fix this.\n  brick works different from most TUI frameworks I know. You don\u2019t have a single cursor which you set to a particular location. Rather, all the different components drawn on the screen can declare their own cursor location, and the composition mechansim ultimately chooses which cursor should be used.\n This, while being pretty flexible, looked fundamentally wrong to me. Why? It doesn\u2019t reflect the reality of a terminal.\n  There is no such thing as \u201cno cursor\u201d in a terminal. The cursor might be hidden, so it is not rendered on the screen. But the cursor still has a location where it sits and waits to print the next output character to the screen. A screen reader will pick that location up, no matter if the cursor is visible or hidden.\n  So after patching brick to declare a cursor when rendering certain list items, checkboxes and radio items, I realized the actual missing bit. brick had no concept of cursor visibility. Rather, if the composition mechansim did not see a cursor declared, it would hide the cursor on-screen and \u201cpretend\u201d there was none. However, as we have learnt above, thats just not true and programs like screen readers actually rely on the cursor location to indicate the locus of fucs.\n Raising this issue with the brick maintainer uncovered the fact that the low level  vty library used by brick to do the actual terminal output did not have a concept of a hidden cursor either. Jonathan fixed this in  vty 5.33.\n  And since vty 5.33 is now in stack LTS, I thought to myself yesterday it is time to finally  add support for invisible cursors to brick.\n There is now a new function putCursor which has the same type signature as the already existing  showCursor, but will make sure the cursor is not visible on-screen. This can and should be used to place a cursor at the locus of focus, even if that location is already visually indicated by different attributes.\n The stock widgets that come with brick should now all be screen reader friendly.

Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn\u2019t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members\u2019 professional identities for the entirety of their career \u2014 it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.\u201d\n In the EU \u2018illegal hate speech\u2019 can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.\n A number of Member States have national laws on the issue \u2014 and some have  passed their own legislation specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.\n The initiative kicked off  back in 2016 \u2014 when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).\n Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined \u2014 with video sharing platform  TikTok signing up last October, for example.\n But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren\u2019t participating. Hence the Commission\u2019s call for more digital services companies to get on board.\n At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.\n L ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the  Digital Services Act) to existing ecommerce rules  to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements \u2014 in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods.  So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles \u2014 at least at a high level \u2014 the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code.\n The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns ( this April) \u2014 which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.\n But it\u2019s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation \u2014 as Reynders\u2019 remarks underline.\n Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of \u2018carrots and sticks\u2019 where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial \u2018danger zone\u2019 of speech regulation.\n So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized \u2018notice and response\u2019 procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there\u2019s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).\n  The EU has \u2014 for several years \u2014 had a  voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)\n And while lawmakers recently  announced a plan to beef that Code up \u2014 to make it \u201cmore binding\u201d, as they oxymoronically put it \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.\n In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.\n It added that it welcomed the results \u2014 but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.\n The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of \u2018fake news\u2019 being fenced on their platforms, including \u2014 on the public health front \u2014 what they last year dubbed a  coronavirus infodemic.\n The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers\u2019 minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "The leader of the Vlog Squad built an empire on goofy pranks and wild stunts. Now he\u2019s under fire for turning trauma into content. Can he make a comeback in a culture driven by clicks?\n         The YouTuber David Dobrik is driving his white Tesla through the verdant hills of suburban Los Angeles, explaining the challenges of selling thin-crust-style pizza in L.A., his assistant Natalie texting in the back seat and Billy Joel on pause on the stereo, when he abruptly stops talking. \u201cI got this,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys.\u201d He leaps out of the driver\u2019s seat to help an elderly lady with a walker cross the street.\n Just a few short hours ago, on the tail end of several controversies surrounding Dobrik and his   collective, the Vlog Squad, squad member Jeff Wittek had released a video alleging that Dobrik permanently maimed him in an elaborate stunt gone wrong. All over social media, people were calling Dobrik a sociopath and accusing him of mining his friends\u2019 trauma for content. And here he was, blithely chatting about his new pizza franchise and helping an old lady cross the street.\n  After a few seconds, Dobrik jumps back into the car, giggling. \u201cWe did that on purpose for you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to have a grandma crossing the street, but I couldn\u2019t keep my composure.\u201d As we drive away, the woman, who Natalie and David tell me was an actor paid $200 simply to walk in front of our car, waves and grins.\n When I ask Dobrik if this scene was staged as a way to distract from or counteract the effects of the Wittek video, he looks at me, confused and maybe a little bit wounded that I would so grossly misinterpret the intention behind a fun prank. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were just trying to do something stupid and silly.\u201d And I laugh, partially because it  is stupid and silly, but also because I\u2019m in a $150,000 car in the Hollywood Hills with an extremely wealthy and charismatic stranger and his assistant, and I don\u2019t want to seem like I can\u2019t take a joke, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure what the joke is.\n Such is my initiation into David Dobrik\u2019s world: where the lines are constantly blurred between fantasy and reality, what\u2019s genuine and what\u2019s content; where everyone is having fun, no one could possibly get hurt, and the rehabilitation of one\u2019s reputation is just $200 and a call to a casting agency away.\n Calling Dobrik a YouTuber is sort of like calling Batman a morose vigilante with a trust fund: While technically true, it\u2019s far from the whole story. Dobrik is the leader of the Vlog Squad, a motley crew of aspiring comedians, Instagram sexpots, and other sundry influencers and creators who zip around Los Angeles filming gross-out pranks, stunts, and lavish giveaways, resulting in an aesthetic that\u2019s a cross of  Jackass,  Entourage, and  The Oprah Winfrey Show. Dobrik has racked up more than 18 million followers on his main channel alone and, in 2020, was estimated by  Forbes to have earned $15.5 million. His white Tesla has been a fixture on the streets of L.A., portending for unsuspecting passersby free iPads or cash or cars, or, if nothing else, the tantalizing promise of 36 million eyeballs on them.\n  Those who follow Dobrik\u2019s slickly edited, four-minute-and-20-second vlogs are intimately familiar with the members of his crew: Jason Nash, a 48-year-old former comic turned co-host of Dobrik\u2019s podcast  Views; aspiring musician and straight man Scotty Sire; reformed bad boy Wittek; Corinna Kopf, a former Hooters waitress and tinder for dumb-blonde jokes; and Natalie Mariduena, Dobrik\u2019s comely 24-year-old assistant and high school best friend, who\u2019s perpetually rumored to be dating him. (Mariduena is actually dating fellow Vlog Squad member Todd Smith, but that doesn\u2019t stop her and Dobrik from playing up a flirtation whenever possible, as she acknowledges: \u201cPeople love seeing us together. They love us interacting with each other and doing funny stuff. Relationship stuff on the internet always is like good clickbait. It gets good views and whatnot.\u201d)\n Functionally, the Vlog Squad primarily serve as yes-men; when they\u2019re not confronting one of their deep-seated phobias or performing some daredevil stunt, they\u2019re on the sidelines, laughing uproariously at the action. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the modern-day  Friends, with a laugh track,\u201d says Wittek of squad members\u2019 roles. \u201cIt tells someone that this is a joke, that it\u2019s OK to laugh at it here.\u201d Many of the more popular recurring characters in Dobrik\u2019s videos are his childhood friends, which helps to foster the gang-of-goofballs dynamic. His housemate Ilya, Mariduena, and Mariduena\u2019s own assistant Reggie are all from Dobrik\u2019s Illinois hometown. \u201cHe\u2019s so attached to his childhood and his youth and his inner being as a kid,\u201d says Mariduena.\n In the center of it all is Dobrik with his camera, affable, puppy-eyed, and perpetually amused by everything and everybody. In person, he is just as unfailingly enthusiastic. \u201cEverybody that has money, everybody that has success, hides all of it. It\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t talk about, or like a secret,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I like sharing all of it. I love showing people things. I\u2019m obsessed with it.\u201d\n  The moment I step into his $9.5 million Sherman Oaks mansion, he does just that. First, he brings me over to his Hawaiian Punch water fountain, inspired by the Adam Sandler film  Mr. Deeds. Next, he shows me his office, where he records his podcast, and which I recognize from one of his recent apology videos, where he was flanked by a Kids\u2019 Choice Award and a potted Baby Groot. We end in the living room, which looks as if it\u2019s been decorated by a 12-year-old with an unlimited budget: There\u2019s a life-size R2D2 animatronic he bought via his friend John Stamos; a Buzz Lightyear portrait made of Rubik\u2019s cubes; a framed photo of a text exchange referencing his losing $288,000 on GameStop stocks (\u201cI wanted something out of that negative situation, like some kind of art piece,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the internet I only lost 80K, so if you could tell them I didn\u2019t lose that much, that\u2019d be great\u201d); rows upon rows of hard candy. Mariduena and Dobrik\u2019s other assistant, an amiable young blond woman named Taylor Hudson who also regularly appears in his videos, stay anchored to the kitchen island on their phones and laptops, the adults in the room, even though both are also in their mid-twenties.\n Shaggy-haired and casually dressed in a Dodgers cap, track pants, and a T-shirt from the restaurant Jon and Vinny\u2019s, Dobrik reminds me of Tom Hanks\u2019 character at the end of  Big, after he finds the Zoltar machine \u2014 a child cosplaying in an adult man\u2019s body. At one point, his attention wavers and he starts casually roaming around his kitchen on a penny board. I half expect someone to come out and yell at him to stop doing that in the house; but, of course, he is 24, and it is his $9.5 million house, so no one does. In all, he comes off as someone who is constantly in awe of the cosmic ridiculousness of his own good fortune. \u201cDavid hasn\u2019t really experienced much pain in his life,\u201d notes Wittek. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty smooth upbringing for him. His life has kind of been just straight up and not really many downs.\u201d\n  Dobrik moved to this new home in January, but he has not yet sold his old house nearby, allowing friends to use it for shoots. The next day I\u2019ll get a tour of that one, too, with Dobrik pointing out the detritus of old stunts, videos, and branding campaigns: a Chipotle-burrito claw machine the company gave him after releasing a burrito in his honor; a miniature Tesla; a ceiling damaged by an elephant toothpaste prank. As we walk through the garage, he tells me about a time a few years ago when he found a homeless person asleep on his couch at 2 a.m., wearing his merch; the man had defecated all over his couch. I ask if he posted it to YouTube, and he says yes.\n  \u201cBecause I\u2019ll never remember it better than if it was on film,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love filming things. I don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t film everything. Everything should be filmed.\u201d\n  At the start of 2020, Dobrik was uniquely positioned for crossover success, something he is not shy about admitting he has always craved. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s almost like a caste system in the entertainment world, where if you\u2019re a YouTuber or a TikToker, you\u2019re just branded as that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with accepting myself because I\u2019ve always wanted the respect of the traditional world. But I\u2019ve always known that at one point, the traditional world is going to meet up with being here, and it\u2019s all going to be the same.\u201d\n With the 2019 launch of his photo app Dispo, which mimics the look and the experience of developing disposable-camera pictures, Dobrik had crossed over into the tech space. Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian was a lead investor, and at one point, the app had a nearly $200 million valuation. Also in the works were a TV series and a pizza franchise called Doughbrik\u2019s, as well as brand deals with corporate giants like HelloFresh, DoorDash, and SeatGeek. \u201cHe\u2019s inherently entrepreneurial,\u201d says Joe Gagliese, CEO of influencer marketing firm Viral Nation, who\u2019s known Dobrik since he was getting started on the now-defunct platform Vine in 2013. \u201cHe was knocking on the door of being the face of major brands across the U.S. He was right there.\u201d\n  And then, he wasn\u2019t. In the spring of 2021, former Vlog Squad members like Seth Francois and Nik Keswani, a.k.a. Big Nik, started to accuse Dobrik of building a culture of bullying, cultural insensitivity, and consent violations. In March,  Insider published the account of a woman named \u201cHannah,\u201d who accused Dobrik\u2019s longtime friend and Vlog Squad member \u201cDurte\u201d Dom Zeglaitis of sexually assaulting her in a 2018 incident that was partially captured by Dobrik on video. Major brands started to distance themselves from Dobrik, and he resigned from the board of Dispo. His fans, primarily zoomers who had come of age watching his energetic vlogs, also started to turn on him. He lost a total of 400,000 followers during March and April, according to SocialBlade data.\n Then came the revelation, the day of our first meeting in April, that he had grievously injured Wittek in a stunt involving an excavator on a lake in Utah, inspired by an extreme-sports YouTuber named Devin Super Tramp. The footage reignited an outcry from people accusing Dobrik of exploiting Vlog Squad members and endangering them for views. And even though this is far from a rare phenomenon in the beef-driven, controversy-fueled, caps-lock-titled world of YouTube, the fact that Dobrik had amassed a reputation as something of a wholesome boy next door (despite the bulk of his content being fairly profane and fratty) made his fall from grace even more precipitous. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on such a pedestal anymore,\u201d says Trisha Paytas, a YouTuber who was briefly in the Vlog Squad. Paytas, who goes by they/them pronouns, has frequently criticized the group on their podcast  Frenemies.\n During my visit, Dobrik was on a self-imposed social media hiatus; though he\u2019d previously spent most of his time shooting, editing, or ideating content, now his days consisted of little more than the occasional pizza-franchise meeting. (He resumed posting on June 15th, with a video titled \u201cSURPRISING MY FRIENDS!!!\u201d which showed his squad on vacation in Hawaii and made no mention of the controversies.) Our meeting had been in the works for a while, before the  Insider story broke, and in the days leading up to it, as his sponsors fell away and the social media mobs swarmed, I became more and more sure that he was going to cancel. But he didn\u2019t, and as we sat by his infinity pool on a sunny Friday afternoon, it was clear why: He was still struggling to make sense of what he had done to warrant such ire.\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that what we were making had such power. I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says, looking smaller than his five-foot-10 frame in an oversize sweatshirt. \u201cSo when [the  Insider story came out], I was like, \u2018What? I\u2019m responsible for someone making a bad decision?\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. But it was all because of this environment of wanting to put on this show.\u201d\n As a child growing up in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia, Dobrik was reserved and \u201chighly sensitive,\u201d his mother, Kristina, says. He\u2019d slept in his parents\u2019 bedroom until he was five, and would cry every morning before he went to preschool. Once, she recalls, she brought him toys to play with in the sandbox, and some bigger kids came over and took them. But David didn\u2019t get upset. \u201cHe just sat down and was just very happy watching how they played with his toys,\u201d she says. \u201cI was happy he didn\u2019t make any fuss about it, though I didn\u2019t want him to be a pushover. But he was just so happy he could share his toys.\u201d\n When he was five years old, Dobrik\u2019s parents moved to Toledo, Ohio, where Kristina had previously lived for a year with an elderly relative after graduating from high school. Kristina had learned some English from watching  Full House reruns and loved how friendly people were in America. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea to go overseas, to make a better life for David,\u201d she says. When the family relocated to Skokie, Illinois, outside of Chicago, David followed them there, flying on a plane from Slovakia all by himself. They later moved to nearby Vernon Hills, an upper-middle-class suburb, where Dobrik\u2019s father started a real-estate-photography company, while Kristina stayed at home with David.\n Kristina says David underwent something of a metamorphosis in America, blossoming from a shy kid to a gregarious class clown; his first words in English, she says, were \u201cgood boy,\u201d which is what his kindergarten teachers called him. At his home, Dobrik shows me an essay he wrote in high school, in which he recounts his journey from Slovakia and expresses his joy at having left the country. Because of his DACA status, he has not been back to the country of his birth since he was seven years old, but he has little interest. \u201cI was obsessed with America. I thought it was like the coolest fucking place in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom how I remember it, Slovakia is very much like if you were to watch a documentary about the Soviet Union or Russia that shows kids in a line with trays and an old lunch lady putting beans on a tray. I almost see it, like, in a different filter, like in sepia. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but here is like the land of opportunity, and you can become anything you want.\u201d\n   Dobrik didn\u2019t have a girlfriend in high school \u2014 he was \u201ctoo squirrel-brained\u201d for that, says his former tennis coach Shannon Etnyre \u2014 but he was friendly and generally well-liked, the type of kid who\u2019d randomly offer hugs to students in the halls. \u201cHe was perfectly right in the middle and friends with everybody,\u201d says Mariduena. He was also a mediocre student, putting in just enough effort to pass his classes. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why it mattered,\u201d says Dobrik.\n Yet even though he spent the majority of his time arguing with teachers over doing work, many of them, like his English teacher Jeff Killinger, couldn\u2019t help but like him. \u201cHis philosophy was, \u2018If I can cheat or in some way get this work done in a way that doesn\u2019t require effort, then that\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d says Killinger, who became a mentor to Dobrik after graduation, fielding FaceTime calls and requests to help with Dobrik\u2019s taxes. \u201c[Every day] I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let this kid do this to me tomorrow,\u2019 and every day he would. He was just that charming and funny.\u201d\n Dobrik took an equally laissez-faire approach to tennis, which he started playing as a young child and continued throughout high school. Etnyre remembers him as an \u201cawkward-looking freshman with a Justin Bieber haircut\u201d who was nonetheless \u201cjust destroying on the tennis court.\u201d Ultimately, Dobrik was good enough to become all-state and be scouted by various universities. \u201cI liked that if you fuck up, that you\u2019re to blame,\u201d he says of his attraction to the sport. \u201cI hated the pressure of letting the team down. It\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re just playing by yourself and then you fuck up. It\u2019s just on you.\u201d (Despite this aversion to pressure, Dobrik has an indisputably competitive side: When I watch him play at Mulholland Tennis Club a few hours later, he is intensely focused, chiding his doubles partner Mariduena for missing shots. \u201cWe\u2019re just having fun right now,\u201d Jason Nash, who was in recovery from hip surgery, calls from the sidelines. \u201cNothing fun about this,\u201d Dobrik retorts.)\n  Though Dobrik had murky aspirations of joining the entertainment business in some capacity, he was always fascinated by the idea of making money. \u201cA lot of people that come from overseas that are immigrants and first generation are really, really hungry to be successful, and that was definitely his case,\u201d says Dobrik\u2019s best friend and housemate Ilya Fedorovich, who was born in Belarus. \u201cHis family and my family, we\u2019re not the richest. We survive by our means. I think that one of the reasons that he\u2019s supersuccessful now is that he didn\u2019t have much when he was growing up, but he wanted a lot.\u201d In high school, when Dobrik was working as a waiter, he and his friends would discuss their incomes with one another in the school cafeteria. \u201cPeople say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. And I completely get that,\u201d Dobrik says. \u201cBut I think you can alleviate so much stress and so much burden from money, so it helps you to the road of happiness.\u201d\n When Dobrik was 16, Mariduena introduced him to the social media outlet that would change his life forever: the short-form video platform Vine. At the time he joined, Vine was starting to become a launching pad for creators like King Bach, Nash Grier, and Dobrik\u2019s future girlfriend Liza Koshy. Even though he only had a few thousand followers early on, Dobrik saw the potential. \u201cI saw the people making money on Vine and actually getting brand deals and moving out to L.A., and I was like, \u2018Holy fuck, I think I could turn this into a career,\u2019\u201d he says. He won his first brand deal, $50 for a to-do-list app called Do!, in high school, and celebrated with his friends at Buffalo Wild Wings.\n What\u2019s notable about Dobrik\u2019s early Vines is not just how young he looks \u2014 he has braces, wears rubber bracelets, and mugs for the camera with his trademark puppyish enthusiasm \u2014 but how much darker they are than his more aw-shucks YouTube presence. In one Vine, he pretends to be a disabled person in a wheelchair; in another, he chides a friend for making an Asian joke, saying, \u201cThey have enough on their plate. Like cats and dogs\u201d; and in another, he says the n-word. He issued a vague apology for these offenses last summer.\n  In speaking about his earlier content, Dobrik blames a combination of the freewheeling climate on Vine and his youth. \u201cI was a fucking 16-year-old idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was just chaos. And it was just the way Vine was. It was so much darker, and no one batted an eye when you did stuff like that.\u201d But even though he pivoted away from explicit edgelord humor once he started blowing up, there is an element of his vlog persona that has remained consistent. Much of the humor is contingent on knowing the identities of the people in his videos: the skeevy older man (Nash), the slutty girl (Kopf), the heartthrob (Smith), the fat kid (Nick Antonyan, a.k.a. Jonah), the bad boy (Wittek). Even though it\u2019s his channel, Dobrik is rarely the butt of the joke.\n A semester into his first year at College of Lake County in Illinois, Dobrik visited Los Angeles to network with other Viners as a trial period for potentially moving out West. On the plane ride back to Chicago, he says, he had the distinct sense that L.A. was his home. \u201cIt was a dramatic, Troy Bolton,  High School Musical-type scene. Like, \u2018This is my dream, I have to pursue it,\u2019\u201d he says. With two of his high school friends, including Dom, and a third friend he\u2019d met on Vine, he moved into a small apartment in West Hollywood. His father was a guara\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 00:28:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "youtube,2020,dobrik,turning", "title": "David Dobrik\u7684\u6982\u51b5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u611a\u8822\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\u81ed\u540d\u662d\u7740\u7684\u611a\u8822\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u57282020\u5e74\u8d5a\u53d6\u4e861550\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u706b\u707e\u4e2d\u906d\u5230\u9020\u6210\u521b\u4f24 ", "title_en": "Profile of David Dobrik, a YouTuber notorious for goofy pranks who earned an estimated $15.5M in 2020, and is now under fire for turning trauma into content", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/david-dobrik-youtube-vlog-squad-profile-1185706/amp/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "2020", "dobrik", "turning"]}]
