And ace it you would indeed.</p><p>对于初学者来说，您在学校会做得更好。不用躺在床上就睡不着第二天的考试，您就可以在知道自己掌握考试所需的一切知识的情况下，充分入睡。而王牌确实可以。</p><p> You would have spent fewer hours studying. How many times have you opened the textbook only to find that you’ve forgotten all that you’d studied the day before? If you did not forget things then those hours you spent studying would always amount to something, instead of leaving you feeling like you’re swimming against the current.

There is no one that has not grappled with this problem before. Our lives would be better if we did not forget.</p><p>健忘影响着我们所有人。没有人以前没有解决过这个问题。如果我们不忘记，我们的生活会更好。</p><p> Unfortunately,  forgetting is inescapable. There is no such thing as a perfect memory.

It has known about it for a while now, in fact. It’s just that it has done a terrible job so far at making sure that you know about it, you whose life would massively benefit from that knowledge.</p><p>科学已经知道如何使记忆长时间留在您的记忆中。实际上，它已经知道了一段时间了。到目前为止，它只是在确保您了解这一点上做得很糟糕，您的一生将因此而受益匪浅。</p><p> My intent for writing this is to correct these wrongs and introduce you to spaced repetition, the more than established method that will put you in control of your memory once and for all, and Anki, the software that will help you do so.</p><p>我写这篇文章的目的是纠正这些错误，并向您介绍间隔重复，这是一种已建立的方法，它将使您一劳永逸地控制内存，而Anki则可以帮助您做到这一点。</p><p>   More than a hundred years ago, the German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus not only started the scientific study of memory, but he also made its most impactful discovery.</p><p>一百多年前，德国心理学家赫尔曼·埃宾格豪斯（Hermann Ebbinghaus）不仅开始了记忆的科学研究，而且还做出了最有影响力的发现。</p><p>  Ebbinghaus created various lists of nonsense syllables that he had to memorize, and once he was able to mouth off the entire list without making a single mistake he would mark on his calendar the day where he had to memorize that list once more.</p><p>Ebbinghaus创建了许多他必须记住的废话音节列表，一旦他能够完整列出整个列表而又没有犯一个错误，他将在他必须再次记住该列表的那天在日历上作标记。</p><p> He would have to memorize some lists the day after, others a week and some a whole month after he had first memorized them. Doesn’t sound much fun, does it? This is especially true when you take into account each list must have taken him quite a long time to memorize since by design each of the three-letter syllables he had to study had been chosen so that they weren’t easily remembered. For example, the syllable BOL was out of the question as Ebbinghaus could instead use BALL to recall it.</p><p>他将不得不在第二天记住一些清单，而在他第一次记住它们之后的一个星期和整个月要记住一些清单。听起来不是很有趣吗？当考虑到每个列表一定要花很长的时间来记忆时，尤其如此，因为通过设计，他必须学习的每个三个字母的音节都经过选择，以使它们不容易被记住。例如，由于Ebbinghaus可以改用BALL来调用它，所以音节BOL完全不可行。</p><p> After the requisite time had passed, to measure the extent to which he had forgotten the list he’d spent so much time memorizing, he memorized the same list once more. Not only did he have to sit still in his office for a long time trying to memorize a bunch of nonsense words once, he had to do it twice! Throughout his second attempt he did have some help since it would take him less time to memorize the list the second time around if he remembered it from his first foray cramming it into his memory.</p><p>经过必要的时间后，为了衡量他忘记了自己花费大量时间记忆的清单的程度，他再次记忆了相同的清单。他不仅不得不长时间呆在办公室里试图一次记住一堆废话，还不得不两次！在他的第二次尝试中，他确实得到了一些帮助，因为如果他记得第一次将其塞入记忆中的时候，第二次记住该列表将花费更少的时间。</p><p> If by that point he’d already forgotten it, then it would take him at least as much time to memorize the list the second time as it had the first. However, if some memory of it still lingered in the confines of his mind, he would be able to go through the list faster than before. By varying the amount of time between each attempt, and seeing how that influenced how long it took him then to memorize the list the second time,  Ebbinghaus was able to measure the effect time had on his memory.</p><p>如果到那时他已经忘记了它，那么第二次记住列表所需的时间至少要比第一次少。但是，如果对它的某些记忆仍然在他的脑海中徘徊，那么他将能够比以前更快地通过这份清单。通过改变每次尝试之间的时间量，并查看它如何影响他第二次记住列表所花费的时间，埃宾豪斯能够衡量时间对他记忆的影响。</p><p>  The first thing he noticed was that memories are at their most fragile when they are still young. From the data he’d collected, he could see that the bulk of forgetting happens in the few moments after the memory is created. Rather than forgetting happening at a linear pace over time, each day that passes nicking a constant amount of the vitality of a memory until it is completely forgotten, Ebbinghaus discovered  forgetting happens rather rapidly at first but slows down afterward.</p><p>他注意到的第一件事是，记忆在他们还很小的时候就处于最脆弱的状态。从他收集的数据中，他可以看到在创建内存后的短时间内发生了很多遗忘。 Ebbinghaus并没有像过去那样以线性的速度随时间推移忘记事情，而是每天刻不容缓地记住恒定的记忆活力，直到被完全忘记为止，而他发现遗忘的起步速度相当快，但其后却减慢了速度。</p><p> In the first few hours of its life, it’s as if your newly created memory has jumped out of a flying airplane and is now free-falling through the sky, the wind buffeting its face violently as it quickly loses altitude. As the ground becomes uncomfortably close, our memory activates its parachute and begins to glide, still falling, of course, but much slower than it was when it first jumped out of the plane.  Now, to be sure,  the forgetting curve, as this discovery came to be called, is an important landmark in the scientific study of memory, but it’s not a particularly useful one. We forget things over time; what a discovery! You don’t need to be a top-level scientist to come to that conclusion. It’s why we’re here in the first place!</p><p>在生命的最初几个小时，就好像您新创建的记忆已经从飞行中的飞机上跳了起来，现在正从空中自由落下一样，风迅速摇晃着脸，使其迅速失去了高度。当地面变得不舒服时，我们的记忆会激活其降落伞并开始滑行，当然仍然会掉落，但比它第一次跳出飞机时要慢得多。现在，可以肯定的是，这一发现被人们称为“遗忘曲线”，是记忆科学研究中的重要里程碑，但并不是特别有用。随着时间的流逝，我们忘记了事情；真是个发现！您无需成为顶级科学家即可得出结论。这就是为什么我们首先来到这里！</p><p>   But Ebbinghaus didn’t stop there. When he first started learning his lists of nonsense syllables, Ebbinghaus, like many a student, crammed all his studying in a single furious session. But then, possibly because he was fed up with all the cramming, he hit upon the idea of spreading his learning over time. Instead of spending the majority of a day learning one of his lists, he spaced out his learning over a few days.  What he found when he did so is the most important discovery about memory that no one ever told you about.</p><p>但是埃宾豪斯并没有就此止步。埃宾豪斯（Ebbinghaus）刚开始学习自己的废话音节清单时，就像许多学生一样，在一次激烈的讨论中就塞满了所有学习内容。但是后来，可能是因为他厌倦了所有的填塞工作，于是他想到了随时间传播学习的想法。他没有花一天的大部分时间来学习他的一个列表，而是花了几天的时间在学习上。他这样做时发现的是关于记忆的最重要发现，这是没人曾告诉过您的。</p><p> You would think not much would change if instead of studying a bunch of material in one day you did so over three or more days. But what Ebbinghaus found was that not only did his memory get stronger, but it also took him less time to memorize his lists. This meant that  simply by changing when he studied, Ebbinghaus could have the best of both worlds: a better memory with less time spent studying.</p><p>如果您不花一天时间研究一堆材料而不是三天或更长时间，您会认为不会有太大变化。但是埃宾豪斯发现的不仅是他的记忆力增强了，而且还减少了他记住自己名单的时间。这意味着只要改变学习时间，埃宾豪斯就可以同时兼顾两个方面的优势：更好的记忆力和更少的学习时间。</p><p> It need not be pointed out how important a discovery this is. If someone came up to you and told you about a revolutionary studying method that would not only cut the time you spent studying but also get you to retain the things you learn for longer, you would think you were being sold on some sort of scam.</p><p>无需指出这是多么重要的发现。如果有人走近告诉您有关一种革命性的学习方法，该方法不仅可以减少您花在学习上的时间，而且可以使您将所学的东西保存得更长久，那么您会以为您被骗了。</p><p> Yet  the spacing effect, as Ebbinghaus’ discovery is called, is far from being a scam. It is  one of the most scientifically supported discoveries in the entire field of psychology.</p><p>然而，正如埃宾豪斯（Ebbinghaus）的发现所称，间隔效应远不是一个骗局。这是整个心理学领域中最受科学支持的发现之一。</p><p> The gist of the spacing effect is rather simple. Given the choice between massing all your studying or spacing it out over a period of time, you are better served by spacing it out.  There is no catch. It really is that simple.</p><p>间隔效果的要点很简单。如果可以选择集中所有学习内容，也可以在一段时间内将其隔开，则最好将其隔开。没有收获。真的就是这么简单。</p><p> This means if you are a student and you have an exam coming up a month from now, you should start studying now rather than waiting until a single week is left. If, for example, you’re going to spend 50 hours studying, then spreading those hours over the whole month, ensuring that you get re-exposed to the material in sufficiently spaced intervals, would get you much better results than you would if you crammed those 50 hours in a single stress-filled and coffee-fueled week.</p><p>这意味着，如果您是学生，并且从现在开始一个月后要进行考试，则应该立即开始学习，而不是等到剩下一个星期。例如，如果您要花费50个小时进行学习，然后将这些时间分散在整个月中，并确保以足够的间隔重新暴露在材料上，则效果会比您好得多在一个充满压力且充满咖啡的一周中，将这50个小时都塞满了。</p><p>  The spacing effect is one of the most important weapons a learner can have on his arsenal but knowing about its amazing effects does not mean that we will necessarily apply it. After all, we all know not to eat too many processed foods do we not? Yet, that doesn’t seem to stop many of us.</p><p>间隔效应是学习者可以在其武器库上使用的最重要的武器之一，但是了解其惊人的效应并不意味着我们一定会应用它。毕竟，我们都知道不要吃太多加工食品，不是吗？但是，这似乎并没有阻止我们许多人。</p><p> Pulling an all-nighter to cram for an exam is like binging on a sugar-filled pastry when one is trying to lose weight, yet the fact it continues to be a staple learning strategy of many a student is a testament to how difficult it can be to embrace the lessons of the spacing effect.</p><p>抽一个通宵做考试的人就像是在尝试减肥的时候在加糖的糕点上加糖一样，但事实仍然是许多学生的主要学习策略，这证明了考试的难度接受间隔效应的教训。</p><p>   One hundred years ago Ebbinghaus didn’t have a computer, let alone a smartphone. If he’d had them they would have taken care of the task of spacing what he had to learn for him. Instead, he had to do all of that himself, though if we consider that he was the kind of guy that did not balk at the idea of spending hundreds of hours learning endless lists of nonsense, perhaps he wasn’t that fazed by it.</p><p>一百年前，埃宾豪斯（Ebbinghaus）没有电脑，更不用说智能手机了。如果他有他们，他们将负责分配他必须为他学习的内容的任务。取而代之的是，他必须自己做所有的事情，尽管如果我们认为他是那种不愿意花数百小时​​学习无休止的废话清单的人，也许他并没有因此而感到困惑。</p><p>   Everyone knows how a flashcard is supposed to work. You write something on the front, then something on the back, and then you’re supposed to recall what it was that you wrote on the back after reading what’s on the front.</p><p>每个人都知道抽认卡应该如何工作。您先在正面写一些东西，然后在背面写些东西，然后再阅读前面的东西，然后回忆一下您在背面写的东西。</p><p> Suppose that in the process of studying for a coming exam, you wrote many of these flashcards. You have a big pile of them sitting on your desk and within them are all the things you have to know if you want to ace that exam.</p><p>假设在为即将到来的考试而学习的过程中，您编写了许多抽认卡。您有很多坐在桌子上的东西，如果要参加该考试，您必须知道其中的所有内容。</p><p> Because you know about the spacing effect, you know that cramming those flashcards is a bad strategy, but then how are you supposed to space them out? There are so many cards to keep track of…</p><p>因为您知道间隔效应，所以知道将这些抽认卡塞满是一个坏策略，但是您应该如何将它们间隔开呢？有太多卡片可以记录…</p><p>  If that were possible, then the computer could take care of the task of keeping track when you’re supposed to review your flashcards and you could focus solely on the things that matter, which, in this case, is answering your flashcards correctly and acing that exam.</p><p>如果可能的话，那么计算机将负责当您应该检查抽认卡时进行跟踪的任务，并且您可以只专注于重要的事情，在这种情况下，这是正确回答抽认卡并发出提示的功能。那个考试。</p><p> Which is why spaced repetition software was invented: to take care of all the grunt work so you can easily add spaced repetition into your life.</p><p>这就是发明间隔重复软件的原因：照顾所有繁重的工作，以便您可以轻松地将间隔重复添加到您的生活中。</p><p> At its core, all spaced repetition software does is keep track of when to present you with the material that you put in it. It’s called spaced repetition software because they use special algorithms to calculate the optimal interval between when you last reviewed the material and when you’re supposed to review it again so you can get all the benefits of the spacing effect.</p><p>本质上，所有间隔重复软件所做的工作都是跟踪何时向您展示放入其中的材料。之所以称其为间隔重复软件，是因为它们使用特殊的算法来计算您上一次查看材料与应该再次查看材料之间的最佳间隔，以便获得间隔效果的所有好处。</p><p> This might not seem much at first, but  spaced repetition software is a revolutionary type of software and starting to use it is of the most impactful decisions you can make. Why?</p><p>乍一看，这似乎并不多，但是间隔重复软件是一种革命性的软件，开始使用它是您可以做出的最具影响力的决定。为什么？</p><p>  Think of it this way: forgetting is inescapable. The forgetting curve is a mean mistress and will pull all your memories down with it. However, the spacing effect tells us there are ways to weaken the forgetting curve’s pull and get memories to stay fresh in your mind for longer. What spaced repetition software does is to automate the job of tracking which memories have become weaker with time so that it can present them to you and thus, through the magical effects of the spacing effect, bring them back to life stronger than ever.</p><p>这样想：忘记是不可避免的。遗忘的曲线是一个卑鄙的情妇，它将使您所有的回忆都落下来。但是，间隔效应告诉我们，有一些方法可以减弱遗忘曲线的拉动，并使您的记忆在您的脑海中保持更长时间。间隔重复软件的作用是使跟踪哪些记忆随着时间变弱而自动执行，以便可以将它们呈现给您，从而通过间隔效应的神奇效果，使它们比以往更强大。</p><p> If the software deems one of your memories to still be strongly rooted within your mind, then it won’t show it the material. If it thinks instead that you’re about to forget the material it will put it in front of you for you to review.</p><p>如果该软件认为您的记忆之一仍然牢牢扎根于您的脑海，那么它就不会向您显示实质内容。如果它认为您将要忘记的材料，它将放在您面前，供您查看。</p><p> As long as you keep using the software, then  anything and everything you put in it has the potential to become something that you remember forever.</p><p>只要您继续使用该软件，那么放入其中的所有内容都有可能成为您永远记住的东西。</p><p>     There are many other kinds of spaced repetition software out there but you should use Anki. There’s a reason it’s the most popular spaced repetition software in the market. It has most of the features you will need and those it doesn’t are available as an add-on by the Anki community.</p><p>还有很多其他间隔的重复软件，但是您应该使用Anki。这是有原因的，它是市场上最流行的间隔重复软件。它具有您所需的大多数功能，而Anki社区没有将这些功能作为附件提供。</p><p> Best of all, it’s free, and I will show you how you can use Anki to improve your memory.</p><p>最重要的是，它是免费的，我将向您展示如何使用Anki改善记忆。</p><p> To start using Anki, you will need to  install it. You already know this of course, but it never hurts to start with the very basics.</p><p>要开始使用Anki，您需要安装它。您当然已经知道了这一点，但是从最基础的内容开始就没有什么害处。</p><p>   This is the main Anki window and it shows the Decks you have in your collection. A  Deck is just a group of cards. You can have as many decks as you want - although Anki struggles when you have a lot of them - but for most people, a single deck will suffice.</p><p>这是Anki主窗口，它显示您的收藏夹中的Decks。甲板只是一组纸牌。您可以拥有任意数量的套牌-尽管Anki在拥有很多套牌时会遇到困难-但对于大多数人而言，一个套牌就足够了。</p><p> On the top menu above there is an Add button. Click on it. It’s time we create our first card.</p><p>在上方的顶部菜单中，有一个添加按钮。点击它。是时候创建第一张卡片了。</p><p>   This is where Anki can become a bit confusing, but I will demystify it for you.</p><p>这是Anki可能会引起混淆的地方，但是我将为您揭开神秘的面纱。</p><p> Know that although Anki is a powerful piece of software, you can do without knowing most of its features and intricacies. You get the bulk of its benefits solely by using it, so you’re better off using it even when you do not understand how all of it works than never using it at all. As the saying goes, perfection is the enemy of good and to use spaced repetition to develop a stronger memory, just using Anki is more than half the battle won.</p><p>要知道，尽管Anki是功能强大的软件，但是您可以在不了解其大部分功能和复杂性的情况下进行操作。您仅通过使用它就能获得大部分好处，因此，即使您根本不了解它的工作原理，也比完全不使用它更好。俗话说，完美是善良的敌人，利用间隔重复来发展更强的记忆力，仅使用Anki就可以赢得一半以上的胜利。</p><p> The first thing to understand about how Anki works is that a  Card - like the flashcards you already know about - is created from a  Note. When you click the ‘Add’ button, the thing you’re adding is a Note, out from which one or more cards will be created by Anki.</p><p>要了解Anki的工作原理，首先要了解的是，卡片是由Note创建的，就像您已经知道的抽认卡一样。当您点击“添加”按钮时，您要添加的内容就是一个便笺，Anki将从其中创建一张或多张卡片。</p><p>  The Front is where you put your question, and the Back is where you put, you guessed it, the answer to that question. It works very much like regular flashcards. You put questions on the Front and answers on the Back.</p><p>前面是您提出问题的位置，而后面是您提出问题的位置，答案就是该问题的答案。它的工作原理与常规抽认卡非常相似。您将问题放在前面，将答案放在后面。</p><p> Using an example from my Deck, here is a card that I added not too long ago:</p><p>以我Deck的示例为例，这是我不久前添加的一张卡片：</p><p>  When Anki deems that it is time for me to review this card, it will show me  “Amygdala is Latin for what?” and I will have to answer,  “Almond”. If you’re wondering why I added this to my collection, it’s because I was reading about the brain and I thought it interesting the amygdala is called that because it is shaped like an almond. I wanted to remember that interesting fact, so I added it to my Anki collection. Now I’ll never forget it. That’s the power of Anki; it puts your memory under your control.</p><p>当Anki认为是我该查看该卡片的时候了，它会告诉我“ Amygdala拉丁语是做什么用的？”我必须回答“杏仁”。如果您想知道为什么将它添加到我的收藏中，那是因为我正在阅读有关大脑的信息，并且我认为有趣的杏仁核被称为是因为它的形状像杏仁一样。我想记住这个有趣的事实，因此将其添加到我的Anki系列中。现在，我永远不会忘记它。那就是Anki的力量；它使您的记忆力得到控制。</p><p> Once you put your question and answer into Anki and click on the ‘Add’ button below, Anki will pick both the Front and Back fields and use them to create a card with the Front as the question and the Back as the answer. However, Anki will only create cards that way because it has been told to do so.</p><p>将问题和答案放入Anki，然后单击下面的“添加”按钮后，Anki将同时选择“正面”和“背面”字段，并使用它们来创建卡片，正面为问题，背面为答案。但是，Anki只会以这种方式创建卡，因为已被告知要这样做。</p><p> If you look back at the image above, there is a little option at the top titled  Type. A  Note Type dictates how many fields a note has and tells Anki how to use them to create cards. In our previous example, the  Basic type dictates that a note have two fields, Front and Back, but you can create your own note types to suit your personal needs.</p><p>如果回头看上图，顶部的类型为小选项。便笺类型决定了便笺有多少字段，并告诉Anki如何使用它们创建卡片。在我们之前的示例中，“基本”类型指示笔记具有两个字段，“正面”和“背面”，但是您可以创建自己的笔记类型来满足您的个人需求。</p><p> By default, Anki comes with two note types installed: The Basic, which we’ve already met, and the  Cloze.</p><p>默认情况下，Anki会安装两种音符类型：我们已经遇到过的Basic和Cloze。</p><p>  Cloze deletion, admittedly a rather strange name, is when a portion of a text is omitted, and you have to remember what fills in the blank. If instead of,  “This is a cloze deletion” I wrote,  “This is a ____ ______”, then it would be your job to fill in the blank with  ‘cloze deletion’.</p><p>完形填空删除是一个相当奇怪的名称，是当文本的一部分被省略时，您必须记住空白处的内容。如果我写的是“这是____ ______”，而不是“这是一个Cloze删除”，那么您需要用“ cloze delete”来填充空白。</p><p> To create a card using the Cloze note type, click where it says Basic; this will open up a window showing all available types for you to choose from. Select Cloze. Now you’re ready to create your first Cloze card.</p><p>要使用Cloze便签类型创建卡，请单击“ Basic”（基本）；这将打开一个窗口，显示所有可用的类型供您选择。选择“结束”。现在，您可以创建您的第一个Cloze卡了。</p><p>  Whereas before you had to add a question and an answer to create a card, for the Cloze type you merely have to tell Anki which portions of the text you want it to test you on. To do so, you need only select the portion of the text you want, go to the toolbar above, and select the fourth icon from the right, the one that looks like this […].</p><p>之前，您必须添加问题和答案来创建卡片，对于Cloze类型，您只需要告诉Anki您希望文本在哪一部分进行测试。为此，您只需要选择所需文本的一部分，转到上方的工具栏，然后从右侧选择第四个图标，该图标如下所示[…]。</p><p> In the image above, I selected two pieces of the text, “cloze note” and “two cards”. Anki, knowing that this card is of the Cloze type, will create two cards from this single note. The first card looks like this:</p><p>在上图中，我选择了两段文字，即“结束符”和“两张卡”。 Anki知道这张卡是Cloze类型的卡片，便会从此单音符中创建两张卡。第一张卡如下所示：</p><p>     This is a […] that will create two cards ⟶  This is a cloze note that will create two cards</p><p>这是一个将创建两张牌的[…]⟶这是一个将创建两张牌的完形纸</p><p>  This is a cloze note that will create […] ⟶  This is a cloze note that will create two cards</p><p>这是一个将创建[…]的完形填空音符。</p><p> The cloze type is very useful, as you can see. I recently used it to create four cards that test me on my knowledge of the brain’s anatomy. I wanted to learn the names of the four lobes of the brain, and to do so I created the following note:</p><p>如您所见，完形填空类型非常有用。我最近用它创建了四张卡片，这些卡片可以测试我对大脑解剖结构的了解。我想学习大脑四个叶的名称，并为此创建了以下注释：</p><p> The four lobes of the brain are: • {{c1::Frontal}} lobe • {{c2::Parietal}} lobe • {{c3::Occipital}} lobe • {{c4::Temporal}} lobe</p><p>大脑的四个瓣是：•{{c1 ::额叶}}瓣•{{c2 ::顶叶}}瓣•{{c3 ::枕骨}}瓣•{{c4 :: Temporal}}瓣</p><p> Anki created four cards from this single note, one for each lobe. When the time comes to review one of those cards, Anki will show me:</p><p>Anki从这个单一音符中创建了四张卡片，每个音符一张。当需要审查其中一张卡片时，Anki会告诉我：</p><p> The four lobes of the brain are: • Frontal lobe • Parietal lobe • Occipital lobe • [...] lobe</p><p>大脑的四个瓣是：•额叶•顶叶•枕叶•[...]</p><p>  It is unlikely you will ever have to create your own note types. The Basic and Cloze will cover most of your needs, and because perfection is the enemy of the good enough, trying to squeeze all efficiency out from Anki by creating your own hyper-specific types will only backfire when you find yourself not using Anki because it is too much work.</p><p>您不太可能需要创建自己的便笺类型。 Basic和Cloze将满足您的大部分需求，并且因为完美是足够好的敌人，因此尝试通过创建自己的超特定类型来挤压Anki的所有效率只会在您发现自己不使用Anki时适得其反，因为太多的工作。</p><p> Keep things simple and you won’t fall off. Remember, just using Anki is more than half the battle won.</p><p>保持简单，您就不会落伍。请记住，仅使用Anki就可以赢得一半以上的胜利。</p><p> Now that you’ve added your first cards, it is time to review them. To do so, click on your deck in the decks’ list and then click on the  Study Now button.</p><p>现在，您已经添加了第一张卡片，现在该对它们进行检查了。为此，请在卡座列表中单击您的卡座，然后单击立即学习按钮。</p><p> Because I created the cards I was showing you above, this is what appears to me when I do so:</p><p>因为我创建了上面显示给您的卡片，所以当我这样做时，这就是我所看到的：</p><p>  Now I need to try and remember what the answer to this is. Because this was just an example there’s no answer for me to remember, but if the question were to be,  “Which spaced repetition software should you use?”, my task would be to recall  “Anki”.</p><p>现在，我需要尝试并记住答案是什么。因为这只是一个示例，所以我想不起来要回答任何问题，但是如果问题是“您应该使用哪个间隔重复软件？”，我的任务就是回忆“ Anki”。</p><p> When you have the answer in mind, or if you are incapable of recalling it, you click on the Show Answer button.</p><p>当您牢记答案时，或者如果您无法回忆起答案，请单击“显示答案”按钮。</p><p>    In the image above, there are three options: Again, Good, and Easy. They are ordered by degree of difficulty in remembering the answer.</p><p>在上图中，有三个选项：再次，良好和简单。他们根据记住答案的难易程度排序。</p><p> If the memory has vanished entirely from your mind, then you select the Again button. That tells Anki that you need to spend more time with the material, and it will make sure to present it you sooner rather than later.</p><p>如果记忆完全消失了，请选择“再次”按钮。这告诉Anki，您需要花更多的时间来处理这些资料，这将确保您早点而不是稍后再展示。</p><p> On the other hand, if the answer came to you instantly, that means your memory of it is strong. By selecting the Easy button Anki will know that you likely do not need to review the material for a while.</p><p>另一方面，如果答案立即传给您，则意味着您对它的记忆力很强。通过选择“简单”按钮，Anki将知道您可能不需要一段时间来查看材料。</p><p> Here is one example of the options that appear in one of the cards in my personal Deck I have to review today.</p><p>这是出现在我今天必须复习的我个人卡片组之一中的选项示例。</p><p>  As you can see, I have four options to choose from rather than the three above because I have already encountered this card many times before, whereas the previous card was newly created.</p><p>如您所见，我有四个选项可供选择，而不是上面的三个，因为我之前已经多次遇到过此卡片，而前一个卡片是新创建的。</p><p> You may also notice that if I choose the Easy option, which I did because the answer to this particular card came to me instantly, Anki will only show it to me again approximately nine months from now.</p><p>您可能还会注意到，如果我选择“轻松”选项是因为该卡的答案立即出现在我眼前，那么安基只会在大约九个月后再次向我显示该选项。</p><p> That is the power of the spacing effect, combined with the magic of Anki, in action.</p><p>这就是间隔效果的力量，结合了Anki的魔力。</p><p> What were the chances that 9 months from now I would remember I needed to review this question and see how well I still remembered its answer?</p><p>从现在开始的9个月后，我还记得我需要复习此问题，看看我仍然记得它的答案的可能性是多少？</p><p>  But with Anki, I don’t need to. It takes care of all of that for me.</p><p>但是有了Anki，我就不需要了。它为我照顾了所有这些。</p><p> From calculating the optimal interval to showing it to us, Anki takes care of all the hard work of adopting spaced repetition into our lives. So long as we keep showing up to do our daily reviews,  Anki will make sure that we are in full control of our memory.</p><p>从计算最佳间隔到向我们展示最佳间隔，Anki负责将间隔重复应用于我们生活中的所有辛苦工作。只要我们不断出现以进行日常评论，Anki就会确保我们完全掌控自己的记忆。</p><p> This means our number one priority should be to make sure we keep showing up for the daily review.</p><p>这意味着我们的头等大事应该是确保我们不断出现在每日审查中。</p><p> This is no small task. I have known about Anki and spaced repetition for close to a decade now, but it would be a stretch to say that I have been using it for that long. There have been many periods over the years where I have completely fallen off using it. It’s not that I forgot about Anki and the many benefits of spaced repetition - that would be ironic - but rather it is rather easy to fall into a trap where doing your daily reviews becomes a chore where you know that opening the program will bring little pleasure, and a whole lot of hurt.</p><p>这是一项不小的任务。我已经知道Anki和间隔重复已经有将近十年了，但是要说我已经使用了很长时间了，这是很牵强的。多年来，有很多时期我完全不使用它。并不是让我忘记了Anki和间隔重复的许多好处-这会具有讽刺意味-而是很容易陷入陷阱，使您的日常评论变得很繁琐，而您知道打开该程序带来的乐趣很少以及很多伤害。</p><p>  A common failure mode when starting out is to start throwing things willy-nilly at it in the hopes that Anki will somehow get it all into your thick head. For example, many people start out by adding all the capitals of the world. That sounds like a fun thing to memorize, right?</p><p>刚开始时的常见故障模式是开始随意扔东西，以希望Anki能够以某种方式将其全部带入您的头脑。例如，许多人从增加世界所有首都开始。听起来这很有趣，对吗？</p><p> Yet eventually they find that they never really cared about it in the first place, but now each time they open Anki they’re being asked to come up with with the name of those capitals. Because they don’t care that much about it, they don’t answer them correctly. Maybe they keep confusing Minsk with Ljubljana, or for the life of them they can’t come with with the name of the capital of Perú. And since they keep getting those questions wrong, Anki keeps showing the same cards to them over and over again, cards they don’t care about about things that hardly matter to them. They enter into a vicious loop, a loop that quickly saps away all the fun there is in learning cool new stuff.</p><p>但是最终他们发现他们从来没有真正关心过它，但是现在每次他们打开Anki时，都被要求提供这些首都的名字。由于他们不太在意，因此无法正确回答。也许他们一直使明斯克与卢布尔雅那（Ljubljana）混为一谈，或者他们一生都无法用秘鲁首都的名字来命名。而且，由于他们总是错误地回答这些问题，因此Anki不断向他们展示相同的卡片，因此他们根本不在乎那些对他们无关紧要的卡片。他们进入了一个恶性循环，这种循环很快就消除了学习有趣的新事物带来的所有乐趣。</p><p> As I’ve said before and will continue to stress,  the most important thing is</p><p>正如我之前所说并将继续强调的，最重要的是</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://superpoweredself.com/gentle-introduction-how-to-use-anki-to-improve-your-memory">https://superpoweredself.com/gentle-introduction-how-to-use-anki-to-improve-your-memory</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/anki/">#anki</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/improve/">#improve</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
