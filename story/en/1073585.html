A similar case  out of Maine ended the same way in October.</p><p>去年12月，最高法院拒绝阻止纽约针对声称有宗教反对意见的医护人员的疫苗授权。缅因州的一个类似案例在10月份以同样的方式结束。</p><p> The court does not typically include explanations with rulings on emergency applications like the one from the New York City teachers, and Justice Sotomayor did not offer one on Friday.</p><p>法院通常不会对纽约市教师的紧急申请做出解释和裁决，索托马约尔法官周五也没有给出解释。</p><p>  Covid booster shots lose much of their potency after about four months, raising the possibility that some Americans — specifically those at high risk of complications or death — may need a fourth dose,  data published on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest.</p><p>美国疾病控制和预防中心周五公布的数据显示，新冠肺炎强化疫苗在大约四个月后会失去很多效力，这增加了一些美国人——特别是那些有并发症或死亡高风险的人——可能需要第四剂疫苗的可能性。</p><p> Preliminary research from Israel and Britain has hinted that protection from booster doses declines within a few months. The data released on Friday offer the first real-world evidence of the mRNA shots’ waning power against moderate to severe illness in the United States.</p><p>来自以色列和英国的初步研究表明，在几个月内，对增强剂量的防护能力会下降。周五公布的数据提供了第一个真实世界的证据，表明mRNA注射在美国对抗中重度疾病的能力正在减弱。</p><p> The analysis did not include a breakdown by age, and the researchers could not distinguish between a booster shot or a third dose given to an immunocompromised person as part of the primary series.</p><p>该分析未包括年龄细分，研究人员无法区分作为主要系列的一部分，给免疫功能低下的人注射增强剂还是第三剂。</p><p> The study focused on people who sought medical care for symptoms of Covid, so if that population was skewed toward older adults or those who have weak immune systems, the booster shots may have seemed less effective than they really are.</p><p>这项研究的重点是那些因新冠肺炎症状而寻求医疗护理的人，因此，如果该人群倾向于老年人或免疫系统较弱的人，那么加强注射的效果可能比实际效果要差。</p><p> Other studies have shown that while vaccines may lose some ability to prevent severe illness and hospitalization in adults older than 65, they remain highly protective in younger adults in good health. Federal health officials will need to know who exactly is at high risk even after three doses before considering recommending a fourth shot.</p><p>其他研究表明，尽管疫苗可能会失去一些预防65岁以上成年人严重疾病和住院的能力，但它们对健康状况良好的年轻人仍然具有高度的保护作用。联邦卫生官员在考虑推荐第四次注射之前，甚至在三次注射后，也需要知道到底谁处于高风险之中。</p><p> “There may be the need for yet again another boost — in this case, a fourth-dose boost for an individual receiving the mRNA — that could be based on age, as well as underlying conditions,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration’s top Covid adviser,  told reporters on Wednesday.</p><p>拜登政府的新冠肺炎高级顾问安东尼·S·福奇博士周三告诉记者：“可能需要再次增加剂量——在这种情况下，接受mRNA的个体需要第四次增加剂量——这可能是基于年龄和潜在条件。”。</p><p> The C.D.C. has previously published data showing that second and third doses of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were  less effective at fending off the Omicron variant than the Delta variant. Third doses enhanced that protection, at least in the short term.</p><p>CDC此前发布的数据显示，第二剂和第三剂Moderna和辉瑞BioNTech疫苗在抵御奥米克龙变异方面不如Delta变异有效。第三剂至少在短期内增强了这种保护。</p><p> In the new study, a team of researchers funded by the C.D.C. collected data from 10 states between Aug. 26, 2021, and Jan. 22, 2022. The data include periods during which the Delta and Omicron variants, respectively, accounted for more than 50 percent of cases in the country.</p><p>在新的研究中，一个由C.DC资助的研究团队从2021年8月26日到2022年1月22日收集了来自10个州的数据。这些数据包括Delta和Omicron变种分别占该国50%以上病例的时期。</p><p> The team analyzed 241,204 visits to emergency departments or urgent care facilities and 93,408 hospitalizations among adults older than 18. The researchers did not include milder coronavirus infections.</p><p>该团队分析了18岁以上成年人中241204例急诊或急救设施就诊和93408例住院情况。研究人员没有包括较温和的冠状病毒感染。</p><p> Protection against emergency department and urgent care visits declined from 69 percent within two months of the second dose to 37 percent after five months or more. Booster shots restored those levels to 87 percent.</p><p>对急诊室和紧急护理就诊的防护从第二次注射后两个月内的69%下降到五个月或更长时间后的37%。加强注射使这些水平恢复到87%。</p><p> The effectiveness of boosters also waned. Protection against emergency department and urgent care visits dropped to 66 percent within four or five months, and to just 31 percent after five or more months of receiving the third shot, the researchers found. The latter estimate may not be reliable because few people received boosters more than five months ago, and so the data is limited, the researchers said.</p><p>助推器的效力也在减弱。研究人员发现，在接受第三次注射后的四到五个月内，对急诊室和紧急护理就诊的保护率下降到66%，在接受第三次注射后的五个月或更长时间内下降到31%。研究人员说，后一种估计可能不可靠，因为很少有人在五个月前接受过助推器，因此数据有限。</p><p> But the protection provided by both second and third shots against hospitalization was generally higher than for emergency department and urgent care visits.</p><p>但第二次和第三次注射对住院患者的保护作用通常高于急诊室和紧急护理就诊。</p><p>  WASHINGTON — In a striking reversal, federal regulators said on Friday that they would wait for data on whether three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine are effective in children younger than 5 before deciding whether to authorize a vaccine for the age group.</p><p>华盛顿——周五，联邦监管机构宣布，他们将等待三剂辉瑞生物技术公司的冠状病毒疫苗对5岁以下儿童是否有效的数据，然后再决定是否批准该年龄组的疫苗。</p><p> The Food and Drug Administration will postpone a meeting of outside experts that was scheduled for Tuesday; the experts were to weigh the evidence and make a recommendation on whether to authorize two doses of the vaccine in young children, as Pfizer had requested.</p><p>美国食品药品监督管理局将推迟原定于周二召开的外部专家会议；专家们将权衡证据，并根据辉瑞公司的要求，就是否批准儿童接种两剂疫苗提出建议。</p><p> In a news release, Pfizer-BioNTech said that their three-dose trial for young children was moving briskly, and that the new timetable would allow the F.D.A. to get more data and thoroughly review it. Results are expected in early April.</p><p>辉瑞生物技术公司在一份新闻稿中表示，他们针对幼儿的三剂试验进展迅速，新的时间表将允许FDA获得更多数据并进行彻底审查。结果预计将在4月初公布。</p><p> At a news conference, Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the vaccine division of the F.D.A., said that parents would have to wait another two months for a decision while regulators gather and analyze more data. “Yes, some of this was late breaking, but that’s what our job is — to adjust to it,” he said.</p><p>FDA疫苗部门负责人彼得·马克斯博士在一次新闻发布会上说，在监管机构收集和分析更多数据的同时，家长们还需要再等两个月才能做出决定。他说：“是的，有些工作是很晚才开始的，但这就是我们的工作——适应它。”。</p><p> Regulators and vaccine manufacturers have been wrestling with how quickly to move to vaccinate roughly 18 million children under 5, the only Americans still ineligible for shots. The highly transmissible Omicron variant is receding in much of the nation, but federal officials have said that nearly 400 children under 5 have died of Covid-19.</p><p>监管机构和疫苗制造商一直在努力，以多快的速度为大约1800万名5岁以下儿童接种疫苗，这是唯一仍然没有资格接种疫苗的美国人。2019冠状病毒疾病在美国大部分地区都在衰退，但联邦政府官员说，将近400名5岁以下儿童死于COVID-19。</p><p> In Pfizer’s clinical trial, which tested one-tenth of the adult dosage in the youngest group, its vaccine failed to produce the desired immune response in children ages 2 to 4, producing only 60 percent of the level of antibodies identified for success, according to multiple officials. Children ages six months to two years produced the sought-after level of antibodies. There were no serious safety concerns, officials have said.</p><p>根据多名官员的说法，辉瑞公司的临床试验在最年轻的一组中测试了成人剂量的十分之一，其疫苗未能在2至4岁的儿童中产生所需的免疫反应，仅产生确定成功的抗体水平的60%。六个月到两岁的儿童产生了人们所追求的抗体水平。官员们表示，没有严重的安全问题。</p><p> Some infectious disease experts have argued that the evidence showing a benefit from two shots is not convincing enough, given that Omicron cases are falling and young children are unlikely to become severely ill from the virus.</p><p>一些传染病专家认为，鉴于奥米克龙病例正在减少，幼儿不太可能因该病毒而严重患病，证明两次注射有益的证据还不够令人信服。</p><p> Walmart said on Friday that fully vaccinated employees would no longer have to wear masks unless state or local rules required it. The change is effective immediately, the giant retailer said in a memo to its staff.</p><p>沃尔玛周五表示，除非州或地方法规要求，已接种疫苗的员工将不再需要戴口罩。这家大型零售商在给员工的备忘录中表示，这一改变立即生效。</p><p> Unvaccinated employees must continue to wear masks in its stores and offices until further notice, the memo said.</p><p>备忘录称，未接种疫苗的员工必须继续在商店和办公室佩戴口罩，直到另行通知。</p><p> Walmart said it had made the decision after closely monitoring Covid trends across the country. It came at the end of a week in which Democratic governors from Connecticut to California began to lift statewide masking policies as coronavirus cases fueled by the Omicron variant were dropping precipitously, and it is in line with similar announcements from other companies. Amazon said on Thursday that vaccinated employees in warehouses in states that had dropped mask mandates could opt out of wearing masks as well.</p><p>沃尔玛表示，它是在密切关注全国新冠疫情趋势后做出这一决定的。一周结束时，从康涅狄格州到加利福尼亚州的民主党州长开始取消全州的掩盖政策，因为由Omicron变种引发的冠状病毒病例急剧下降，这与其他公司的类似声明一致。亚马逊周四表示，在已取消口罩授权的州，仓库中接种疫苗的员工也可以选择不戴口罩。</p><p> Walmart, which has about 1.6 million employees in the United States alone, was among the first private employers at the start of the pandemic to mandate that its workers wear masks. The company eased the mask requirement for vaccinated workers and shoppers for several months in the spring before reimposing it yet again for some workers when the Delta variant posed a significant threat. Then, in December as new cases driven by Omicron began to surge, the company again required masks for all workers.</p><p>沃尔玛仅在美国就拥有约160万名员工，是疫情开始时第一批要求员工佩戴口罩的私营雇主之一。今年春天，该公司放宽了对接种疫苗的工人和购物者的口罩要求几个月，然后在Delta变种构成重大威胁时，再次对一些工人使用口罩。然后，在12月，随着Omicron引发的新病例开始激增，该公司再次要求所有员工佩戴口罩。</p><p> The company also said that a pandemic sick-pay plan that had been in place for the past two years to cover Covid-related illnesses would end on March 31, unless it was required by state or local governments. The memo also said that daily health screenings before each shift would no longer be necessary for workers, except those in California, New York and Virginia.</p><p>该公司还表示，过去两年为覆盖新冠病毒相关疾病而实施的大流行病假工资计划将于3月31日结束，除非州或地方政府要求。备忘录还说，除了加利福尼亚州、纽约州和弗吉尼亚州的工人外，工人们不再需要在每次轮班前进行每日健康筛查。</p><p>  With Covid treatments still in short supply in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration on Friday  gave emergency authorization to a new monoclonal antibody drug that has been found in the laboratory to be potent against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.</p><p>由于新冠病毒治疗在美国仍然供不应求，美国食品和药物管理局（Food and Drug Administration）周五紧急批准了一种新的单克隆抗体药物，该药物在实验室中被发现对新冠病毒的奥米克罗变种具有强效。</p><p> The Biden administration said it would make the therapy immediately available to states free of charge.</p><p>拜登政府表示，将立即向各州免费提供这种疗法。</p><p> The authorization of the treatment, bebtelovimab, means that the United States now has four drugs available for high-risk Covid patients early in the course of their illness that have been found to neutralize the Omicron variant. While there is a greater menu of Covid pills and treatments now than at any other point in the pandemic, the drugs  have been so scarce that doctors have been forced to make painful rationing decisions during the Omicron surge.</p><p>bebtelovimab治疗的授权意味着美国目前有四种药物可用于高危新冠病毒患者病程早期的治疗，这些药物已被发现能中和奥米克罗变体。虽然现在新冠病毒药物和治疗的种类比大流行中的任何其他时候都多，但这些药物非常稀缺，以至于医生不得不在奥米克罗激增期间做出痛苦的配给决定。</p><p> The drug that the F.D.A. authorized on Friday is manufactured by Eli Lilly, which  said on Thursday that it had signed a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services to provide the government with up to 600,000 courses of the treatment for at least $720 million. The company said it had already manufactured hundreds of thousands of doses and was ready to begin shipments within 24 hours.</p><p>FDA周五批准的药物由礼来公司生产，礼来公司周四表示，已与卫生与公共服务部签署合同，为政府提供多达60万个疗程的治疗，费用至少为7.2亿美元。该公司表示，已经生产了数十万剂，并准备在24小时内开始发货。</p><p> The Lilly drug has not been tested in a study that can show whether it can stave off severe disease. The F.D.A. said it should not be a preferred product and instead should be used only when alternative treatments are not “accessible or clinically appropriate.” Federal health officials have given a similar designation to a Covid pill from Merck and the Covid vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>礼来的药物尚未在一项研究中进行测试，该研究可以证明它是否可以避免严重疾病。FDA表示，它不应成为首选产品，而应仅在替代疗法“无法获得或临床上不合适”的情况下使用联邦卫生官员对默克公司生产的新冠病毒药丸和强生公司生产的新冠病毒疫苗给出了类似的名称；约翰逊。</p><p> However, there are data suggesting Eli Lilly’s drug is safe and may reduce the amount of virus that builds up in people who are sick with Covid.</p><p>然而，有数据表明礼来的药物是安全的，可能会减少新冠病毒感染者体内积聚的病毒数量。</p><p> Like other drugs for recently diagnosed Covid patients, Lilly’s new treatment is authorized for people who are vulnerable to becoming seriously ill because they are older or have a medical condition like obesity or diabetes. People as young as 12 can be eligible.</p><p>与其他针对新近确诊的新冠病毒患者的药物一样，礼来的新疗法也被授权用于因年龄较大或患有肥胖症或糖尿病等疾病而容易患重病的患者。只有12岁的人才有资格。</p><p> The drug is meant to be given as a quick intravenous injection by a health care provider, typically at a clinic or hospital. It must be administered within seven days of symptoms starting.</p><p>这种药物通常在诊所或医院由医疗保健提供者快速静脉注射。必须在症状开始后七天内服用。</p><p> Poly Prep Country Day School, an elite, expensive Brooklyn institution, will continue to require students and staff to wear masks in school, reversing a decision to make masks optional starting Monday.</p><p>布鲁克林一所名贵的精英学校Poly Prep Country Day School将继续要求学生和教职员工在学校佩戴口罩，从而扭转了从周一开始让口罩可选的决定。</p><p> A statewide mask mandate for schools remains in place until at least Feb. 21. Officials at Poly Prep, which had been the first New York City school to make masks optional despite the mandate, said in an email to parents on Friday afternoon that they had received guidance from the state and city health departments that the policy shift was “not permissible under current state- and city-wide restrictions.”</p><p>全州范围内的学校口罩授权至少持续到2月21日。Poly Prep是纽约市第一所尽管有此规定但仍将口罩作为可选口罩的学校，该校官员周五下午在给家长的电子邮件中表示，他们收到了州和市卫生部门的指导，即“在当前州和市范围内的限制下，政策转变是不允许的”</p><p> The school said it would delay the policy shift and asked parents to make sure their children were masked starting on Monday.</p><p>学校表示将推迟政策转变，并要求家长从周一开始确保他们的孩子戴上口罩。</p><p> “Please continue to send students to school with masks on Monday, as has been the policy throughout this year,” Sarah Zuercher, the school’s director of health and well-being, said in the email.</p><p>“请继续在周一让学生戴口罩上学，这是今年全年的政策，”学校健康和福利主任莎拉·祖尔彻在电子邮件中说。</p><p> Earlier this week, school officials had said that because coronavirus cases citywide and at the school were declining, they would not require students or staff members to wear face coverings starting Monday. The change in policy was going to apply to both the Lower School campus, in Park Slope, and the Middle and Upper School campus, in Dyker Heights.</p><p>本周早些时候，学校官员曾表示，由于全市和学校的冠状病毒病例正在减少，他们将从周一开始不再要求学生或教职员工戴口罩。政策的变化将同时适用于公园坡的低年级校园和戴克高地的高中校园。</p><p> Before the rollback, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Health had described the school’s policy change as a “violation.”</p><p>在退学之前，纽约州卫生部的一名女发言人曾将学校的政策变化描述为“违反”</p><p> “We worked with the school and the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and the school agreed to delay its plan to no longer require masks until such a policy is permitted,” the spokeswoman, Jill Montag, said on Friday. “We are glad they decided to do the right thing.”</p><p>发言人吉尔·蒙塔格周五说：“我们与学校和纽约市卫生和精神卫生部合作，学校同意推迟不再需要口罩的计划，直到这项政策得到允许。”。“我们很高兴他们决定做正确的事情。”</p><p> Gov. Kathy Hochul announced this week that she would let a rule expire that required businesses to ask people to either show proof of full vaccination or wear masks indoors at all times. That mandate was separate from the rule requiring masks to be worn in schools.</p><p>州长凯西·霍丘（Kathy Hochul）本周宣布，她将让一项规定到期，该规定要求企业要求人们要么出示完全接种疫苗的证明，要么在室内始终戴口罩。这项规定与要求学校佩戴口罩的规定是分开的。</p><p> Ms. Hochul has said  state officials would reassess the school mask mandate in early March, once students returned from midwinter break. The governors of two neighboring states, New Jersey and Connecticut, have said that their mask mandates for schools would end in the coming weeks.</p><p>霍丘尔说，一旦学生们从仲冬假期回来，州官员将在3月初重新评估学校口罩的规定。新泽西州和康涅狄格州两个相邻州的州长表示，他们对学校的口罩授权将在未来几周内结束。</p><p> The Polygon, Poly Prep’s student newspaper,  which broke the news about the changing policy on Wednesday, noted that all students ages 5 and older are vaccinated, while students ages 16 and up are vaccinated and boosted.</p><p>Poly Prep的学生报纸Polygon周三公布了政策变化的消息，该报指出，所有5岁及以上的学生都接种了疫苗，而16岁及以上的学生则接种了疫苗并得到了提振。</p><p> Poly Prep has 1,151 students, according to its website. Yearly tuition ranges from about $32,000 for nursery-school students to about $58,000 for 12th graders.</p><p>根据Poly Prep的网站，该校共有1151名学生。每年的学费从幼儿园学生的32000美元到12年级学生的58000美元不等。</p><p> In the email on Wednesday announcing that masks would be made optional, Ms. Zuercher had said that the school would continue to require weekly testing.</p><p>在周三宣布口罩将可选的电子邮件中，祖尔彻说学校将继续要求每周进行测试。</p><p> She also said that more than 20 percent of the Poly Prep community had tested positive for the virus since mid-December. “Almost all cases have been mild to asymptomatic with no cases of severe disease or hospitalization,” she said.</p><p>她还说，自12月中旬以来，Poly Prep社区有超过20%的人检测出病毒呈阳性。“几乎所有病例都是轻度到无症状的，没有严重疾病或住院，”她说。</p><p> Correction:   An earlier version of this article misattributed a statement from the Health Department. It came from a spokeswoman, not a spokesman.</p><p>更正：这篇文章的早期版本将卫生部的一份声明误判了。它来自一位发言人，而不是一位发言人。</p><p>  Two new reports lay out the added difficulties that unvaccinated women with Covid have during pregnancy and childbirth, adding to research showing that they face elevated risks.</p><p>两份新报告列出了未接种新冠病毒的妇女在怀孕和分娩期间面临的额外困难，这进一步说明了她们面临更高风险的研究。</p><p> One study, published Thursday in the  Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine, suggests that the coronavirus can invade and destroy the placenta, through which the mother passes nutrients to the fetus.</p><p>一项研究发表在周四的《病理学与病理学档案》上；实验室医学表明，冠状病毒可以侵入并破坏胎盘，母亲通过胎盘将营养物质传递给胎儿。</p><p> The other, published this week in the  Journal of the American Medical Association, found that pregnant women infected with the coronavirus are about 40 percent more likely to develop serious complications or die during pregnancy than those who aren’t infected.</p><p>另一项研究发表在本周的《美国医学会杂志》上，发现感染冠状病毒的孕妇在怀孕期间发生严重并发症或死亡的可能性比未感染冠状病毒的孕妇高约40%。</p><p> The study of the effects of the virus on the placenta found that infection may deprive the fetus of oxygen in unvaccinated pregnant women, leading to a higher risk of delivering stillborn babies. While other infections can cause stillbirth by passing through the placenta and damaging the fetus, Covid-19 takes a different, dangerous tack.</p><p>对该病毒对胎盘影响的研究发现，未接种疫苗的孕妇感染该病毒可能会使胎儿缺氧，导致分娩死胎的风险更高。2019冠状病毒疾病可能是由于胎盘感染而导致死胎，而COVID-19则是另一种危险的粘性。</p><p> “It causes extensive damage to the placenta, and stillbirth occurs from lack of oxygen,” said Dr. David Schwartz, a perinatal pathologist in Atlanta and the lead author of the study. “The placental destruction is so severe that whether or not the fetus becomes infected might be irrelevant.”</p><p>亚特兰大围产期病理学家、该研究的主要作者戴维·施瓦茨博士说：“它会对胎盘造成广泛损害，缺氧会导致死产。”。“胎盘破坏非常严重，胎儿是否感染可能无关紧要。”</p><p> Dr. Schwartz’s research team analyzed 64 stillbirth cases and four neonatal deaths in 12 countries. All the pregnant mothers were unvaccinated, and all were thought to have been infected with the Delta variant. In the 68 cases, an average of 77 percent of the placenta had been destroyed.</p><p>施瓦茨博士的研究团队分析了12个国家的64例死产病例和4例新生儿死亡。所有怀孕的母亲都没有接种疫苗，而且都被认为感染了德尔塔变种。在68例患者中，平均77%的胎盘被破坏。</p><p> Although stillbirths attributed to Covid-19 are uncommon — overall, about 24,000 babies are  stillborn in the United States each year — a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  study released in November found that pregnant women who had Covid-19 when they delivered their babies were almost twice as likely  to have a stillbirth as healthy women who did not have Covid.</p><p>虽然2019冠状病毒疾病死胎很少见，但总体上来说，美国每年约有2019冠状病毒疾病，其中一个是在美国每年都有24000个婴儿死胎。十一月，一个疾病控制和预防中心的研究发现，怀孕时携带COVID-19的孕妇是死胎的两倍，而没有生育的健康妇女则是死胎的两倍。</p><p> The new study about complications for mothers found that the severity of their Covid symptoms was the key factor in their heightened risk. The most severely ill women were three times more likely to develop pregnancy complications than those who tested negative or had milder symptoms.</p><p>这项关于母亲并发症的新研究发现，新冠肺炎症状的严重程度是她们风险增加的关键因素。病情最严重的女性发生妊娠并发症的可能性是那些检测呈阴性或症状较轻的女性的三倍。</p><p> The researchers analyzed electronic medical records of about 14,000 pregnant women between March 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, before vaccines were widely available. Of those, about 2,350 tested positive during pregnancy or within six weeks of delivery.</p><p>在疫苗普及之前，研究人员分析了2020年3月1日至12月31日期间约14000名孕妇的电子病历。其中约有2350人在怀孕期间或分娩后6周内检测呈阳性。</p><p> The study also pointed to increased danger for newborns: Covid-19 was significantly associated with premature birth and admission to newborn intensive care units.</p><p>该研究还指出2019冠状病毒疾病与新生儿早产和新生儿重症监护病房的发病率有显著的相关性。</p><p> “We know from other studies that vaccination prevents the most severe symptoms of the disease,” said Dr. Torri D. Metz, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Utah Health, who led the study. “So, this is just another piece of the puzzle that should encourage pregnant people to get vaccinated.”</p><p>“我们从其他的研究中知道，接种疫苗可以预防这种疾病的最严重症状，”犹他大学健康研究所的妇产科副教授Torri D. Metz博士说。“所以，这只是应该鼓励孕妇接种疫苗的另一个谜题。”</p><p> The new studies add to research  showing the danger of Covid-19 to  pregnant women and their babies. The C.D.C. has  strongly encouraged vaccination for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant. But vaccination rates are low among pregnant women, even though early research has found no evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna  vaccines pose serious risks during  pregnancy.</p><p>新的研究增加2019冠状病毒疾病对孕妇和婴儿的危害。疾控中心强烈鼓励怀孕、哺乳或计划怀孕的妇女接种疫苗。但孕妇的疫苗接种率很低，尽管早期的研究没有发现任何证据表明辉瑞BioNTech或Moderna疫苗在怀孕期间会造成严重风险。</p><p> As the Omicron wave subsides in regions across the world, more governments, politicians and health officials are telling us that it’s time to start “living with the virus.”</p><p>随着Omicron浪潮在世界各地消退，越来越多的政府、政界人士和卫生官员告诉我们，是时候开始“与病毒共存”了</p><p>  For guidance, The Times asked more than a dozen epidemiologists about the next phase of the pandemic and how they’re approaching it.</p><p>《纽约时报》向十几名流行病学家询问了大流行的下一个阶段以及他们是如何接近大流行的，以寻求指导。</p><p> Living with the virus “is an acknowledgment that eradication of SARS-CoV-2, like what we did with smallpox, is not feasible,” said Maria Sundaram, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute.</p><p>马什菲尔德诊所研究所的传染病流行病学家玛丽亚·桑德拉姆说，与病毒共存“是对SARS-CoV-2根除的一种承认，就像我们对天花所做的那样，是不可行的。”。</p><p> Instead, we’ll need to rely on an arsenal of tools — including vaccines, paid sick leave and masks — to coexist with the virus while reducing our own risk and protecting others.</p><p>相反，我们需要依靠一系列工具——包括疫苗、带薪病假和口罩——与病毒共存，同时降低我们自身的风险，保护他人。</p><p> Eventually, the thinking goes, we’ll get to a point where the coronavirus is incorporated into other common viruses we are used to dealing with all the time, said Pia MacDonald, an infectious disease epidemiologist at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute. “We should each reflect on how we live with other viruses that routinely circulate, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, noroviruses and others.”</p><p>非营利研究机构RTI International的传染病流行病学家皮亚·麦克唐纳（Pia MacDonald）说，最终，我们的想法是，冠状病毒将被纳入我们一直在处理的其他常见病毒中。“我们每个人都应该反思我们如何与其他经常传播的病毒共存，如流感、呼吸道合胞病毒、诺如病毒等。”</p><p> That’s going to require a huge mental shift and acceptance of “a new element of manageable risk in our lives,” said Eduardo Franco, the director of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology at McGill University. “It means reacquiring behaviors, attitudes and social norms,” that have always been </p><p>麦吉尔大学癌症流行病学系主任爱德华多·弗兰科说，这将需要一个巨大的思想转变，并接受“我们生活中一个可控风险的新因素”。“这意味着重新获得行为、态度和社会规范，”这一直是人们关注的问题</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div
