The company appears to be planning to keep up a quick clip when it comes to the pace of Falcon 9 flights in 2022, as it\u2019s readying for a rideshare mission as early as January 13, and another three missions planned before even the end of the month.\n  Meanwhile, it\u2019s also making progress on its preparations for the first orbital test launch of its Starship vehicle, with a test of its  launch tower this week that showed how the tower\u2019s robotic arms would operate in hefting Starship atop the Super Heavy booster that will provide it with the power to get to space. Depending on approvals, SpaceX could be ready to actually make use of that tower for an orbital test sometime around March.\n   NASA\u2019s James Webb space telescope, which should provide more detailed and distant imaging of galaxies beyond our own than ever before, has competed its final set of deployments, meaning all the parts that were supposed to unfurl and set themselves up post-launch have successfully done so.\n That\u2019s got to have the NASA scientists who\u2019ve been working on Webb breathing a sigh of relief. The telescope now just has to complete some mid-flight thruster burns in order to place it in the planned and correct orbit, and then it\u2019ll be ready to snap some photos and send them back for study.\n    Starlink ran into regulatory problems in India after it set up its own subsidiary to operate in the country. The company had to  refund preorders after the government ordered them to stop providing satellite connectivity in the country without a valid license to do so. Elon Musk has previously been relatively brazen about his view that Starlink doesn\u2019t necessarily need a license to operate in some global markets.\n Shortly after news of the refunds came out,  Starlink India\u2019s lead Sanjay Bhargava announced he\u2019d be stepping down.\n  President Biden nominated  Vice Admiral Frank Whitworth as the next director of the  National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 07:11:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u706b\u7bad,spacex,starship", "title": "MAX\u95ee\uff1aSpacex\u5728\u706b\u7bad\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u8e22\u51fa2022", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMax Q: SpaceX kicks off 2022 in rocket launches\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/max-q-spacex-kicks-off-2022-in-rocket-launches/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u706b\u7bad", "spacex", "starship"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e7c0882d80c700b2c3dbc11bce493397.jpg", "infoid": 1072685, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaMoxie Marlinspike\u62c5\u4efb\u516c\u53f8\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u4ed6\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\u5728\u535a\u5ba2\u5c97\u4f4d\u4e0a\u3002\u6267\u884c\u8463\u4e8b\u957fBrian Acton\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u3002\n\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u91cc\uff0c\u66fe\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u89c1\u9762\uff0c\u201cMarlinspike\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u641c\u7d22\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u3002\n\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e8e2021\u5e74\u521d\u6025\u4e8e\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u7387\uff0c\u4ee5\u56de\u5e94\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u65b0\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56 - \u4f46\u6210\u529f\u5e76\u975e\u6ca1\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u5373\u516c\u53f8\u62d2\u7edd\u7ef4\u62a4\u5185\u5bb9\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u4fe1\u53f7\u6700\u8fd1\u901a\u8fc7MobileCoin\u7eb3\u5165\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ed8\u6b3e\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u53ea\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "note_en": "Signal founder Moxie Marlinspike is stepping down as CEO of the company, he announced  in a blog post on Monday.

You\u2019d assume there wasn\u2019t much to the story. Maybe a terminal manufacturer put a toggle flip flop on the cursor output and it caught on. But the true story is much deeper than that.\n We were surprised that the father of the blinking cursor was one guy, [Charles Kiesling]. In a 1967 patent, he described the blinking cursor. An ex-Navy man, [Kiesling\u2019s]  patent names his employer at the time, Sperry Rand, where he\u2019d worked since 1955.\n  According to the post, little is known of [Kiesling], one of the many unsung engineers who create everyday life. The article purports that the Apple II was the first place the general public would encounter the invention. We guess it depends on how you define the general public. The VT50 had a blinking cursor, we seem to remember, and we didn\u2019t think it was the first, anyway. The VT05 in the video below seems to have a blinking cursor, too.

Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center say the transplant showed that a heart from a genetically modified animal can function in the human body without immediate rejection.\n The patient, David Bennett, 57, knew there was no guarantee the experiment would work but he was dying, ineligible for a human heart transplant and had no other option, his son told The Associated Press.\n \u201cIt was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark, but it\u2019s my last choice,\u201d Bennett said a day before the surgery, according to a statement provided by the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n  There\u2019s a huge shortage of human organs donated for transplant, driving scientists to try to figure out how to use animal organs instead. Last year, there were just over 3,800 heart transplants in the U.S., a record number, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which oversees the nation\u2019s transplant system.\n  \u201cIf this works, there will be an endless supply of these organs for patients who are suffering,\u201d said Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the university\u2019s animal-to-human transplant program.\n But prior attempts at such transplants -- or xenotransplantation -- have failed, largely because patients\u2019 bodies rapidly rejected the animal organ. Notably, in 1984, Baby Fae, a dying infant, lived 21 days with a baboon heart.\n The difference this time: The Maryland surgeons used a heart from a pig that had undergone gene-editing to remove a sugar in its cells that\u2019s responsible for that hyper-fast organ rejection.\n \u201cI think you can characterize it as a watershed event,\u201d Dr. David Klassen, UNOS\u2019 chief medical officer, said of the Maryland transplant.\n Still, Klassen cautioned that it\u2019s only a first tentative step into exploring whether this time around, xenotransplantation might finally work.\n The Food and Drug Administration, which oversees xenotransplantation experiments, allowed the surgery under what\u2019s called a \u201ccompassionate use\u201d emergency authorization, available when a patient with a life-threatening condition has no other options.\n Just last September, researchers in New York performed an experiment suggesting these kinds of pigs might offer promise for animal-to-human transplants. Doctors temporarily attached a pig\u2019s kidney to a deceased human body and watched it begin to work.\n The Maryland transplant takes their experiment to the next level, said Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led that experiment at NYU Langone Health.\n  \u201cThis is a truly remarkable breakthrough,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAs a heart transplant recipient, myself with a genetic heart disorder, I am thrilled by this news and the hope it gives to my family and other patients who will eventually be saved by this breakthrough.\u201d\n It will be crucial to share the data gathered from this transplant before opening the option to more patients, said Karen Maschke, a research scholar at the Hastings Center, who is helping develop ethics and policy recommendations for the first clinical trials under a grant from the National Institutes of Health.\n \u201cRushing into animal-to-human transplants without this information would not be advisable,\u201d Maschke said.\n  \u201cHe realizes the magnitude of what was done and he really realizes the importance of it,\u201d David Bennett Jr. said of his father. \u201cHe could not live, or he could last a day, or he could last a couple of days.

Today, we use \u201cLuddite\u201d as a pejorative referring to backwards, anti-technology reactionaries.\n  In truth, the Luddites\u2019 cause wasn\u2019t the destruction of technology \u2013 no more than the Boston Tea Party\u2019s cause was the elimination of tea, or Al Qaeda\u2019s cause was the end of civilian aviation. Smashing looms and stocking frames was the Luddites\u2019  tactic, not their  goal.\n In truth, their goal was something closely related to science fiction: to challenge not the technology itself, but rather the social relations that governed its use.\n The critique of Luddism as anti-technology is as shallow a reading of the Luddites as the critique of science fiction as nothing more than speculation about the design of gadgets of varying degrees of plausibility.\n In truth, Luddism and science fiction concern themselves with the same questions: not merely  what the technology does, but who it does it  for and who it does it  to.\n The Luddites were textile workers \u2013 skilled tradespeople who enjoyed comfortable lifestyles because they commanded a hefty portion of the money generated by the product of their labor. What\u2019s more, it took a  lot of labor to weave fabric, and as a result, cloth was incredibly expensive, as were clothes, naturally.\n The advent of textile automation upended everything. It didn\u2019t just reduce the amount of labor that went into a yard of cloth \u2013 it also created unprecedented demand for wool (leading to the mass eviction of the tenant farmers to make way for sheep) and cotton (supercharging global slavery).\n Textile automation also produced a lot of textiles (obviously). These were cheaper and often finer than the textiles they replaced, and transformed ready access to clothing of all sorts from a luxury for elites into something working people came to expect.\n You really couldn\u2019t ask for a more science-fictional setup: someone invents a couple of gadgets and everything changes. A whole industry of skilled workers is threatened. Ancient settlements are razed and replaced by sheep, their residents turned into internal refugees, wandering the land. Slavers sail around the world, murdering and enslaving distant strangers to feed the machine. The entire material culture of a nation is transformed. Guerilla warfare breaks out. Machines are smashed. Factories are put to the torch. Guerrillas are captured and publicly executed. Blood runs through the streets.\n The Luddites weren\u2019t exercised about automation. They didn\u2019t mind the proliferation of cheap textiles. History is mostly silent on whether they gave thought to the plight of tenant farmers at home or enslaved people abroad.\n What  were they fighting about? The social relations governing the use of the new machines. These new machines  could have allowed the existing workforce to produce far more cloth, in far fewer hours, at a much lower price, while still paying these workers well (the lower per-unit cost of finished cloth would be offset by the higher sales volume, and that volume could be produced in fewer hours).\n Instead, the owners of the factories \u2013 whose fortunes had been built on the labor of textile workers \u2013 chose to employ fewer workers, working the same long hours as before, at a lower rate than before, and pocketed the substantial savings.\n There is nothing natural about this arrangement. A Martian watching the Industrial Revolution unfold through the eyepiece of a powerful telescope could not tell you why the dividends from these machines should favor factory owners, rather than factory workers.\n The Luddites did what every science fiction writer does: they took a technology and imagined all the different ways it could be used \u2013 who it could be used  for and whom it could be used  against. They demanded the creation of a parallel universe in which the left fork was taken, rather than the right.\n That is many things, but it is  not technophobic. Using \u201cLuddite\u201d as a synonym for technophobe is an historically insupportable libel.\n We\u2019re living in quite a Luddite moment, as it hap\u00adpens. Many of us are contesting the social relations surrounding our technologies: should we continue to subsidize big agriculture? Should our cities continue to be organized around cars? Should tech giants be permitted to continue to gobble up each other and their small competitors, reducing the internet to \u201cfive giant websites, each filled with screenshots of the other four?\u201d (to quote Tom Eastman).\n Some of that contestation is taking place in the streets, some at the ballot-box, some in boardrooms; some is happening at high-level meetings like COP26 in Glasgow. To mangle William Gibson\u2019s rallying cry, the street is desperately asserting its right to find its own use for things.\n Luddism is the key to resolving the tension in some of our most important labor and technology debates. For example, labor economists have long decried automation as \u201cde-skilling\u201d \u2013 a way to decompose skilled labor into a series of easy tasks, which weakens the bargaining position of workers by allowing employers to replace them more easily.\n But automation isn\u2019t solely disempowering: it also lifts people up. Today, thanks to automated machining tools like CNC mills, someone with very little training can do a lot of fine machining for themselves, without having to bother a skilled machinist. Democratizing access to the means of production isn\u2019t intrinsically anti-labor \u2013 it\u2019s only bad for workers when the bounty of automation is disproportionally al\u00adlocated to a small number of capital owners, and not workers.\n The history of science fiction is rife with stories of people who seize the means of production. The classical \u201cproblem story\u201d \u2013 in which an engineer has to figure out how to repurpose some machine or system to make it work in ways its creator never intended \u2013 is, at root, a story about technological self-determination. It\u2019s a story that says that the person who uses the machine matters more than the person who designed it or bought it.\n You don\u2019t have to go turn to cyberpunk to find this ethic: when a Hein\u00adlein character like Kip Russell uses duct-tape and ingenuity to save his friend\u2019s life on the lunar surface in  Have Spacesuit, Will Travel, he\u2019s unilaterally remapping the social relations of the technology he depends on, as a matter of life and death. Kip Russell is a Luddite, convinced that his own welfare is more important than the intentions and choices of the company that made his spacesuit.\n The difference between de-skilling and democratizing isn\u2019t what the gadget does \u2013 it\u2019s who it does it  for and who it does it  to. Imagining new ways of arranging those factors is profoundly science fictional.\n The Luddites weren\u2019t merely science fictional, either. They took their name from King Ludd, or Captain (or General!) Ludd, a mythological titan who supposedly led their shadow army. The Luddites spun tall tales about this leader and signed his name to letters to the newspapers and to factory owners. King Ludd was a creature out of fantasy \u2013 an imaginary giant who was often depicted as towering over the factories that were the object of the Luddites\u2019 rage.\n A secret society bent on remaking the social relations for technology, who claimed to be led by a mythological giant? That\u2019s fannish as hell, a Golden Age fantasy/SF crossover worthy of an Ace Double.\n  Cory Doctorow is the author of  Walkaway,  Little Brother, and  Information Doesn\u2019t Want to Be Free (among many others); he is the co-owner of Boing Boing, a special consultant to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a visiting professor of Computer Science at the Open University and an MIT Media Lab Research Affiliate.\n  All opinions expressed by commentators are solely their own and do not reflect the opinions of Locus .\n  While you are here, please take a moment to support  Locus with a one-time or recurring donation.

Now, a near complete fossilised skeleton of a 180-million-year-old ichthyosaur that measured 10 metres in length has been discovered in the UK.\n The fossil is the largest and most complete ichthyosaur skeleton unearthed in the UK. It was found in the  Rutland Water Nature Reserve\u00a0near Leicester.\n Joe Davis at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust says he discovered the fossil by chance as he was working on landscaping the region. \u201cI know lots of people have spent their lives looking for something like this and I\u2019ve been very lucky to come across it,\u201d he says.\n  It is believed to be the first of its species,  Temnodontosaurus trigonodon,\u00a0to be found in the UK. Such fossils are typically found in North America and Germany.\n The ichthyosaur was an apex predator. This species belonged to a group\u00a0 suggested to have had perhaps the largest eyes of any known vertebrate animal, some 20 centimetres in diameter.\n \u201cIt is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history,\u201d says\u00a0 Dean Lomax at the University of Manchester, who led the fossil\u2019s excavation.\n  Mary Anning discovered the first ichthyosaur fossil in about 1811 in Lyme Regis in Dorset.

Williams and  Stephen J. Ceci\u00a0think so. As\u00a0the co-directors of the  Cornell Institute for Women in Science, they have spent much\u00a0of the past six\u00a0years\u00a0researching sexism in STEM fields. And according to their latest\u00a0 study,\u00a0published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, women are no longer at a disadvantage when applying for tenure-track positions in university science departments. In fact, the bias has now flipped: Female candidates are now twice as likely to be chosen as equally qualified men.\n \u201cIt\u00a0is a propitious time for women launching careers in academic science,\u201d the researchers declared.\n  The finding is based on a survey of nearly 900 faculty members from 371 schools across the country. In a series of\u00a0experiments, evaluators were presented with profiles of fictional job candidates and asked to rank them according to who was most qualified for an assistant professorship in biology, engineering, economics and psychology.\u00a0In nearly every case, the female candidates\u00a0were more likely to be ranked higher, regardless of their lifestyle, area of expertise and the\u00a0evaluators\u2019 field of research.\u00a0The one exception was with male economists, who showed no gender bias one way or the other.\n  \u201cAt one point we turned to each other while we were coding email responses from faculty across the U.S. and said we hoped that the large preference for women applicants over identically qualified men applicants would slow down because it seemed too large to be believed!\u201d Williams wrote in an  e-mail to Inside Higher Ed. \u201cIt never did slow down, and the final tally was roughly a 2\u00a0to\u00a01 preference. So, we were surprised.\u201d\n She and Ceci also found that\u00a0despite the belief\u00a0that women\u2019s life choices \u2014 like taking time off to\u00a0have\u00a0children \u2014 can put them at a disadvantage, men actually favored\u00a0women who took\u00a0extended maternity leave over those who went\u00a0right back to work at a ratio of 2-to-1 (women slightly preferred female candidates who didn\u2019t take extended leave). Female\u00a0evaluators also preferred divorced women over married fathers, and both genders favored a single, female candidate over a man with children.\n  \u201cAnti-female bias in academic hiring has ended,\u201d Williams and Ceci wrote in an  opinion piece for CNN on Monday. \u201cChanging cultural values, gender-awareness training and trends such as the retirement of older faculty members have brought us to a time when women in academic science are seen as more desirable hires than equally competent men.\u201d\n   This is the latest in a series of studies by the Cornell researchers, many of which have concluded\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0scarcity of female faculty in science departments (about 20 percent in most fields) can\u2019t be blamed on innate sexism. In a  study\u00a0published in the journal Psychological Science in the Public Interest, they found that young and mid-career women are\u00a0more likely to receive job\u00a0offers than male candidates, are paid roughly the same\u00a0amount, are granted\u00a0tenure and promoted at the same rate (except in economics),\u00a0remain in their fields for the same amount of time, and\u00a0are about as satisfied with their jobs. The study attributes the lack of female scientists to early educational choices \u2014 like opting not to take Advanced Placement\u00a0calculus and physics in high school or choosing not to declare a math-intensive major in college \u2014 rather than discrimination later on.\n In\u00a0their most recent report, Williams and Ceci also argue that\u00a0the belief that science is unwelcoming to women\u00a0may be what keeps so many women out of the field.\n  \u201cThe perception that STEM fields continue to be inhospitable male bastions can become self-reinforcing by discouraging female applicants, thus contributing to continued underrepresentation,\u201d\u00a0they wrote.\n  Though the conclusion should be\u00a0heartening news for proponents of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), who have long argued that hiring bias is holding female scientists back,\u00a0it contradicts  other\u00a0 prominent\u00a0 studies\u00a0of the issue \u2014 a fact that has subjected it to skepticism from other researchers.\n Joan C. Williams (no relation to Wendy), a  distinguished professor at the University of California\u2019s Hastings College of Law and co-principal investigator for the  Tools for Change project, which tries to level the playing field for women in STEM,  told Inside Higher Ed that the Cornell study is \u201cseriously flawed\u201d in its conclusion that science is now a welcoming place for women. She argued that\u00a0hiring has never really been the main source of discrimination against women.\n  Joan Williams and others noted that the fictional female candidates in the Cornell study were exceptionally well-qualified, a factor that may have mitigated gender bias. A similar\u00a0 2012\u00a0study in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\u00a0which looked at more moderately qualified graduate student candidates for a job in a lab, found that male applicants were much more likely to be hired, given better salaries and offered mentorship.\n  \u201cI think it\u2019s too soon to say, \u2018Okay, problem solved,\u2019\u201d  Virginia Valian, who researches gender equity at New York\u2019s Hunter College,  told Science Magazine. \u201cWe haven\u2019t solved the problem of underrepresentation of women in the sciences\u00a0\u2026\u00a0and I wouldn\u2019t want people to think that this paper demonstrates that we have solved it.\u201d\n  \u201cWe\u2019re not saying women do not face discrimination\u201d in academic science, she said. \u201cBut these data speak to a real change. People seem to have internalized the value of gender diversity, and are consciously or unconsciously upgrading women candidates.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 06:14:21", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53d7\u5230,finds,\u5973\u6027", "title": "\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5973\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u830e\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u9752\u7750", "title_en": "Study finds, surprisingly, that women are favored for jobs in STEM", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/04/14/study-finds-surprisingly-that-women-are-favored-for-jobs-in-stem/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d7\u5230", "finds", "\u5973\u6027"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072676, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u201c\u7266\u725b\u5243\u987b\u201d\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u601d\u8bae\u7684\u672f\u8bed\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u653e\u7eb5\u548c\u5e7d\u9ed8\u3002\u6709\u70b9\u50cf\u201crascal\u201d\uff1a\u987d\u76ae\uff0c\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u7231\u7684\u3002\u5f88\u660e\u663e\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u7266\u725b\u5243\u987b\u4ee4\u4eba\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u8be5\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u7684\u5206\u5fc3\u3002\u5b83\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u62d6\u5ef6\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\n\u5efa\u7b51Tex\u662f\u7266\u725b\u5243\u987b\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u4fa7\u9762\u9879\u76ee\u3002 yakshav.es\u5e16\u5b50\u8ba9\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u593a\u56de\u4e86\u7266\u725b\u5243\u987b\u3002\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u4e00\u4ef6\u574f\u4e8b\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1f\u5927\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6765\u81ea\u5b83\u3002 Tex\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u6392\u7248\u548c\u5236\u5b9a\u6280\u672f\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u53d7\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66\u3002\u6709\u4e9b\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e89\u8fa9\u8bf4\uff0cTex\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86Taocp\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u60a8\u662f\u76f8\u4fe1\u8fd8\u662f\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5426\u8ba4TEX\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u662f\u6df1\u523b\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7266\u725b\u5243\u987b\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u3002", "note_en": "\u201cYak shaving\u201d. It is, at base, an opprobrious term but with a touch of indulgence and humor. Sort of like \u201crascal\u201d: naughty, yes, but lovably so. It\u2019s clear why yak shaving has a bad reputation. It\u2019s a distraction from what we\u2019re supposed to be doing. It is, really, a form of procrastination.\n Procrastination, distraction, not doing what you\u2019re supposed to be doing. Not notions we associate with Donald Knuth, arguably the apotheosis of their opposite. Yet,  yakshav.es makes the case that  Knuth is yak shaving\u2019s patron saint. To support that claim, they tell the familiar story of how in the middle of writing  The Art of Computer Programming, his (self described) life\u2019s work, Knuth noticed that hot type typesetting was no longer available to print Volume 2 of the series and that the alternatives looked terrible. So Knuth took 11 years off to build his own typesetting system. In the middle of building TeX, he noticed that there no free fonts to use with TeX so he undertook a side project to build the Computer Modern font set. In the middle of building the Computer Modern Font, he noticed that there was no way of programmatically specifying a character in a font set so he invented Metafont. And on and on. See the post for the more comprehensive version.\n Building TeX is the very definition of yak shaving. A seemingly infinite recursion of side projects in service of the main goal. The yakshav.es post made me reappraise yak shaving. It\u2019s not always a bad thing. Sure, it can delay the main goal but great things can come from it. TeX revolutionized typesetting and the preparation of technical documents. Its influence is felt well outside Computer Science. Some might argue that TeX\u2019s influence exceeds that of TAOCP. Whether you believe that or not, there\u2019s no denying that TeX\u2019s importance is profound, especially for an instance of yak shaving.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 06:10:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7266\u725b,yak,tex", "title": "\u7266\u725b\u522e\u80e1\u5b50", "title_en": "Yak Shaving", "transed": 1, "url": "https://irreal.org/blog/?p=10244", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7266\u725b", "yak", "tex"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "db856a372314aae2acffb03350ba60ce.jpg", "infoid": 1072675, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u6307\u8d23Apple\u4ece\u6b3a\u51cc\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u84c4\u610f\u6218\u7565\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f7fAndroid\u7528\u6237\u8fdb\u5165iPhone-Maker\u7684Imessage\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u4e8c\u7b49\u516c\u6c11\u3002\n\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u520a\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u793a\u4e86\u6765\u81eaAndroid\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684Android\uff0cHiroshi Lockheimer\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\n\u6d1b\u514b\u6d77\u9ed8\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\uff1a\u201cApple\u7684Imessage Lock-In\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6b3a\u51cc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9500\u552e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u80a1\u6743\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u8425\u9500\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u4e0d\u8bda\u4f4d\u3002\u4eca\u5929\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u201c\n\u867d\u7136Apple\u7684Imessage\u7b56\u7565\u5f88\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8fd1\u671f\u53f2\u8bd7\u5965\u8fd0\u4f1a\u5ba1\u5224\u671f\u95f4\u6d6e\u51fa\u6c34\u9762\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u9ad8\u7ba1\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6218\u7565\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u3002 Apple\u786e\u5b9e\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5728Android\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u5a01\u529b\u6765\u5438\u5f15\u66f4\u591a\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u4f1a\u201c\u4f24\u5bb3\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u201d\uff08\u4ee5Apple Exp Phil Schiller\u7684\u8bdd\uff09\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0cCraig Federighi\uff0c\u628a\u5b83\u7f6e\u4e8e\uff1a\u201cAndroid\u4e0a\u7684Imessage\u53ea\u4f1a\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06[AN]\u969c\u788d\u7269\u79fb\u5230iPhone\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u7ed9\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u5b89\u5353\u624b\u673a\u3002\u201d\n\u8c37\u6b4c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6279\u8bc4\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6b63\u5982Ars Technica Editor Ron Amadeo\u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5728\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u65f6\uff0c\u641c\u7d22\u5de8\u5934\u662f\u81ed\u540d\u662d\u7740\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5931\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7531\u4e8eIMessage\u4e8e2011\u5e74\u51fa\u7248\u4ee5\u6765\u63a8\u51fa\u4e8613\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff08\u5176\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5931\u8d25\uff09\u3002", "note_en": "Google has accused Apple of benefiting from bullying as part of a deliberate strategy to make Android users into second-class citizens on the iPhone-maker\u2019s iMessage service.\n Apple\u2019s messaging service includes a number of iOS-exclusive features, like  Memoji, and famously turns texts from Android users green instead of the iOS-native blue. This has turned iMessage into a status symbol among US teens, creating peer pressure for young people to buy iPhones and sometimes leading to the ostracization of Android users. Showing up in a group chat as a green bubble has become, for some, a social faux pas.\n A recent report in   The Wall Street Journal highlighted this dynamic and prompted a response from both the Android team and Google\u2019s head of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer.\n \u201ciMessage should not benefit from bullying. Texting should bring us together, and the solution exists. Let\u2019s fix this as one industry,\u201d  tweeted the official Android account.\n Lockheimer  was more strident: \u201cApple\u2019s iMessage lock-in is a documented strategy. Using peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products is disingenuous for a company that has humanity and equity as a core part of its marketing. The standards exist today to fix this.\u201d\n Apple says making iMessage available on Android would \u201churt us more than help us\u201d\n Although Apple\u2019s iMessage strategy has long been apparent,  internal emails sent by company executives that were surfaced during the recent Epic Games trial confirmed the conscious importance of this strategy. Apple did consider making iMessage available on Android to attract more users, but concluded that doing so would \u201churt us more than help us\u201d (in the words of Apple exec Phil Schiller). As another executive, Craig Federighi, put it: \u201ciMessage on Android would simply serve to remove [an] obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones.\u201d\n Google\u2019s intervention here is not purely altruistic, of course: the company would benefit hugely from Apple making iMessage available on Android. Google has also  recently been pushing for the iPhone-maker to support  next-generation texting standard RCS, which is intended to replace SMS and has already  gathered support from major US carriers.\n Google is also not well-placed to criticize other companies messaging strategies. As  Ars Technica editor Ron Amadeo  noted on Twitter, the search giant is notoriously dysfunctional when it comes to messaging, and has launched  13 separate messaging apps since iMessage came out in 2011 (most of which have failed).", "posttime": "2022-01-11 06:06:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,apple,\u8868\u793a,android", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0cApple'\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece\u6b3a\u51cc\u8005\u521b\u9020\u7684\u6b3a\u51cc\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca", "title_en": "Google says Apple 'should not benefit from bullying' created by iMessage lock-in", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876067/google-apple-ios-android-imessages-bullying-lockheimer", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "apple", "\u8868\u793a", "android"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9eb8594f000b2a0b534cc1947c4b2062.png", "infoid": 1072674, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u70bd\u70ed\u7684\u98df\u8c31\u3002\u6ca1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u3002", "note_en": "Blazing fast recipes.

The updates contained code to produce an infinite loop that caused dependent apps to spew gibberish, prefaced with the words \u201cLiberty Liberty Liberty.\u201d The update sent developers scrambling as they attempted to fix their malfunctioning apps.\n  Squires provided no reason for the move, but in a  readme file accompanying last week\u2019s malicious update, he included the words \u201cWhat really happened with Aaron Swartz?\u201d\n  Swartz tragically  took his own life after facing federal hacking charges that could have landed him in prison for 50 years. The charges\u2014for alleged computer hacking crimes and wire fraud\u2014stemmed from Swartz logging into a network at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and scraping millions of academic papers that were behind a paywall. After being locked out of the MIT Wi-Fi system, he entered an MIT network closet and plugged a laptop directly into the campus network. At the same time that he included the cryptic Swartz reference in the readme file, Squires also  tweeted those same words and included a link to  this thread claiming that Swartz was murdered after he discovered child-abuse porn on MIT servers. This  now-deleted post, included in the thread, stated:\n No, it is not Aaron Swartz who should be on trial but that lofty institution of hired learning, MIT, which is responsible for the heinous crimes that led to his death. The risks taken on by Swartz, which have threatened MIT, can be understood only through the issue of child porn as orchestrated and produced by its acclaimed professors and distributed to their wealthy and powerful sponsors. The MIT cyber-pimps cater to a clientele that includes the highest echelon of the State Department, major corporations, intelligence agencies, the military brass, and the White House.\n Every element in the Swartz case indicates that he died in a heroic attempt to expose the perversion that has corrupted the hearts and minds of the global elite, a heinous and often murderous vice that traumatizes innocent children and threatens every family on this planet.\n There\u2019s also evidence that Squires may have been charged two years ago with reckless endangerment after allegedly starting a fire in his Queens, New York, apartment. According to  news articles, a then 37-year-old man named Marak Squires was arrested after being taken to the hospital after authorities allegedly observed him acting erratically as they responded to the fire.\n    The articles said Squires was a software developer and early bitcoin investor. A month after the fire, Squires  reported on Twitter having \u201clost all my stuff in an apartment fire\u201d and asked for financial support.\n I lost all my stuff in an apartment fire and am barely staying unhomeless. Lost access to most of my accounts. All precious metal is missing. If anyone could bless paypal@marak.com with a little cash it would help me from freezing on the street. lol.\n\u2014 marak \ud83d\uddff (@marak)  October 25, 2020\n   Last week\u2019s sabotage raises concerns about the safety of the software supply chain that\u2019s crucial to large numbers of organizations\u2014including Fortune 500 companies. The two sabotaged libraries\u2014 Faker.js and  Colors.js\u2014created problems for people using  Amazon\u2019s Cloud Development Kit. Big companies, critics have long said, benefit from open source ecosystems without adequately compensating developers for their time. In turn, developers responsible for the software are unfairly strained.\n Indeed, Squires in 2020 said he would  no longer support large companies with work he does for free. \u201cTake this as an opportunity to send me a six-figure yearly contract or fork the project and have someone else work on it,\u201d he wrote.\n The ability of a single developer to throw a wrench in such a large base of apps underscores a fundamental weakness of the current free and open source software structure.

I wasn\u2019t able to get enough corroborated information to name the company (don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll keep trying). For now, here\u2019s a couple of annual reminders, as you\u2019re leaping into 2022 all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\n Be careful what you say in the company Slack \u2013 It may feel like DMs are private, but did you know that  a company admin can export all the DMs that have ever been sent on a Slack instance? Of course, there may be laws against exporting the data, but if you discussed something illegal or immoral in the DMs, you\u2019re going to have as hard a time explaining that as your boss has explaining how they ended up with a copy of your DMs. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, and you may have a case for suing your employer if your suspicious, over-eager head of IT decides to do some digging around, but that sort of thing is easily avoided by just keeping personal talk to personal channels, and work talk to work channels. Of course,  even your texts may not stay private, but at least there\u2019s a higher bar for getting access to those. And, y\u2019know, if you are particularly paranoid, there\u2019s always  Signal or  Telegram, with expiring messages.\n  Your bosses can monitor your company equipment \u2013 There\u2019s often a clause in contracts about how you can and cannot use equipment provided by your company. Some of those things are obvious \u2014 don\u2019t do illegal things \u2014 but others are more obscure. That\u2019s all good and well, but read your contract carefully. There may be language that says that your company is allowed to monitor what you do on your computer. I don\u2019t think that sounds particularly innocent, but it is worded obliquely in a lot of work contracts. In a world where AI tools are becoming more and more powerful, and where you sign a contract that says you\u2019re completely cool with being tracked, there are a ton of companies ( AktivTrak,  ActiveOps,  Veratio, to just name a few) that make software that can keep an eye on you, and your employers can install these on your computer with various degrees of stealth and permission from you.\n  HR is not on your side \u2013 The human resources department at your company might be friendly and helpful and lovely, and they may try their best to help resolve workplace issues, but they aren\u2019t on your side:  HR works for the company. They are there to protect the company\u2019s interests. And when your interests and those of the company are at odds, remember that the people who work in HR \u2014 no matter how friendly they are \u2014 still need to pay their bills and have a good working relationship with  their bosses after you\u2019ve quit, been fired or otherwise get moved around within the company. And as James Altucher points out in his column,  eventually, they will fire you.\n You don\u2019t owe a company your loyalty \u2013 Especially in the U.S., where a lot of employment is \u201cat will,\u201d i.e. you can be laid off at any time for any reason, you remain employed for as long as the company can afford you, and you\u2019re contributing to the bottom line. Especially in startups, this is a mercurial universe, because goals and targets can shift from board meeting to board meeting. One month, the engineering department is the be-all and end-all of a company\u2019s life blood. But the amount of money in the bank account and the fundraising environment can change quickly, and the next month, it could all change. Especially when the going gets tough, it may become tempting for leadership to run the company to its KPIs, and focus only on growth and customer acquisition. In that universe, engineering is of low importance in the short term, and suddenly advertising spend and the sales operation becomes top priority. Even great leaders with solid long-term visions can be forced into making abrupt changes. Loyalty in the professional world is a myth that benefits only the employers; if they need to let you go, they will, so when a recruiter comes knocking, take the call to see how you are priced in the market.\n  Don\u2019t quit \u2013  If a manager or someone from HR is trying to make you quit on your own accord, as a rule of thumb, it\u2019s best to resist.  Don\u2019t quit! A lot of mechanisms (including, in some states, unemployment benefits)  only apply to you if you\u2019re laid off . If you quit \u2014 and especially if you sign an agreement that you promise not to sue the company \u2014 you hugely weaken your options further down the line.\n Did HR use your Slack DM messages or your emails against you? I\u2019m talking to a number of startup employees at the moment \u2014 at a few different companies. I want to hear from you.

Now, Harris describes, his vision is that Career Karma will match employees and contractors to job training programs in the marketplace it has built over the past few years.\n  To execute on this stage of the business, Career Karma announced today that it has raised a $40 million Series B at an undisclosed valuation. The round was led by Top Tier Capital Partners, alongside GV (Google Ventures), Bronze Venture Fund, Stardust, Trousdale Ventures and Alumni Ventures Group. Existing investors also participated in the round, including SoftBank, Emerson Collective, Kapor Capital, Backstage, 4S Bay Partners and Y Combinator.\n \u201cStage one was become the number one career advice service for the internet, stage two was become the world\u2019s largest community of career transitioners and now phase three is to become the world\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d said Harris in an interview with TechCrunch.\n Similar to Handshake and Guild Education, both valued as multibillion-dollar businesses, Career Karma is playing the middleman. As an employee benefit, Career Karma will be able to get students employer-paid tuition, and then re-skill and up-skill them into ideally more advanced job skills.\n Employers will serve as a zero-cost acquisition channel that helps Career Karma work with lots of employees at scale \u2014 a business its been in since launch.\n  \u201cOn the user side, we\u2019re able to identify the job training programs that they\u2019re interested in, the current skills that they have and the job that they want,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEventually we\u2019re going to have a really powerful database internally.\u201d\n Career Karma\u2019s strategy shift means its business model will need a refresh as well. Previously, Career Karma charged a fee to bootcamps when it successfully placed a student in one of their programs. The fee was usually 10% of a placed-student\u2019s tuition, which could range from $10,000 to $50,000, Harris says. While this strategy could appear to align incentives \u2014 Career Karma only makes money when it successfully places a student inside a boot camp \u2014 it could also pressure the platform to focus more on pace of placement than personalization of placement. The enterprise business won\u2019t necessarily bring the same sorts of pressures, since it will be built to serve career services, not just program matching.\n Now, with an enterprise side, Harris said the company is hiring folks to help figure out the best new pricing strategy. Beyond the aforementioned companies, there\u2019s precedent in this sort of pivot: last year, Codecademy  raised the same sum in a Series D round to sell its services to the enterprise. A few weeks ago, the same company  sold to Skillsoft in a $525 million deal.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 04:02:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "karma,\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf", "title": "\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6dafKarma\u5360\u573040\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3aEdtech\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u798f\u5229", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCareer Karma lands $40M to evolve into an edtech employee benefit\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["karma", "\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "81c4c0e3fc0921d505f10b0c307fb8a2.png", "infoid": 1072669, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u94b1\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u9996\u5148\u662f\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684Y\u7ec4\u5408\u80a1\u6743\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a125,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u53607\uff05\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u672c\u96c6\u56e2\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u5c06\u4ee5\u4e0d\u660e\u7ec6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9879\u4e3a375,000\u7f8e\u5143 - \u672a\u6765\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u534f\u8bae - \u201c\u6700\u6709\u5229\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u201d\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\n\u90a3\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u8005\u73b0\u5728\u4e3a\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u672c\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6;\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u672f\u8bed\u662f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u60ca\u559c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc7\u7c7d\u7c7d\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u5e02\u573a\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u524d\u5f80\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u5373\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u6784\uff0cY\u7ec4\u5408\u8005\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u542f\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdb\u5316\u3002\u4ece\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4eb2\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0cYC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u9065\u9065\u3002 TechCrunch Reckoning\uff0c\u8be5\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u53c2\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u8be5\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4e5f\u642c\u5230\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728TechCrunch\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6211\u4eec\u8d5e\u8d4f\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u518d\u4ece\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u5f00\u8f66\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u592a\u5c11\u6905\u5b50\u7684\u5927\u623f\u95f4\u3002", "note_en": "The money comes in two different forms. The first is the well-known Y Combinator equity deal, worth $125,000 for 7% of accelerated startups. The group will now also offer $375,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note \u2014 a simple agreement for future equity \u2014 with a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clause.\n Uncapped means that there is no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 SAFE will convert to shares, while the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d language ensures that Y Combinator gets as good a deal as anyone else in a later conversion.\n  That Y Combinator is now offering more capital to startups is not surprising; indeed, that it took this long for the group to update its terms is the bigger surprise. Still, a half-million dollars is much more in keeping with where the pre-seed and seed-stage investing markets have headed in recent years, namely to larger dollar amounts at higher prices.\n The updated terms do not mean that the accelerator itself will have any less preserved upside in portfolio companies. In fact, you could argue that Y Combinator\u2019s updated terms are defensive in that it is offering more capital in addition, but not in place of, its traditional equity stake in companies that pass through its doors. So the accelerator may be better able to attract the best early-stage startups with larger checks, even as it puts its initial equity investment to work at a price point that has proven historically lucrative.\n  As an institution, Y Combinator has been updating itself as the startup market has evolved. From a focus on in-person work, YC  went remote during the pandemic. The result of that switch was more participating startups from other countries and markets,  by TechCrunch reckoning. The group has also  moved to remote demo days, something that we\u2019ve appreciated here at TechCrunch as we no longer have to drive down from San Francisco to a large room with too few chairs.\n It will be interesting to see how rival accelerators react, if at all, to Y Combinator\u2019s updated terms set.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 04:02:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u73b0\u5728,combinator,\u7ec4\u5408", "title": "Y Combinator\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u516c\u53f8\u6295\u8d44500,000\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tY Combinator will now invest $500,000 in accelerator companies\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/y-combinator-will-now-invest-500000-in-accelerator-companies/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u73b0\u5728", "\u7ec4\u5408"]}]
