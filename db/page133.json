All that is certain is that Amblin will produce \u201cmultiple new feature films per year\u201d for Netflix.\n \u201cFrom the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,\u201d said Spielberg in the release.\n  Those new ways didn\u2019t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.\n \u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie,\u201d Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind, or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect \u201cthe theatrical experience\u201d \u2014 understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.\n Naturally it\u2019s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there\u2019s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.\n Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the \u201ctheatrical experience\u201d is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a \u201cpremiere\u201d at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:46:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7535\u5f71,amblin", "title": "Spielberg\u7684Amblin\u58a8\u6c34\u58a8\u6c34\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7535\u5f71\u5904\u7406Netflix ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSpielberg\u2019s Amblin inks multi-year feature film deal with Netflix\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/spielbergs-amblin-inks-multi-year-feature-film-deal-with-netflix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7535\u5f71", "amblin"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f836ce1f3532f41865e7566a77edcbcf.png", "infoid": 1067243, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0cqu'est-ce qu'une plante\uff1f \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f89\u714c\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u690d\u7269\u751f\u6d3b\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u548c\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u690d\u7269\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u3002 ", "note_en": "What if plants suffered, thought, helped each other? And what if the carrot were an animal like any other? According to Peter Wohlleben, famous German forest engineer and author of the best-seller  The Hidden Life of Trees, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a wolf ripping apart a wild boar or a deer eating an oak seedling, in both cases there is pain and death\u201d (quoted p. 13). The thesis is original, and seems all the more innocuous since none of its defenders call for people to stop cooking plants.\n Is there not in this form of neo-animism, which sees a continuity between human and plant subjective interiority, an element of bad faith? Is not the alleged suffering of plants, Florence Burgat asks, \u201ca new diversion from the cause of animals\u201d (p. 172)? Dominique Lestel, author of  Apologie du carnivore (Apology for Carnivorism), does not hide his polemical intentions: \u201cWhy would it be more ethical to make a carrot suffer than a hare?\u201d (quoted p. 13). In good logic, if the carrot and the hare suffer in equal measure, \u201cit is not ethical\u201d to discriminate between them, to spare animals while savagely killing blades of grass, carrots, and soy sprouts. In this sense, vegetarians are murderers like any other. Just let carnivores enjoy themselves!\n Against this thesis, known as the \u201ccry of the carrot\u201d ( le cri de la carotte), animalists have so far been content to answer two things. On the one hand, plants do not have a nervous system, and so they do not feel pain. On the other hand, carnivores consume animals that are themselves fed on plants. Worse, the production of one animal protein requires 7 to 10 plant proteins. The argument is a strictly accounting one. Even if plant suffering were of the same intensity as animal suffering, omnivores would produce seven to ten times more suffering than plant lovers alone.\n Burgat is not satisfied with these arguments. The first is based on the idea that there can be no suffering without a nervous system. A  handful of biologists, controversial to be sure, follow in Wohlleben\u2019s footsteps and argue that plants have a form of \u201cdiffuse nervous system.\u201d In their view, synaptic activity\u2014electrical signals\u2014on the body of plants functions like a diffuse brain, one that is not concentrated in a single organ, as in animals. As for the second argument, it concedes that killing a carrot is murder, a murder comparable to that of a farm animal. In the eyes of the philosopher, this concession is absurd, pointless.\n Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une plante? (What is a plant?) goes beyond these two arguments by defending the thesis of a radical ontological difference between plant and animal life. According to Burgat, resolving the question of pain, of subjectivity, requires us to focus on how plants give themselves to us, on their phenomenology.\n  The book is divided into three parts: epistemology, ontology, and morals and rights. The first part deals with the knowledge of plants. How does one produce knowledge about plants? Two models of knowledge can be distinguished: homological and analogical. The homological model assimilates plants to animal or human life. The body parts of one correspond to the body parts of the other. This is Wohlleben\u2019s model. Drawing on numerous passages from his book, Burgat easily shows that anthropomorphism is not here a simple method of popularizing science, a pedagogical metaphor; it is taken as a given. The other model of knowledge, the analogical paradigm, is more interesting and more complex. Since we know animals better than plants, since the former are closer to us physically, emotionally, and mentally, the scientific strategy of botanists has long consisted in investigating the unknown in plants based on the animal model\u2014as Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte observes in his works, but also Foucault in  The Order of Things. According to Burgat, this model of knowledge stumbles on at least two fundamental points: plant nutrition and reproduction. Unlike animals, plants are capable of feeding themselves without taking ready-made organic molecules from their environment; they can synthesize the latter from light. Thus, plants do not need to look for food. As for reproduction, some plants reproduce by cutting, \u201cwhich remains unexplained, for lack of finding an analogue elsewhere\u201d (Canguilhem, quoted p. 36). In this mode of reproduction, like comes from like. \u201cA plant,\u201d writes Hegel quoted by Burgat (p. 40), \u201cis an aggregate of a group of individuals which form a single individual, but whose parts are completely self-subsistent.\u201d\n It will be objected that certain plants, for instance carnivorous plants (p. 60), are mixotrophic, capable also of feeding on pre-existing organic constituents. Moreover, plant reproduction is not always asexual; not all plants can grow from a cutting. This is because a good part of the misunderstandings concerning plants stems \u201cfrom the idea that finding an animal feature in a plant organism suffices to extract [this organism] from its category and to place it in the opposite category\u201d (pp. 51-52). No single empirical feature is the truth of an organism. \u201cUnder the analytical eye, empirical features say nothing when taken one by one; they never allow the ontological question to be decided\u201d (p. 52). The organism is the structure and not the sum of its parts. Against analytical methodology, which decomposes the living into its elements, Burgat pleads for a science or an interpretation of forms, of the whole that is formed and transformed.\n  Thus, Florence Burgat propose an ontological study based on a phenomenology of plant life. The investigation focuses on what plants are. The challenge is to understand what substantially differentiates plants from animals by proposing both a negative, privative definition (what they do not have compared to animals) and a positive one (what they have that animals do not have). To understand what is specific to plant life, one must first engage in comparative analysis, which is the means by which philosophy, and not only the current of philosophical anthropology, approaches the \u201cquestion of plant life.\u201d Negatively, the plant has no perception in the psychological sense (p. 55). When the plant has infraperceptions, that is, perceptions without a subject to experience them as its own, it is not necessarily its unity that infraperceives\u2014a unity that is nowhere to be found\u2014but some of its parts. Plants react finely to any corpuscular or undulatory phenomenon, but without forming mental images of it (p. 90).\n There is no interiority, no life of consciousness, no intentionality in plant life: \u201cConsciousness appears only in the primitive reflection of sensation\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 79). Plant life is neither experiential nor restless (p. 102).\n Plants do not have a lived world; their life is immediate. They are among the living beings for whom objects in the world have only one meaning. There is no multivocality of meaning. There is no error experienced as an error, no astonishment at what appears. There is an \u201cabsolutely radical\u201d division between the plant world and the animal world, between the world of \u201cobjective correspondence\u201d and the world of subjective meaning (p. 64). Plants are not individuals, if individuals are indivisible totalities whose division implies destruction (p. 105).\n Finally, plants do not move. Phototropism, or reaction to light, is just that\u2014a reaction. \u201cThe animal,\u201d writes Hans Jonas, \u201ccan freely close and open its jaws whenever it feels like it\u2014to chew, to yawn, or simply to exercise this faculty\u2014and it can stop and reverse every movement in progress\u201d (quoted p. 62). The plant does not have this freedom; it cannot close and open its leaves.\n From the perspective of a positive ontology, Burgat wonders whether the life of the plant might not closely approximate life as a superpowerful and eternal force. In some respects, the plant seems immortal, freed from temporality: Seeds or root fragments suffice for its rebirth. Plants are \u201cdriven by pure growth, unaware of the caesura of birth and the irreversible rupture of death, slowly collapsing in on themselves to relive elsewhere\u201d (p. 83). If the plant is not an individual, then its positive quality may be that it is a  dividuum (according to the expression coined by a biologist quoted by Plessner, p. 105). The plant is \u201cthe greatest chemist among all living beings (...) it builds the elements of its organic development from inorganic substances\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 110). This capacity\u2014this autotrophy\u2014is the mark of its autarchic royalty (p. 130). Whereas for Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss the animal is the most other of all others, that is, the psycho-subjective structure which, sharing a common basis, is the most alien to us, plant life for Burgat is \u201cradical alterity\u201d (p. 129), that which resists all common, lived experience.\n  Is plant life\u2014as defined through the ontological investigation\u2014worthy of respect? The philosopher shares with L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Francis Hall\u00e9 a certain repugnance for the felling of trees. Their destruction as well as \u201cthe ransacking and pollution of natural environments are reproved for their consequences and for what they are in themselves: a repugnant attitude\u201d (p. 144). This repugnance appears to be an intuition, the first answer that comes to mind when we are summoned to answer the question \u201cis it right to cut down the tree that is standing over there, right in front of me, and has been around for decades?\u201d But is this intuition correct? Is it reprehensible to cut down a hundred hundred-year-old oaks to rebuild the framework of Notre-Dame Cathedral (p. 148)? If it is reprehensible, is our repugnance consistent with the principle of attributing fundamental rights to plants?\n Burgat does not definitively settle these questions. In terms of content, she sides with Rousseau and Bentham. Sensibility is a necessary and sufficient condition to be a bearer of rights. In terms of form, she points out that, from a strictly technical point of view, nothing prevents the legislator from protecting the interests of humans in the environment, if they consider these interests sufficiently important to set up a specific protection, or to protect such and such a species of flower, or such and such a tree that is particularly remarkable for aesthetic reasons. One may well call legal \u201crights\u201d these types of rights which are conceptually indirect. If historical monuments can be protected (p. 153), then so can plants.

Maybe you should improve your hiring process. How do you track what they are getting done now?\n I don&#39;t know. Now I walk around and ask them, and we have meetings where we talk about it; if I&#39;m not around how would I know if they were slacking off?\n Maybe you should work to improve what you measure and how you encourage feedback. It is normally a good idea to have ways to tell if people are doing a good job for what you are paying them to do.\n But if I can\u2019t see them to make sure they are working, then I can\u2019t manage them.\n Sounds like you need to level up as a manager. There are other skills to improve how you manage different types of teams and working styles. Your job as a leader is to have a productive team; take ownership of this and adjust to running a productive team in a new way.\n But we can\u2019t let our people not see each other, they won\u2019t communicate well.\n People coordinate large projects all the time without being in the same place. You might want to think about improving your processes. Some simple changes could improve your communication.\n  The last year isn&#39;t typical remote work; most companies were rushing to move away from the office, but were not embracing remote work. Remote work, if done well, is not a day full of Zoom meetings. GitLab, a $6B company, has a guide that might be an  interesting read. In it, they say that the company is in the  Skeumorph phase when they just do everything the same way, but not in the same place. You can mature past this into later phases where you don&#39;t spend so much on video calls.\n I&#39;m a manager, if I spend less time in meetings, what am I going to be doing all day?\n I appreciate the honesty; that sounds like a great problem to have. Thinking strategically, helping to grow your people, writing documents that would have been meetings. You will be plenty busy, just in a different way.\n  Sounds like if they want to and you don\u2019t let them, they will leave to one of the many companies that let them. I hope none of them are your  competitors.\n But we are paying all this money for office space, I don&#39;t want to waste that.\n That is ultimately your call. Depending on your business,  losing a few key employees might be worse that eating a year of a lease. Depending on your business, reducing in-person meetings, being able to hire talented people a few hours away, and having happier more loyal employees might be less important than a big lease cost. Also, you might be experiencing the  Sunk Cost Fallacy.\n I don&#39;t want to change the way I work, I just want people to join me in the office. My kids are driving me crazy. Is it weird to say I&#39;m lonely; I miss my office friends.\n The office has some great things going for it. Have you ever sat down and listed them and thought about how more established companies make sure those things happen without an office? You might be surprised.

And nearly 40% of high earners \u2014 those making more than $100,000 annually \u2014 said they live that way.\n That means high-earning millennials aren&#39;t the only ones feeling stretched thin, but they feel that way more than their six-figure-making peers. Living on constrained budgets may therefore have less to do with income and more to do with expenses, the report said.\n     That&#39;s partly because of lifestyle choices. Many of these millennials are likely  HENRYs \u2014 short for high earner, not rich yet. The acronym was invented in 2003, but it has come to characterize a certain group of 30-something six-figure earners who struggle to balance their spending and savings habits.\n HENRYs typically fall victim to  lifestyle creep, when one increases one&#39;s standard of living to match a rise in discretionary income. They prefer a comfortable and often expensive lifestyle that leaves them living paycheck to paycheck.\n        As the report said, &#34;Living paycheck to paycheck sometimes carries connotations of barely scraping by and of poverty. The reality of a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle in the United States today is much more complex, and the current economic environment has made it even more complicated.&#34;\n It cited the example of a college-educated 35-year-old earning more than $100,000 while juggling a mortgage, student-loan debt, and a child, which could leave them with little savings for big purchases or unexpected emergencies.\n The generation is facing an  affordability crisis. Income increases simply  have not kept up with an exponential increase in living costs, and the pandemic hasn&#39;t helped matters by throwing job loss and  pay cuts into the mix.\n The cost of education has also more than doubled since the 1970s, leaving many millennials with student debt. Priya Malani, the founder of  Stash Wealth, a financial firm that works with HENRYs,  previously told Insider that 40% of her clients had student loans. On average, they owed $80,000.\n     As a byproduct of this increased cost in living, the middle class has been shrinking.

Other preliminary evidence puts  humans in central Mexico as early as around 33,000 years ago ( SN: 7/22/20).\n The latest evidence comes from animal bones that biological anthropologist and archaeologist Andrew Somerville and two Mexican colleagues found stored in a Mexico City lab. The bones had been excavated in the 1960s at a rock-shelter called Coxcatlan Cave.\n Radiocarbon analyses of six rabbit bones from the site\u2019s deepest sediment  yielded unexpectedly old ages, the researchers report online May 19 in  Latin American Antiquity. That sediment also contained chipped and sharp-edged stones regarded as tools by the site\u2019s lead excavator.\n Higher sediment layers yielded clearer examples of stone tools and other remnants of human activity dating to nearly 9,900 years ago. \u00a0Somerville, of\u00a0Iowa State University in Ames, initially suspected that rabbit bones from the deepest sediment were perhaps around 12,000 years old. But analyses revealed they were much older, hinting humans were living in the cave roughly 30,000 years ago.\n Somerville will next determine whether other animal bones from the ancient sediment display butchery marks, breaks where marrow was removed or burned patches from cooking. He also wants to locate and study possible stone tools from that same sediment that may be stored in the same lab.\n Based on additional radiocarbon dates and comparisons with stone-tool finds from other Mexican sites, Somerville suspects that a separate occupation of Coxcatlan Cave occurred between 13,500 and 9,900 years ago. Regional food and water sources may have dwindled when the last Ice Age peaked between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago, causing the earliest settlers to leave and delaying further occupations \u00a0until conditions improved, Somerville speculates.\n   A.
