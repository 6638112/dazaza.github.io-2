They amuse themselves for months in quarantine with dancers and buffoons until, one night, a ghost appears and kills them all. This parable felt apropos during the early phase of COVID-19’s spread, when billionaires were hiding on their super-yachts and posting pics on Instagram. “Isolated in the Grenadines avoiding the virus,” the record producer David Geffen captioned one such photo. “I’m hoping everybody is staying safe.”</p><p>埃德加·艾伦普队的冠状病毒停工者正在趋势。 “红色死亡的面具”，他从1842年开始的哥特式故事，在2020年3月开始到寓言：一个王子，其州被出血热像出血热的东西，邀请了1000名贵族的朋友留在他储存的良好中保持。他们用舞者和水副龙在隔离的地方逗留几个月，直到一晚，鬼魂出现并杀死他们。当亿万富翁藏在他们的超级游艇上并在Instagram上发布照片时，这种寓言觉得这是一个令人叹为观的令人叹为观止的appos。 “避开了避开病毒的格林纳丁斯，”记录制作人大卫Geffen标题是一张这样的照片。 “我希望每个人都保持安全。”</p><p> A Red Death wish for the ultrarich soon gave way to other, less parochial concerns, and “Masque” turned out to be less apt than some of Poe’s other writings on disease. Take “ The Sphinx.” The story is set “during the dread reign of the Cholera in New York” in 1832, and the narrator has just bolted to a rustic cottage in the Hudson Valley. That summer, Manhattan was indeed abandoned to a morbid silence, according to Charles E. Rosenberg’s history   The Cholera Years. Church bells went unrung, pedestrians disappeared, and tufts of grass sprouted from the streets. “By the end of the first week in July, almost everyone who could afford to had left the city,” Rosenberg writes.</p><p> Ultrarich的红色愿望很久很久就留给了其他，较少的狭隘问题，并且“面具”结果不如一些关于一些关于疾病的其他着作品。拿“狮身人面像”。 1832年，这个故事是“在纽约纽约霍乱的恐怖主义统治期间”，叙述者刚刚用哈德逊谷的乡村小屋。根据Charles E. Rosenberg的历史，曼哈顿认为，曼哈顿确实被遗弃到了病态的沉默。教堂铃声漫漫，行人消失了，从街上发芽的草丛。 “到7月的第一周结束，几乎每个人都能承受到城市的人，”罗森伯格写道。</p><p> Poe’s narrator is one of these well-heeled refugees, holed up for several weeks and hosted by a relative. The pair are pleasantly occupied inside and outdoors, but horrid news keeps wafting into their retreat: “The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death,” the narrator says. “That palsying thought, indeed, took entire possession of my soul. I could neither speak, think, nor dream of anything else.”</p><p> Poe的叙述者是这些良好的难民之一，落在几周内并被亲戚举办。这对令人愉快地坐在户外和户外，但是恐怖新闻一直吐进入他们的撤退：“来自南方的空气似乎在我们死亡时悔改，”叙述者说。 “确实占据了Palsying的想法，整个拥有了我的灵魂。我既不说，想想，也不梦想别的。“</p><p> Then, one day, he is seated by the window, a book in his hand, musing on the epidemic’s toll as he gazes out across the Hudson River. On the far, denuded bank he sees something terrible: a “living monster of hideous conformation,” darting toward the trees. It’s the size of a great ship, he says, with a proboscis sprouting from a mass of shaggy hair and two giant, gleaming tusks below; it has two pairs of wings, each nearly 100 yards in length and clothed in metal scales. When the monster opens its jaws and shrieks across the valley, the narrator collapses in a faint.</p><p> 然后，有一天，他坐在窗边，一本书在他的手中，当他在哈德逊河凝视着外面的陷入困境时，纪念疫情。在远处，剥夺银行他看到了一些可怕的东西：一个“丑陋的丑陋构造的怪物”，飞向树木。他说，这是一艘大船的大小，从大量的毛茸茸的头发和两个巨型，闪闪发光的象牙，它是一座粗壮的萌芽;它有两对翅膀，每个近100码长，穿着金属鳞片。当怪物打开它的颌骨并穿过山谷尖叫时，叙述者在微弱的情况下崩溃。</p><p> The vision recurs a few days later, and the narrator takes it as an omen of his coming death. His relative, a scientific man, tells him not to worry. The narrator, the host explains, has been the victim of “the principle source of error in all human investigations”: namely, the tendency to lose one’s sense of proportion. Rather than a giant beast scuttling along the banks of the Hudson, the narrator must have spotted something small and near at hand, and then misjudged its “propinquity.”</p><p> 几天后的视觉回归，叙述者将其作为他未来的预兆。他的亲戚是一个科学的人，告诉他不担心。叙述者，主持人解释，一直是“所有人类调查中的原则误差源的原则”的受害者：即失去一个比例感的倾向。叙述者必须透过哈德森的银行沿着哈德森的巨型野兽阉割，而是透过了手头的小而附近，然后误判了它的“预言。”。</p><p> The relative pulls a natural-history book from his shelf to make his point. He reads aloud a scientific description of  Acherontia atropos— the death’s-head hawk moth. It matches the vision: four membranous wings covered with metallic scales, downy palpi, a proboscis, and so forth. Then he steps over to the window and, like Sherlock Holmes, plops down in the chair, mimicking the narrator’s posture and position. “Ah, here it is!” he cries. He’s found the moth in question—wriggling along the window sash, just about a 16th of an inch away, he says, from the pupil of his eye.</p><p> 相对从他的架子中拉动自然历史书，以达到他的观点。他大声朗读Acherontia Atropos的科学描述 - 死亡的头发鹰蛾。它符合愿景：四个覆盖有金属鳞片的膜翅膀，柔软的Palpi，一个长官等等。然后他跨过窗户，就像Sherlock Holmes一样，溅在椅子上，模仿叙述者的姿势和位置。 “啊，这里是！”他哭。他发现沿着窗扇上的问题鞭打的蛾，只有16岁的英寸，他说，从他的眼睛看。</p><p> This reads, at first, as a triumphal tale of science in which phantasmal fear is tamed by cool and calculating method. But on closer look, the story’s message is ambivalent. While its final line pretends to be the culmination of a careful proof—elementary, my dear Watson—that’s not the case at all: If a hawk moth had really spread its wings two millimeters from the narrator’s pupil, he wouldn’t have perceived a monster. He wouldn’t have been able to distinguish anything at all. The vision that’s ascribed to him is instead the microscopic view—a dissector’s terrifying, supernormal closeness to the facts. (Think of a  dust mite, captured at 300x: a dimpled, pincered blob on hairy stilts.) This is a specimen, not an omen—one that illustrates the rival modes by which science changes our perception. It may help us organize and simplify the world, but it also has the power to derange us with its details.</p><p> 首先，这读取了胜利的科学胜利，其中通过凉爽和计算方法驯服了幻力恐惧。但在仔细看来，故事的消息是矛盾的。虽然其最终线假装是仔细证明 - 小学的高级，但我亲爱的沃森 - 这并非如此：如果一个鹰派蛾已经从叙述者的瞳孔中占据了两毫米的翅膀，他就不会被察觉怪物。他根本无法区分任何东西。归因于他的愿景是微观观点 - 一个分歧者对事实的可怕的过度近似。 （想想一个尘螨，捕获在300x的毛茸茸的毛茸茸的毛茸茸的悬臂下来。）这是一个标本，而不是一个例子，而不是一个例子，说明科学改变我们的感知的竞争力模式。它可能有助于我们组织和简化世界，但它也有能力嘲笑我们的细节。 </p><p>  Poe, a master of horror (and detective) fiction, is far less well known for his fascination with empirical methods, and the mysteries they reveal. As he wrote in another context, his era’s brand-new tools of image-making represented the “most important, and perhaps the most extraordinary triumph of modern science.” Technology revealed hidden facts at “inaccessible elevations,” he wrote—it ginned up propinquity—and cast a light on “truth itself in the supremeness of its perfection.”</p><p>Poe，恐怖主义主义（和侦探）小说，对于他与实证方法的迷恋，以及他们揭示的谜团令人着迷。正如他在另一个背景下写的那样，他的时代的全新的形象制作工具代表了“最重要的，也许是现代科学最具非凡的胜利”。技术揭示了“难以接近的海拔”的隐藏事实，他写道 - 它造成了最大的预选 - 并在“完美的最高性中的真相本身”展开了光明。</p><p> So the story of the terror on the riverbank leaves us with a puzzle: Is the vision of the moth—this massive microbe creeping up the waterway from cholera-stricken New York City—really just an error of inflation, as the relative suggests? Or might it be some message sent from hidden elevations, a scientific signal of its own?</p><p> 因此，河岸恐怖的故事让我们带着一个谜题：是蛾的愿景 - 这个大规模的微生物爬上了霍乱 - 受灾的纽约市的水路 - 真的只是一个通货膨胀的错误，因为相对暗示？或者可能会有一些消息从隐藏的高度发送，它自己的科学信号？</p><p> raged across America in the early 19th century. Poe, as a writer, critic, and thinker, battled for both sides. A new biography—  The Reason for the Darkness of the Night: Edgar Allan Poe and the Forging of American Science, by the historian John Tresch—situates its subject in a maelstrom of competing tides, as a new class of engineers and experimentalists splashed up against philosophers, theologians, and cranks. “Understanding his life and work,” Tresch maintains, “demands close attention to his multiform engagements with” scientific thought and discoveries.</p><p> 在19世纪初的美国肆虐。 Poe，作为作家，评论家和思想家，对双方作战者。一个新的传记 - 夜间黑暗的原因：埃德加艾伦普和美国科学的锻造，由历史学家约翰培训 - 在迈尔斯坦竞争潮汐迈尔斯特罗姆的主题，作为一类新的工程师和实验主义者泼反对哲学家，神学家和曲柄。 “了解他的生命和工作”，“培训维护”，“要求密切关注他的多种态度与”科学思想和发现。</p><p> Poe certainly had a scientific cast of mind: In 1830, at the age of 21, he was admitted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point—a scientific school, modeled on the École Polytechnique, in France, and meant to be a training ground for top-flight engineers. Poe showed promise, too. Before dropping out, he placed 17th in math out of 87 cadets. A few years later, he helped produce  a textbook on conchology that sold more copies during his life than any other volume bearing his name. Among its selling points were several hundred color illustrations of seashells.</p><p> Poe当然有一个科学的心灵：1830年，在21岁时，他在西点录取了美国军方学院 - 一个科学学校，在法国ÉcoleGoytechnique建模，并意味着培训地面用于前途工程师。 PoE也显示了承诺。在辍学之前，他在87名学员的数学中排名第17。几年后，他帮助生产了康诵教科书，这些教科书在寿命期间销售更多副本，而不是带有他名字的任何其他体积。在其销售点中是几百种贝壳的颜色插图。</p><p> By 1840, Poe was working at a men’s magazine, where he launched a feature called “A Chapter on Science and Art,” consisting of the sorts of squibs on innovation later found in  Popular Mechanics. (“A gentleman of Liverpool announces that he has invented a new engine,”  one entry started.) With this column, Tresch suggests, “Poe made himself one of America’s first science reporters.” He also made himself one of America’s first popular skeptics—a puzzle master and a debunker, in the vein of Martin Gardner. Poe wrote a column on riddles and enigmas, and he made a gleeful habit of exposing pseudoscience quacks.</p><p> 到1840年，PoE正在在一个男人的杂志上工作，在那里他推出了一个名为“科学和艺术章节”的功能，这些功能包括在流行的力学中稍后发现的创新戒断。 （“利物浦的绅士宣布他发明了一个新的发动机，”一个条目开始了。）Treadch建议，“Poe成为美国第一科学记者之一。”他还使自己成为Martin Gardner的静脉中的美国第一个受欢迎的怀疑论者 - 一个拼图硕士和揭露。 Poe在谜语和谜上写了一列栏，他养了一种暴露伪科学嘎嘎队的习惯。</p><p> D. H. Lawrence once said that Poe engaged in “an almost chemical analysis of the soul and consciousness.” It’s true that his art was scientific, in a way. At times this was explicit, as in his science-fiction tales that took the form of  medical case histories, or  travelogues and  news reports about ballooning. But as a critic, too, Poe searched for meaning in mechanics. He often railed against Romantic verse and the Boston clique of transcendentalists with their Yoda-like adherence to the sanctity of nature. In print, he called Ralph Waldo Emerson ( one of this magazine’s co-founders) a “mystic for mysticism’s sake” and James Russell Lowell ( this magazine’s first editor) “a fanatic for the sake of fanaticism.” Poe also provoked his readers with disquisitions on the technological basis for his literary work, laying out how he would take a poem “step by step, to its completion, with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.”</p><p> D. H. Hawrence曾经说过，PoE从事“对灵魂和意识的几乎化学分析”。他的艺术是科学的，在某种程度上是真实的。有时这是明确的，就像他认为医疗案例历史的形式的科幻故事，或旅游和新闻报道关于膨胀的。但作为评论家，PoE也在力学中寻找意义。他经常冒险反对浪漫的诗歌和波士顿集团的超越者，他们对自然的神圣性的尤达粘附。在印刷中，他叫Ralph Waldo Emerson（这个杂志的联合创始人之一）一个“神秘主义的神秘主义者的缘故”和詹姆斯·拉塞尔·洛厄尔（这个杂志的第一个编辑）“为了狂热的狂热者而言。” PoE还挑衅了他的读者，以提示他的文学作品的技术基础，制定了如何将一首诗“一步一步地完成，以完成数学问题的精确和刚性后果。”</p><p>  Yet promoting and defending science, as Poe often did, could be a tricky matter. The word  scientist wasn’t coined until 1833, Tresch notes, and the American research community lacked formal leadership and guidance. Some of Poe’s contemporaries—including another former student from West Point, Alexander Dallas Bache—aimed to fix this problem. Science should be standardized and federalized, Bache insisted, and put to public use. To this end, he and his colleagues drafted scientific safety regulations for boilers and flues; they established networks for observing weather and the stars; they tried to strengthen science education.</p><p>  然而，促进和捍卫科学，因为PoE经常做了，可能是一个棘手的事情。科学家在1833年，Threcch Notes和美国研究界缺乏正式的领导和指导方面。一些Poe的同时代人 - 包括来自West Point的另一名前学生，Alexander Dallas Bache  - 旨在解决这个问题。科学应该是标准化和联邦化的，Bache坚持，并提出公共使用。为此，他和他的同事为锅炉和烟道制定了科学安全法规;他们建立了观察天气和星星的网络;他们试图加强科学教育。 </p><p> Central to their project was the invention of a new, rational elite—an  authority for science. Bache and his peers saw a landscape of untamed infotainment in America, where charlatans gathered paying crowds for old-timey TED Talks with magic-lantern slides. “We must put down quackery or quackery will put down science,” Bache told the electromagnetism expert Joseph Henry. So the two devised an “aristocratical” (Henry’s word) regime of oversight, which in 1848 became the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p><p>他们的项目核心是一种新的理性精英的发明。 Bache和他的同龄人在美国看到了一个未被DIOK的信息娱乐的景观，Charlatans聚集了与魔术灯笼幻灯片的旧时代谈话的人群。 “我们必须放下古宗或古怪会放下科学，”巴赫告诉电磁专家约瑟夫亨利。因此，这两个设计了“贵族”（亨利的话）监督制度，1848年成为美国科学进步的美国协会。</p><p> Poe subscribed to their endeavor on the whole, and supported its particulars in print. But he also chafed at the strictures of empiricism and its delimited scope. Tresch describes his tendency to champion research at the quackish margins—claiming, in one case, that phrenology had “assumed the majesty of a science; and, as a science, ranks among the most important.” He seemed just as taken with the life-force theories of the mesmerists. He was as obsessed as they were, Tresch writes, with “the shadowy relations between matter and spirit, observation and imagination.”</p><p> PoE在整体上订阅了他们的努力，并支持其印刷的详细资料。但他还在经验主义的狭窄和界定范围内烹调。 Treesch描述了他对酷刑的冠军研究的倾向，在一种情况下，孕丙化“假设科学陛下”;作为一种科学，跻身最重要的排名。“他似乎与乳房家的生命力理论一样。他是迷人，因为他们是培训，并“物质与精神，观察和想象之间的阴影关系。”</p><p>  Indeed, the dialogue between the two men in the cottage of “The Sphinx” plays out across Poe’s work—in his fiction and essays alike. In places, he will take the part of the relative, debunking and dismissive—the sort of guy who’d write a book about more than 200 types of seashells. Elsewhere, he’s instead that story’s narrator, hitching flights of fancy—and mystical revelations—to the scientific method.</p><p>  实际上，两名男子在“狮身人面像”的两名男子之间的对话横穿Poe的工作，他的小说和散文相似。在地方，他将参加相对，揭穿和不屑一顾的部分 - 那种撰写大约200多种贝壳类型的书。在其他地方，他代替故事的叙述者，搭便车的叙述者，搭便车和神秘的启示 - 科学方法。</p><p> Often he played both parts at once. His paeans to the scientific method, as in the essay likening poetry to mathematics, dangled weirdly on the edge of spoof. They can be read in earnest, or as caricature. Or, Tresch suggests, they can be seen as endorsements of a synthesis of science and Romanticism, in which perfect, sublime laws of nature—and perfect, sublime laws of verse—are set in motion (in the manner of the divine watchmaker) by an all-supreme creative force.</p><p> 他经常立刻玩两个部分。他的赞助科学方法，如在论文中喜欢诗歌到数学，奇怪地摇晃着欺骗的边缘。他们可以认真阅读或作为漫画。或者，培训表明，他们可以被视为综合科学和浪漫主义的认可，其中完美，崇高的自然法则 - 和完善的诗歌 - 诗歌（以神圣腕表）的方式设置一个全日欲的创造力。</p><p> This same interpretation helps illuminate one of Poe’s final works, an esoteric treatise on cosmology called   Eureka: An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe. Scholars have long debated whether this, like many of his other writings, was meant to be a hoax. Certainly it’s ironic, satirical, and silly. (The essay starts with fragments of a letter written in the year 2848.) But it also holds some striking scientific intuitions—Poe describes a collapse of space and time, for instance, and a universe that begins with a “primordial particle” exploding in all directions. Poe himself insisted that the essay should be taken as a “poem,” and he believed that it was a work of genius. “I have no desire to live since I have done ‘Eureka,’ ” he wrote to his aunt Maria in the summer of 1849. “I could accomplish nothing more.”</p><p> 同样的解释有助于照亮PoE的最终作品之一，这是一个叫做Eureka的宇宙学的宇宙论文：关于材料和精神宇宙的一篇文章。学者是否长期以来争论，如同许多其他着作，这是一个骗局。当然，这是讽刺，讽刺和愚蠢的。 （论文从2848年写的一封信的碎片开始。）但它也持有一些引人注目的科学直觉 -  PoE描述了空间和时间的崩溃，例如，以“原始粒子”开头的宇宙八方。我自己坚持认为，这篇文章应该被视为“诗”，他认为这是天才的工作。 “自从我做'eureka'以来，我没有渴望生活，”“他在1849年夏天写信给他的阿姨玛丽亚。”我什么都不能完成。“</p><p> By that point, though, Poe’s wretched tendency to “sip the juice” had derailed his every opportunity, and he found himself in Philadelphia, deranged and destitute, as a second wave of cholera crashed across the Eastern Seaboard. His debunker aspect was no more. Around this time he had an evil vision, not unlike the one he’d given to the narrator of “The Sphinx” just a few years earlier: He told a friend he’d seen a monstrous black bird flying above the city, spreading its wings so wide that a shadow fell upon the streets below, and from this bird’s feathers, big, inky drops began to fall in a pestilential rain. The bird turned its beak toward Poe and screeched, “ I am the Cholera.” Poe was dead, from unknown causes, a few months later.</p><p> 但是，虽然，Poe的可怜的悲惨倾向于“啜饮果汁”逐渐推出了他的每一个机会，他发现自己在费城，疯狂和贫困，作为一波霍乱坠毁的东部海岸。他的揭露方面不再。在这次他周围有一个邪恶的愿景，并不像他刚才刚才给“狮身人面像”叙述者的那个愿景：他告诉一位朋友，他看到了一个在城市之上飞行的怪物黑鸟，蔓延如此宽阔的翅膀，阴影落在下面的街道上，从这个鸟的羽毛，大，墨水的滴滴开始落在矛雨中。这只鸟把喙转向poe并尖叫着，“我是霍乱。”几个月后，Poe已经死了，从未知的原因。</p><p> in the 1830s and ’40s, as last year for COVID-19, even basic scientific facts were in dispute.  The disease was new to North America and Europe, and scientists had yet to spot its causal agent on a slide. One prominent clinician pictured a swarm of “poisonous, invisible, aerial insects.” Only later did others find the bacterium  Vibrio cholerae with their microscopes.</p><p> 在1830年代和40年代，作为Covid-19的去年，即使是基本的科学事实也争议。该疾病是北美和欧洲的新疾病，科学家尚未在幻灯片上发现其因果因子。一个着名的临床医生描绘了一群“有毒，隐形，空中昆虫”的群。唯一的别人才发现与他们的显微镜一起发现细菌霍乱。 </p><p> And what about contagion? Did the plague fan out through vapor, as Poe’s story hints with “the very air … redolent with death,” or was it waterborne instead? Should the sick be doused with brandy, or rubbed with cayenne pepper, or given enemas of tobacco smoke? Even efforts to self-isolate—flights of terror to the Hudson Valley—were dismissed by certain scientific journals of the time as needless and irrational, and the source of much more harm than good.</p><p>传染怎么样？瘟疫是否通过蒸气扇出来了，因为Poe的故事提示“非常厌恶死亡，”或者是水性的吗？生病是否应该用白兰地煮沸，或用辣椒擦拭，或者给予烟草烟雾的灌肠？即使是对哈德森谷的自我隔离飞行的努力 - 被某些科学期刊的恐怖遗憾地被忽视，这是不必要的和不合理的，而且弊大于良好。</p><p> Doctors,  leading doctors, disagreed on all these details, and when public-health officials tried to suss out the consensus view—when they deferred to expertise—many of their policies were wrong.</p><p> 主导医生，在所有这些细节中不同意，当公立卫生官员试图讨论共识看法 - 当他们推迟到专业知识 - 他们的许多政策都是错误的。</p><p>  It was Poe’s contemporary, and in temperament his mirror image, who brought some light to this confusion. In 1854, the British physician John Snow demonstrated, through a stunning feat of epidemiological reasoning, that cholera was spread through tainted water. Now he’s taken as a scientific hero. Last autumn, when a coterie of academic experts—today’s aristocratical elite, speaking for science as an institution—attacked the Trump administration’s view of herd immunity, they called their statement of dissent the “ John Snow Memorandum.”</p><p>  这是Poe的当代，在气质他的镜像，谁给这种混乱带来了一些光芒。 1854年，英国医师约翰雪通过流行病学推理的惊人壮举，霍乱蔓延到污染水中。现在他被视为一个科学英雄。去年秋季，当学术专家的Coterie  - 今天的贵族精英时，为科学发言为一个机构袭击了特朗普政府的畜牧业的观点，他们称他们对“约翰雪议员”的异议陈述。</p><p> But Snow’s own views about disease, and the theory that he proved with data, were guided by his passions too. If he blamed polluted water for the cholera pandemic, it was at least in part because he was so pious, mystical—even quackish—in his faith in water’s healing power. While Poe dissolved in alcohol,  Snow became a fervent teetotaler, preaching about “the water which comes gurgling from the hills in unrivalled softness and purity.” In speeches, he would frame this notion in Romantic terms, linking water to “the unassisted powers of nature inherent in the body.”</p><p> 但是雪对疾病的看法，以及他证明数据的理论也被他的激情引导了。如果他归咎于霍乱大流行的污染水，它至少部分是因为他是如此虔诚，神秘 - 甚至甚至在他对水的愈合力量的信念中。虽然PoE溶解在酒精中，但雪成为了一个热情的故事，讲道“从山上从山上带来无与伦比的柔软性和纯洁的水。”在演讲中，他将在浪漫的术语中框架这个概念，将水与“身体固有的自然的自然能力”。</p><p> Snow was right about the source of cholera; his work saved countless lives. But this science couldn’t have happened by itself. It did not proceed, like Poe’s imagined poem, “step by step, to its completion, with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.” Nor, of course, has the science of our pandemic proceeded that way. We’re still responding to  impressions of the data, and crude measurements of propinquity. Witness all the experts’ flip-flops and mistakes since the spring of 2020: on face masks, dexamethasone, asymptomatic and aerosol transmission, convalescent plasma, and the rest.</p><p> 雪人是对霍乱来源的权利;他的工作挽救了无数的生命。但这种科学本身就不会发生。它没有像Poe的想象的诗一样继续，“一步一步地完成，以数学问题的精确和刚性后果。”当然，也不是我们流行的科学就此进行了这种方式。我们仍然响应数据的印象，并粗略测量的预言。目睹了自2020年春天以来的所有专家的触发器和错误：面部面膜，地塞米松，无症状和气溶胶传输，康复等离子体，其余的。</p><p> “The Sphinx” reminds us that scientific revelation distorts and magnifies in equal measure, and that it must be understood, in part, through intuition. What, then, does it mean to “follow the science,” as we like to say today?
