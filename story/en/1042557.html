He was a literary novelist and also the writer of enduring, noir thrillers; he wrote many films – including perhaps the greatest classic of English cinema in the shape of  The Third Man – and most of his novels were adapted for the screen. But he was also a playwright whose work was produced in the West End and on Broadway. He was a film critic and a literary journalist; he was a great booster of writers he admired. He was a publisher and a spy. He had a serendipitous knack of being in the right place at the right time and the articles he wrote – about American subversion in Vietnam, about Castro, about Mafia corruption on the Côte d’Azur – created scandals and shifted political opinions. Greene was a compulsive letter writer and a sometime poet. He enjoyed entering literary competitions, often parodying his own work. In 1949 he entered a contest held by the  New Statesman – where the demand was to write the notional opening of a Graham Greene novel – and didn’t win outright: he shared the six-guinea prize with five others. However, Greene’s opening paragraphs were so intriguing that a friend who was a film producer asked him to expand on them. The storyline was eventually adapted into one of the best films based on Greene’s work,  The Stranger’s Hand (1954) starring Trevor Howard and Alida Valli. Greene made many thousands of pounds from the adaptation – such are the serendipitous reimbursements from entering literary competitions. Richard Greene ranks the film highly, almost up there with  The Third Man. [See also:  Joni Mitchell: “I know what I want and I’m not afraid to stand up for it”] Another near-contemporary and equivalent polymath with energy to spare was Anthony Burgess. Burgess and Greene had a somewhat combative relationship. Burgess lived in Monte Carlo while Greene lived in Antibes. Burgess, born a Catholic in working-class Manchester, had the cradle-Catholic’s sardonic suspicion of the zeal and devotion of the convert. It’s a matter of some note that three of our greatest 20th century novelists – Greene, Evelyn Waugh and Muriel Spark – all converted to Catholicism. Waugh was genuinely devout – his faith was his safety net, his life-raft. But I’ve long struggled with Greene and Spark’s declared belief in a supernatural being. It has always struck me as both conveniently useful to them as writers and fundamentally bogus. However, the other revelation of Richard Greene’s biography is that, having converted to Catholicism in order to marry his wife, Vivien, Greene’s faith, while it wavered from time to time – he made a nice distinction between “faith” and “belief” – was a remarkable constant in the ups and downs of his life. He went to mass, he received the sacrament, Roman Catholic priests were close friends. On his deathbed he had a Catholic priest read him the last rites. Anton Chekhov once declared that he could never understand how an intelligent person could believe in a god – an opinion I share. Greene’s agonised personal life, however, was not noticeably inhibited by the injunctions of his faith. Richard Greene recounts one particularly complicated situation in 1952. Greene’s relationship with the wealthy American beauty Catherine Walston – the second longest love affair of his life – was going through one of its regular rough patches. Both Walston and Greene were married, and both spouses were fully aware of their partners’ long-term infidelity. Greene, moreover, was having another affair simultaneously and so was Walston. Greene found out who her lover was – it happened to be a close friend of his called Thomas Gilbey, who also happened to be a Dominican priest, sworn to celibacy, of course. If one’s faith can survive this kind of devastating train-wreck of competing emotional and moral values then it is indeed enduring. *** Such is the mass of material thrown up by a full account of Graham Greene’s intensely complicated, seemingly non-stop life, that occasionally one is aware of Richard Greene’s mild desperation as he has to rather gallop through the narrative. There is a wonderful throwaway line about Greene’s 1938 visit to Mexico, a visit that produced not only  The Lawless Roads, his non-fiction account of the religious repression in the country, but also  The ­Power and The Glory, his famous novel about a “whisky” priest. Richard Greene relates how, when arriving in Mexico City, Greene “made visits to a brothel and a monastery”. That’s all the information we are supplied with but, in a singular way, the juxtaposition is a potent summation of Greene’s life and, indeed, of his work. As Greene once said, quoting Robert Browning’s poem “Bishop Blougram’s Apology”, our “interest’s on the dangerous edge of things/The ­honest thief, the tender murderer… We watch while these in equilibrium keep/The ­giddy line midway”. It is precisely this seeming antipathy, this ­apparently ­irresolvable ­disequilibrium ­between the earthy and the sublime, between the flesh and the spirit, that makes his novels so controversially appealing. *** I once gave a paper at a Graham Greene conference called “An Atheist Reads  The Heart of the Matter”. The novel is one of my all-time favourites, and a great novel of Africa, but its denouement and climax are near-incomprehensible to me. At the end of the novel, the troubled policeman Scobie feels he has to commit suicide – and duly does so – because he has gone to church and taken the sacrament without receiving ­absolution and is, as a result, committing a mortal sin. Therefore he would go to hell. Committing suicide, also a mortal sin, would send him to hell as well – but, as it’s ­already his destination, it doesn’t matter if he kills himself. [See also:  Rediscovering an unsentimental World War Two memoir] True catharsis is only available, I argued, to someone who actually believes in this mumbo-jumbo. The non-believing reader is left disappointed and baffled. Yet the ­novel triumphantly survives its tacked-on religiosity as so many of Greene’s great ­novels do. The brothel/monastery juxtaposition, as we might term it, somehow allows both categories to coexist, however uneasily, and each category avoids cancelling the other out in both the life and the work. Greene is allowed his cake and the eating of it. Yvonne Cloetta perhaps came to know Greene better than anyone. Their relationship lasted over 25 years until his death – she was married, herself, and Greene’s wife, Vivien, always refused to divorce him – so they were never able formally to become husband and wife. Cloetta had this to say about Greene: “People often called him ‘The hunted man’, but he was only hunted by himself, a victim of the traps that, unconsciously or not, he had set up around himself.” It seems a fitting epitaph for this most mysterious of men.  William Boyd’s new novel, “Trio”, is published by Viking Russian Roulette: The Life and Times of Graham Greene 	Richard Greene   Little, Brown, 608pp, £25</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/Russian-roulette-life-times-graham-greene-new-biography-richard-review">https://www.newstatesman.com/Russian-roulette-life-times-graham-greene-new-biography-richard-review</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/揭露/">#揭露</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/graham/">#graham</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
