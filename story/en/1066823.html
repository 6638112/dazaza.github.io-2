While still in police custody, an out-of-hours forensic psychiatric assessment had been requested.</p><p>e ven在SEB抵达监狱之前，第一次访问前五周，工作人员收到了一个通知，他应该受到密切监测。虽然仍处于警察监护权，但已要求一项小时的法医精神病学评估。</p><p> Seb had been compliant with the arresting officers, but he had given the impression that he was unconcerned by what had happened – it seemed as though he didn’t mind at all that he was being arrested. More bizarrely, there were flickers of apparent self-satisfaction. Seb had been arrested on suspicion of murdering his mother.</p><p> SEB一​​直符合逮捕的官员，但他曾给人的印象是，他被发生的事情漠不关心 - 似乎他根本不介意他被捕。更奇怪，有明显的自我满足的闪烁。 SEB因涉嫌谋杀母亲而被捕。</p><p>  A nurse and the on-call doctor from the local forensic unit travelled to the police station, but Seb declined to come out of the cell to speak to them. Accompanied by police officers, the clinicians went to his cell to speak to him directly, but whatever they said, Seb stuck to the same line: he had nothing to say to them. He even resisted attempts to be drawn into casual conversation. The clinicians, along with the on-call consultant, agreed that Seb did not require admission to hospital. Having said that, this reticence, along with the particulars of the crime Seb had committed, left the assessors reluctant to rule out psychiatric issues completely.</p><p>  来自当地法医单位的护士和随叫随到的医生前往派出所，但SEB拒绝走出牢房谈到他们。陪同警察陪同，临床医生去了他的牢房直接与他说话，但无论他们说什么，SEB都坚持同一条线：他无话可说。他甚至抵制了被吸引到随意的谈话的尝试。临床医生以及随叫随到的顾问同意SEB不需要入院。话虽如此，这种紧迫症以及犯罪特点犯下了犯罪，使评估员不愿意完全排除精神病问题。</p><p> The next morning the doctor who had assessed Seb in the police station called the prison mental health team to recommend that, on arrival, he should be admitted to the healthcare wing for further monitoring. From their observations, the officers and nurses also felt that Seb was not quite right, though they found it difficult to put their finger on precisely why they felt that way. He kept a distance from everyone. When he spoke, he used as few words as possible to make his point, which was either a specific request – such as for clean towels – or more often to decline offers of help or support from the staff.</p><p> 第二天早上，在警察局评估了SEB的医生叫监狱心理健康团队建议，在抵达时，他应该进入医疗保健机翼进一步监测。从他们的观察中，官员和护士也觉得SEB并不是正确的，尽管他们发现很难将手指恰恰恰到好切地把他们的手指放在那样。他远远距离每个人。当他发言时，他用了尽可能少的单词来制作他的观点，这是一个特定的请求 - 例如清洁毛巾 - 或者更频繁地拒绝工作人员的帮助或支持。</p><p> He did not want to come out of the cell for meals or to relax in the day room. He seemed to be eating and sleeping well, and although he avoided contact, if they spoke to him he was not noticeably irritable and there had not been any aggression. That was, until the second night.</p><p> 他不想从咖啡中出去吃饭或在日间放松。他似乎正在吃得好，虽然他避免接触，如果他们与他说话，他并不明显烦躁，并且没有任何侵略。那是，直到第二天。</p><p>  Just before the end of her long shift, one of the nurses went to check on Seb. She found him leaning on his sink looking into the small wall-mounted mirror. At first glance there was nothing unusual. During the debrief later, the nurse recalled that it was slightly odd that he did not react at all to her presence, but at the time she thought there was a mundane explanation; he seemed lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>  就在她长期前结束之前，其中一名护士去了Seb。她发现他靠在他的水槽上看着小壁挂式镜子。乍一看，没有任何罕见的事情。在塞布里后来，护士回忆说，他对她的存在并没有反应略显奇怪，但在她认为有一个平凡的解释时;他似乎迷失在自己的想法中。</p><p> With only one foot in his cell, the nurse tried to get Seb’s attention by calling his name. Then it was a bit of a blur. He must have sprung towards her and, as she made to leave the cell, wrapped his forearm around her neck, pulling her back. The staff heard her shout out, and the sound of her alarm, which she had activated by pressing the red button on her belt radio.</p><p> 只有一只脚在他的细胞中，护士试图通过致电他的名字来获得Seb的注意力。然后它有点模糊。他一定要向她涌现，并且当她留下了牢房时，把他的前臂包裹在脖子上，拉回她。工作人员听到她的喊叫，以及她的警报声，她通过按皮带收音机上的红色按钮激活。 </p><p> Fortunately, it was only a few steps from the nurses’ office to Seb’s cell, but they were not expecting the strength with which Seb fought against their attempts to release his arm from their colleague’s neck. A prison officer who arrived at the scene admitted that he felt he had no choice but to hit Seb on the head. With the help of officers who had run from other wings in response to the alarm, they were able to free the nurse and lock Seb back in his cell.</p><p>幸运的是，这只是护士办公室到Seb的细胞的几步之遥，但他们并没有期望Seb的力量与他们的同事颈部释放他的手臂。到达现场的监狱官员承认他觉得他别无选择，只能在头上击中皮革。借助从其他翅膀跑的官员的帮助下，他们能够释放护士并锁定他的细胞。</p><p> After what was regarded as an attempted hostage-taking incident on the healthcare wing, Seb was assessed as too dangerous to remain there, and so when I visited him, I made my way to the segregation unit.</p><p> 在被认为是在医疗保健机翼上发生的企图造成的劫持人物之后，SEB被评估为仍然仍然存在危险，所以当我访问他时，我才能让我走向隔离单位。</p><p>  I  specialise in forensic psychiatry, a branch of medicine that deals with the assessment and treatment of offenders in prisons and secure hospitals, many of whom exhibit violent behaviour. I had been asked by Seb’s legal team to offer an expert opinion on his mental state at the time of the offence. (To maintain patient confidentiality, Seb is not his real name and other identifiers have been altered.)</p><p>  我专注于法医精神病学，一个医学分支，涉及监狱和安全医院的罪犯的评估和治疗，其中许多人都表现出暴力行为。 SEB的法律团队在犯罪时向SEB的法律团队提出了专家意见。 （为了保持患者保密，SEB不是他的真名，其他标识符已被改变。）</p><p> As a regular visitor,  I knew the atmosphere on the unit was completely unpredictable; it could at times be eerily quiet, but frequently I had arrived in the “seg” to a cacophony of screams, shouts, howls and shuddering bangs that were made all the more unnerving by the sources of the noise being out of sight. The only opportunity for the residents of the bleak, single-occupancy cells to interact face to face with their fellow inmates was during their brief allotted time for exercise in individual caged pods running outside half the length of the building.</p><p> 作为普通访客，我知道该单位的气氛完全不可预测;它有时可能是令人惊叹的安静，但我经常到了“SEG”到了一个尖叫声，喊叫，Howls和颤抖的刘海，这些爆炸的噪音的来源更加不受影响。沉闷居民的唯一机会，单人入住的细胞与他们的同囚犯相互作用，在他们的短暂规定的时间内，在跑在建筑物的长度以外的一半以上的单个笼罩的吊舱中。</p><p> Otherwise, communication was mostly done by shouting indiscriminately across the central space of the unit. Sometimes these were calls to welcome a new arrival who was in their fold, or to threaten ones who were not. Alternatively, the focus of their attention could be the officers; either to plead for something, or announce their aggressive intentions.</p><p> 否则，通过在单元的中央空间上不分青红皂井来呼喊来进行沟通。有时这些是呼吁欢迎一个新的抵达，他们折叠，或者威胁那些没有的人。或者，他们的注意力可能是军官;要么恳求某些东西，要么宣布他们的侵略性意图。</p><p> Visitors to the unit often provoked renewed excitement. I used to wonder how the prisoners who already knew me could tell when I came on the wing, despite the doors and hatches being firmly shut. They’d yell, “Dr Nathan, come here a minute, I need to speak to you,” just after I passed their door. I realised later that they could spy through the narrow slit between the heavy metal door and its frame. When other prisoners heard about the presence of a doctor, they would shout out that they were ill and needed to see me urgently. Some probably required medical attention. Most were suffering from extreme isolation and craved any sort of interaction. The calls tended to subside once I had passed along the unit, or they would turn into other pleas and threats, as if the existence of other people also reminded them of their desires and grievances.</p><p> 该单位的游客经常引起更新的兴奋。我曾经想知道囚犯已经知道我的囚犯是如何告诉我何时来到翼的时候，尽管门和舱口牢固地关闭。他们大喊大叫，“内森博士，这里来到这里，我需要和你说话，”就在我传过门之后。我稍后会意识到它们可以通过重金属门和框架之间的狭窄狭缝来窥探。当其他囚犯听到医生的存在时，他们会喊出他们生病并需要紧急见到我。有些可能需要医疗注意力。大多数人患有极端隔离并诱使任何类型的互动。一旦我沿着该单位传递，他们往后倾向于消退，或者他们会变成其他请求和威胁，仿佛其他人的存在也提醒他们的欲望和不满。</p><p>  Seb was on what the officers call a “three-officer unlock”. All segregation unit residents are only allowed out of their cells one at a time, but those who are considered particularly unpredictable, like Seb, require at least three officers to be on hand before the door to the cell can be opened.</p><p>  SEB是关于官员称之为“三名解锁”的东西。所有隔离单位居民只允许一次允许在他们的细胞中，但是那些被认为特别不可预测的人，如SEB，在可以打开电池门之前至少需要三名官员。 </p><p> But when we got to his cell, Seb had covered himself entirely with his blanket and remained still. When the officer opened the door and announced why we were there, there was no sign of a response. Feeling self-conscious about talking to a blanket in front of an audience of three officers and a trainee doctor, I introduced myself to Seb and said that I was there to see if there was anything else that could be done to help.</p><p>但是，当我们到他的牢房时，Seb却与他的毯子完全覆盖着自己，仍然仍然存在。当军官打开门并宣布为什么我们在那里时，没有答案的迹象。感到自我意识，在三名官员的观众面前和一个实习生医生的毯子上谈论，我向SEB介绍了SEB，并说我在那里看看是否有其他任何东西可以做到帮助。</p><p> In the silence waiting for a response, I scanned his cell for anything of significance. During assessments of prisoners in the segregation unit, I have often found their cells to be in a state of disarray. The floor may be sodden after the occupant has blocked their lavatory as an act of dissent. Messages may be scrawled on fragments of paper or other surfaces. On occasion, faeces have been smeared on the walls in what is called a “dirty protest”. There were no such signs in Seb’s cell. The very few possessions were arranged tidily on the floor against the furthest wall.</p><p> 在沉默等待回应中，我扫描了他的牢房以争论任何重要意义。在分离单位的囚犯评估期间，我经常发现他们的细胞处于混乱状态。乘员阻止他们作为异议的行为后，地板可能是脱水。消息可以在纸张或其他表面的碎片上储备。有时，粪便在被称为“肮脏抗议”的墙上涂抹在墙上。 Seb的细胞中没有这样的迹象。少数财产在地板上整齐地排列在最远的墙壁上。</p><p> As a last attempt to get his attention, the lead officer told Seb that soon there would not be another chance to speak to a doctor. It had no effect. Seb remained silent. Maintaining the direction of my gaze towards Seb, I carefully stepped backward out of the cell.</p><p> 作为最后一次尝试引起他的注意，主任官员告诉SEB，很快就会有没有又有机会与医生发言。它没有效果。 SEB保持沉默。将我的凝视的方向保持在SEB，我仔细地走出了细胞。</p><p> My role in visiting prisoners like Seb is to help his legal team establish a picture of the defendant’s mind so they can decide what plea he should enter. When I began practising forensic psychiatry 23 years ago, I quickly learned that anticipating questions that lawyers would ask required me to start thinking more deeply about the patient’s mind than my psychiatric training had prepared me for. The court may be willing to take account of my evidence about the role of an unfortunate upbringing, or birth trauma on the actions of the defendant, but they would also need to hear how those particular factors are relevant – why their mental processes led them to commit this particular crime.</p><p> 我在参观等囚犯的角色是为了帮助他的法律团队建立一张被告的思想的照片，以便他们可以决定他应该进入的内容。当我开始练习法医精神病学到23年前时，我很快了解到，预期律师会要求我开始更深入地思考患者的思想，而不是我的精神科训练准备了我的问题。法院可能愿意考虑我对不幸的成长或出生创伤对被告的行动作用的证据，但他们还需要听到这些特定因素是相关的 - 为什么他们的精神过程导致他们犯下这个特殊的罪行。</p><p> Once I extended my practice beyond working on criminal trials and began appearing as an expert witness in family courts and in other types of legal proceedings, the limitations of an explanation based on a diagnosis or a list of causal factors became clear. It would be of little assistance to the family courts in deciding about the safe care of a child if I were to just present symptom names and the associated diagnostic label. From my assessment, I need to acquire an understanding of that person’s subjective experience – their thoughts, feelings, emotions, perceptions – so that I can try to explain not only why they had behaved as they had, but also the circumstances that may increase the chances they would behave in that way again.</p><p> 一旦我延长了除刑事审判的实践之外，并开始出现在家庭法院的专家见证人以及其他类型的法律程序中，就是基于诊断或因果因素清单的解释的局限性变得清晰。如果我只是呈现症状名称和相关的诊断标签，这将对家庭法院的援助很少。从我的评估来看，我需要获得对该人的主观经历的理解 - 他们的想法，感受，情感，感知 - 因此，我不仅可以解释为什么他们的表现，而且可能增加的情况他们的机会再次表现得其。</p><p>  S eb’s solicitor had requested an opinion on whether his client’s mental state at the time of the offence amounted to insanity. The day after my unsuccessful assessment, I called his solicitor to let him know that Seb had refused to speak to me. Although the recent dramatic transformation of his personality with the development of eccentric behaviour, uncharacteristic violence and brooding reserve pointed to a “disease of the mind”, until I could communicate with him, I was unable to determine whether that had caused him to not know what he was doing when he attacked his mother.</p><p>  SEB的律师已向犯罪时曾令人生畏，要求他是否对其客户的精神状态达成意见。在我不成功的评估后的一天，我叫他的律师让他知道SEB拒绝与我说话。虽然最近对他个性的巨大变革与偏心行为的发展，一方面的暴力和育雏储备指出了一个“心灵的疾病”，直到我可以与他沟通，我无法确定是否导致他不知道当他袭击他的母亲时，他正在做什么。</p><p> Seb was not completely mute, but there was good reason to doubt his ability to make a proper defence to the charge of murder. My impression was that he was not being deliberately obstructive. I needed to come to a view on whether he could properly engage in the criminal proceedings; in other words, was he fit to plead? The final decision rests with the judge, having considered the evidence of two doctors. I filed my report to the solicitors stating that he was, in my opinion, unfit to plead.</p><p> 皮革没有完全静音，但有充分的理由怀疑他对谋杀罪的适当辩护的能力。我的印象是他没有故意阻碍。我需要来看看是否能够正确地参与刑事诉讼;换句话说，他是否适合恳求？最终决定与法官依赖，考虑了两位医生的证据。我向律师提起了报告，说明他是，在我看来，他不适合恳求。 </p><p> Until Seb agreed to speak, I was not going to be able to understand his mind. All the same, I was not content for him to stay in prison. There was enough evidence to make a case for assessment and treatment in hospital. Following liaison with a suitably secure forensic hospital and written recommendations to the Ministry of Justice, a warrant was issued for transfer.</p><p>直到SEB同意发言，我并没有能够理解他的思想。一切都一样，我没有满足于他留在监狱里。有足够的证据来在医院进行评估和治疗案例。在对司法部的适当安全的法医院和书面建议与司法部进行联络后，颁发了一项逮捕令。</p><p> By the time we next met, six weeks later, Seb had been moved to a forensic hospital. I was reintroduced to him by a ward nurse who escorted him to the interview room. Before even having a chance to check whether he was any more communicative, I could see a change in his appearance. Many, but not necessarily all, of my patients who experience distressing psychotic experiences seem to gain significant benefit from antipsychotic medication, although unfortunately these often have side effects including weight gain. From Seb’s heavier appearance, I suspected that he had been started on anti-psychotic medication.</p><p> 当我们下次遇到的时候，六周后，SEB已被搬到法医院。我被护送到他的访谈室陪同他的病房护士向他重新引入了他。在甚至有机会检查他是否有更多交际，我可以看到他的外表变化。许多但不一定是全部，我的患者体验令人痛苦的精神病经历似乎从抗精神病药体中获得显着的益处，尽管遗憾的是这些通常具有重量增益的副作用。从Seb的较重的外表，我怀疑他已经开始抗精神病药物。</p><p> He told me that several months before his arrest he had started to feel overcome with waves of unease, which developed into a more relentless sense of foreboding and dread. Things around him didn’t feel right. People had a dreamlike aura about them. He questioned whether they were who he thought they were. Then Seb’s thoughts crystallised. It dawned on him that he was surrounded by imposters. The woman masquerading as his mother looked and behaved like her in every respect, but he could not shake his conviction that she was a charlatan, and that this imposter was involved in the abduction of his real mother. The usurper, who had cleverly adopted all his mother’s characteristics, vehemently repudiated his allegations.</p><p> 他告诉我，在他逮捕之前几个月开始感受到不安的浪潮克服，这促进了更加不懈的令人不受欢迎和恐惧感。周围的事情并不对。人们对他们有一个梦幻般的光环。他质疑他们是否认为他们是谁。然后Seb的思想结晶了。它恍然大悟，他被驾驶员包围着。伪装成他母亲的女人看起来像是在各方面都表现得像她一样，但他无法动摇他是一个夏尔兰的信念，而这位冒名将参与他真正的母亲的绑架。聪明地采用了他所有母亲的特色，激动地拒绝了他的指控。</p><p> He explained to me that he interpreted her protestations as a sign of how desperate she was to maintain the fraud. His tone became more earnest as he spoke about the offence, but he did not become overtly emotional. (It was as if his memory was not yet fully infused with emotion – whereas his words acknowledged responsibility for carrying out the offence, his tone was that of an objective spectator.) Seb had felt that his options were narrowing. He could not leave the charade unchallenged, but revealing to the imposter that he knew the truth could imperil his true mother. He wrestled with himself before the night when he finally stabbed the woman he believed was not his mother while she slept.</p><p> 他向我解释说，他将她的抗议解释为她认为欺诈的绝望的标志。当他谈到罪行时，他的语气变得更加认真，但他没有明显的情感。 （就好像他的记忆尚未充分融入情感 - 而他的话就是承认执行犯罪的责任，他的语气是一个客观观众。）SEB已经觉得他的选择是缩小的。他无法留下秩序，但揭示了他知道真相可能会威胁他真正的母亲。当他终于刺伤的那个女人睡觉时，他在夜晚摔跤就在夜晚摔跤。当她睡觉时，他认为不是他的母亲。</p><p> Seb took the failure of his real mother to reappear to be a sign that the conspiracy ran deeper than he had previously thought. He decided that the best course of action was to avoid talking to anyone about what he knew. On the whole, he could suppress signs of his simmering frustration, but occasionally it became too much to bear – such as after the first couple of days on the healthcare wing, when he grabbed the nurse.</p><p> SEB取得了他真正的母亲重新出现了一个迹象，即阴谋跑得比他以前想过的更深。他决定最好的行动方案是避免与任何人交谈他所知道的东西。总的来说，他可以抑制他煨挫折的迹象，但偶尔会有太多的才能忍受 - 例如在医疗保健翼的前几天之后，当他抓住护士时。</p><p> The way Seb spoke to me showed that he was able to stand back from his former conspiracy-obsessed existence and question the veracity of his beliefs. I asked him when his perspective changed. He said he had acquired his new insights several weeks after his admission, around the same time that he started taking antipsychotic medication.</p><p> Sebab对我说话的方式表明，他能够从他以前的阴谋痴迷的存在并质疑他信仰的真实性。当他的观点发生变化时，我问他。他说他在入场后几周内获得了新的见解，同时他开始服用抗精神病药。</p><p>  There was agreement about Seb’s diagnosis. The presence of delusions in the absence of other psychotic symptoms such as voices or visions encouraged a diagnosis of delusional disorder, which falls within the same category as schizophrenia. There was also a term for the specific type of experience he had: Capgras syndrome, named after Joseph Capgras, who described the case of a middle-aged woman from Paris who, in June 1918, visited the local police commissioner to ask for two officers to accompany her and witness the evidence of a widespread crime. She reported that children were being illegally confined across Paris, including in the basement of her house. The police took her to an infirmary, from where she was admitted to Sainte-Anne mental asylum.</p><p>  有关SEB诊断的协议。在没有其他精神病症状的情况下存在妄想，如声音或视觉，鼓励患有妄想障碍的诊断，这落入与精神分裂症相同的类别。他有一个术语，他有一个特定类型的经验：Capgras综合征，以Joseph Capgras命名，他描述了来自巴黎的中年妇女的案例，1918年6月，参观了当地警察专员要求两名官员陪伴她并见证了广泛犯罪的证据。她报告说，孩子们在巴黎非法局限于，包括在她家的地下室。警察从她送到Sainte-Anne Menents Asylum的地方带来了一个医务室。 </p><p> After about a year, she was transferred to another asylum, Maison Blanche. There she came to the attention of Capgras, a psychiatrist who was interested in the themes of substitutions and disappearances that ran through her delusional beliefs. She believed she had been the victim of an abduction, and that she and others had identical doubles. She thought that “the theatre played out by these doubles is unbelievable”. With a colleague, the psychiatrist published a report on this case, which they termed  illusion des sosies, or illusion of doubles.</p><p>经过大约一年后，她被转移到另一个庇护，Maison Blanche。她在那里引起了Capgras，这是一个对替换和失踪的主题感兴趣的精神科医生，这是通过她妄想的信仰。她相信她一直是绑架的受害者，而且她和其他人的双打相同。她以为“这些双打戏剧的剧院是令人难以置信的”。与同事们，精神科医生在此案例上发表了一份报告，他们称之为幻觉Des Sosies，或双打幻觉。</p><p> My medical training had taught me that, having found a term for a patient’s condition and one for his symptoms, I had achieved sufficient understanding and the assessment was complete. But these terms only describe, they do not explain.</p><p> 我的医疗训练教会了我，找到了患者的病情一词，一个是他的症状，我已经取得了足够的理解，并且评估完成了。但这些条款只描述，他们没有解释。</p><p> To get to the underlying mechanisms that explain why Seb was experiencing symptoms, we needed to listen in detail to exactly what he was saying.</p><p> 为了达到解释为什么SEB正在经历症状的潜在机制，我们需要详细倾听他所说的。</p><p>  K nowing a little about the workings of the brain could help us interpret Seb’s words. Seb claimed that the woman he killed appeared to have the same form as his mother, but a different identity. He acknowledged that he could not detect any difference in appearance between the imposter and his mother, but even so, he was sure this was not his mother.</p><p>  K现在一点关于大脑的工作可以帮助我们解释Seb的话。 SEB声称，他杀害的那个女人似乎与他的母亲相同，但具有不同的身份。他承认，他无法发现塞子和他的母亲之间的外表的任何差异，但即便如此，他确信这不是他的母亲。</p><p> We know from brain scans on both humans and other primates that recognising other people relies heavily on facial images, and involves a number of different brain pathways. Disruption in this neural network can interfere with a person’s ability to recognise the face of a familiar person, a condition that is known as prosopagnosia, literally meaning “face ignorance”.</p><p> 我们从脑扫描都知道人类和其他灵长类动物识别别人依赖面部图像，并涉及许多不同的脑途径。这种神经网络中断可能会干扰一个人识别熟悉的人的面孔的能力，这种状况被称为prosopagnosia，字面意思是“脸无知”。</p><p> Seb’s problem was not prosopagnosia. He could recognise the form of his mother’s face. It was her identity that he questioned. Before the definable paranoid beliefs took hold, his perception of the world was accompanied by a general sense of doubt. He emphasised feelings of unreality; he was sure of nothing. Seb could not grasp a clear meaning, but there was an undertone of danger.</p><p> SEB的问题不是prosopagnosia。他可以认识到母亲脸的形式。她质疑的是她的身份。在可定义的偏执信仰之前，他对世界的看法伴随着一般的怀疑感。他强调了不良的感情;他确信什么都不确定。 SEB无法掌握明确的意义，但有一个危险的危险。</p><p> Seb spoke of a jump from this early feeling of ambiguity and nebulous threat to the arrival of certainty. An idea came to him that helped resolve his confusion about the reality of the world around him (including his mother’s identity) and to him it was consistent with his conspiratorial feelings. But while this idea – that his mother had been replaced by an imposter – matched his reality, it was out of kilter with everyone else’s. And so, instead of rejecting the idea, Seb interpreted others’ actions in a way that supported this idea. The belief that his mother’s replacement was part of a wider plot gave meaning to his experiences and he selected evidence consistent with that meaning. In reaction to a loss of the sense of familiarity that had previously accompanied the visual image of his mother, Seb accepted a coherent yet false narrative.</p><p> SEB从这种早期的歧义感和模糊威胁到达确定性的威胁的跳跃跳跃。一个想法来到了他，帮助解决他对他周围世界的现实（包括他母亲的身份）和他的困惑，这与他的阴谋感受一致。但是，虽然这个想法 - 他的母亲被一个冒名顶替塞 - 匹配了他的现实，而其他所有人都没有千克。因此，而不是拒绝这个想法，SEB以支持这个想法的方式解释了其他人的行为。相信他母亲的替代是更广泛的情节的一部分，给出了他的经历，他选择了与这种意义一致的证据。在反应以前伴随着他母亲的视觉形象的熟悉程度的丧失，SEB接受了一个连贯但虚假的叙述。 </p><p> Neurobiological studies have improved our understanding of the origins of psychotic distortions of the sort experienced by Seb. But using only the language of brain chemicals and neuronal pathways is not sufficient. We have to retain the subjective perspective to truly understand human experience and behaviour. To explain violence, we must contextualise the physiology with psychological abstractions, such as impulses, urges and motives.</p><p>神经生物学研究改善了我们对SEB所经历的各种精神病扭曲的起源的理解。但仅使用脑化学品和神经元途径的语言是不够的。我们必须保留主观的视角，真正了解人类的经历和行为。为了解释暴力，我们必须以心理抽象（例如冲动，敦促和动机）为生理学。</p><p>  T he narrative that Seb had created was obviously a delusional one, but sometimes the basis of a narrative that supports a violent act is more difficult to judge. Most patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia are not violent. By chronicling forensic psychiatric cases, there is a risk of reinforcing the media cliche of the violent schizophrenic.</p><p>  他叙述了SEB所创造的显然是一个妄想的，但有时支持一个暴力行为的叙述的基础更难以判断。大多数诊断精神分裂症的患者都不是暴力的。通过编年灵性法医精神案例，存在增强剧中精神分裂症的媒体陈词滥调的风险。</p><p> On the contrary, my view is that such stereotypes are broken down by sympathetically examining real-life cases while emphasising their rarity. The diagnosis of schizophrenia relies in part on the identification of psychotic experiences such as delusional beliefs or hallucinatory voices. It comes as a surprise to many that these experiences are not uncommon among the general population.</p><p> 相反，我的观点是，通过同情现实案例在强调他们的稀有情况时，这种刻板印象被打破了。精神分裂症的诊断依赖于剥夺信仰或幻觉声音等精神病经验的识别。对于许多人来说，这些经历在一般人群中并不少见。</p><p> A clinical diagnosis requires the unusual experiences to be accompanied by high levels of distress and dysfunction. Some individuals suffering in this way may have periods when, to the observer, their behaviour appears bizarre. What has become increasingly clear to me in my practice is that diagnosis is not a particularly informative way of understanding behaviour. I have been involved in too many trials in which the central issue has been whether the criteria for a specific diagnosis were met.</p><p> 临床诊断需要具有高水平的痛苦和功能障碍的不寻常的经历。以这种方式遭受这种方式的一些人可能会在观察者中有期间，他们的行为似乎奇怪。在我的练习中对我来说越来越清楚的是，诊断不是一种特别提供的理解行为方式。我参与了太多的试验，其中核心问题是是否满足了特定诊断的标准。</p><p> At the core of most motives for violence are assumptions about the intentions of others. Seb believed that a sinister collective was intent on keeping his mother hidden against her will.</p><p> 在大多数暴力动机的核心上是对他人意图的假设。 SEB认为，险恶的集体是意图让他的母亲隐藏在她的意志中。</p><p> Understanding motivation is certainly important, but we also need to think about why hostile feelings are so seldom translated into homicidal actions. For most of us, even a flickering awareness of the consequences of our imagined aggression triggers negative feelings that prevent us from going through with a violent act. And since we are programmed to avoid negative feelings, we are inclined to suppress or resist the thoughts that cause them. If you were to imagine being the perpetrator of a violent attack on the person you love or care for most in the world, it is likely that you are immediately repulsed by the thought – that you imagine the horror in their reaction, the pain they would feel, the feelings of shock, betrayal, confusion. Thus adopting the emotional perspective of the victim is, for most people, enough to stop a violent impulse in its tracks. When we imagine a violent act from the perspective of the victim, we are demonstrating a type of empathy – we are imagining the mind of another.</p><p> 了解动机肯定是重要的，但我们也需要考虑为什么敌对的感受很少被翻译成凶杀作用。对于我们大多数人来说，即使是对我们想象的侵略的后果的闪烁意识触发了防止我们通过暴力行为的负面情绪。由于我们被编程为避免负面情绪，因此我们倾向于抑制或抵制导致它们的思想。如果你想象是对世界上最爱或照顾的人的暴力袭击的肇事者，你可能会立即被思想击退 - 你想象他们反应中的恐怖，他们会的痛苦感觉，休克的感觉，背叛，混乱。从而采用受害者的情感视角，对于大多数人来说，足以阻止剧烈的冲动。当我们想象从受害者的角度来看暴力行为时，我们正在展示一种同情的同情 - 我们想象另一个人的思想。</p><p> Empathy is a critical human ability and, when it comes to violence, it is powerfully inhibiting. So crucial are these processes that they do not even require conscious effort: they run behind the scenes, constantly inhibiting myriad counterproductive impulses. Violence is a consequence of an interplay between emotional forces driving the aggressive urges </p><p> 同理心是一种关键的人类能力，并且在暴力方面，它有力抑制。因此，这是这些过程，他们甚至不需要有意识的努力：他们在幕后跑，不断抑制无数的反潜冲动。暴力是在驾驶侵略性急促的情感力量之间相互作用的结果 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/17/inside-the-mind-of-murderer-power-and-limits-of-forensic-psychiatry-crime-prison">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/17/inside-the-mind-of-murderer-power-and-limits-of-forensic-psychiatry-crime-prison</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/思想/">#思想</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/murderer/">#murderer</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/seb/">#seb</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
