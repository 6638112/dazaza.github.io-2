It&#39;s heavily inspired by the Freakonomics movie. I&#39;ve made minimal changes from the version I submitted.\n As always, if something is wrong or you just have an opinion to share, feel free to  contact me.\n    Free software\u2014free as in freedom\u2014is a cornerstone of the current software environment. Most, if not all, of the apps people are familiar with use code from free software. But what even is free software? Free open-source software (or FOSS) is software whose code is publicly available under a license that allows the use of the code in your projects. One of the largest FOSS projects in the world is the Linux kernel, which is freely available. You might not have heard of the Linux kernel, but it is the software that powers ChromeOS, Android, most IoT devices, and the majority of the world&#39;s servers. It is only alive because of the millions of dollars in donations it receives from companies which depend on the software. However, there are pieces of FOSS software that someone has been thanklessly maintaining for decades with no pay.\n  This is clearly an issue. The current state of software is such that everything depends on everything else. If one essential component ceases to be maintained, or is sold to another (more malicious) actor, the software which depends on it will break. So how do we prevent this? FOSS is typically created by individuals, not by corporations (although there is a shift toward FOSS companies), and since the software is free, you can not sell or license it to make money.\n  The developer is bored of the project and does not want to keep on supporting it, since it was originally a passion or a school project.\n The project has gotten out of hand and is really large, so it is difficult to maintain.\n The project&#39;s main users are people who are not particularly computer literate, therefore there is an abundance of support requests that would be considered idiotic (lack of patience).\n There is a better alternative available so the developer stops working on the current project.\n  The developer&#39;s priorities may shift away from the project and toward work or something else.\n Each and every one of these reasons has already happened in real life and caused issues for consumers. One perfect example is the \u201cThe Great Suspender\u201d fiasco. The FOSS extension was sold to another person who uploaded a malicious version of the program to Google&#39;s Chrome Web Store. This caused a mass exodus from the extension subsequently leading to the extension not being used. The source code for the program has not been updated since October of 2020 and the extension has been pulled from the store. The school had approved of this extension for use, and it still failed since there was no real incentive to not sell the program.\n So how does this relate to economics? It is clear that FOSS has a massive social benefit, but the private benefit to the developer is very low. Therefore,  incentives matter. In order for the developers to continue their projects, they must have an incentive to do so. Currently, for smaller projects, the incentive is a sense of obligation the developers have to their users. Naturally, the developers do not want to abandon their users, but a situation may arise that a proper incentive would fix. Therefore, by donating money to developers, you prevent the project from being abandoned. Some people have a large salary from their open source projects, such as the Haxx team which created the  de facto HTTP client library that is used across every platform. They have many sponsors because these sponsors realize that if this project goes under, so does the company&#39;s software. Unfortunately, it is common that only the larger projects are funded to the point where the developers can make aliving off of it.\n Along with incentives mattering, one of the incentives listed earlier included how technology could change, leading to the depreciation of a project. The  technological change especially in the software industry, leads to shifts in popular software. One notable exception is the C programming language, which has been around since 1972 and is still the number one choice for high-performance or systems applications (although this paradigm has been shifting slightly toward the Rust programming language). With the introduction of new languages, such as Rust, many developers decide to rewrite their projects (see the RIIR movement), or create a new one entirely. A real-world example of technological change would be something like Adobe Flash. Technologies like JavaScript and WASM depreciated Flash, leading to legacy Flash programs being unavailable to people today. Movements have been made to archive the Flash programs, but all of the software that had to do with Flash (and the few companies that depend on Flash still) were left out in the rain.\n Technological change is linked with  competition and efficacy, since with the shifts in technology, new programs rise as well. In the late 1980&#39;s, the open-source kernel of choice was GNU Hurd. However, with the release of the Linux kernel in the early 1990&#39;s, GNU Hurd was driven out as a viable choice and now is delegated to experimentalists and enthusiasts. This open source project has still been kept alive by a small but dedicated group of people. There has still been no official stable release and the time between code changes is typically weeks.Competition typically leads to a shift in consumer tastes, so the  supply, demand, and equilibrium price changes as well. In terms of free software, the price is zero, so theoretically demand should be infinite. This is not the case, with non-free software still dominating on some platforms, such asWindows, MacOS, and so on.\n  Therefore, there must be some costs to the software beyond monetary costs that we must account for. Many FOSS projects require a higher learning curve and implementation costs than popular non-free alternatives. A wonderful example of this is Microsoft Word. The leading FOSS alternative to Word is LibreOffice Writer. Writer has many issues, such as compatibility problems with DOCX files, lack of features, and difficulty of use. So, there is an implicit \u201ccost\u201d of using FOSS, or with using anything for that matter. The other important part of the graph is the supply curve. There are two possibilities for the supply curve: perfectly inelastic (as outlined in figure 1.1), representing that the developers are willing to accept any money but that will not change how much software is released. But this runs into another issue with the supply and demand graph: software is free to download, and you can copy it for free. Therefore, there is an infinite supply of the software, but not an infinite quantity supplied, since that must be at an equilibrium point. So what could cause the supply and demand to shift? Again, a shift in consumer tastes, a change in the inputs for production (more developers working on a project), or any other economic concept, proving that free stuff still has to abide by the laws of supply and demand.\n Linked perfectly with supply / demand and consumer tastes,  the \u201csnob effect\u201d in consumer purchasing is a major player in software. With such a wide diversity in software, people who use one program are viewed as \u201cbetter\u201d than people who use another. A perfect example of this is Apple. Apple&#39;s MacOS (which you can only legally receive with an Apple computer) is considered the \u201csnob\u201d of the operating systems, while those who use Linux or another more niche product are considered to be nerds. People pay top dollar to not use free software because if it is free, it is seen as being a second-rate, inferior product. FOSS projects fail because they are seen as second-rate to an already-existing non-free product. In July of 2000, Microsoft&#39;s CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux \u201ccommunism\u201d:\n [T]o emphasise the competitive threat, and in some senses the competitive opportunity, that Linux represents. Linux is a tough competitor. There&#39;s no company called Linux, there&#39;s barely a Linux road map. Yet Linux sort of springs organically from the earth. And it had, you know, the characteristics of communism that people love so very, very much about it. That is, it&#39;s free.\n For more than the next decade, Microsoft continued to make Linux seem as a second rate product that only nerds and communists use, cementing Windows&#39;s position as expensive but the best, similarly to Apple&#39;s products. Ballmer also called the free-software movement and Linux \u201ccancer\u201d the next year. All of this naturally shifted demand left via the \u201csnob effect\u201d and set the community back a decade.\n  So what do we do in order to incentivise developers to continue their essential projects? Simple: we give them money. As stated earlier, the marginal social benefit is much higher than the marginal private benefit. Therefore, if MPB is increased so that it equals MSB, society is better off.\n  In figure 3.1, we see the current situation. Society is better off than the developer, so there is a deadweight loss (in red). To move MPB to MSB, we pay the developer. In fact, others have already thought of this idea. GitHub, the leader in open-source software hosting, has implemented a feature called \u201cSponsors\u201d in which a person or a company can sponsor a GitHub organization or individual. GitHub takes no cut. This is suitable for small and large scale products and replaces similar methods such as a Patreon or a simple Paypal transfer. Another method that can be used is an official sponsorship. Because companies use some of the FOSS code, they want it to continue, so they sponsor the project. For example, Rocky Linux is a Linux distribution that is built to replace CentOS. They have gotten sponsors because the companies want a replacement for CentOS. Lastly, there is the sellout option. Selling the software to a third party would only temporarily increase MPB to equal MSB. At that point the software would fail, as it did with the Great Suspender. So where does that leave developers? It is difficult to get funding from individuals since people usually do not want to pay money. This follows that, if the developers want to make money from their FOSS projects, they will make something worth donating to.\n    Lea, Graham. \u201cMS&#39; Ballmer: Linux Is Communism.\u201d The Register, 21 May 2000, https://www.theregister.com/2000/07/31/ms_ballmer_linux_is_communism/.

", "note_en": "Tesla has unveiled its new supercomputer, which is already the fifth most powerful in the world, and it\u2019s going to be the predecessor of Tesla\u2019s upcoming new Dojo supercomputer.\n It is being used to train the neural nets powering Tesla\u2019s Autopilot and upcoming self-driving AI.\n  Over the last few years, Tesla has had a clear focus on computing power both inside and outside its vehicles.\n Inside, it needs computers powerful enough to run its self-driving software, and outside, it needs supercomputers to train its self-driving software powered by neural nets that are fed an insane amount of data coming from the fleet.\n CEO Elon Musk has been teasing Tesla\u2019s Dojo project, which apparently  consists of a supercomputer capable of an\u00a0exaFLOP,\u00a0one quintillion (10 18) floating-point operations per second, or 1,000 petaFLOPS \u2013 making it one of the most powerful computers in the world.\n Tesla has been working on Dojo for the last few years, and Musk has been hinting that it should be ready by the end of this year.\n But the company has developed other supercomputers on its way to Dojo, and now Andrej Karpathy, Tesla\u2019s head of AI, has unveiled the latest one during a presentation at the 2021 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition.\n During the presentation, Karpathy gave a shoutout to Tesla\u2019s supercomputing team and showcased their latest work, Tesla\u2019s third supercomputer cluster:\n  Tesla is claiming some fairly insane specs on this new cluster, which should make it roughly the fifth most-powerful computer in the world:\n   \u201cWe have a neural net architecture network and we have a data set, a 1.5 petabytes data set that requires a huge amount of computing. So I wanted to give a plug to this insane supercomputer that we are building and using now. For us, computer vision is the bread and butter of what we do and what enables Autopilot. And for that to work really well, we need to master the data from the fleet, and train massive neural nets and experiment a lot. So we invested a lot into the compute. In this case, we have a cluster that we built with 720 nodes of 8x A100 of the 80GB version. So this is a massive supercomputer. I actually think that in terms of flops, it\u2019s roughly the number 5 supercomputer in the world.\u201d\n The Tesla engineer didn\u2019t want to elaborate on project Dojo, but he did say that it will be an even better supercomputer optimized for neural net training than Tesla\u2019s current cluster.\n Musk also previously said that Tesla plans to eventually\u00a0 make its supercomputers available to other companies in order for them to train their neural nets on it.\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.

"note_en": "Over the past 15 years, Google has introduced more than a dozen messaging services spanning text, voice, and video calling. This week, the company\u2019s efforts culminated in the general availability of Google Chat, a combination of Slack / Discord-style rooms with more traditional messaging.\n It\u2019s the sort of announcement that might have been expected to bring some consistency to the company\u2019s muddled messenger messaging, but \u2014 as is traditional for Google in this area \u2014 there\u2019s plenty of confusion to go around.\n  For one thing, Google Chat is the name fans have affectionately used to refer to Google\u2019s original messaging service, Google Talk, for many years. Is this a coincidence that brings Google\u2019s messaging ouroboros full circle, or is it meant to entice GChat fans into actually using the company\u2019s latest attempt?\n For another, Google Chat contains its own messaging rooms that were previously called Rooms but will soon \u201cevolve\u201d into something called Spaces, even though Google introduced  a different messaging app called Spaces in 2016.\n Here\u2019s a breakdown of Google\u2019s major messaging offerings over the years, with currently active services in bold:\n Messaging services: Google Talk, Google Plus Huddle, Google Hangouts, Google Allo,  Google Chat, plus innumerable chat features built into other Google products we won\u2019t mention here\n Within that mess of product names are two core issues: Google\u2019s apparent love of launching new services and its inability to combine products under one umbrella.\n Competitors like WhatsApp demonstrate what the opposite approach could be: a chat service tied to a user\u2019s phone number that allows for video and voice, all from one app. Or there\u2019s Apple\u2019s iPhone approach, which ties email addresses and phone numbers to two services: iMessage for text and FaceTime for audio and video.\n Google keeps falling into the same cycle, though, one that has repeated itself throughout the years. It\u2019ll build out new services, integrating them into more areas of its product lineup, then try to wipe the slate clean, launch new services that (eventually) replace the old set, and start the cycle anew.\n     April 1st, 2004: Gmail launches in beta. Arguably Google\u2019s first communication product, Gmail promised a new kind of email service where users wouldn\u2019t have to delete emails and could search old threads with the same power as Google\u2019s main site.  Originally assumed to be an April Fools\u2019 joke.\n August 2005: Google Talk launches, kicking off Google\u2019s foray into messaging services. In addition to instant messaging, Talk also offered voice calls through its desktop client. Talk would be integrated into Gmail in 2006 as the sort of \u201cAOL Instant Messenger\u201d to Gmail\u2019s \u201cAOL\u201d email service. Found in the \u201cChat\u201d window in Gmail, users wind up calling it GChat.\n November 2007: Google Talk receives support for group chats, allowing users to message multiple contacts in real time.\n October 2008:  Google launches Android for smartphones, with support for both Google Talk and regular SMS texting.\n  March 2009:  Google Voice launches. A rebrand of an existing company called GrandCentral that Google bought in 2007, Google Voice lets users sign up for a single phone number that can send and receive text messages and calls on both PCs and phones. Google Voice and Google Talk remain separate services.\n May 2009:  Google Wave is announced at Google I/O. Pitched as a grand vision for the future of internet communication, Wave reimagined email and chat as a series of grouped threads with different users until Google stopped development a year later. While overall a flop, Wave is now seen as a precursor to team messaging apps like Slack.\n February 2010:  Google launches Google Buzz. It\u2019s primarily a microblogging service like Twitter that lives inside Gmail, but it also offers private messages you could send to small groups. It was discontinued in 2011 to make way for Google+.\n April 2010:  Google adds chat to Google Docs. The new chat feature is designed to let document editors communicate with each other while editing a document, but it\u2019s separate from Google\u2019s other chat services.\n August 2010:  Google Voice gets integrated into Gmail, allowing Gmail users to call regular phone numbers directly from Gmail as an expansion of Google Talk\u2019s voice call feature.\n April 2011: Google  adds live video chat to Android, bringing Google Talk\u2019s voice and internet calls to mobile.\n    June 2011: Google+ launches. Ostensibly Google\u2019s approach to Facebook\u2019s social media dominance, it also intros two messaging services of its own: Huddle group text messaging for phones and Hangouts for group video.\n It\u2019s the first part of Google\u2019s messaging cycle: the introduction of new services, even though it\u2019ll take two years for Google to finalize the branding and strategy here.\n July 2012: Google  launches Hangouts in Gmail, calling it a more \u201cmodern\u201d version of the existing video calling feature that Gmail had offered through Google Talk. Already, we start to see the second part of the cycle, as Google starts to build out Hangouts into its other services.\n  May 2013:  Google+ Hangouts is relaunched as Google\u2019s new overarching messaging platform. It attempts to merge other Google messaging and video chat apps into a single unified service, replacing Google Talk, Google+ Messenger, and the old Google+ Hangouts video chat service.\n  September 2014: Google Voice is integrated into Hangouts, continuing Google\u2019s efforts for a cohesive messaging system and bringing some SMS support.\n April 2015:  Google Fi launches as Project Fi. Google\u2019s phone plan also integrates with Hangouts but leads to headaches with Google Voice, given that the  two services exist side by side.\n June 2016: Google Talk for Android and Gmail (still not officially named GChat or Google Chat, despite what most people call it) is discontinued, marking the end of Google\u2019s original messaging service.\n    May 2016: Google starts its cycle again at Google I/O 2016, announcing both Allo, a new texting app, and Duo, a new video chat application. Both are separate from Hangouts, muddying the waters once again.\n March 2017: Google announces Hangouts is being rebranded as Hangouts Chat, with a new focus on enterprise use. Google also launches Hangouts Meet, an enterprise-friendly videoconferencing app that later becomes Google\u2019s answer to Zoom. Allo and Duo are expected to take the place of Hangouts as the new consumer options for messaging and video chat.\n June 2017:  GChat is finally, really discontinued. Google also  removes SMS support from Hangouts to better position it as a Slack competitor.\n April 2018:  Google \u201cpauses investment\u201d in Allo, focusing instead on RCS, a new standard to replace SMS. Confusingly, Google uses the phrase \u201cchat services\u201d to refer to enabling RCS on Android, despite being unrelated to Google Talk (commonly referred to as GChat) and Hangouts Chat / Google Chat.\n      With Google\u2019s mobile messaging focused on RCS, the company comes back to Hangouts as its old-new web-based service for communication. But in a twist, the COVID-19 pandemic puts enterprise communication tools like Slack and Zoom front and center \u2014 not just for companies, but for the everyday life of people to use for socializing, school, and more.\n March 2020: Hangouts Meet is released to personal Google accounts as a new group videoconferencing option.\n April 2020: Hangouts Chat (which has steadily grown into a Slack / Discord-style app during the previous era) is  renamed to Google Chat \u2014 marking the return of sorts of the Google Chat name, although the slow rollout might mean you still have Hangouts lurking in your Gmail browser window.\n  June 2021: Google releases Google Chat to all customers and announces that \u201cRooms\u201d will become \u201cSpaces.\u201d Spaces work similar to a Slack or Discord room, offering a central place for larger group discussions compared to regular group threads \u2014 which still exist in Chat, too.\n  It\u2019s been a long road to get here, but with the launch of Workspace and Google Chat to non-enterprise users, it\u2019s almost possible to see Google\u2019s strategy. Gmail exists for emails; Chat is the GChat / Hangouts-style messaging system for real-time conversations and group chats; Spaces is the Slack / Discord-style area for more persistent, larger rooms based on a particular topic or conversation; and there\u2019s Meet for video chats.\n Mobile messaging is messier, though, with Google having spent years trying to get its own services to work side by side with carrier technologies like SMS and RCS \u2014 and there\u2019s no end in sight. Working with cellular carrier technology to pursue Apple and WhatsApp isn\u2019t a terrible idea, but it\u2019s not clear whether Google can actually manage to catch up.\n Even if RCS might be a strong contender to replace SMS, it doesn\u2019t connect to the web-based Google Chat at all \u2014 even though, confusingly,  Google refers to RCS services as \u201cchat\u201d as well. And on the video front, it\u2019s not clear why Google Duo still exists following the broader release of Hangouts Meet since the two largely accomplish the same things.\n If anything is clear in 2021, it\u2019s that Google\u2019s messaging future will likely remain muddled for quite some time.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 12:32:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,messaging", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6df7\u4e71\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u8868 ", "title_en": "Google\u2019s Messaging Mess: A Timeline", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22538240/google-chat-allo-hangouts-talk-messaging-mess-timeline", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "messaging"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067358, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u8f66\u8f86\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u9876\u90e8\u548c\u4e03\u4e2a\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a40\u6881\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u3002 ", "note_en": "The data acquisition vehicle is equipped with one 40-beam LiDAR on the top and seven cameras.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 12:32:22", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u81ea\u52a8,million,\u91c7\u96c6", "title": "\u4e00\u65e6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u573a\u666f ", "title_en": "Once Dataset: One Million Scenes for Autonomous Driving", "transed": 1, "url": "https://once-for-auto-driving.github.io/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u81ea\u52a8", "million", "\u91c7\u96c6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e1dc6c1204ccf3de0089d57d6f66ba1f.jpg", "infoid": 1067357, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f -

Opponents say the procedure is skewed toward the cancellation of valid patents.\n The decision on Monday means the challenges will largely proceed as before, without changes to how the judges are appointed. The court\u2019s narrow fix, subjecting the judges to additional supervision, fell well short of upending the current system.\n The case, United States v. Arthrex, No. 19-1434, arose from a challenge filed by Smith &amp; Nephew, a medical technology company, against patents held by a competitor, Arthrex, on a medical device. A panel of judges on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative tribunal in the executive branch created by the 2011 law, ruled that Arthrex\u2019s patents were invalid.\n Arthrex appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court in Washington, saying that the patent judges\u2019 decision should be thrown out because they had not been properly appointed.\n The appeals court agreed, ruling that the judges performed important work without supervision and so were \u201cprincipal officers\u201d under the Constitution, meaning that they had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n The appeals court\u2019s solution to the constitutional problem was to strike down a part of the law that protected the patent judges from being fired without cause. This effectively demoted them from \u201cprincipal officers,\u201d the appeals court said.\n Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for five justices on Monday, agreed that there was a constitutional problem with the fit between how the judges had been appointed and their duties. \u201cThe unreviewable executive power exercised\u201d by the judges, he wrote, \u201cis incompatible with their status as inferior officers.\u201d\n \u201cOnly an officer properly appointed to a principal office may issue a final decision binding the executive branch in the proceeding before us,\u201d the chief justice wrote.\n Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined that part of the chief justice\u2019s opinion.\n Chief Justice Roberts wrote for only four justices in another part of his opinion, this one concerning what the court should do about the constitutional problem it had identified. He said the judges\u2019 decisions must be made subject to the director\u2019s review. Justice Gorsuch did not agree with that part of the ruling, saying it was up to Congress to address how to fix the constitutional flaw.\n Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented from the first part of the chief justice\u2019s opinion. \u201cToday\u2019s decision,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis both unprecedented and unnecessary, and risks pushing the judiciary further into areas where we lack both the authority to act and the capacity to act wisely.\u201d\n But those three justices nonetheless said they accepted Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s solution to the problem the majority had identified.\n Justice Clarence Thomas issued a separate dissent, joined in large part by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan. \u201cThe court today draws a new line dividing inferior officers from principal ones,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe fact that this line places administrative patent judges on the side of ambassadors, Supreme Court justices and department heads suggests that something is not quite right.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 12:32:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

of food allergy to red meat and other products made from mammals. In the United States, the condition most often begins when a Lone Star tick bites someone. The bite transmits a sugar molecule called alpha-gal into the person&#39;s body. In some people, this triggers an immune system reaction that later produces mild to severe allergic reactions to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb, or other mammal products.\n  The Lone Star tick is found predominantly in the southeastern United States, and most cases of alpha-gal syndrome occur in this region. The tick can also be found in the eastern and south central United States. The condition appears to be spreading farther north and west, however, as deer carry the Lone Star tick to new parts of the United States. Alpha-gal syndrome also has been diagnosed in Europe, Australia and Asia, where other types of ticks carry alpha-gal molecules.\n Researchers now believe that some people who have frequent, unexplained anaphylactic reactions \u2014 and who test negative for other food allergies \u2014 may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome. There&#39;s no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals.\n Avoiding tick bites is the key to prevention. Protect against tick bites by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts and using insect repellents when you&#39;re in wooded, grassy areas. Do a thorough, full-body tick check after spending time outside.\n      Signs and symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction are often delayed compared with other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens \u2014 peanuts or shellfish, for example \u2014 happen within minutes of exposure. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about three to six hours after exposure. Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb; organ meats; and products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products, can cause a reaction.\n   Doctors think the time delay between eating red meat and developing an allergic reaction is one reason the condition was overlooked until recently. A possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight was far from obvious.\n   See your primary care doctor or a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of allergies (allergist) if you experience food allergy symptoms after eating \u2014 even several hours after eating. Don&#39;t rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction, especially if you live or spend time outdoors in the southeastern United States or in other parts of the world where alpha-gal syndrome is known to occur.\n       Most people who develop alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S. develop the condition when a Lone Star tick bites them. Bites from other types of ticks can lead to the condition in Europe, Australia and Asia.\n   Ticks that cause alpha-gal syndrome are believed to carry alpha-gal molecules from the blood of the animals they commonly bite, such as cows and sheep. When a carrier tick bites a human, the tick injects alpha-gal into the person&#39;s body.\n For unknown reasons, some people have such a strong immune response to these molecules that they can no longer eat red meat or products made from mammals without a mild to severe allergic reaction. People who are exposed to many tick bites over time may develop more-severe symptoms.\n   People with antibodies related to alpha-gal syndrome can have allergic reactions to the cancer drug cetuximab (Erbitux). Cetuximab-induced cases of this condition are most common in regions with a high population of Lone Star ticks, suggesting a possible link between Lone Star tick bites and an increased vulnerability to alpha-gal syndrome. More research is needed to understand the connection between ticks that carry alpha-gal in certain regions and cases of alpha-gal syndrome that don&#39;t seem directly linked to tick bites.\n Researchers think the hallmark time-delayed reaction of alpha-gal syndrome is due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter your circulatory system.\n   Doctors don&#39;t yet know why some people develop alpha-gal syndrome after exposure and others don&#39;t. The condition mostly occurs in the southeastern United States and parts of New York, New Jersey and New England. You&#39;re at increased risk if you live or spend time in these regions and:\n  In the past 20 to 30 years, the Lone Star tick has been found in large numbers as far north as Maine and as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma in the United States.\n Alpha-gal syndrome can also occur in other parts of the world such as Europe, Australia and parts of Asia, where bites from certain types of ticks also appear to increase your risk of the condition.\n   Alpha-gal syndrome can cause food-induced anaphylaxis, a medical emergency that requires treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) injector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others) and a visit to the emergency room.\n   Based on recent research, doctors now believe that some people with unexplained, frequent anaphylaxis may be living with undiagnosed alpha-gal syndrome.\n   The best way to prevent alpha-gal syndrome is to avoid areas where ticks live, especially wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can decrease your risk of getting alpha-gal syndrome with some simple precautions:\n Cover up. When in wooded or grassy areas, wear shoes, long pants tucked into your socks, a long-sleeved shirt, a hat and gloves. Try to stick to trails and avoid walking through low bushes and long grass. Keep your dog on a leash.\n  Use insect repellents. Apply insect repellent with a 20% or higher concentration of DEET to your skin. Parents should apply repellent to their children, avoiding their hands, eyes and mouths. Keep in mind that chemical repellents can be toxic, so follow directions carefully. Apply products with permethrin to clothing or buy pre-treated clothing.\n  Do your best to tick-proof your yard. Clear brush and leaves where ticks live. Keep woodpiles in sunny areas.\n  Check yourself, your children and your pets for ticks. Be especially vigilant after spending time in wooded or grassy areas.\n  It&#39;s helpful to shower as soon as you come indoors. Ticks often remain on your skin for hours before attaching themselves. Showering and using a washcloth might remove unattached ticks.\n  Remove a tick as soon as possible with tweezers. Gently grasp the tick near its head or mouth. Don&#39;t squeeze or crush the tick, but pull carefully and steadily. Once you&#39;ve removed the entire tick, dispose of it and apply antiseptic to the bite area.\n &#34;They get themselves in a position. And they will climb up the nearest object, like this blade of grass here.&#34; It&#39;s called questing. &#34;It sticks out its legs, and that allows it to grab on to hosts as they walk by.&#34; You can lessen the chances you&#39;ll become a host. &#34;Using insect repellents is a good idea.&#34;\n Mayo Clinic parasitic diseases expert Dr. Bobbi Pritt suggests permethrin for your clothing and gear.\n  &#34;You can really saturate your gear. Leave them out to dry, and, then, the next day, wear them.&#34;\n  Use permethrin on materials and DEET on skin. Spray the DEET repellent on exposed skin, including your legs and hands. Avoid your face, but be sure to protect your neck. Then, tuck your pants into your socks. And, on your hike, remember to avoid areas where those questing ticks may be perched.\n  &#34;That&#39;s why you want to stay away from the tall grasses.

", "note_en": "Yes a plane can land by itself using a system that is often referred to as \u201cautoland\u201d. The pilots can program the auto pilot to carry out the landing automatically whilst the pilots monitor the aircraft. However there are limitations as to when the autoland system can be used.\n Automatic landings probably account for less then 1% of all landings on commercial flights. Many pilots actually think it\u2019s much easier to land the aircraft manually, as monitoring the auto pilot in the autoland stage of flight is itself very demanding with a very high level of vigilance required at all stages.\n The  Boeing 737 (the world\u2019s most successful airliner in terms of the number sold) is limited to a maximum crosswind of 25kts (15kts for many airlines) when carrying out an automatic landing (Category 3 / CAT III approach). The autopilot is usually used to land in low visibility conditions when there are typically little or no winds (fog will seldom form if it\u2019s very windy). As soon as the wind picks up, the average pilot is far better at coping with the conditions and landing the aircraft when compared to the auto pilot.\n  Automatic landings require a high level of automation monitoring that needs  retraining every six months for professional pilots. Autolands can only be performed under strict conditions that require the certification of both the aircraft (often downgraded to no autoland capability due to technical issues), both of the pilots and the airport itself. The pilots are still required to configure the aircraft and control it\u2019s speed and monitor its flight path. Any number of relatively minor technical issues can compromise many fail-passive auto land systems, requiring a missed approach to be carried out and then a possible diversion to an airport which is clear of fog or low cloud.\n An Autoland is often referred to as a CAT III (3) approach. This refers to the category of the  Instrument Landing System (ILS), which is a radio aid used to direct the pilots towards the runway on the final approach stages of flight. Not all airports have a CAT III \u2018runway\u2019 which means that not all airports can support Autoland operations. Equally, autoland capability is not a function that all aircraft have.\n   CAT I requires a manual landing but runway visibility must be more than 550 meters and pilots must be in sight of the runway

", "note_en": "A big change in how the Internet is defined - and who defines it - is underway.\n For a while now, it\u2019s been apparent that Internet and Web standards have stagnated at the \u2018top\u2019 of the stack. While the IETF has been busy  revising HTTP and  replacing TCP down below, a tremendous amount of innovation is going on up top, and it\u2019s all in private hands. This is where most of the apparent value in the Internet now resides: when you ask people  what is the Internet? they don\u2019t say anything about end-to-end, reliable delivery, stateful resources, or the browser platform; they say \u2018social networking, search and shopping\u2019, or more likely, \u2018Facebook, Google and Amazon.\u2019\n Services like social networking, instant messaging and online marketplaces don\u2019t  have to be entrusted into the hands of these companies \u2013 they could be distributed and/or federated systems like the lower layers of the Internet, where there isn\u2019t a \u2018choke point\u2019 that allows a single entity to control them. There are even existing standards for many of these functions, but they haven\u2019t succeeded. Sometimes, that\u2019s because they weren\u2019t capable enough, or able to evolve quickly enough (see  Moxie\u2019s great talk about this), or because someone used market power to shift power away from an open solution that didn\u2019t fit their business model (Google Reader, anyone?).\n With this in mind, I\u2019ve been watching the investigations of the competition issues surrounding big tech platforms around the world with great interest.  1 It seems to me that an obvious remedy to a concentration of power is to distribute that power by requiring market participants to use open interoperability standards, and competition regulators have the power to force the issue. This won\u2019t solve all problems with the big platforms, of course, but it\u2019s a great start.\n Lots of people seem to agree; if you have some reading time, browser through papers from folks like  Chris Riley,  Peter Swire, the  Internet Society,  Kerber &amp; Schweitzer,  Ian Brown,  Kades &amp; Scott Morton, and  Chinmayi Sharma - to name just a few.\n However, establishing good standards isn\u2019t easy. Balancing different stakeholders\u2019 views, broadness of applicability, implementation concerns, security and privacy, interoperability, and the need to actually ship something is difficult even when everyone gets along. Additionally, the outcome needs to be legitimate on the same scale that the Internet is \u2013 globally. As we\u2019ll see, that\u2019s an aspect that requires very careful management.\n Over the years, the Internet community has evolved a set of institutions and associated architectural principles to embody these tradeoffs. It\u2019s not that every Internet or Web specification has to go through the W3C or the IETF, or that every standard that these bodies produce is successful (far from it). What these bodies provide is an ever-growing knowledge and experience of what  not to do, both technically and organisationally, when you\u2019re creating technical standards for the Internet.\n In this context, I found two recent announcements about competition efforts to reign in big tech both interesting and concerning.\n  The saga of  Google\u2019s Privacy Sandbox and the  UK Competition and Market Authority\u2019s investigation into its competition impact deserves a paper of its own,  2 but I want to focus on the  CMA\u2019s announcement last week.\n In a nutshell, Google\u2019s efforts to improve privacy by removing support for third-party cookies in Chrome have attracted the CMA\u2019s attention, because doing so can be seen to give Google an upper hand in the advertising and publishing markets, since Google will retain access to first-party tracking information. Last week\u2019s announcement stated that Google had made some commitments to the CMA regarding how it would develop the Privacy Sandbox.\n The CMA\u2019s concerns about the impact of these changes on those markets are entirely reasonable, and some parts of the Privacy Sandbox are dubious at best (e.g., see  Mozilla\u2019s assessment of FLoC). However, the Privacy Sandbox also includes functions like:\n Removing third-party cookies: just like Firefox, Safari and Brave are doing, with support extending from the  very first Cookie standard through to the  most recent revision.\n  Combatting fingerprinting: just like Firefox, Safari and Brave are doing, with broad support over multiple years  in Web standards.\n  Privacy proxies: just like Firefox and Apple are working on, with relevant standardisation activity in the  IETF MASQUE Working Group among other places.\n These functions \u2013 which many consider to be normal or even critical browser functions \u2013 are now subject to approval by the UK\u2019s competition regulator, at least in the most popular Web browser. By extracting commitments from Google regarding how they build Chrome, the CMA has quietly inserted itself as a \u2018silent partner\u2019 to Google. Most significantly, Google is now required to give the CMA 60 days notice before removing third-party cookies from the browser, even though other browsers have done so long ago.\n What\u2019s concerning is that the CMA is creating what\u2019s effectively a parallel process to what standards go through, but substituting its own judgement and perspective. The outcomes will be solely dictated by the CMA and the ICO, based upon consultations with those parties that they choose, and supported by British values and a  British sense of what \u2018privacy\u2019 means and its priority relative to the advertising ecosystem. Whether they get it right for the rest of the world is anybody\u2019s guess; they have a very specific set of goals and incentives which are radically different than those that brought us the Internet and the Web.\n Of course, just like other software vendors, browsers have to conform to the legal requirements in the various jurisdictions that they have a market in. This intervention is also fairly \u2018light\u2019; they\u2019re not yet telling Google what it must do. So when I saw the news of these commitments, I was concerned for the reasons above, but not yet alarmed. What happened next took care of that.\n  One of the  five US bills to designed to rein in big tech that have been getting a lot of press recently is the  ACCESS Act 2021.\n This bill requires designated platforms (likely candidates would be Google, Facebook and Amazon) to conform to interoperability standards set by new a new committee run by the FTC. If it passes, the APIs that define the next layer of the Internet will not be based upon broad community input, review, or participation.\n Instead, the FTC will hand-pick the participants at its pleasure, and will retain change control over the APIs.  3. Even if the right mix of people gets onto the committee, its role is explicitly \u2018advisory\u2019.  4 Documentation for those APIs is only supplied to \u2018competing businesses or potential competing businesses.\u2019  5 There\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll be public.\n To be clear, I\u2019m super-happy that Lina Khan is now the FTC Chair. Some big platform heads need kicking, and her boots are laced. That said, technical standards defined to force interoperability on big tech will inevitably become the de facto standards for the industries that they\u2019re established within, potentially lasting far longer than the companies they\u2019re designed to hobble (if they do their jobs well). That effectively makes the FTC a new Internet governance institution.\n  While these developments might be appropriate in the context of domestic competition law, they\u2019re likely to have significant negative effects on the Internet overall. Governments taking control of Internet governance with a focus on economic actors has two predictable effects:  fragmentation and  ossification.\n  Creating government-set standards for Internet functions will inevitably lead other governments to decide that their priorities are different, or that they just don\u2019t find someone else\u2019s standards palatable. For example, the EU could decide that the UK got the wrong end of the stick on the Privacy Sandbox, or Brazil could decide that the US standards for social networking aren\u2019t for it.\n That, in turn, would increase the pressure towards fragmentation, and the corresponding diminishment of the enormous benefits that the Internet has for global society and trade.\n Google will have to figure out whether to have a UK version of Chrome, or try to force the UK\u2019s approach to privacy and advertising on everyone else. Facebook will be faced with the possibility of supporting different APIs in different countries \u2013 which will probably suit them fine, because it will help prevent a large rival from being established.\n The risks of fragmentation have been widely recognised for some time, and as a result, governments all over the world have agreed that the best way to govern the Internet is with a \u2018multistakeholder\u2019 model that places responsibility for technical standardisation firmly in the hands of community-led, industry-backed organisations.\n For example, in 2017 the G20 (including the UK and US)  said that they were\n Reaffirming the principle in the G20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative commitment to a multistakeholder approach to Internet governance, which includes full and active participation by governments, private sector, civil society, the technical community, and international organisations, in their respective roles and responsibilities. We support multistakeholder processes and initiatives which are inclusive, transparent and accountable to all stakeholders in achieving the digitally connected world.\n And, they can be viewed as bound by treaty to do so; as per the  WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade s 2.6:\n With a view to harmonizing technical regulations on as wide a basis as possible, Members shall play a full part, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation by appropriate international standardizing bodies of international standards for products for which they either have adopted, or expect to adopt, technical regulations.\n I\u2019m not sure if the friction between these developments and their commitments haven\u2019t been recognised, or if it\u2019s just being ignored. However, if the amount of pain and mistrust involved in the  IANA transition is any indication, much of the rest of the world is not content to allow the US (or any other rich Western country) solely determine the future of the Internet.\n  The other risk is creating friction against future, beneficial changes to the Internet. For example, creating an API for Facebook might only serve to cement them (or their business model) into place as the \u2018glue\u2019 of social networking, preventing other, more decentralised models from emerging.\n Likewise, forcing Chrome to accommodate third-party cookies and other forms of tracking to prop up the third-party display advertising industry might prevent a natural and healthy evolution towards other forms of advertising and other means of supporting Web content.\n In protocol design, we call this  ossification \u2013 when the ability to evolve is prevented by external factors. Mandated support for specific technical specifications or features combined with the market power that is being targeted is a dangerous brew.\n To put it another way: if we leave the definition of the Internet to the US Federal Trade Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the result is focused on companies and competition, rather than people and cooperation. Companies have a huge part to play in the Internet, but it doesn\u2019t mean we should delegate all functions to them, especially when significant advances are being made in decentralisation.\n  All of this raises the question:  can these standards be defined within the multistakeholder system? To put it another way, are the IETF and W3C fit for this purpose?\n It\u2019s a good question. These bodies are set up for  voluntary, not mandatory standards, and the spectre of mandatory implementation for some parties has a huge distorting effect. As someone who\u2019s been involved in Internet and Web standardisation for more than twenty years, I\u2019m not sure how it would go, and there are a lot of hard questions that would need to be answered.\n Still, in some cases there are existing solutions that could be adapted as the basis for interoperability standards (e.g.,  ActivityStreams for social networking).\n In other cases, the  threat of regulation might change power dynamics enough to produce meaningful change. For example, browsers haven\u2019t had a strong incentive to align how they handle third-party cookies to date, but that might change if the CMA, ICO and other interested regulators made their preferences known.\n Beyond their standardisation processes, these organisations have pools of deeply experienced engineers who have thought about the issues involved in many relevant areas for a long time. By looking only through the lens of \u2018what big companies do I need to talk to?\u2019, the regulators miss out on valuable alternative perspectives.\n However, we may not find out how much these bodies could bring to the table: apparently, many of the relevant decision-makers consider these institutions to be compromised by big tech companies. I think that\u2019s a simplistic view of two complex organisations with many different participants, incentives and goals. That said, this view can\u2019t be dismissed out of hand; big tech companies clearly have significant power inside standards organisations as well as in the market, and  multistakeholderism may be unstable ground for legitimacy on its own.\n So, I think that these governance institutions need to do some introspection \u2013 to find how they can maintain (or build) legitimacy and trust, so that bodies like the CMA and FTC can plausibly defer to their open, community-based global processes for technical standardisation. If that isn\u2019t possible, buckle up: the way the Internet is standardised is going to change a lot, and it\u2019s not at all clear where we\u2019ll end up.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 12:30:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e92\u8054\u7f51,internet", "title": "\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c42\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u6807\u51c6\u5316 ", "title_en": "How the Next Layer of the Internet Is Going to Be Standardised", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.mnot.net/blog/2021/06/21/standards-competition-governance", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e92\u8054\u7f51", "internet"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067352, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u82f1\u56fd\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u559d\u5496\u5561\u7684\u4eba\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ece\u75c5\u60c5\u4e2d\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8649\uff05\n    \u4ece\u6d53\u5496\u5561\u5230\u5373\u65f6\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u662f\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u65e5\u5e38\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u917f\u9020\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6162\u6027\u809d\u75c5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6216\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u8f83\u4f4e\u673a\u4f1a\u6709\u5173\u3002\n \u6162\u6027\u809d\u75c5\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6839\u636e\u82f1\u56fd\u809d\u810f\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u809d\u75c5\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u65e9\u4ea7\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u81ea1970\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5df2\u5347\u8d77400\uff05\u3002\n  \u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u996e\u7528\u5496\u5561\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u4e0e\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u809d\u764c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u542b\u6709\u9152\u7cbe\u76f8\u5173\u809d\u75c5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n \u201c\u5357\u5b89\u666e\u6566\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u5458Paul Roderick\u6559\u6388\u8bf4\uff1a\u201d\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u82f1\u56fd\u961f\u7684\u5496\u5561\u996e\u9152\u662f\u4fdd\u62a4\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u201c\u5357\u5b89\u666e\u6566\u5927\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6559\u6388\u8bf4\u3002\n \u5728BMC\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\uff0cRoderick\u53ca\u5176\u540c\u4e8b\u4e2d\u7684\u5199\u4f5c\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81ea\u82f1\u56fdBiobank\u7684494,585\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e -

Now research suggests the brew could be linked to a lower chance of developing or dying from chronic liver disease.\n Chronic liver disease is a major health problem around the world.  According to the British Liver Trust, liver disease is the third leading cause of premature death in the UK, with deaths having risen 400% since 1970.\n  The new study is the latest to suggest drinking coffee could bring benefits, with previous work suggesting it may  help stave off liver cancer, and reduce the  risk of alcohol-related liver disease.\n \u201cIt confirms in a large UK cohort that coffee drinking is protective against severe liver disease,\u201d said Prof Paul Roderick, a co-author of the study from the University of Southampton.\n Writing in the journal  BMC Public Health, Roderick and colleagues report how they analysed data from 494,585 participants in the  UK Biobank \u2013 a project designed to help unpick the genetic and environmental factors associated with particular conditions.\n All participants were aged 40 to 69 when they signed up to the project, with 384,818 saying they were coffee drinkers at the outset compared with 109,767 who did not consume the beverage.\n The team looked at the liver health of the participants over a median period of almost 11 years, finding 3,600 cases of chronic liver disease, with 301 deaths, and 1,839 cases of simple fatty liver disease.\n The analysis revealed that after taking into account factors such as body mass index, alcohol consumption, and smoking status, those who drank any amount of coffee, and of any sort, had a 20% lower risk of developing chronic liver disease or fatty liver disease (taken together) than those who did not consume the brew. The coffee drinkers also had a 49% lower risk of dying from chronic liver disease.\n The team said the magnitude of the effect increased with the amount of coffee consumed, up to about three to four cups a day, \u201cbeyond which further increases in consumption provided no additional benefit\u201d.\n A reduction in risk was also found when instant, decaffeinated and ground coffee were considered separately \u2013 although the latter linked to the largest effect.\n However, the study has limitations, including that it cannot prove that coffee itself reduces the risk of chronic liver disease, while participants were only quizzed about their coffee drinking habits at one point in time.\n \u201cIt does, however, raise the issue that it might be an effective intervention to prevent severe liver disease, say in those at high risk,\u201d said Roderick, noting there are numerous ingredients that may exert beneficial effects on liver disease and that these vary between types of coffee.\n Vanessa Hebditch, of the British Liver Trust, said the research added to a growing body of evidence that coffee was good for liver health.\n \u201c\u201cHowever, it\u2019s important that people improve their liver health not just by drinking coffee,\u201d she said, \u201cbut by also cutting down on alcohol and keeping to a healthy weight by exercising and eating well.\u201d", "posttime":

", "note_en": "To examine the association of low-carbohydrate diets with mortality during 26 years of follow-up in women and 20 years in men.\n A prospective cohort study of women and men, followed from 1980 (women) or 1986 (men) until 2006. Low-carbohydrate diets, either animal-based (emphasizing animal sources of fat and protein), or vegetable-based (emphasizing vegetable sources of fat and protein) were computed from multiple validated food frequency questionnaire assessed during follow-up.\n  85,168 women (aged 34-59 years at baseline) and 44,548 men (aged 40-75 years at baseline) without heart disease, cancer, or diabetes.\n Investigator documented 12,555 deaths (2,458 cardiovascular, 5,780 cancer) in women and 8,678 deaths (2,746 cardiovascular, 2,960 cancer) in men.\n The overall low-carbohydrate score was associated with a modest increase in overall mortality in pooled analysis (Hazard Ratio, HR, comparing extreme deciles=1.12 (95% CI=1.01-1.24, p-trend=0.14). The animal low-carbohydrate score was associated with a higher all-cause mortality (pooled HR comparing extreme deciles=1.23, 95% CI=1.11-1.37, p-trend=0.05), cardiovascular mortality (corresponding HR=1.14, 95% CI=1.01-1.29, p-trend=0.029), and cancer mortality (corresponding HR=1.28, 95% CI 1.02-1.60, p for trend = 0.09). In contrast, a higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score was associated with lower all-cause (HR=0.80, 95% CI=0.75-0.85, p-trend&lt;0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.68-0.87, p-trend&lt;0.001).\n Diet and lifestyle characteristics were assessed with some degree of error, however, sensitivity analyses indicated that results were not unlikely to be substantially affected by residual or confounding or an unmeasured confounder. In addition, participants were not a representative sample of the U.S. population.\n A low-carbohydrate diet based on animal sources was associated with higher all-cause mortality in both men and women, whereas a vegetable-based low-carbohydrate diet was associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates.\n Low-carbohydrate diets have claimed to promote weight loss, improve blood cholesterol levels, and blood pressure( 1,  2). Weight loss trials lasting 6 months to 2 years have found them to be as effective( ,  ) or more effective( ,  ) than diets with higher carbohydrate content. However, effects on blood lipid profiles for low-carbohydrates diets with substantial animal products were mixed, with low-carbohydrate diets resulting in greater improvements in high density lipoprotein but possibly less favorable change in low density lipoprotein than higher carbohydrate diets( - ). In addition, these diets can be high in red meat and low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains which has been shown to increase risk of chronic diseases( - ). On the other hand, the \u201cEco-Atkins\u201d diet, a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet with high amounts of plant protein and oils has shown to improve low density lipoprotein levels when compared with a high carbohydrate, lacto-ovo vegetarian diet ( ). Because the leading causes of death in the U.S.\u2013cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer( 14)\u2013develop over many years, long-term studies of low-carbohydrate diets are needed to evaluate effects on mortality. However, randomized trials of low-carbohydrate diets on mortality are not feasible because of the difficulty in maintaining compliance and follow-up over many years.\n We previously developed three scores to characterize low-carbohydrates based on the proportion of carbohydrate, fat, and protein in the diet, and the contribution to these macronutrients from animal or vegetable sources( ). We found that women with higher low-carbohydrate diet scores did not have greater risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease and that a low-carbohydrate dietary pattern that emphasized vegetable sources of fat and protein was associated with a lower risk of both( ,  ). However, long-term data on low-carbohydrate diets and mortality are scarce. Two European cohorts reported that a low-carbohydrate-high protein diet was associated with a weak but statistical significant higher mortality( ,  ). These studies included only a few hundred deaths, and did not evaluate different sources of proteins and fat.\n Therefore, we prospectively examined the relation between different types of low-carbohydrates diets and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in two large cohorts in the U. S.\n The Nurses&#39; Health Study (NHS) is a cohort study of 121,700 female nurses aged 30-55 years living in 11 U.S. states established in 1976 (  figure 1a). Questionnaires are sent biennially to collect medical, lifestyle, and other health-related information( ). In 1980, participants completed a 61-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This was expanded to 116 items in 1984 and similar FFQs were sent in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002.\n  The Health Professionals&#39; Follow-up Study (HPFS) was established in 1986 with 51,529 male podiatrists, optometrist, pharmacists, dentists, and veterinarians, aged 40 to 75 years (  figure 1b). Questionnaire similar to the NHS are sent every two years, and an FFQ was sent every four years( ). Each FFQ contained approximately 130 questions on food intake. Follow-up was complete for over 90% in each 2-year cycle for both cohorts.\n  For this analysis, we used 1980 as baseline for NHS when the first dietary data were collected. We included women who completed the 1980 FFQ with &lt;10 missing items and a plausible total energy intake (calculated from the FFQ, between 500 and 3500 kcal/day)( 21). For HPFS, we included men with total energy intake (calculated from the FFQ) of 800 to 4200 kcal/day at baseline and &lt;70 missing items. After excluding those with a history of cancer (women: 1579, men: 1998) (except non-melanoma skin cancer), heart disease (women: 772, men: 2077), and diabetes mellitus at baseline (women: 1858, men: 1284), we included 85,168 women with follow-up from 1980 through 2006, and 44,548 men with follow-up from 1986 to 2006. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital, Boston, MA.\n Self-administered semi-quantitative FFQs were designed to assess average food intake over the preceding year. A standard portion size and nine possible consumption frequency categories, from \u201cnever, or &lt;1/month\u201d to \u201c6+ times per day\u201d were given for each food. Total energy and nutrient intake was calculated by summing up from all foods. Previous validation studies revealed reasonably good correlations between energy-adjusted nutrients assessed by the FFQ and multiple food records completed over the preceding year in both NHS( 21) and HPFS( ).\n The computation of low-carbohydrate diet scores was previously described in detail( ). Briefly, percentages of energy from fat, protein, and carbohydrate were divided into deciles. For fat and protein, participants in the highest decile received 10 points for that macronutrient and participants in the ninth decile received 9 points, and so forth. For carbohydrate, the lowest decile received 10 points and the highest zero points. The fat, protein, and carbohydrate scores were summed to create the overall low-carbohydrate-diet score, which ranged from 0-30. In addition, we also created a vegetable low-carbohydrate score, based on percent of energy of carbohydrate, vegetable protein, and vegetable fat; and an animal low-carbohydrate score based on percent energy as carbohydrate, animal protein, and animal fat. Thus, each participant was given the overall, animal and vegetable scores.\n Deaths were identified from state vital statistics records, the National Death Index, reported by the families, and the postal system. Cause of death was identified from death certificates or review of medical records. For this analysis, we evaluated all-cause mortality, death from CVD (International Classification of Diseases, eighth revision [ICD-8] codes 390 through 458), cancer (ICD-8 codes 140 through 207), death from colorectal (ICD-8 codes 153-154), lung (ICD-8 code 162), breast (ICD-8 code 174), and prostate (ICD-8 code 185) cancers. The follow-up for death in both cohorts is at least 95% complete( ).\n Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight reported on each biennial questionnaire and height reported at the first questionnaire. Smoking status and number of cigarette use, history of hypertension, aspirin use (number of tablets and frequency of use), regular intake of multivitamin, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy, parity, and age at first birth were assessed every 2 years. In the NHS, hours per week of vigorous activities was collected in 1980, 1982, and 1984. Leisure-time physical activity was measured 7 times beginning in 1986 with validated questions on 10 common activities in NHS and biennially from baseline in HPFS. The information was then summed and calculated as Metabolic Equivalent Hours (METs)( ). In NHS, we inquired about physical examinations (for screening purposes or to evaluate symptoms) at baseline and in both cohorts every two years beginning in 1988. Family history (1 st degree relatives) of colorectal cancers, breast (women only), prostate cancer (men only), and information on having undergone colonoscopy and prostate specific antigen (PSA, men only) screening were also collected several times during follow-up.\n We used Cox proportional hazard models to assess the association between the three low-carbohydrate diet scores and risk of all-cause mortality during follow-up. In addition, we separately analyzed CVD mortality, overall cancer mortality, and the leading causes of cancer deaths: lung, colorectal, breast (women only), and prostate (men only). All analyses were conducted separately for each cohort.\n For analyses of all-cause, CVD, and cancer mortality, participants were divided into 10 categories (deciles) for each of the low-carbohydrate diet scores. For specific cancer deaths, participants were categorized into quintiles of low-carbohydrate diet scores because of smaller numbers of cases. To reduce random within-person variation and to best represent long-term dietary intake, we calculated cumulative averages of the 3 low-carbohydrate diet scores from our repeated FFQs ( ). For example, in NHS, the low-carbohydrate diet score in 1980 was used to predict mortality between 1980 and 1984, the average score from 1980 and 1984 was used to predict mortality from 1984 to 1986, and so forth with cumulative dietary information for the entire follow-up duration. The same procedure was used in HPFS. However, dietary intake was not updated when the participants reported a diagnosis of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease, or angina because these conditions may lead to changes in diet.\n In multivariate analyses, we adjusted for age (continuous), physical activity (quintiles), BMI (5 categories), energy intake (quintiles), alcohol intake (4 categories), history of hypertension (yes/no), smoking (5 categories), and multivitamin use (yes/no) with updated information at each 2 year questionnaire cycle. In women, we also adjusted for menopausal status and post menopausal hormone use (4 categories). In secondary analysis, we also adjusted for having gone through a physical examination (yes/no) at each 2 year questionnaire cycle as this may be related to early disease detection and hence better prognosis. Individuals with missing BMI were excluded from baseline (2%). Smoking status was missing for 0.2% of the participants in NHS and 4% participants in HPFS at baseline. These individuals were represented by a missing indicator variable for smoking.\n For analyses of deaths due to specific cancers, we used multivariate models that additionally included disease-specific risk factors. For breast cancer, we additionally adjusted for family history of breast cancer (yes/no), weight change since age 18 (7 categories), history of benign breast disease (yes/no), BMI at age 18 (4 categories), and height (4 categories). For analysis of prostate cancer, we additionally adjusted for family history of prostate cancer (yes/no), history of diabetes (yes/no), ethnicity (4 categories), height (5categories), vigorous (6+ METs) physical activity (quintiles), history of vasectomy (3 categories), BMI at age 21 (5categories), PSA screening (yes/no). For analysis of colorectal cancer, we additionally adjusted for history of colorectal polyps (yes/no), family history of colorectal cancer (yes/no), history colonoscopy (yes/no), aspirin use (yes/no). Cigarette smoking was modeled as pack years (5 categories). In analysis of lung cancer, covariates used in each cohort were slightly different due to availability of data. Therefore in women, we additionally adjusted for age at smoking initiation (continuous), and smoking status was modeled using six categories. In men, we adjusted for pack years (5 categories), parental smoking in childhood (3 categories), and adult environmental tobacco smoke exposure (4 categories).\n Hazard ratios from each cohort were also pooled to obtain a summary risk estimate using a random effects model that allows for between-study heterogeneity( ). P-values for heterogeneity of study results were calculated using the Cochran Q test. Proportional hazard assumption for total mortality was tested with a time dependent variable by including an interaction term between the low carbohydrate diet score and the \u201cmonth to death\u201d variable. Statistical analysis was conducted with SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC).\n As a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our analysis using only baseline dietary information, and corrected for measurement error ( ) in the assessment of the overall low-carbohydrate diet score using data from validation studies conducted in NHS ( 21) and HPFS ( ). To explore residual confounding, we adjusted for major confounders with finer categories or as continuous variables in separate regression models, as well as computing and adjusting for a propensity score ( ). We also conducted sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of our results from influence of unmeasured confounding ( ). We did not observe any material difference in results from these precautionary measures and therefore presented results with covariates adjusted in their original categories. We used a multiple imputation procedure, with 20 rounds of imputation and including all covariates to account for missing dietary and covariate data. We then repeated the analysis using non-cumulative updating of dietary information in which we use the most recent diet data to predict mortality ( 29).\n This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health. It had no role in the design and conduct of the study, analysis or interpretation of the data, or preparation or final approval of the manuscript before publication.\n In NHS with up to 26 years of follow-up, we documented 12,555 deaths, of which, 2,458 were cardiovascular deaths, and 5,780 were cancer deaths. Among the cancer deaths, 1,605 were from breast cancer, 547 from colorectal cancer, and 1,280 from lung cancer. In the HPFS with up to 20 years of follow-up, there were 8,678 deaths, of which 2,746 were CVD deaths, and 2,960 were cancer deaths. Among cancer deaths, 335 cases were from colorectal cancer, 563 from lung cancer, and 416 from prostate cancer.\n Both men and women who had higher overall and animal low-carbohydrate scores had higher BMI and more likely to be current smokers, but lower intakes of fruits and vegetables (  table 1). Conversely, those with higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score tended to have higher alcohol and whole grain intake. 1986 was chosen for consistency of data for men and women.\n *Baseline deciles for lifestyle characteristics and 1986 deciles for dietary intake. Data are means unless otherwise stated. BMI=body mass index, MET=metabolic equivalent hours.\n After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a modest but statistically higher risk for all-cause mortality with the animal low-carbohydrate score (HR comparing extreme deciles of animal score for HPFS=1.31, 95% CI=1.19-1.44, p trend&lt;0.001; for NHS: HR=1.17, 95% CI=1.08-1.26, p trend&lt;0.001) (  table 2). The pooled HR was 1.23 (95% CI=1.11-1.37, p trend=0.051). In both cohorts, similar inverse associations were observed between the vegetable score and all-cause mortality, with the pooled HR comparing extreme deciles=0.80 (95% CI=0.75-0.85, p trend&lt;0.001).\n *adjusted for age, physical activity, BMI, energy intake, alcohol intake, menopausal status and post menopausal hormone use, history of hypertension, smoking, multivitamin use.\n For CVD mortality, a modest but statistically significant direct association was observed with the overall low-carbohydrate score in men only (  table 3). However, the animal-based score showed a direct association in the pooled analysis (HR=1.14, 95% CI=1.01-1.29, p trend=0.029 for animal score). Results for the vegetable-based score were similar for men and women, and the pooled HR for CVD mortality was 0.77 (95% CI=0.68-0.87, p trend&lt;0.001) for extreme deciles.\n *adjusted for age, physical activity, BMI, energy intake, alcohol intake, menopausal status and post menopausal hormone use, history of hypertension, smoking, multivitamin use.\n For total cancer deaths, a statistically significant direct association was observed with the overall low-carbohydrate score in men (HR comparing extreme deciles1.32, 95% CI=1.11-1.57, p trend&lt;0.001) (  table 4). A slightly stronger association was observed with the animal low-carbohydrate score in men (HR=1.45, 95% CI=1.23-1.72, p trend&lt;0.001). However, the same association was weaker in women and did not reach statistical significance in the sensitivity analysis when smoking and physical activity was modeled in finer categories. In addition, no association was observed with the vegetable low-carbohydrate score in either men or women.\n *adjusted for age, physical activity, BMI, energy intake, alcohol intake, menopausal status and post menopausal hormone use, history of hypertension, smoking, multivitamin use.\n A direct association was observed between the animal low-carbohydrate score and colorectal cancer death when data were combined (HR comparing extreme quintiles=1.31, 95% CI=1.06-1.62, p trend=0.048) ( table 5, online appendix). In both cohorts, the overall and animal low-carbohydrate scores were positively associated with lung cancer mortality, with the pooled hazard ratio for the overall low-carbohydrate score of 1.22 (95% CI=1.05-1.42, p trend=0.003) comparing top to bottom quintiles ( table 5). The vegetable low-carbohydrate score was not associated with lung cancer deaths. After adjusting for risk factors relevant to specific cancers, none of the low-carbohydrate scores was associated with breast cancer or prostate cancer death.\n Additional adjustment for physical examinations to reduce the possibility of confounding by late detection and hence more fatal diseases showed similar results. We also repeated our analysis with continuous updating dietary information even after diagnosis of chronic diseases, but adjusted for the self-reported diagnosis in the regression models. In both cohorts, neither the relative risks nor the p-values were changed. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison for gender-specific analysis did not change the conclusion of the results for all-cause, CVD, or cancer mortality, and statistically significant associations remained significant.\n Less than 25% of either NHS or HPFS participants missed more than 2 FFQs during the follow-up period. However, results for the animal and vegetable low carbohydrate scores remained statistically significant when the multiple imputation procedure was used to account for missing data. In NHS, the HR for a 10 point increase in the animal score was 1.09 (p&lt;0.0001) for total mortality and the c\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-22 11:42:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u996e\u98df,diets", "title": "\u4f4e\u78b3\u6c34\u5316\u5408\u7269\u996e\u98df\u548c\u5168\u56e0\u548c\u9020\u6210\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387 ", "title_en": "Low-carbohydrate diets and all-cause and cause-specific mortality", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989112/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u996e\u98df", "diets"]}]
