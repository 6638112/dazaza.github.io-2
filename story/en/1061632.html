And he was frustrated over being nickel-and-dimed, seeing his wages steadily decrease. The added risk of contracting the coronavirus was enough to convince him to  log off in a panic in March 2020, quitting cold turkey after he dropped a passenger off near a hospital.</p><p> 但在三年以上超过15,000次旅行之后，他从驾驶的日常压力中疲惫不堪。他对镍级和萧条令人沮丧，看到他的工资稳步下降。加合冠状病毒的额外风险足以让他在2020年3月在恐慌中注销，在靠近医院乘客之后退出冷火鸡。</p><p> Now vaccinated and in search of good work, Gregg says he is in no hurry to return to Uber or Lyft. He said unemployment tided him over during the pandemic and a recent move to Modesto, Calif., from the San Francisco Bay area had lowered his cost of living.</p><p> 现在接种疫苗并寻找良好的工作，格雷格说他不急于回到优步或Lyft。他说失业率在大流行期间和加利福尼亚州的莫德斯托举行的迁至莫德斯托举行，从旧金山湾区降低了他的生活成本。</p><p>  “I can never go back,” Gregg, 53, said in an interview before hedging, “I can never say never. … It was a great journey but it ended hard.”</p><p>  “我永远不能回去，”格雷格，53，在对冲之前在采访中说：“我永远不能说永远不会。 ......这是一个伟大的旅程，但它结束了。“</p><p>  Uber and Lyft are facing a supply shortage, as returning and newly vaccinated customers again flood the apps, only to find out there aren’t enough drivers to serve them. It’s resulting in longer wait times and higher fares for riders. The companies cited  drivers’ ongoing hesitance regarding fears of contracting the  coronavirus and lingering concerns that demand has dried up, even as customers in many major cities have resumed riding. Uber and Lyft are offering incentives and paying out what they say are record wages as they attempt to lure drivers back to the apps.</p><p>  优步和Lyft正面临着供应短缺，返回和新接种疫苗的客户再次泛滥应用程序，只能找出不够的司机来服务它们。它导致骑手的等待时间和更高的船员。这些公司引用了司机，即使在许多主要城市的客户恢复骑行时，也担心将需求干涸的恐惧和挥之不去的担忧。优步和Lyft正在提供激励措施并支付他们所说的是记录工资，因为他们试图诱惑司机返回应用程序。</p><p>  “One of our top priorities is to rebuild the driver base,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday’s company earnings call. “With demand currently outstripping supply, driver earnings are at historically elevated levels.”</p><p>  “我们的首要任务之一是重建司机基地，”优步首席执行官Dara Khosrowshahi在周三的公司盈利通话时表示。 “随着目前推出供应的需求，司机收益处于历史上升升高。”</p><p>  Lyft Chief Financial Officer Brian Roberts echoed those remarks on the company’s call this week, noting that the dynamic “led to record earnings for drivers in most U.S. cities.” The company’s CEO, Logan Green, said he expected drivers to return as gig workers come off unemployment as the year goes on and demand for delivery apps falls as businesses fully reopen.</p><p>  Lyft首席财务官Brian Roberts本周对公司的呼吁呼应了这些言论，并指出动态“导致大多数美国城市的司机收入。”该公司的首席执行官Logan Green表示，他预计随着Gig Workers抵消失业的预计驾驶员，随着年内的开展，随着企业完全重新开放的情况下降而下降。 </p><p> “We think that in [the third quarter] and beyond, we’ll start to see some … trends that should give us real tail winds on the driver side,” he said on the company’s earnings call.</p><p>“我们认为，在[第三季度]及以后，我们将开始看到一些......趋势应该在驾驶员方面给我们真正的尾风，”他对公司的盈利电话表示。</p><p> The shortage is in part prompted by workers such as Gregg, who left the app when the risks of driving during the coronavirus were highest and the vectors of transmission were not completely understood. Demand was  down by as much as 75 percent in the United States as the pandemic set in, the  companies said. Now Uber faces a supply shortage even as more than two-thirds of the ride-hailing demand has recovered, when gross bookings are compared with April 2019, according to Khosrowshahi.</p><p> 短缺部分部分由Gregg等工人提示，当冠状病毒期间的驾驶风险最高并且不完全理解传输量的驾驶风险时离开了应用程序。该公司表示，美国随着大流行病的需求下降了75％。根据Khosrowshahi的说法，Uber甚至在速度预订量的速度预订时，Uber甚至面临的供应短缺。</p><p>  Uber last month announced a $250 million incentive program to boost driver earnings in an effort to encourage drivers to come back. The company said median wages are also up in major cities because there are more  customers seeking trips than drivers to provide them, hiking up fares.</p><p>  Uber上个月宣布了2.5亿美元的激励计划，以鼓励司机回来的努力。该公司表示，中位数工资也在主要城市，因为有更多的客户寻求旅行而不是司机提供他们，徒步旅行。</p><p>   But drivers said the coronavirus pandemic provided the first glimpse in years at what a life after Uber could look like. For many of them, it was a meaningful reset that gave them a better understanding of the toll the gigs had taken on their bodies, their mental health and their vehicles. It was the push they needed to finally begin their lives after Uber.</p><p>   但司机表示，冠状病毒大流行在优步之后的生活中的寿命中提供了第一次瞥见。对于其中的许多人来说，这是一个有意义的重置，让他们更好地了解Gigs在身体上采取的损失，他们的心理健康和他们的车辆。这是推动他们在优步之后最终开始他们的生活。</p><p> Some of the drivers said they realized the ride-hailing gigs were not the same jobs they signed up for in the early days of the apps. In the early days, they were incentivized with promotions and what they regarded as sustainable wages, taking more than $1,000 in pay from a full workweek. But as the apps took off, pay models changed and earnings slowly dwindled as drivers saw their weekly pay fall into the hundreds.</p><p> 有些司机表示，他们意识到乘车的演出在应用程序的早期没有与他们注册的工作不同样的工作。在早期，他们随着晋升和他们被视为可持续工资的促销而激励，从一份全工作周上支付超过1000美元。但随着应用所起飞的，随着司机看到他们的每周支付落入数百人，付费模型慢慢地被贬低了。</p><p>  “It’s very much not a career,” said Lyft driver Bruce Blood, 34, of Los Angeles, who has taken advantage of the higher wages but has also dealt with the fallout. “Passengers are angrier. When they get in my car, they are angrier about the time they’ve had to wait or the price that they’re being charged.”</p><p>  “这不是一个职业生涯，”洛杉矶34岁的Lyft司机布鲁斯血统表示，洛杉矶34岁，洛杉矶有利于较高的工资，但也处理了堕落。 “乘客是愤怒。当他们进入我的车时，他们是他们必须等待或他们被收取的价格的时候愤怒。“</p><p>   One day recently, for example, Lyft sent him 30 minutes out of his way to pick up a passenger who was in a foul mood. When Blood called to say he had arrived, the passenger hurled a profanity at him as he complained that two previous drivers had canceled. The passenger abruptly hung up and was hit with a no-show fee.</p><p>   例如，有一天，例如，Lyft派他30分钟从他的路上拿起一个陷入犯规情绪的乘客。当血液叫说他已经到了时，乘客会对他带来巨大的巨大，因为他抱怨两个先前的司机已经取消了。乘客突然挂了，并被禁止的费用击中。 </p><p> “I collected two dollars,” Blood said. “So that’s an example of what I deal with.”</p><p>“我收集了两美元，”血液说。 “所以这就是我处理的例子。”</p><p>  Uber is also a changed business. Wednesday’s earnings report showed, for example, that Uber Eats made up almost  two-thirds of the company’s gross bookings, or the total it takes in from customers. That was a complete reversal from the first quarter of 2019, when rides made up about  80 percent of the business.</p><p>  优步也是一个改变的业务。例如，星期三的盈利报告显示，优步饮食近三分之二的公司预订，或者来自客户所需的总数。这是从2019年第一季度的完全逆转，当时乘坐约80％的业务。</p><p>  Many of the drivers who stopped giving rides switched to delivering food, which was seen as a less risky gig but with lower pay. Harry Campbell, founder  of the popular blog the  Rideshare Guy, which provides information and resources for gig workers, said many turned to food delivery through Uber, DoorDash or other apps as demand exploded for delivery of meals and household items.</p><p>  许多停止乘坐游乐设施的司机转向提供食物，这被视为较少的风险演出，但工资较低。 Harry Campbell是博客的创始人，德里亚克·戈雷什巴尔（Rideshare Guy）为Gig Workers提供信息和资源，称，随着需求爆炸供应膳食和家居用品的需求，许多人通过优步，Doordash或其他应用程序转向食物交付。</p><p>  Uber’s tense relationship with its contract workforce has also played a part in the shortage, some drivers say. Through a ballot measure called Proposition 22, Uber and other gig economy companies in November defeated an effort to make California drivers full employees, which would have entitled them to benefits such as health insurance, a minimum wage and unemployment.</p><p>  有些司机说，优步与合同劳动力的紧张关系也在短缺中发挥了作用。通过名为“主题”第22号的选票措施，11月的优步和其他演出经济公司击败了加利福尼亚州的全部雇员的努力，这些员工将有权获得健康保险，最低工资和失业的福利。</p><p>  Khosrowshahi said on the call that driver earnings are at “historically elevated levels,” with median earnings of $37 an hour in New York and Philadelphia, $36 in Chicago and $33 in Austin, well over what drivers might typically earn. Experts said that lines up with what drivers have been finding as they have logged back onto the app.</p><p>  Khosrowshahi对驾驶员收入的呼吁表示，“历史上升升高”，纽约和费城的中位数为37美元，芝加哥36美元，奥斯汀33美元，超过司机通常可以获得的司机。专家表示，与他们登录应用程序时，驾驶员的排队都在一起。</p><p>  “It seems like the good old days again, with strategic drivers averaging $40 to $50 per hour in major cities right now but I don’t expect it to last,” Campbell said.</p><p>  “这似乎再次又一次的旧日子，战略司机现在主要城市每小时平均每小时40％至50美元，但我不希望它持续，”坎贝尔说。</p><p>  But even with higher earnings potential, drivers are under little impression the changes will last.</p><p>  但即使有更高的收益潜力，司机也会对压力很少，更改将持续变化。 </p><p>  Uber passenger Jonah Bliss experienced the effects of the driver shortage firsthand. The Los Angeles resident, 33, said he had difficulty finding a nearby ride twice in a matter of weeks.</p><p>优步乘客乔纳·布莱斯首次经历了司机短缺的影响。 33岁的洛杉矶居民表示，他在几周内遇到两次附近的骑行。</p><p> One morning, as he sought to travel three miles between residential neighborhoods, his app indicated the driver was 10 minutes away. That was longer than usual, but he accepted the ride. But as time went on he saw the driver wasn’t inching any closer; in the mean time, Uber offered him quicker rides for higher fares, all the way up to about  $65.</p><p> 一天早上，当他试图在住宅街区之间旅行三英里时，他的应用程序表示驾驶员距离酒店有10分钟路程。比平常更长，但他接受了骑行。但随着时间的推移，他看到司机没有近距离;与此同时，优步给他更快地乘坐更高的票价，一直达到65美元。</p><p>  Uber swapped drivers until one finally arrived after about half an hour, and the trip cost $25 — double what he would typically pay. He had a similar experience traveling from his apartment in a densely populated neighborhood to a doctor’s appointment, as he waited 15 minutes for a driver to show up.</p><p>  优步交换司机，直到终于半小时后终于到达，旅行费用25美元 - 他通常支付的两倍。他在一个浓密的居住的街区到医生预约，他的公寓旅行了类似的经验，因为他等了15分钟的司机出现。</p><p>  “It was like, if I needed to rely on this regularly, I would just have to bake in an extra 20 minutes to get anywhere,” he said.</p><p>  “就像我需要经常依靠这个一样，我只需要烘烤20分钟才能到达任何地方，”他说。</p><p>  The Prop 22 campaign drew attention to the harsh working conditions and meager wages drivers can face on the job. And for some drivers, it exhausted any goodwill they might have toward the apps, which are now in need of workers.</p><p>  Prop 22活动提请注意苛刻的工作条件，微薄工资司机可以面对工作。对于一些司机来说，它耗尽了他们可能对应用程序的任何善意，现在需要工人。</p><p>  Uber made changes aimed at placating drivers in an effort to show they were independent of its control, and thus didn’t need to be made employees under the state law. But amid the driver shortage, Uber has rescinded at least one of those options for California drivers: the ability to set their own fare multipliers, which had resulted in some passengers receiving offers to be picked up faster if they paid higher, and sometimes even exorbitant, fares.</p><p>  优步做出了旨在安抚司机的改变，以表明他们独立于其控制，因此不需要在国家法律下制造员工。但在驾驶员短缺中，优步已经谴责了加州司机的至少一个选项：设定自己的乘客乘客的能力，这导致一些乘客收到更多的乘客如果他们支付更高，并且有时甚至过高，票价。</p><p>  “I think if you’re a smart driver, you wouldn’t trust anything that Uber says,” said Maryann Hrichak, 63, who drove for Uber from 2014 up until July 2019.</p><p>  “我认为如果你是一个聪明的司机，你就不会相信一些超级所说的，”马里安赫希克说，63人，他们从2014年开车到2019年7月。 </p><p>  Hrichak recalled how she joined the app at a time when it was growing and the competitive wages, combined with driver incentives and opportunities to meet new people and explore the city, made the experience worthwhile, even fun. But that impression didn’t last. As time went on, she said, her $1,500-per-week earnings dwindled to half of that, if she was lucky, and even less some weeks. Uber’s treatment of drivers left a sour taste in her mouth.</p><p>Hrichak回顾了她在越来越多的时候如何加入应用程序和竞争的工资，结合驾驶奖励和迎接新人并探索城市的机会，使得体验有价值，甚至有趣。但这种印象没有持久。她说，她说，如果她很幸运，她每周1,500美元的收益减少了一半，甚至少了几个星期。优步对司机的治疗在她的嘴里留下了酸味。</p><p> “Uber started chunking away at the drivers’ pay,” she said. “I think they slowly chipped away until they exhausted all the goodwill. You couldn’t make any money. … The trust has been eroded, and I don’t know, when you erode trust like that in a company like Uber, I don’t know how you get that back.”</p><p> “优步开始在司机的工资上划分，”她说。 “我觉得他们慢慢地削弱，直到他们用尽了所有的善意。你不能赚钱。 ......信任已经被侵蚀，我不知道，当你像超级公司这样的公司侵蚀的信任时，我不知道你是如何得到的。“</p><p>  Uber spokesman Matthew Wing said the onus is on the company to gain drivers’ trust.</p><p>  Uber发言人Matthew Wing表示，Onus是公司，以获得司机的信任。</p><p> “Drivers have a lot of choices — it’s our job to earn their trust every day and make driving with Uber worth their while,” he said.</p><p> “司机有很多选择 - 这是我们每天赢得信任的工作，并用优步驾驶价值，”他说。</p><p> Gregg, the driver who moved from the Bay Area city of Antioch to Modesto during the pandemic, was conflicted as he learned about all Uber was doing to bring drivers back into the fold.</p><p> GREGG，驾驶员从海湾地区的安提阿搬迁到大流行期间莫德斯托，因为他了解到所有优步都在做的事情，让司机带回折叠。</p><p> “I’ve seen what they’re capable of,” said Gregg, who has been involved in organizing efforts  in support of drivers. “The bear is still the bear: You don’t stick your head in their mouth.”</p><p> “我已经看到了他们的能力，”格雷格说，他们参与组织支持司机的努力。 “熊还是熊：你不要把头伸在嘴里。”</p><p> At the same time, he added, “I could I think be lured into doing it on the side or something.”</p><p> 与此同时，他补充道，“我可以认为在一边或某事上诱惑。” </p><p>     The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.</p><p>当天最重要的新闻故事，由邮政编辑策划并每天早上交付。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/07/uber-lyft-drivers/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/07/uber-lyft-drivers/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/优步/">#优步</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/uber/">#uber</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/司机/">#司机</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
