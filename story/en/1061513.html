Instead, the world learned Friday that  just 266,000 jobs were added, a massive disappointment that raises questions about whether the recovery is on track.</p><p>从华尔街到白宫，4月份招聘飙升的预期很高，潜在的百万美国人回归工作。相反，世界上学到星期五，只增加了266,000个工作，这是一个大规模的失望，提出了关于恢复是否正在进行的问题。</p><p>  President Biden’s team has vowed that its massive stimulus package will recover all the remaining jobs lost during the pandemic in about a year, but that promise won’t be kept unless there’s a big pickup in hiring soon. There are still 8.2 million jobs left to recover. At the same time, business leaders and Republicans are complaining that  there is a “worker shortage,” and they largely blame the more generous unemployment payments and stimulus checks for making people less likely to take low-paying fast food and retail jobs again. Democratic economists counter that companies could raise pay if they really wanted workers back quickly.</p><p>  拜登总统的团队发誓，其大规模的刺激计划将在大约一年内恢复大流行期间失去的所有剩余工作，但除非很快招聘，否则不会保留这一承诺。仍有820万件工作恢复。与此同时，商业领袖和共和党人抱怨有一个“工人短缺”，他们在很大程度上归咎于更慷慨的失业率支付和刺激检查，让人民再次减少快餐和零售业。民主经济学家柜台，如果他们真正想要迅速的工人，那么公司可以提高工资。</p><p> One way to make sense of this weak jobs report is to do what Wall Street did and shrug it off as an anomaly. Stocks still rose Friday as investors saw this as a blip. They think there is just a lag in hiring and more people will return to work as they get vaccinated. And they point out oddball months have occurred before, especially with some weird quirks in the Labor Department’s seasonal adjustments.</p><p> 理解这一弱职位的一种方法是做华尔街所做的事情并将其作为异常耸耸肩。随着投资者认为这是一个昙花一现，股票仍然上涨。他们认为招聘中只有滞后，更多的人会在接种疫苗时重返工作岗位。他们之前已经发生了奇怪的月份，特别是在劳工处的季节性调整中有一些奇怪的怪癖。</p><p>  “With the U.S. economy rapidly reopening, and news of pockets of labor shortages emerging, the markets should treat today’s number as an anomaly in a generally positive upward trend,” wrote Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, to clients.</p><p>  “随着美国经济迅速重新开放，劳动力短缺的新兴新兴的消息，市场应该以一般积极的上升趋势为一个大规模的异常来对待今天的数量，”主要全球投资者的首席战略家为客户编写Shah Shah Shah Shah Shah。</p><p>   But another way to look at this is there is a great reassessment going on in the U.S. economy. It’s happening on a lot of different levels. At the most basic level, people are still hesitant to return to work until they are fully vaccinated and their children are back in school and day care full time. For example, all the job gains in April went to men. The number of women employed or looking for work fell by 64,000, a reminder that child-care issues are still in play.</p><p>   但另一种方式来看这是在美国经济中进行了大量重新评估。它正在发生很多不同的级别。在最基本的层面，人们仍然犹豫不决，直到他们完全接种疫苗，孩子们回到学校和日托全职。例如，4月份的所有工作收益都去了男人。雇用或寻找工作的妇女人数下降了64,000人，提醒人们仍在发挥儿童保育问题。</p><p>  There is also growing evidence — both anecdotal and in surveys — that a lot of people want to do something different with their lives than they did before the pandemic. The  coronavirus outbreak has had a dramatic psychological effect on workers, and people are reassessing what they want to do and how they want to work, whether in an office, at home or some hybrid combination.</p><p>  还有日益增长的证据 - 轶事和调查 - 很多人都希望与他们的生活做些不同于他们在大流行前做的事情。冠状病毒爆发对工人进行了巨大巨大的心理影响，人们重新评估他们想要做什么以及他们如何在办公室，家庭或一些混合组合工作。</p><p> A Pew Research Center survey this year found that  66 percent of the unemployed had “seriously considered” changing their field of work, a far greater percentage than during the Great Recession. People who used to work in restaurants or travel are finding higher-paying jobs in warehouses or real estate, for example. Or they want a job that is more stable and less likely to be exposed to the coronavirus — or any other deadly virus down the road. Consider that grocery stores shed over 49,000 workers in April and nursing care facilities lost nearly 20,000.</p><p> 今年的PEW研究中心调查发现，66％的失业人士“认真考虑”改变了他们的工作领域，比在巨大经济衰退期间更大的百分比。例如，曾经在餐馆或旅行中工作的人在仓库或房地产中找到更高的薪水工作。或者他们想要一个更稳定的工作，更不可能暴露在冠状病毒 - 或任何其他致命的病毒下方。考虑到杂货店在4月份的49,000多名工人铺设了49,000名工人，养老金设施近20,000。 </p><p>  Economists describe this phenomenon as reallocation friction, the idea that the types of jobs in the economy are changing and workers are taking awhile to figure out what new jobs they want — or what skills they need for different roles.</p><p>经济学家将这种现象描述为重新分配摩擦，这一观点是经济中的工作类型正在变化，工人需要一段时间来弄清楚他们想要的新工作 - 或者他们需要不同角色的技能。</p><p>   “Clearly, there are industries in both manufacturing and services that are eager to beef up staff as the pace of economic activity accelerates. But those efforts are being frustrated. In some cases, the problem is a mismatch in skills. You can’t train a one-time courier on a bike to become an IT specialist overnight,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.</p><p>   “显然，随着经济活动的步伐加速，有令人渴望的制造和服务的行业。但这些努力受到沮丧。在某些情况下，问题是技能不匹配。经济展望集团首席全球经济学家Bernard Baumohl表示，您无法在骑自行车上培训一辆自行车成为IT专家。“</p><p>  Tim and Sara Wojtala are a young couple completely rethinking their careers due to the pandemic. Tim worked for years as a manager at major retailer. Last year, he was frustrated by what he felt were lax safety conditions at work and having to deal with irate customers who didn’t want to wear masks. He quit in the fall as the virus surged again. Now he’s going to school to become a wind turbine technician through a program backed by the government. Sara also spent many years in retail and wants to do something more meaningful now.</p><p>  Tim和Sara Wojtala是一对年轻夫妇，完全重新思考他们的职业生涯。蒂姆曾在主要零售商的经理工作过多年。去年，他感到沮丧，他觉得在工作中是宽松的安全条件，并且不得不处理不想戴上面具的令牌客户。当病毒再次飙升时，他在秋天辞职。现在他正在学校通过政府支持的计划成为风力涡轮机技术人员。萨拉还在零售中花了多年，并希望现在做一些更有意义的事情。</p><p> “The problem is we are not making enough money to make it worth it to go back to these jobs that are difficult and dirty and usually thankless. You’re getting yelled at and disrespected all day. It’s hell,” said Sara, who is 31. She added that with two young kids, finding child care has also been a huge issue lately.</p><p> “问题是我们没有做足够的钱来让它回到这些困难和肮脏的工作，通常是有意义的。你一整天都在喊叫并不尊重。这是地狱，“萨拉说，谁是31岁。她补充说，随着两个小孩，发现幼儿园最近也是一个巨大的问题。</p><p>   The couple have decided to sell their suburban Detroit home and buy a camper van to travel the country. They hope to home-school their kids and spend more time as a family.</p><p>   这对夫妇决定销售他们的郊区底特律家，买一个露营车以旅行国家。他们希望在家学校他们的孩子，并花费更多时间作为一个家庭。</p><p> “During the pandemic, I grew to really appreciate my family,” said Tim, who is 37. “We always thought we were a middle-class family that would do the same plan as our parents. Now we’re both just excited at the prospect of a different way of living life.”</p><p> “在大流行期间，我长大了，真的很欣赏我的家人，”蒂姆说，谁是37岁。“我们总是认为我们是一个中产阶级的家庭，可以做与我们父母相同的计划。现在我们都只是在不同生活方式的前景中兴奋。“</p><p> Wage data from April is also telling. When companies, especially fast-food restaurants, complain they can’t find workers, the common retort is, “Why don’t these companies raise pay?” In fact, there is evidence that restaurants are raising pay. The average hourly rate in the hospitality sector is up roughly $1 compared to the pre-pandemic going rate. But the bigger issue appears to be that warehouses have hiked wages by more than a dollar and now pay $26 an hour on average — far more than the roughly $18 average in hospitality.</p><p> 4月份的工资数据也在讲述。当公司，特别是快餐店，抱怨他们找不到工人时，共同的蒸煮是，“为什么这些公司不提高支付？”事实上，有证据表明餐馆正在提高薪酬。与前大流行前的速度相比，酒店的平均每小时率大约1美元。但更大的问题似乎是仓库已经超过一美元的工资，现在平均支付26美元 - 远远超过大约18美元的款待。 </p><p>  Even among those who have jobs, people are rethinking their options. Front-line workers are reporting high levels of burnout, causing some to seek a new career path. There’s also been a wave of retirements as workers over 50 quit because they don’t want to return to teaching, home health care or other front-line jobs. More affluent Americans say they are retiring early because their retirement portfolios have surged in the past year and the pandemic has taught them that life is short. They don’t want to spend as much time at a desk, even if it is safe.</p><p>即使是那些有工作的人，人们也在重新思考他们的选择。前线工人报告了高水平的倦怠，导致一些寻求新的职业道路。由于50岁以上的工人，还有一波退休，因为他们不想返回教学，家庭医疗保健或其他前线工作。更富裕的美国人说他们早早退休，因为过去一年的退休投资组合飙升，大流行教导了他们的生活是短暂的。他们不想在桌子上花费尽可能多的时间，即使它是安全的。</p><p>   Alison Detrick used to clean houses in New Orleans. She cut her hourly rate in half last summer  to lure clients back. But she lost nearly an entire month of work in the fall when two of her clients contracted the coronavirus. Detrick didn’t get the virus, but she had to get tested and quarantine, losing much needed pay.</p><p>   Alison Detrick过去常常在新奥尔良清洁房屋。她在去年夏天的一半左右削减了她的每小时率来吸引客户。但是当她的两个客户收缩冠状病毒时，她在秋天丢失了几个月的工作。 Detrick没有得到病毒，但她必须获得测试和检疫，失去了急需的工资。</p><p> Today, Detrick works at a call center. It’s not as flexible of a job, but she says it pays well and she can do it from the safety of her home. She transitioned quickly, but others will take time.</p><p> 今天，Detrick在呼叫中心工作。这并不灵活，但她说它付出了很好，她可以从她家的安全方面做到。她迅速过渡，但其他人会花时间。</p><p> Companies are also doing a reassessment of how many workers they need and in what capacities. Economists have been warning for months that some jobs won’t come back, especially jobs like hotel check in desk workers, valets, toll booth collectors and some serving jobs that can be automated. There’s also an ongoing decline in employment of administrative support staff. Temporary office help declined by 115,000 in April.</p><p> 公司还在重新评估他们需要的工作人员以及在哪些能力。经济学家一直警告几个月，一些工作不会回来，特别是在酒店办理咨询台工作人员，代客，收费展位收藏家和一些可以自动的工作工作的工作。行政支持人员的就业也持续下降。 4月份临时办公室帮助下降了115,000。</p><p>   Two supposedly hot areas of the economy — manufacturing and construction — also had surprisingly weak hiring, with manufacturing shedding 18,000 jobs and construction flat. Supply chain holdups are forcing factories and construction sites to slow down or even  shut down for a while. But it’s notable that the manufacturing sector has bounced back strongly, yet the industry has only added back about 60 percent of the jobs lost. This suggests many factories are ramping up automation in a way that allows them to do more with fewer workers.</p><p>   两个据说热门的经济领域 - 制造业和建筑 - 招聘人士令人惊讶的是，招聘疲弱，制造业脱落18,000名岗位和建筑公寓。供应链持有迫使工厂和建筑工地减速或甚至关闭一段时间。但是，制造业的强烈反弹是值得注意的，但该行业只增加了大约60％的工作损失。这表明许多工厂正在以一种允许他们用更少的工人做更多做更多的方式来增加自动化。</p><p> The overall expectation is still for hiring to pick up this summer as the economy reopens fully and more people are vaccinated. But the past year has fundamentally changed the economy and what many Americans want in their working life. This big reassessment — for companies and workers — is going to take awhile to sort out and it could continue to pop up in surprising ways.</p><p> 整体期望仍然是为了招聘今年夏天，因为经济全面重新打开，更多的人接种疫苗。但过去的一年从根本上改变了经济以及许多美国人在工作生活中想要的东西。这种重新评估 - 为公司和工人 - 将要考虑一下，它可以继续以惊人的方式弹出。</p><p>     The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.</p><p>     当天最重要的新闻故事，由邮政编辑策划并每天早上交付。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/07/jobs-report-labor-shortage-analysis/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
