Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  The Latin American venture capital market for early-stage startups  had a number of similar hallmarks. That shouldn\u2019t have been surprising. According to  Seth Pierrepont, a partner at London-based Accel, \u201cfundraising dynamics are now no longer U.S.- or European-specific \u2014 they\u2019re global.\u201d Fundraising over videoconferencing services like Zoom has done more than make geographical distances less impactful inside of countries \u2014 it\u2019s even made national borders and even oceans less meaningful.\n Is the European startup market similar to what we\u2019ve seen in Latin America and the United States \u2014 a cognate for the North American venture capital scene, given its outsized global weight by round count and amount invested?\n Largely, yes, a trend that appears to be shaking up prices and the talent wars. This morning, we\u2019re taking a final look at the early-stage venture capital market, this time through a European lens, with an assist from a few investors from the continent.\n  Broadly, early-stage venture capital rounds in Europe are happening \u201cearlier and are larger in size,\u201d according to  Draper Esprit\u2019s Vinoth Jayakumar, an investor based in London. The correlate of larger rounds being raised while startups are younger is valuation expansion, according to Jayakumar, who said that prices are going up \u201cbecause larger rounds are very dilutive to founders if done at normal \u2014 or in this case too low \u2014 valuations.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:44:10", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7ea7\u8054,stage,\u65e9\u671f", "title": "\u665a\u671f\u8d44\u672c\u6b63\u5728\u6b27\u6d32VC\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u201c\u7ea7\u8054\u6548\u5e94\u201d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tLate-stage capital is having a \u2018cascading effect\u2019 on European VC activity\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/late-stage-capital-is-having-a-cascading-effect-on-european-vc-activity/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ea7\u8054", "stage", "\u65e9\u671f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c58481466e15dddd3dcc1f8ad5060b0f.gif", "infoid": 1068606, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u672c\u5468\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u9884\u5907\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5168\u90e8 -

Starship has completed quite a few test flights to date, including one that went as well as could be expected right from launch to landing.\n The first orbital test of Starship is a significant milestone for the spacecraft\u2019s development program, and if it does indeed happen in July that\u2019s an impressive turnaround for the launch company, which has been working on both Starship and its Super Heavy booster in south Texas.\n Getting to orbit with Starship won\u2019t mean that SpaceX is ready to use the vehicle for commercial missions, however; this first attempt, which if the history of rocket testing is any indication, might not go so well, will just be about seeing how the prototype handles space. SpaceX will use later tests to refine other key components of Starship, including its controlled re-entry and landing burn.\n Before Starship can attempt to leave Earth\u2019s atmospheric confines, it needs to get clearance from the FAA to even do so, and that\u2019s still pending. SpaceX and the FAA seem to have a somewhat fraught relationship, however, especially as regards Starship testing.\n   Virgin Galactic is gearing up for a final series of crewed test flights before it begins taking its paying passengers up to space. It also just  received approval from the FAA for its \u2018spaceline\u2019 operator\u2019s license, which is like an airline but with space.\n This is an adaptation of its existing commercial spaceflight license that now allows it to also begin transporting paying passengers, including space tourists and researchers, to low Earth orbit using its SpaceShipTwo vehicle. That\u2019s a key ingredient, but the company will still be doing its series of three test flights, the first ever with a full crew on board, before it actually does begin operating in that capacity. Richard Branson is set to be a passenger on the second of those three test flights, according to the current plan.\n  tartup  Orbion has raised a $20 million Series B for its plasma thruster technology. Plasma thrusters are a key means of in-space propulsion, and that\u2019s a booming sector in light of the emergence of more and more small spacecraft operators as low Earth orbit becomes a high-traffic zone.\n Orbion\u2019s approach reduces the cost of production and, by extension, the cost to its clients, which puts the technology more within reach for resource-constrained satellite startups.\n  Last year we held our first dedicated space event, and it went so well that we decided to host it again in 2021. This year, it\u2019s happening December 14 and 15, and it\u2019s once again going to be an entirely virtual conference, so people from all over the world will be able to join \u2014 and  you can, too.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:43:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bb8\u53ef,licensed,\u7a7a\u95f4", "title": "MAX\u95ee\uff1a\u8bb8\u53ef\u7a7a\u95f4 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMax Q: Licensed to space\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/max-q-licensed-to-space/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bb8\u53ef", "licensed", "\u7a7a\u95f4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4feb8d299ddac75b8e525c87223083db.jpg", "infoid": 1068605, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2018\u5e74\uff0cTrauma Surgeon Dr.alex Young\u57f9\u8bad\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u7b49\u9ad8\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u666f\u6240\u9700\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6fc0\u8fdb\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n \u4ed6\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u53f0Virti\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7531IQ Capital\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u5217\u7531Cedars-Sinai Medical Center\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u82f1\u56fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672fVC\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u8131\u53e3\u8d44\u672c\u52a0\u5165\u3002\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\uff0cKurt Kratchman\u548cMark Ashworth\u5206\u522b\u4eceOracle\u4f5c\u4e3aCRO\u548cCFO / COO\u3002\n  \u5728\u82f1\u56fd\u5e03\u91cc\u65af\u6258\u5c14\u6210\u7acb\uff0cVirti\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u684c\u9762\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6216VR / AR\u8033\u673a\uff0c\u5e76\u6355\u83b7\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u4e2a\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u5458\u5de5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u91cf\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u5ba2\u89c2\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b83\u751a\u81f3\u8bbe\u6cd5\u88ab\u547d\u540d\u4e3a2020\u5e74\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u53d1\u660e\u3002\n Virti\u58f0\u79f0\u5176\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6b63\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u57f9\u8bad\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe230\uff05\uff0c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u589e\u52a0\u4e86978\uff05\u7684\u6536\u5165\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e91\u7684\u65e0\u4ee3\u7801\u4eff\u771f\u521b\u5efa\u5957\u4ef6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u57f9\u8bad\u6a21\u5757\u3002\n Vieti\u7684\u4e9a\u5386\u5c71\u5927\u00b7\u6768\u535a\u58eb\u535a\u58eb\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e86\uff1a\u201c\u5728Vieti\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u4f53\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u60e0\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6700\u5927\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u4eba\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u59cb\u7ec8\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u5f80\u5f80\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u6302\u8d77 -

In additional news, Kurt Kratchman and Mark Ashworth join Virti from Oracle as CRO and CFO/COO respectively.\n  Founded in Bristol, UK, the  Virti platform works across mobile or desktop devices, or VR/AR headsets and captures data across all three to analyze, measure, and give feedback on employee performance, turning a lot of subjectively assessed skills into more objective and measurable data. It\u2019s even managed to have been named one of TIME\u2019s Best Inventions of 2020.\n Virti claims its deep learning technology is improving training outcomes by up to 230% and the startups says it has increased revenues by 978%. It also has a cloud-based, no-code simulation creation suite allowing organizations to build their own bespoke training modules.\n Dr Alexander Young, CEO and founder of Virti, commented: \u201cAt Virti, our goal is to maximize human performance by making experiential learning affordable and accessible for everyone. In-person training has always been expensive with e-learning often unengaging \u2013 and research shows that employees forget upwards of 80% of episodic training.\u201d\n Max Bautin, managing Partner at IQ Capital, said: \u201cE-learning has seen strong growth over the last 5 years, and COVID-driven shift to remote work has increased demand many times over. Virti\u2019s deeptech experiential learning platform is by far the best in the world.\u201d\n Virti competes with normal desktop-based training solutions. But on the VR side, more so with StriVR which has raised $51 million, and Mursiun which has raised $35.1 million.\n Speaking to me over a call Young told me: \u201cOur system, which we\u2019ve patented in terms of the analytics, can actually track what people are looking at if they\u2019re in a virtual reality headset. So we can really pull out some deep engagement metrics, a bit like heat map data you might see on marketing platforms.

PCs, Microsoft announced Monday.\n At the same time, the\u00a0  Backbone One -- my favorite of the iPhone controllers that mimic the physical experience of the   Nintendo Switch, such as the   Razer Kishi -- joins the  Designed for Xbox program, with specific features designed to make you feel more like you&#39;re playing on an   Xbox or standalone device.\n  Xbox Cloud Gaming, nee Project xCloud, lets you play a subset of   Xbox Game Pass games on a device other than a console by streaming them from the cloud, a la   Google Stadia and   Nvidia GeForce Now. It, like others, follows\u00a0  Amazon Luna&#39;s lead of using a web app to circumvent\u00a0  Apple&#39;s App Store policies, which effectively shut out cloud gaming apps. For Windows PCs, it lets you play games your system might not otherwise have the power or space to run locally via Game Pass for PC.\n  The Backbone One will come with three free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (saving $1 over  Microsoft&#39;s own current promo of three months for $1).\n The Backbone One gamepad uses a layout similar to, though slightly different from, that of  Microsoft&#39;s own Xbox controllers. But Backbone&#39;s software is one of the keys to its success, and which makes the controller an easy update for current owners to get the new features.

The company previously  teased these features in February.\n YouTube TV is already one of  the pricier streaming services out there \u2014 at $64.99 per month, you might not save much money by choosing YouTube in lieu of your cable service. Hulu + Live TV is priced the same, but offers a Disney+ and ESPN+ add-on for a total of $72.99 per month. But if you want to kick your video quality (and your monthly bill) up a notch, you can now enable 4K streaming for an extra $19.99 per month, bringing your grand total to $84.98 monthly.\n  The 4K Plus add-on package will also allow subscribers to download shows from DVR to watch offline \u2014 currently, that\u2019s not possible on the standard $64.99 per month package. Subscribers will be able to try out the package for free for a month, then pay $9.99 per month for a year before the price increases to $19.99. This is pretty consistent with YouTube TV\u2019s  continual price hikes over the years.\n Meanwhile, the 5.1 Dolby audio capabilities will be a free addition for all YouTube TV members \u2014 in a blog post, the company says this has been one of users\u2019 \u201cbiggest requests.\u201d Over the coming weeks, these surround-sound audio capabilities will begin rolling out to select devices.\n The sports upgrades also come at no additional cost \u2014 one new feature will let viewers jump to key plays and specific highlight moments when watching a DVR recording or trying to catch up live. So, if you\u2019re tuning in an hour late, you can view key moments from the game, then jump right in live. YouTube TV will also let users search for specific sports to add to their DVR, which has no storage space limit. So, again, if you\u2019re determined not to miss a single Simone Biles floor routine, it will be easier to make sure you\u2019re in the loop. There will also be a Medal count view during the Olympics within the app.\n As the Olympics draw nearer, we can expect other cord-cutting services to up the ante on their live sports offerings \u2014 the $9.99 monthly  Paramount+ Premium plan includes a wide range of international soccer matches, but no word on the Olympics yet. Still, the service is far less expensive than YouTube TV and already offers 4K, HDR, and Dolby Vision. YouTube TV had  3 million subscribers as of October 2020, but did not offer an update for Q1 of 2021.

By one measure it is more rare than a once in a 1,000 year event \u2014 which means that if you could live in this particular spot for 1,000 years, you&#39;d likely only experience a heat dome like this once, if ever.\n   Portland, Oregon, has already broken its all-time record hottest temperature at 108 degrees on Saturday and the peak of the heat wave has not even been reached yet. Canada is expected to register the nation&#39;s all-time highest temperature before the event is done. These are extremely dangerous numbers, especially in a region not used to heat like this, where many people do not have air conditioning.\n  By Monday, some \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the all-time record highs seen below are forecast to break, with many more cities not listed here expected to achieve the same feat.\n  The heat is being caused by a combination of a significant atmospheric blocking pattern on top of a human-caused climate changed world where baseline temperatures are already a couple to a few degrees higher than nature intended.\n  This heat wave comes on the heels of another historic heat wave less than two weeks ago that baked the U.S. Intermountain West, Desert Southwest and California with hundreds of record highs.\n  Meanwhile, the eastern U.S. is also seeing the heat ratchet up, with &#34;feels-like&#34; temperatures pushing 100 degrees by Monday and Tuesday in the major cities of the I-95 corridor. The back-to-back and dueling heat waves are made more likely by a very wavy jet stream and our unnaturally  heating climate.\n  Sunday and Monday are projected to be the hottest days of the heat wave along the Northwest coast from Portland to Seattle. Even before the peak of the heat had been reached on Saturday, many records have already been broken, with even hotter temperatures to come.\n It&#39;s never been hotter in Portland than it was yesterday; all part of an ongoing, historic, and dangerous heatwave in the NW; many homes don&#39;t have A/C.  @WeatherProf helps explain how we know this is so historic  https://t.co/AJT1oU0TLt  #WAwx  #ORwx  #MNwx  pic.twitter.com/nC2mGtRUwm\n\u2014 Mike Augustyniak (@MikeAugustyniak)  June 27, 2021\n As the heat dome continues to build, cities like Portland will likely break their all-time heat record again, on back-to-back days. On Sunday the thermometer reached a staggering  112 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 that&#39;s 5 degrees higher than what had been the all-time record of 107 degrees, prior to Saturday&#39;s 108.\n  In Seattle, after a record high of 102 on Saturday, the thermometer is likely to shatter its all-time record high of 103 degrees on Monday, with a forecast high of 108. In its history, Seattle has only reached 100 degrees three times before. Remarkably, in this one heat wave, highs in the city will easily top 100 degrees 3 days in a row.\n  Some of the inland cities in eastern Washington and Oregon will likely max out in the 115-120 degree range. And while the heat will break along the coast of Washington and Oregon by midweek, the record heat will continue over inland Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Montana late in the week.\n  For the past week, as computer models have consistently forecast seemingly unbelievable numbers, meteorologists struggled to grasp how a heat wave of this magnitude could even be possible, given this region has never experienced anything of this magnitude before. Were the models wrong? Or, given climate change, should we now expect the unexpected \u2014 is this now just becoming routine?\n  Turns out, the models were correct and we should expect extreme heat waves, even unprecedented ones like this to become more routine. &#34;There is no context really, in the sense that there is no analog in our past for what we are likely to see this week,&#34; says Dr. Michael Mann, distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University and author of the  new book &#34;The New Climate War.&#34;\n But calling it a new normal does not suffice says Mann, &#34;Some people called this a &#39;new normal. But it is worse than that,&#34; explained Mann. &#34;We will continue to see more and more extreme heat waves, droughts, wildfires and floods as long as we continue to warm the planet through fossil fuel burning and carbon emissions.&#34;\n   As shown in the below illustration from the Oregon Climate Assessment, this is only the beginning of the heating expected if humanity continues burning fossil fuels. By 2100, temperatures are expected to be 7 to 10 degrees above what they naturally should, and that would mean a dramatic increase in extreme heat waves.\n  In the case of this specific heat dome, which is a mountain of hot air stacked vertically through the atmosphere, it is a once in a 1,000 or even 10,000-year event for this particular area. How do we know? It&#39;s actually quite simple to explain.\n The intensity of a heat dome is measured by how &#34;thick&#34; the atmosphere is at a given spot. The hotter the air in that column, the larger the thickness of air in that column, because heat expands. In our historical record of North America&#39;s Pacific Northwest this heat dome registers a statistical standard deviation from the average of greater than 4.\n In layman terms, that means it falls more than 4 deviations to the right of the center of a typical bell curve (shown below) and that equates to values with less than a 99.99% chance of happening.\n  In other words, statistically speaking, there is a 1 in 10,000 chance of experiencing this value. So, if you could possibly live in that spot for 10,000 years, you&#39;d likely only experience that kind of heat dome once, if ever.\n To put climate extremes into perspective we measure against the average. The sigma is the standard deviation of a normal distribution of expected values. In this case the heat dome sigma max is 4.4 - that means it&#39;s outside of 99.99% of expected values or a 1/10,000+ chance (1/2)  pic.twitter.com/8raIMAngkg\n\u2014 Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf)  June 27, 2021\n It is worth noting that our historical record is limited and statistics like this are very sensitive to small changes. But if it seems like an overstatement to say there is a 1 in 10,000 chance of having a heat dome like this, it is certainly not an overstatement to say this is the kind of event you would expect to experience once in 1000 years.\n But we will know the exact value soon, as some of the best  extreme weather attribution scientists are likely to be hard at work doing rapid attribution \u2014 a new type of cutting edge science \u2014 this week to determine the actual values and to what degree climate change has contributed.\n What it means for the Pacific NW is that there will be a very high attribution to climate change for the upcoming event and the exact numbers will depend on how hot it really gets. And the hotter it gets, the larger the attribution will be.\n \u2014 Gavin Schmidt (@ClimateOfGavin)  June 25, 2021\n So what is causing this heat wave? Like any heat wave, it is being caused by a highly amplified jet stream pattern. These extreme jet stream perturbations are a natural, normal part of the atmosphere. But the climate science community is split as to whether these extreme jet stream perturbations are becoming even more likely because of climate change \u2014 a phenomena known as the  wavy jet stream.\n  Along with a more wavy, buckling and slow-moving jet stream, comes a phenomena called &#34;blocking&#34;. This is when waves in the jet stream become so elongated that they break off, sit and spin. In this case there is a textbook type of block called an Omega block over the Pacific Northwest because it looks like the Greek letter Omega. Inside this Omega, the heat pools and intensifies.\n   There is a faction of climate scientists who believe that a warming climate \u2014 specifically the Arctic \u2014 results in a more wandering jet stream at certain times of the year. But it is  hotly debated; there is an equal amount of research that does not arrive at this conclusion.\n Mann and his colleagues have been involved in some of  this research, in which he finds that a specific type of Northern Hemisphere blocking \u2014 what he calls Quasi Resonant Amplification \u2014 will increase by 50% this century under business as usual human-forced climate warming. &#34;I do indeed believe that the phenomenon we describe in our work played a very important role in the record heat wave,&#34; Mann said.\n As for the lack of consensus in the climate research on the wavy jet stream and blocking, Mann thinks it has more to do with the current state of climate modeling &#34;This is an area where current generation models are NOT capturing a real-world climate connection,&#34; Mann explained.\n Whatever the cause, the result of an extreme jet stream pattern is extreme weather across many parts of the nation and globe. Over the past few days, the central U.S. has seen over a foot of rain with flash flooding along a stalled front. And, starting on Sunday and continuing through most of the upcoming week, the major East Coast cities will also sweat through a heat wave \u2014 although not nearly as intense as the one in the West \u2014 with feels-like temperatures near 100 degrees from Washington D.C. to Philadelphia and New York City.\n  While natural swings between hot and cold patterns will continue, the trend is clear \u2014 extreme heat waves are bound to become more common, more extreme and more deadly in the coming years. In practice, the solution to worsening extreme weather is a herculean challenge for humanity, but in theory it is simple: &#34;We can prevent things from getting worse if we rapidly decarbonize our civilization,&#34; Mann said.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:32:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u897f\u5317,northwest,\u6c14\u5019", "title": "\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u897f\u5317\u517b\u6210\u4e00\u6beb\u5728\u5343\u5e74\u708e\u70ed\u5706\u9876 ", "title_en": "Pacific Northwest Bakes Under Once-In-a-Millennium Heat Dome", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-dome-2021-seattle-portland-weather/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u897f\u5317", "northwest", "\u6c14\u5019"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "170f5e88c534ea1930ffe797a937a249.jpg", "infoid": 1068599, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\uff0c\u53c8\u79f0\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7528\u6237\u540dByuu\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u5f00\u521b\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7684\u521b\u9020\u8005\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u5e86\u795d\u7684JRPG Bahamut Lagoon\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff0c\u5df2\u7531\u81ea\u6740\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\n  \u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e16\u5b50\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u53d7\u5230\u5728\u5947\u5a01\u519c\u573a\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u9a9a\u6270\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0cIT\u987e\u95ee\u548cLinux\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684Hector Martin\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u6d88\u606f\uff08CW\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u6740\u65b9\u6cd5\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u660e\u786e\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\u9644\u8fd1\uff06\uff0339;\u6b7b\u4ea1\u9644\u8fd1\u8b66\u65b9\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\u3002\u8054\u7cfb\u6587\u4ef6\u8fd8\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u7315\u7334\u6843\u8bba\u575b\u548c\u8fd1\u4e4e\u548c\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u9a9a\u6270\u3002\n  \u8fd1\u4e4e\uff06\uff0339; S BSNES\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u6709100\uff05\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u4efb\u5929\u5802\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0cHigan\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u630126\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5305\u62ecNES\uff0cSNES\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u7537\u5b69\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u7537\u5b69\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0cSEGA\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u521b\u4e16\u7eaa/\u5de8\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u548cPC\u5f15\u64ce\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; Ve\u626e\u6f14\u4efb\u4f55\u53d7\u5230Arthbound\uff0cAka Mother 2\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8d54\u7387\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u6e38\u620f\u548c\uff0339; S Designer\u5728Higan\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4efd\u571f\u5730\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u526f\u672c\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002\n  \u4eff\u771f\u5668\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u65af\u8482\u82ac\u970d\u91d1\u548c\uff0339;\u5728\u7740\u540d\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u7684\u6700\u540e\u51e0\u5e74\u91cc\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5408\u6210\u5668\u5de5\u4f5c\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u4eceHigan\uff06\uff0339; S\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u501f\u7528\u3002\n  \u5728\u7c89\u4e1d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u6bcd\u4eb23\uff0cDragon Quest 5\uff0cDer Langriss\u7b49\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u4e34\u8fd1\u8d21\u732e\u7f16\u7a0b\u9644\u8fd1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u5b83\u540e23\u5e74\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u4e862021\u5e74\u7684Bahamut Lagoon\u7684\u672c\u5730\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u526f\u6863\u6848\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\n  \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6216\u60a8\u8ba4\u8bc6\u7684\u4eba\u6709\u81ea\u6740\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u8bf7\u8054\u7cfb\u56fd\u5bb6\u81ea\u6740\u9884\u9632\u751f\u547d\u7ebf\uff08\u7f8e\u56fd\uff09\uff0c\u5371\u673a\u670d\u52a1\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\uff08CA\uff09\uff0c\u6492\u739b\u5229\u4e9a\u4eba\uff08\u82f1\u56fd\uff09\u6216\u751f\u547d\u7ebf\uff08AUS\uff09\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728\u60a8\u6240\u5728\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5730\u533a\u7684\u70ed\u7ebf\u4e2d\u67e5\u770b\u6b64\u5217\u8868\u3002 ", "note_en": "Near, also known by their username Byuu, the creator of several groundbreaking videogame emulators and a recent celebrated translation of JRPG Bahamut Lagoon, has died by suicide.\n  Near posted a  thread on Twitter explaining how they were affected by a campaign of harassment organized against them on the Kiwi Farms forum. Subsequently, Hector Martin, an IT consultant and Linux hacker, posted  a message about Near from a mutual friend ( CW: contains explicit details of Near&#39;s method of suicide) and said that they had confirmed Near&#39;s death with police in a  follow-up tweet. The linked document also focuses on the Kiwi Farms forum and the doxing and harassing of Near and their friends.\n  Near&#39;s  bsnes was the first Super Nintendo emulator with 100% compatibility, and  higan is a multi-system emulator supporting 26 different devices including the NES, SNES, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, Sega Master System and Genesis/Mega Drive, and PC Engine. If you&#39;ve played any of the indie games influenced by EarthBound, aka Mother 2, then odds are good that game&#39;s designer had a copy of EarthBound open in higan for reference.\n  Parts of the emulator created to keep  Stephen Hawking&#39;s voice synthesizer working in the final years of the famous physicist&#39;s life were even borrowed from higan&#39;s open source code.\n  In the field of fan translation, Near contributed programming to localizations of games like  Mother 3,  Dragon Quest 5, Der Langrisser, and released a localization of  Bahamut Lagoon in 2021, 23 years after beginning it, as a  Vice profile explains.\n  If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, contact the   National Suicide Prevention Lifeline  (US),   Crisis Services Canada  (CA),   Samaritans  (UK), or   Lifeline  (AUS).

It raises particular concerns about Apple\u2019s design making those batteries too readily accessible.\n \u201cThe ACCC is concerned that the AirTag\u2019s battery compartment could be accessible to young children, and the button battery removed with ease. In addition, the AirTag battery compartment\u2019s lid does not always secure fully on closing, and a distinctive sound plays when an AirTag\u2019s lid is being closed, suggesting the lid is secure when it may not be.\u201d\n As  9to5Mac notes, Australian retailer Officeworks  removed AirTags from its shelves last month, citing safety concerns. Apple has since added a new warning label to AirTag packaging, and the ACCC quotes Apple as saying that AirTags are \u201cdesigned to meet international child safety standards.\u201d The agency states that it\u2019s currently discussing safety issues with Apple.\n Many devices \u2014 including AirTag competitors \u2014 use button batteries. Some companies make them tougher to remove; Tile trackers, for instance,  require a paperclip or precision screwdriver to swap a battery.

New findings from a team using the international Gemini Observatory and the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory suggest that Earth-sized worlds could be lurking undiscovered in binary star systems, hidden in the glare of their parent stars. As roughly half of all stars are in binary systems, this means that astronomers could be missing many Earth-sized worlds.    Earth-sized planets may be much more common than previously realized. Astronomers working at NASA Ames Research Center have used the twin telescopes of the international Gemini Observatory, a Program of NSF&#39;s NOIRLab, to determine that many planet-hosting stars identified by NASA&#39;s TESS exoplanet-hunting mission are actually pairs of stars\u2014known as binary stars\u2014where the planets orbit one of the stars in the pair. After examining these binary stars, the team has concluded that Earth-sized planets in many two-star systems might be going unnoticed by transit searches like TESS&#39;s, which look for changes in the light from a star when a planet passes in front of it. The light from the second star makes it more difficult to detect the changes in the host star&#39;s light when the planet transits.\n  The team started out by trying to determine whether some of the exoplanet host stars identified with TESS were actually unknown binary stars. Physical pairs of stars that are close together can be mistaken for single stars unless they are observed at extremely high resolution. So the team turned to both Gemini telescopes to inspect a sample of exoplanet host stars in painstaking detail. Using a technique called speckle imaging, the astronomers set out to see whether they could spot undiscovered stellar companions.\n   Using the &#39;Alopeke and Zorro instruments on the Gemini North and South telescopes in Chile and Hawai&#39;i, respectively, the team observed hundreds of nearby stars that TESS had identified as potential exoplanet hosts. They discovered that 73 of these stars are really binary star systems that had appeared as single points of light until observed at higher resolution with Gemini. &#34;With the Gemini Observatory&#39;s 8.1-meter telescopes, we obtained extremely high-resolution images of exoplanet host stars and detected stellar companions at very small separations,&#34; said Katie Lester of NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center, who led this work.\n  Lester&#39;s team also studied an additional 18 binary stars previously found among the TESS exoplanet hosts using the NN-EXPLORE Exoplanet and Stellar Speckle Imager (NESSI) on the WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, also a Program of NSF&#39;s NOIRLab.\n    After identifying the binary stars, the team compared the sizes of the detected planets in the binary star systems to those in single-star systems. They realized that the TESS spacecraft found both large and small exoplanets orbiting single stars, but only large planets in binary systems.\n  These results imply that a population of Earth-sized planets could be lurking in binary systems and going undetected using the transit method employed by TESS and many other planet-hunting telescopes. Some scientists had suspected that transit searches might be missing small planets in binary systems, but the new study provides observational support to back it up and shows which sizes of exoplanets are affected.\n  &#34;We have shown that it is more difficult to find Earth-sized planets in binary systems because small planets get lost in the glare of their two parent stars,&#34; Lester stated. &#34;Their transits are &#39;filled in&#39; by the light from the companion star,&#34; added Steve Howell of NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center, who leads the speckle imaging effort and was involved in this research.\n  &#34;Since roughly 50% of stars are in binary systems, we could be missing the discovery of\u2014and the chance to study\u2014a lot of Earth-like planets,&#34; Lester concluded.\n  The possibility of these missing worlds means that astronomers will need to use a variety of observational techniques before concluding that a given binary star system has no Earth-like planets. &#34;Astronomers need to know whether a star is single or binary before they claim that no small planets exist in that system,&#34; explained Lester. &#34;If it&#39;s single, then you could say that no small planets exist. But if the host is in a binary, you wouldn&#39;t know whether a small planet is hidden by the companion star or does not exist at all. You would need more observations with a different technique to figure that out.&#34;\n  As part of their study, Lester and her colleagues also analyzed how far apart the stars are in the binary systems where TESS had detected large planets. The team found that the stars in the exoplanet-hosting pairs were typically farther apart than binary stars not known to have planets. This could suggest that planets do not form around stars that have close stellar companions.\n  &#34;This speckle imaging survey illustrates the critical need for NSF telescope facilities to characterize newly discovered planetary systems and develop our understanding of planetary populations,&#34; said National Science Foundation Division of Astronomical Sciences Program Officer Martin Still.\n  &#34;This is a major finding in   work,&#34; Howell commented. &#34;The results will help theorists create their models for how planets form and evolve in double-star systems.&#34;        More information:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpeckle Observations of TESS Exoplanet Host Stars.

the history of the Pacific Northwest has climaxed, obliterating scores of long-standing records. The National Weather Service had predicted it would be \u201c historic, dangerous, prolonged and unprecedented,\u201d and it lived up to its billing.\n  Major cities, such as Portland and Seattle, broke all-time records by enormous margins as temperatures ballooned 30 to 40 degrees above normal.\n On Monday, Portland reached 116 degrees, the highest temperature in more than 80 years of record-keeping. It was the third day in a row the city set a new all-time high. Before this weekend, the all-time high was 107, but on Saturday it hit 108 and on Sunday 112.\n  Seattle soared to a sizzling 108 degrees Monday evening, surpassing the all-time record of 104 degrees set the day before (which topped the previous mark of 103 from 2009). The high of 108 was 34 degrees above the normal high of 74 and higher than the all-time heat record in Washington, D.C., among  many other cities much farther to its south.\n    The extraordinary heat swelled north of the international border as Canada saw its highest temperature recorded for a second straight afternoon on Monday. The temperature in Lytton in British Columbia reached  118.2 degrees just one day after it had surged to a record of 116 degrees. For perspective, this temperature is more extreme than the all-time high in Las Vegas: 117.\n  Some places on Monday shattered all-time records, which are exceptionally rare and difficult to break, by 5 or even 10-plus degrees. For example, Quillayute, Wash., which hit 110, obliterated its previous all-time high by 11 degrees.\n While the siege of excessive heat will finally end in Portland and Seattle Tuesday, additional all-time highs could be set in the interior Pacific Northwest where sweltering temperatures may linger for days, including around Spokane.\n  \u201cTuesday will likely be the hottest day in recorded history for many sites across the Inland Northwest,\u201d wrote the National Weather Service in Spokane.\n Here are the predicted highs in several major population centers Tuesday along with what the current all-time high temperatures are at those locations:\n   The strength of the  heat dome, or sprawling zone of high pressure centered near the U.S.-Canada border, responsible for these temperatures is  off the charts and  blowing away records. Its  intensity is so statistically rare that it  might be expected only once every several thousand years on average. But human-caused climate change has made exceptional events such as this  many times more probable.\n \u201cThe past is no longer a reliable guide for the future. These events are becoming more frequent and intense, a trend projected to continue,\u201d  tweeted the Oregon Climate Office.\n  Meteorologists have described the situation as \u201c insane,\u201d \u201c bonkers\u201d and \u201c incredible.\u201d The Weather Service in Seattle  wrote that attempting to forecast heat this extreme is \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d because no analogous situation has occurred in the past.\n   Because of the heat wave\u2019s longevity, new record-long streaks for surpassing different temperature thresholds are also occurring. For example, Seattle experienced triple-digit heat on three straight days for the first time on record.\n  Officials fear that the intensity and duration of the heat wave will lead to dramatic increases in heat-related illness and possibly fatalities in a region where many lack air-conditioning ( more than half the homes in Seattle lack air-conditioning). Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States in a typical year.\n     All-time highs are the most rare and refer to the highest temperature on record for any month at a given location.\n  Portland reached 116 degrees, topping 112 from Sunday and 108 from Saturday. (Before this stretch, the max was 107 from 1981.)\n Seattle reached 108 degrees, topping 104 degrees from Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 103 from 2009.)\n  The Dalles, Ore., reached 118 degrees, topping Sunday\u2019s 114. (Before this stretch, the max was 111 in 1998 and 1992.)\n Salem, Ore., reached at least 117 degrees, topping 113 from Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 108 from 1927, 1941, and 1981.)\n Vancouver, Wash., reached 115 degrees, topping 112 degrees Sunday and 108 on Saturday. (Saturday\u2019s 108 tied a previous mark from 2009.)\n  Troutdale, Ore., reached 115 degrees, topping 112 Sunday and 109 on Saturday. (Before this stretch, the max was 108 in 1977.)\n McMinnville, Ore., reached 114 degrees, topping 111 Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 110 in 1926 and 1925.)\n Hillsboro, Ore., reached 114 degrees, topping 109 Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 108 in 2006.)\n   Redmond, Ore., reached 110 degrees, topping 108 Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 106 in 2008.)\n   Fort Lewis, Wash, reached 110 degrees, topping 104 Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 103 in 2009.)\n  Shelton, Wash., reached 109 degrees, topping 107 Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 104 from 2009.)\n   Stampede Pass, Wash., reached 95 degrees after 93 on Sunday tied the high mark from 2004.\n    Several records that were set Saturday were broken again Sunday and/or Monday and are listed above.\n  Record warm lows refer to the warmest nighttime or morning minimum temperatures on record. The ones we present here are all-time (any month) cases.\n  Seattle\u2019s low temperature Sunday morning of 73 degrees was the warmest on record for any date, topping 72 from 2009. Combined with the 104 high, the average temperature of 89 makes Sunday the hottest daily temperature on record for the city.\n  These are the warmest temperatures observed during the month of June at the given locations. They are rare, but monthly records are easier to break than all-time records.\n  Klamath Falls, Ore., reached 103 degrees, topping 101 on Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 100 from 1992.)\n  La Grande, Ore., reached 105 degrees, topping 102 degrees Sunday. (Before this stretch, the max was 99 from 2003.)\n  Pasco, Wash., reached 115 degrees, topping 111 in 2015.

In April 2020, Netflix filed a complaint against SK Broadband Co., rejecting the Korean internet provider&#39;s demand that the streaming platform pay for network use in South Korea.  The legal action has drawn attention because it marks the world&#39;s first legal conflict between an OTT platform and a broadband company. South Korea is one of the world&#39;s fast-growing OTT markets, where Netflix posted  triple-digit earnings growth in 2020 from the year previous.  On June 25, the Seoul Central District Court rejected the case brought forth by Netflix, while dismissing Netflix&#39;s claim that the OTT platform has no obligation to negotiate with SK Broadband over the network use charges.  &#34;It needs to be determined by negotiations between the parties involved whether or not some fees will be paid, or whether they enter an agreement in accordance with the principle of freedom of contract,&#34; the court ruling reads.\u00a0  Netflix offers movies, TV drama series and other content on the internet to its paid subscribers. With the streaming service giant taking up the biggest portion of the country&#39;s OTT market, SK Broadband has suggested that Netflix share the costs related to internet traffic growth.\u00a0  But Netflix accused SK Broadband of double billing. It argued that its subscribers are already paying internet connection fees to log in to OTT platforms, separate from their subscription payments to OTT service providers.  Back in November 2019, the broadband arm of SK Telecom took the case against Netflix to the Korea Communications Commission, but the two companies failed to reach a settlement.  &#34;Netflix has not been paying network usage fees, or something equivalent to the fees claimed by SK Broadband, to any one of the ISPs (internet service providers) in the world,&#34; the streaming service firm said in a Korean statement, released in an immediate response to the court ruling.  &#34;None of the government agencies, nor courts in the world, forced CPs (content providers) to pay network usage fees to ISPs. It is because there is no legal basis for the fees and they are against internet governance principles.&#34;  It was not immediately known whether the US company will appeal to a higher court.  SK Broadband welcomed the court decision, saying: &#34;It confirmed that Netflix needs to pay to use our network.&#34;  &#34;Internet connection is basically a paid service. As Netflix has paid telecom companies for network use in the US and Japan, it also needs to pay in Korea,&#34; said SK Broadband.  In the US and France, Netflix is said to pay telecom operators for broadband service, but it is not been stipulated as a network usage fee. In Japan, however, Netflix said that it only pays a fee for getting necessary services for running Open Connect appliances, or servers designed for the delivery of streaming video content, instead of a charge for network use.   WHO&#39;S NEXT?  Telecom industry observers said the lowest court ruling laid the groundwork for domestic broadband providers to charge global OTT companies for internet usage. That could result in a drastic increase in their subscription fees.  The court verdict is likely to apply to other global OTT players preparing to enter the Korean market, including Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime and HBO Max. The Walt Disney Company\u2019s OTT service is expected to land in South Korea later this year.  &#34;This ruling made it clear that Netflix is owing to the ISPs, enabling them to enter renegotiations with OTT platforms for network usage fees,&#34; a telecom industry source told The Korea Economic Daily.  In comparison, the country&#39;s two platform behemoths -- Naver Corp. and  Kakao Corp. -- have been paying 70 billion won ($62 million) and 30 billion won annually to ISPs.  It is yet to be known how much SK Broadband is charging Netflix. But the market consensus is that the streaming giant might receive a bill worth several tens of million dollars from SK per year, considering the annual fees paid by domestic streaming service companies.  &#34;Netflix is highly likely to pass the surging costs on to its subscribers to make up for them,&#34; said an OTT company source. &#34;Considering that it could set a precedent for its global services in other countries, Netflix may sharply increase domestic subscription fees.&#34;\u00a0  But Netflix drew a distinction between itself and Korean OTT rivals, saying that unlike Korean content providers, it has not been provided with internet networks, nor relevant services by SK Broadband.\u00a0  In South Korea, Netflix boasts  around 4.1 million paid subscribers with a share of 4.8%.

", "note_en": "A mix-and-match approach to Covid vaccines - using different brands for first and second doses - appears to give good protection against the pandemic virus, a UK study has found.\n The Com-Cov trial looked at the efficacy of either two doses of Pfizer, two of AstraZeneca, or one of them followed by the other.\n   The trial results also hint that people who have already received two doses of AstraZeneca vaccine could have a stronger immune response if they were given a different jab as a booster if recommended in the autumn.\n The UK&#39;s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said there was no reason to change the current successful same dose vaccine schedules in the UK, however, given vaccines were in good supply and saving lives.\n  But he says it might be something to look at in the future: &#34;Mixing doses could provide us with even greater flexibility for a booster programme, while also supporting countries who have further to go with their vaccine rollouts, and who may be experiencing supply difficulties.&#34;\n Some countries are already using mixed doses. Spain and Germany are offering the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccines as a second dose to younger people who have already received a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following concerns about rare but serious blood clots, rather than about efficacy.\n  Two doses are important to give the fullest protection and teach the body to make antibodies and T cells to block and kill Covid.\n The  Com-Cov study, which looked at giving the doses four weeks apart in 850 volunteers aged 50 and above, found:\n AZ followed by Pfizer induced higher antibodies and T cell responses than Pfizer followed by AZ\n  The highest antibody response was seen after two doses of Pfizer, and the highest T cell response from AZ followed by Pfizer\n Lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape, from the University of Oxford, said the findings did not undermine the UK policy of giving people the same jab twice: &#34;We already know that both standard schedules are very effective against severe disease and hospitalisations, including against the Delta variant when given at eight to 12 weeks apart.&#34;\n He said the new results showed mixed dose schedules were also effective, even though the interval of four weeks studied was shorter than the eight to 12-week schedule most commonly used in the UK.\n     Meanwhile, another pre-print study, which also came out on Monday, suggests a third dose of AZ vaccine, given more than six months after the second, boosts the immune system.\n But experts say it is too early to know if people will need a booster dose this year ahead of winter. It is unclear yet how much immunity might wane over time.\n Prof Paul Hunter from the University of East Anglia said: &#34;The big question at present is whether or not we will be being offered booster vaccines in the autumn. With the evidence available from this and other sources, I suspect that will be likely for those most at risk from the virus, either due to age or being clinically vulnerable.&#34;\n He suggested people who have had a first course of AstraZeneca might be offered the Pfizer vaccine in as a booster rather than a repeat AstraZeneca, while people who had a Pfizer first course may not need an autumn booster, based on the evidence from the Com-Cov trial.\n    The initial results of this mix and match vaccine trial are highly encouraging and throw up some interesting options for booster doses.\n Mixing first and second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines yielded strong immune responses. Indeed, every combination of dosing - Pfizer/Pfizer, AZ/Pfizer or Pfizer/AZ produced higher antibody and cellular responses than AZ/AZ.\n  It is worth remembering that two doses of AZ are already proven to reduce the chances of being hospitalised with Covid by more than 90%.\n So we know from real world evidence that the AZ vaccine is highly effective. The AZ vaccine is a &#39;slow burner&#39;, and immunity levels build over time, especially when the dosing period is stretched. Currently the gap between first and second doses is between eight and 12 weeks which should give a better immune response.\n What this trial suggests is that for the third, booster doses, it may be preferable to give a different brand of vaccine than the one used for the first two shots.\n But it&#39;s also worth noting that mixing vaccines does produce more short-term side effects such as chills, headaches and muscle pain.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:30:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8868\u660e,covid,\u75ab\u82d7", "title":

", "note_en": "Alcoholic intoxication is an abnormal mental state characterized by reduced self-control and various degrees of euphoria or depression, brought about by the temporary impairment of a pretty big chunk of the brain. As the term suggests, it involves the ingestion of a chemical toxin, ethanol, which in small doses makes us happy, more sociable and better at thinking creatively and defusing conflicts. In progressively higher doses, it can lead to degraded motor coordination, slurred speech, violent arguments, maudlin expressions of love, inappropriate touching, injuries, blackouts, property damage and even karaoke.\n  Why do we do it? Historically, scientists have written off our affinity for intoxication as an evolutionary mistake, a method that we\u2019ve developed for tricking our biological reward system into releasing little shots of pleasure for no good reason. But this is not a satisfying explanation. It should puzzle us more than it does that humans have devoted so much ingenuity and effort to getting drunk.\n  At sites in eastern Turkey, dating to perhaps 12,000 years ago, the remains of what appear to be brewing vats, combined with images of festivals and dancing, suggest that people were gathering in groups, fermenting grain or grapes, playing music and getting truly hammered before humanity had even figured out agriculture. In fact, archaeologists have begun to suggest that alcohol wasn\u2019t merely a byproduct of the invention of agriculture but actually a motivation for it. The first farmers, on this view, were driven by a desire not for bread but for beer\u2014no civilization without intoxication.\n  Once we begin to think systematically about the antiquity, ubiquity and power of our taste for intoxicants, the idea that it\u2019s some sort of evolutionary accident becomes difficult to take seriously. Evolution isn\u2019t stupid, and it works much faster than most people realize. Tibetans have adapted genetically to living at high altitudes and boat-dwelling Southeast Asian peoples to diving and holding their breath underwater. If alcohol were merely hijacking pleasure centers in the brain, evolution should have figured it out by now and put a firm end to this nonsense.\n  Other vices can plausibly be seen as necessary appetites gone wrong, such as our taste for pornography or junk food. But alcohol is mind-bogglingly dangerous, both physiologically and socially. The fact that our supposedly accidental taste for it has not been eradicated by genetic or cultural evolution means that the cost of indulging in alcohol must be offset by benefits.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.
