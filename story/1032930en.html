Nothing formal, little more than anecdotes, stories or examples - the good, the bad and the ugly. They were initially strewn all over the place; some were captured in To Do apps, others in stray text files or scribbled in a Moleskine notebook. Part lessons learned, and part personal and familial history. Something in the spirit of Mark Oliver Everett&#39;s &#34;Things the Grandchildren Should Know,&#34; I thought of it very loosely as a &#34;User Manual&#34; for life, the one that I was never handed.</p><p>在我女儿出生前几个月，我开始给她记笔记。没有什么正式的，只不过是轶事、故事或例子-好的、坏的和丑陋的。起初，它们散落得到处都是；一些被捕获来做应用程序，另一些放在零散的文本文件中，或者草草写在Moleskine笔记本上。一部分是吸取的教训，一部分是个人和家族史。有些东西发自马克·奥利弗·埃弗雷特(Mark Oliver Everett)的精神，是孙辈们应该知道的，我把它粗略地认为是一本终身使用手册，是一本从未交给我的手册。</p><p>  Eventually I consolidated the various fragments down and discovered that I had something close to 18,000 words of advice for my unborn daughter. I never got around to finishing the project, let alone publishing it. First, because how does one “finish” a user manual for life? Second, because it would be years before she could even read, let alone digest the advice I had to give. But the main reason it sat incomplete was simple: because I assumed that I had plenty of time to finish it.</p><p>最后，我把各种片段整理下来，发现我有一些近18000字的建议给我未出生的女儿。我从未抽出时间完成这个项目，更不用说发表了。首先，因为一个人如何“完成”一本终生用户手册？其次，因为她甚至需要数年时间才能识字，更不用说消化我给她的建议了。但它没有完成的主要原因很简单：因为我以为我有足够的时间完成它。</p><p>    In the months before the end of his life, Ulysses S. Grant was diagnosed with cancer of the throat. The condition was not curable. In spite of the cancer&#39;s accelerating progress, the impact of which made it difficult for him to eat or swallow and made him feel as if he was perpetually choking, he wrote furiously. He viewed the memoirs as his final task, the commercial means by which to provide for his family once he was gone, and labored at them on that basis.</p><p>在尤利西斯·S·格兰特(Ulysses S.Grant)生命结束前的几个月里，他被诊断出患有喉癌。这种情况是无法治愈的。他怒气冲冲地写道，尽管癌症进展加快，但它的影响使他难以进食或吞咽，并让他感觉好像永远窒息一样，他愤怒地写道，尽管癌症正在加速发展，但它的影响使他难以进食或吞咽，感觉就像是永远窒息一样。他认为回忆录是他最后的任务，是他去世后养家糊口的商业手段，并在此基础上努力工作。</p><p>    Enduring the excruciating pain that came to define his life, he devoted what time he had left to documenting his experiences. The speed at which he produced pages, sometimes approaching fifty per day, was proof of the will that defined the man. The final work, in the end, was worthy of that effort. Grant’s memoirs were a masterpiece. Well received by contemporaries, no less an authority than Mark Twain compared them favorably to Caesar&#39;s Commentaries. They have stood the test of time and are appropriately regarded as one of the true masterpieces of American non-fiction.</p><p>忍受着定义他生活的痛苦，他把剩下的时间都花在了记录自己的经历上。他写页的速度，有时每天接近50页，证明了他的意志。最后的工作，归根结底，是值得这一努力的。格兰特的回忆录是一部杰作。受到同时代人的好评，其权威程度不亚于马克·吐温，并将其与凯撒的评论家相提并论。它们经受住了时间的考验，被恰当地视为美国非虚构类文学的真正杰作之一。</p><p>  I bring all of this up not for the sake of comparison, of course. My health, unlike Grant&#39;s, is fine for the moment. Nor have I any hope of this project being commercially viable, let alone providing for my wife and daughter. This is a labor of love, literally. And I hope that it goes without saying that I have no intention of implying any equivalence between Grant&#39;s observations and what follows. He was the Union General who accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee, thus closing the chapter on the darkest period in the history of the United States, as well as the President arguably most responsible for Reconstruction, and his memoirs were a vital, definitive account of American history. I am a software industry analyst who works for a small firm few have heard of and these are random thoughts I scribbled into a notebook in the frenzied weeks ahead of my child&#39;s birth.</p><p>当然，我提出这一切并不是为了比较。与格兰特不同，我的健康状况目前还不错。我也不希望这个项目在商业上可行，更不用说养活我的妻子和女儿了。从字面上看，这是爱的劳动。我希望不用说，我无意在格兰特的观察和随后的评论之间暗示任何等价性。他是接受罗伯特·E·李(Robert E.Lee)投降的联邦将军，从而结束了美国历史上最黑暗时期的篇章，也是可以说对重建负有最大责任的总统，他的回忆录对美国历史进行了至关重要的、明确的描述。我是一名软件行业分析师，在一家很少有人听说过的小公司工作，在我孩子出生前狂热的几周里，我在笔记本上胡乱写下了这些想法。</p><p>    Grant&#39;s memoirs nevertheless have come to mind often for me in this period of unprecedented uncertainty, because of the mathematics of the outbreak that is gaining speed as I write these words. COVID-19 is not a death sentence for my particular demographic, but neither am I obviously in the clear. The virus has killed people far younger and healthier than I am, and because there&#39;s more that we don&#39;t know about than that we do, the uncertainty means that only the foolish take it lightly. The virus is dangerous, but what makes the outlook even less promising are the limitations of our healthcare system’s ability to scale. Doctors in Italy have had to make decisions they will carry the rest of their lives, forced by a lack of equipment to choose who shall rise and who shall not. It is not certain that that is our fate here in the United States generally or Maine specifically. Neither is it clear that it will not be.</p><p>然而，在这个前所未有的不确定时期，格兰特的回忆录经常浮现在我的脑海中，因为在我写这些话的时候，疫情爆发的数学运算正在加速。新冠肺炎不是对我这个特定人群的死刑判决，但我显然也不是清白的。这种病毒杀死的人比我年轻得多，也比我健康得多，因为我们不知道的东西比我们知道的多得多，这种不确定性意味着只有愚蠢的人才会对此掉以轻心。这种病毒是危险的，但使前景变得更加黯淡的是我们医疗保健系统规模能力的限制。意大利的医生不得不做出决定，他们将带着他们的余生，因为缺乏选择谁应该崛起，谁不应该崛起的设备。目前还不能确定这是我们在美国这里的普遍命运，还是缅因州的具体命运。也不清楚它是否会不会。</p><p>    In doing just that, I came back both to the scattered words of advice I had written down for my daughter as well as to Grant’s famous efforts to beat the clock. If I were to contract the serious form of this disease, there is no guarantee that I would have the window that Grant did. This suggests that the labor of love needs to be completed before a potential infection, as there may be no after.</p><p>在这样做的同时，我又回到了我为女儿写下的零散的忠告，以及格兰特著名的争分夺秒的努力。如果我感染了这种严重的疾病，不能保证我会有格兰特那样的机会。这表明，爱的劳动需要在潜在的感染之前完成，因为可能没有感染之后。</p><p>  The below then is at best imperfect. It’s not even as perfect as I can make it, but as they say in the industry I have found an unexpected home in, “ perfect is the enemy of good.”</p><p>那么，下面的内容充其量也就是不完美的。它甚至没有我能做到的那么完美，但正如他们所说，在这个行业里，我找到了一个意想不到的家，“完美是好的敌人。”</p><p>  By way of introduction, let me quote Umberto Eco wildly out of context: “ these features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other.” The following features are, however, strategies that have worked for me.</p><p>作为介绍，让我断章取义地引用翁贝托·艾柯(Umberto Eco)的话：“这些功能不能组织成一个系统；它们中的许多相互矛盾。”然而，以下是对我有效的策略。</p><p>    Some I was born with. Others I learned on my own, often through hard lessons. More frequently the points below are what I might have learned from family, friends, coaches or mentors if I had been willing to listen. If I hadn’t, in the typical manner of the young, been convinced that I already knew everything and that what I might not I could figure out. What follows are lessons that I’ve collected over my years on this earth from people who have accomplished more than I will, that are smarter than I am or that are just fundamentally better people. It is, in short, what I wish I had known when I was younger, and what I would go back to tell my younger self if such a thing were possible. There may be lessons or history in here that could be of use for you, Eleanor, if you decide to be open to them.</p><p>有些是我与生俱来的。还有一些是我自学的，通常是通过惨痛的教训学到的。更常见的情况是，如果我愿意倾听，下面的几点可能是我从家人、朋友、教练或导师那里学到的。如果我没有以年轻人的典型方式确信我已经知道了一切，相信我可能不知道的事情我就能弄明白。以下是我多年来在这个世界上从那些取得比我更多成就、比我更聪明或者根本上更优秀的人那里收集到的经验教训。简而言之，这就是我希望我在年轻时就知道的事情，以及如果有可能的话，我会回去告诉年轻时的我自己的事情。埃莉诺，如果你决定向他们敞开心扉，这里可能会有一些课程或历史对你有用。</p><p>  No guarantee there, of course - I was young once. But it’s worth a shot. You can’t quite read yet as I write these words, my little bear, but this is for you, for when you’re ready.</p><p>当然，这不能保证-我曾经年轻过。但这值得一试。我写这些话的时候你还不能完全读懂，我的小熊，但这是给你的，当你准备好的时候。</p><p>          “ Far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.&#34; - Theodore Roosevelt</p><p>“毫无疑问，生活提供的最好奖赏就是有机会为值得做的工作而努力工作。”--西奥多·罗斯福(Theodore Roosevelt)。</p><p>  Growing up dirt poor in South Boston, my grandfather on my Mom’s side - named Theodore after Teddy Roosevelt - had guidance counselors who were so convinced that they could get him into Harvard and that his intelligence deserved it that they made the long trip out to visit his parents in their home to sell them on the idea.</p><p>我的祖父在南波士顿一贫如洗地长大，我母亲那边的祖父--以泰迪·罗斯福(Teddy Roosevelt)的名字命名西奥多(Theodore)--的辅导顾问非常确信他们可以让他进入哈佛大学，而且他的智商是当之无愧的，他们长途跋涉去他父母家看望他们，向他们推销这个想法。</p><p>    His status as the eldest son meant he had to pass on higher education to go to work to provide for his mother and his brothers and sisters. He was never bitter or resentful about this opportunity denied him, this turn in his life. He went to work in the shipyard and did his job. He taught his daughter, your grandmother, to do the same. She, in turn, married a man with the same philosophy.</p><p>他作为长子的身份意味着他必须接受高等教育才能去工作，以养活他的母亲和兄弟姐妹。他从来没有对他生命中的这一转折失去了这个机会感到痛苦或怨恨。他去造船厂工作，做好了他的工作。他教他的女儿，你的祖母，也要这样做。反过来，她嫁给了一个有着相同哲学的男人。</p><p>    Anyway, when my grandfather passed away, we waited an appropriate period and celebrated his life. Many people talked about him and his impact on their lives. My Mom, as is typical, gave the best talk. It was a simple, powerful and poignant list of what she had learned from her Dad. We were there to celebrate, but everyone wept terribly as she spoke, myself included. I asked her later for a copy of what she’d written. It included this line:</p><p>不管怎么说，当我祖父去世的时候，我们等了一段适当的时间来庆祝他的一生。很多人都在谈论他和他对他们生活的影响。我妈妈，一如既往，讲得最好。这是一份简单、有力、令人心酸的清单，列出了她从父亲那里学到的东西。我们在那里庆祝，但当她讲话时，每个人都哭得很厉害，包括我自己。后来我向她要了一份她写的东西的复印件。其中包括这样一句话：</p><p>  “ His knee jerk response to any challenge or setback was to simply put his shoulder to the wheel and try harder; as a result he accomplished just about everything he set his mind to.”</p><p>“面对任何挑战或挫折，他的下意识反应就是把肩膀放在方向盘上，更加努力；结果，他几乎完成了他下决心要做的一切。”</p><p>  It is what is expected of you. You do your job, you do it to the best of your ability, you do it without complaint, and you don’t expect a gold star for that. We will never celebrate Father’s Day, as one example, because my job is to be your father and we do not believe in holidays for doing your job.</p><p>这就是人们对你的期望。你做你的工作，你尽你的能力去做，你毫无怨言地去做，你不会因此期望得到金星。举个例子，我们永远不会庆祝父亲节，因为我的工作是做你的父亲，而我们不相信做你的工作要放假。</p><p>  Your job will not always be what you want to do. Some of your jobs will be unpleasant. Some will be actively miserable. This is not relevant. You do your job anyway because that is what we do. Whatever your job is, you will work like a dray horse. Many things in life will be out of your control. Your effort level is not one of those things.</p><p>你的工作不会总是你想做的。你们的一些工作会很不愉快。有些人会非常痛苦。这是不相关的。你无论如何都要做好你的工作，因为这就是我们的工作。不管你的工作是什么，你都会像拖拉马一样工作。生活中的许多事情将不是你所能控制的。你的努力程度不在这些事情之列。</p><p>  I don&#39;t ask you to always be the best. I simply ask that you always do your best.</p><p>我不要求你永远做最好的。我只是要求你永远做到最好。</p><p>    ‘&#34; It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.&#34; - Charles Darwin</p><p>幸存下来的不是最强壮的物种，也不是幸存下来的最聪明的物种。它是最能适应变化的一种。&查尔斯·达尔文。</p><p>  I apologize in advance, but you’re going to hear a great many things in your life related in some way to baseball. Things that really have no business being related to baseball.</p><p>我提前道歉，但在你的生活中，你会听到很多与棒球有关的事情。那些与棒球无关的事情。</p><p>    When you listen to the Red Sox games, and you’ll be doing that a lot (sorry), you’re going to hear baseball talked about as a game of adjustments. A player has success, the league adjusts to him. The player then adjusts to the league’s adjustments. Which then adjusts back. This process continues until a player’s ability to adapt is sapped by old age and he retires, or the player is retired prematurely by the league.</p><p>当你听红袜队的比赛时，你会经常听(抱歉)，你会听到棒球被说成是一场调整的比赛。一个球员有了成功，联盟就会适应他。然后，球员会根据联盟的调整进行调整。然后再向后调整。这个过程会一直持续下去，直到球员的适应能力因年事已高而被削弱并退役，或者球员被联盟提前退役。</p><p>  Your life will be the same. The only thing you can predict with certainty about it is that it will be beyond your ability to predict it. Your way of life may become obsolete. Your relationship may end. You may get injured or sick. You may have your  car impounded twenty-two hundred miles from home in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>你的生活将会是一样的。你唯一可以肯定地预测到的是，它将超出你的预测能力。你的生活方式可能会过时。你们的关系可能会结束。你可能会受伤或生病。你的车可能会在离家2200英里的荒郊野外被扣押。</p><p>  Whatever life holds for you, your job is to deal with it. To display adaptability. In nature, if you don&#39;t adapt, you die. The consequences will hopefully be less dire if you fail to do so, but material nonetheless.</p><p>无论你的生活如何，你的工作就是处理它。表现出适应能力。在自然界中，如果你不适应，你就会死。如果你不这样做，希望后果不会那么可怕，但仍然是实质性的。</p><p>  You may want to focus on how unfair it is, say, that you have to seek a new profession when yours becomes obsolete. That is pointless. If you need to bitch and moan, make it quick. Your grandfather had to reinvent himself four or five times in his time in finance, but then again this was the same man who taught himself to play tennis with his off hand after breaking a wrist and made it to the state semi-finals that way.</p><p>你可能想要关注这有多不公平，比如说，当你的职业过时了，你必须寻找一个新的职业。那是毫无意义的。如果你需要发牢骚和呻吟，那就快点。你的祖父在他从事金融工作的时候不得不重塑自己四五次，但这又是同一个人，他在手腕骨折后学会了用副手打网球，并以这种方式进入了州半决赛。</p><p>  As Arthur Ashe put it, “ Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.&#34;</p><p>正如亚瑟·阿什所说，“从你现在的位置开始。利用你所拥有的。做你力所能及的事。</p><p>      &#34; I don’t like bullies; I don’t care where they’re from.&#34; - Captain America</p><p>我不喜欢欺凌弱小的人；我不在乎他们来自哪里。&#34；-美国队长。</p><p>  Because I’m a poor and unimaginative storyteller at heart, your bedtime stories as a child cribbed liberally from a wide variety of sources. Everything from Jules Verne to Marvel Movies to Scooby-Doo made appearances in the various adventures of  Puppy, Kitty and Noble Raccoon. One of your particularly favorite lines, however, was Captain America talking about bullies.</p><p>因为我本质上是一个糟糕且缺乏想象力的故事家，你小时候的睡前故事从各种各样的来源大肆抄袭而来。从儒勒·凡尔纳(Jules Verne)到漫威(Marvel)电影再到史酷比(SCooby-Doo)，所有的东西都出现在小狗、小猫和高贵浣熊的各种冒险故事中。然而，你特别喜欢的一句台词是美国队长谈论欺凌弱小的人。</p><p>  I can&#39;t tell you how many times you made me play that clip for you; I half-expected to get an email from YouTube asking if my excessive viewing was a cry for help.</p><p>我已经记不清你让我给你放了多少次这个片段了；我本以为会收到一封来自YouTube的电子邮件，询问我的过度观看是否是在呼救。</p><p>  Initially, the intent was to use Captain America as a mechanism for both introducing you to the idea of bullies and steering you away from that path. What became obvious when you began repeating this mantra to yourself at night when talking to your stuffed animals, however, was that you took it seriously. So seriously that the stuffed animals who were “bullying” your other stuffed friends were roughly treated and put forcefully into &#34;body breaks.&#34;</p><p>最初的目的是利用美国队长作为一种机制，既向你介绍欺凌弱小的想法，又引导你远离那条道路。然而，当你在晚上和你的毛绒动物聊天时，当你开始对自己重复这句咒语时，显而易见的是，你把它当回事了。如此严重，以至于那些“欺负”你的其他毛绒朋友的毛绒动物受到粗暴对待，并被强行放入身体骨折。</p><p>    Which was good, first because you were literally a head taller than all of your preschool friends and could easily have taken advantage of that. But more because we intended to raise a kind little girl. One who not only didn’t bully her friends but helped them stand up to bullies. One who didn’t laugh at their mistakes. One who gave them a hand up when they fell. And one who thought as much about others as she thought about herself.</p><p>这很好，首先，因为你实际上比你所有的学龄前朋友都高一个头，可以很容易地利用这一点。但更多的是因为我们打算抚养一个善良的小女孩。她不仅没有欺负她的朋友，还帮助他们对抗欺凌弱小的人。一个不对自己的错误一笑置之的人。当他们跌倒时帮他们一把的人。她对别人的想法和她对自己的想法一样多。</p><p>      ” Don’t worry about the level of individual prominence you have achieved; worry about the individuals you have helped become better people. This is my final recommendation: Think about the metric by which your life will be judged, and make a resolution to live every day so that in the end, your life will be judged a success.” -  Clayton Christensen</p><p>“不要担心你已经取得的个人显赫成就，而要担心你帮助他们成为更好的人。这是我最后的建议：想一想评判你生活的标准，下定决心每天都要活下去，这样最终你的生活才会被认为是成功的。“--克莱顿·克里斯滕森(Clayton Christensen)--克莱顿·克里斯滕森(Clayton Christensen)</p><p>  There’s a saying in business that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. This may or may not be true; W. Edwards Deming, the source most often credited for the quote, certainly believed the opposite. For our purposes, it doesn’t matter. What is true is that measurement is important. And that to measure, you need to understand what you intend to measure with.</p><p>商界有一种说法，如果你不能衡量它，你就不能管理它。这可能是真的，也可能不是；W·爱德华兹·戴明(W.Edwards Deming)，最常被认为是这句话的来源，肯定持相反的观点。就我们的目的而言，这无关紧要。事实是，衡量是重要的。而要衡量这一点，你需要了解你打算用什么来衡量。</p><p>  When I speak to college students today about their post-college careers, most of the advice I provide has little to do with their career path or salaries or possibilities. It’s to understand, or work towards an understanding of, what makes them happy.</p><p>今天，当我和大学生谈论他们大学毕业后的职业生涯时，我提供的大部分建议与他们的职业道路、薪水或可能性几乎没有什么关系。这是为了理解，或者努力理解是什么让他们快乐。</p><p>  With some distance this is obvious, of course. You’re much more likely to be successful doing something that makes you happy than something that makes you miserable. But it’s surprising how easy it is to lose this when you’re in the middle of making these decisions. Life can come at you fast, and it’s easy to focus on what you think you should do at the expense of what you want to do.</p><p>当然，在保持一定距离的情况下，这一点是显而易见的。你更有可能成功地做一些让你快乐的事情，而不是让你痛苦的事情。但令人惊讶的是，当你正在做这些决定的时候，丢失这些东西是多么容易。生活来得很快，很容易把注意力集中在你认为你应该做的事情上，而忽略了你想做的事情。</p><p>  If money makes you happy, so be it. If it’s having fun, likewise. If helping other people is what drives you, so much the better. As your father, it is not my place to assign you a motivation, but rather try to make sure you understand what your motivation is, and more importantly, the tradeoffs involved. If you focus on making money, you may sacrifice time with friends and family, for example. If you choose a path that allows you to do what you love, you may have to adjust your material expectations downwards to accommodate.</p><p>如果金钱让你快乐，那就随它去吧。如果它玩得很开心，也一样。如果帮助别人是你的动力，那就更好了。作为你的父亲，我不应该给你一个动机，而是试着确保你了解你的动机是什么，更重要的是，了解其中的权衡。例如，如果你专注于赚钱，你可能会牺牲与朋友和家人在一起的时间。如果你选择了一条允许你做自己喜欢的事情的道路，你可能不得不调低你的物质期望来适应。</p><p>  Understanding what makes you happy, and how you might measure success, guarantees neither. But it can’t help but inform your decision-making process so that you have a better chance of getting there.</p><p>了解什么能让你快乐，以及你如何衡量成功，都不能保证。但它不由自主地告知你的决策过程，这样你就有更好的机会实现目标。</p><p>      Over the course of my career, I&#39;ve spent about five nights on the bench seats at the O&#39;Hare airport. I&#39;ve had to sleep at the office maybe half a dozen times. I&#39;ve almost been laid off twice and actually been laid off once.</p><p>在我的职业生涯中，我在奥黑尔机场的长椅上度过了大约五个晚上。我可能已经在办公室睡过六次了。我几乎被解雇过两次，实际上有一次被解雇了。</p><p>  All of which in the professional world means I&#39;ve had things pretty easy. My friends who went into investment banking out of college slept at the office ten times a month in their first few years. As for airports to be stranded in, O&#39;Hare&#39;s not the best, but it&#39;s far from the worst. And one layoff is a streak of luck these days.</p><p>在职场上，所有这些都意味着我过得相当轻松。我的那些大学毕业后进入投资银行业的朋友在最初的几年里每个月都要在办公室睡上10次。至于要滞留的机场，O&#39；Hare；不是最好的，但也远不是最差的。而这些天来，一次裁员是一种运气。</p><p>  Still, none of the above was fun, exactly. When you’re at work at two in the morning and people are screaming at you, or when you get a call in the middle of a meeting with a client in Dallas to inform you that you no longer have a job, life could be better.</p><p>不过，确切地说，上面的这些都不好玩。当你凌晨两点上班时，人们对你大喊大叫，或者当你在达拉斯与一位客户开会时接到一个电话，告诉你你不再有工作，生活可能会更好。</p><p>  What can be useful at such times is to have a fixed point on the horizon. Something to hang on to, something to look forward to, where mundane or major. Vacation. Seeing a good friend. A date (not until you’re old enough). A new record from your favorite band out Saturday. A trip to the islands next weekend. Snow, maybe, next month. Whatever.</p><p>在这种时候，在地平线上有一个固定的点是有用的。一些可以依附的东西，一些可以期待的东西，无论是平凡的还是重要的。放假。去见一个好朋友。约会(等你长大了再约会)。周六你最喜欢的乐队的一张新唱片。下周末去岛屿旅行。下雪，也许，下个月。管他呢。</p><p>  You might not be able to successfully visualize laying on the beach or sitting in the bleachers at Fenway when it’s the middle of the night and everything’s on fire around you, but every second you&#39;re looking forward to something is a second that you&#39;re not dealing with the crisis of the day.</p><p>你可能无法成功地想象在午夜时分躺在海滩上或坐在芬威的露天看台上，周围的一切都着火了，但你期待的每一秒都是你没有处理当天危机的那一秒。这句话的意思是：“你可能无法想象自己躺在海滩上或坐在芬威的露天看台上，周围的一切都着火了，但你期待的每一秒都是你没有处理当天危机的那一秒。”</p><p>    “ If you have one true friend you have more than your share.” - Thomas Fuller</p><p>“如果你有一个真正的朋友，那么你拥有的比你应得的要多。”--托马斯·富勒(Thomas Fuller)。</p><p>  A lot of people you’ll meet use the term friend casually, and apply it indiscriminately to everyone in their social circle. I have no problems with this approach, and there are certainly merits to assuming friendship and good intentions, but it is not an approach that works for me.</p><p>你会遇到很多人不经意地使用“朋友”这个词，并且不加区别地用在他们的社交圈里的每一个人身上。我对这种方法没有问题，假设友谊和善意当然是有好处的，但这不是一种对我有效的方法。</p><p>  If I use the term friend with intent, it is rare, purposeful and has a very specific meaning. If I call someone a friend, I expect them to be there when I need them.</p><p>如果我故意使用“朋友”这个词，它是罕见的、有目的的，并且有非常具体的含义。如果我称某人为朋友，我希望他们会在我需要的时候出现在我身边。</p><p>  You will be friendly with many people throughout your life. People you grow up with. People you go to school with. People you work with. Many of them - most of them if you’re lucky - will be reasonable, good people. Some will be fun. Some will be interesting. Some will simply be the least bad alternative.</p><p>在你的一生中，你会与许多人友好相处。和你一起长大的人。和你一起上学的人。和你一起工作的人。他们中的许多人--如果你幸运的话，他们中的大多数人--都会是讲道理的好人。有些会很有趣的。有些会很有趣。有些只会是最不糟糕的选择。</p><p>  Unless you’re exceptionally lucky, however, you will have a much smaller number of actual friends. In my experience, the difference between a friend and an acquaintance is simple and comes down to convenience. Acquaintances are there for you when it’s convenient for them. Friends are there when it’s not.</p><p>然而，除非你特别幸运，否则你真正的朋友会少得多。根据我的经验，朋友和熟人之间的区别很简单，归根结底是方便。熟人在你方便的时候会在那里等你。朋友不在的时候，朋友就在那里。</p><p>  When you’re young, this might mean remaining friends with someone unpopular or uncool at school. As you get older, it could be being there for someone who’s lost a job, gotten divorced, had surgery or been sick. It may mean, though hopefully not until later in life, being a friend to someone who’s dying.</p><p>当你年轻的时候，这可能意味着和学校里不受欢迎或不酷的人保持朋友关系。随着年龄的增长，它可能会陪伴那些失业、离婚、做过手术或生病的人。这可能意味着，尽管希望直到晚年才能成为垂死的人的朋友。</p><p>  There is nothing easy about visiting a friend with a terminal illness, which is why acquaintances don’t do it. Your job as a friend is to be there when your friend needs you, no exceptions. If they’re sick, you visit them. You do what you can for them or their family. What you don’t do is say, “it’s too hard, I can’t.”</p><p>拜访身患绝症的朋友绝非易事，这就是为什么熟人不会这么做的原因。作为朋友，你的工作就是在朋友需要你的时候出现在你身边，无一例外。如果他们病了，你就去看望他们。你要为他们或他们的家人做你能做的。你不会说，“太难了，我做不到。”</p><p>  In most cases, the stakes will be lower. If your friend is moving, for example, you show up five minutes before they ask you to, throw some hustle at it and you stay until they’re done. If your friend had a relationship end but isn’t up to talking, you sit with them in silence so that they don’t have to be alone. If they lose their job and can’t afford the rent, you take them in. If they get too drunk and end up throwing up in a toilet, you sit with them and hold their hair.</p><p>在大多数情况下，赌注会更低。例如，如果你的朋友要搬家，你在他们要求你之前五分钟就出现了，匆忙一下，你就会一直待到他们完成。如果你的朋友结束了一段恋情，但无法交谈，你可以静静地和他们坐在一起，这样他们就不会孤单。如果他们失业了，付不起房租，你就收留他们。如果他们喝得太醉，最后吐在马桶里，你就和他们坐在一起，抓着他们的头发。</p><p>  If all of this seems like a lot of responsibility, that’s because it is. It’s why most people don’t have many true friends. When you find someone that you care about enough to be there for, and that you know will be there for you, cherish that person and that relationship. Be prepared to sacrifice for it though, because if you’re only there for someone when it’s convenient for you, you can only expect the same in return.</p><p>如果所有这些看起来都是很大的责任，那是因为的确如此。这就是为什么大多数人没有很多真正的朋友。当你找到一个你足够关心的人，你知道他会在那里支持你，珍惜那个人和这段关系。尽管如此，还是要做好牺牲的准备，因为如果你只在方便的时候陪着某人，你只能期待同样的回报。</p><p>    One of the things that businesses strive for - mostly because it’s fantastically lucrative financially - is a monopoly. By virtue of honestly earned success, illegal market manipulation or, more frequently, some combination of the two, competition is eliminated. Absent competition, companies wield immense power, and can essentially dictate terms to customers, suppliers and partners.</p><p>企业努力争取的一件事-主要是因为它在财务上利润丰厚-是垄断。凭借诚实获得的成功、非法的市场操纵，或者更常见的是，这两者的某种组合，竞争就被消除了。在没有竞争的情况下，公司拥有巨大的权力，基本上可以向客户、供应商和合作伙伴发号施令。</p><p>    The funny thing is, over the long term, this is bad for the monopolist. With competition, companies are forced to evolve, to innovate - to compete. In a world with no challengers, these normal market incentives are depressed or eliminated entirely. Which leads to stagnation, laziness and decline.</p><p>有趣的是，从长远来看，这对垄断者不利。随着竞争，公司被迫发展、创新、竞争。在一个没有挑战者的世界里，这些正常的市场激励被压抑或完全消除。这会导致停滞、懒惰和衰落。</p><p>  What’s true for companies is also true for people. There’s a reason the very wealthy say appallingly dumb things. It’s the same reason that wildly successful writers eventually churn out poor material: there’s no one in a position to tell them “what were you thinking?” People who get their way and operate unchecked are universally poorer for it.</p><p>对公司是如此，对个人也是如此。非常富有的人说出令人毛骨悚然的蠢话是有原因的。这与那些极为成功的作家最终会炮制出糟糕的素材的原因是一样的：没有人能够告诉他们“你在想什么？”随心所欲、不受约束地经营的人普遍因此而变得更穷。</p><p>  It’s important to know your mind and to know what you want. It’s unhealthy, however, to always get that. Look for balance, people to challenge you, press you and encourage you to try things you don’t like - or think you don’t like.</p><p>了解你的想法和知道你想要什么是很重要的。然而，总是得到这样的结果是不健康的。寻找平衡，人们向你挑战，向你施压，鼓励你尝试你不喜欢的东西--或者认为你不喜欢的东西。</p><p>  Companies who always get their way inevitably behave in ways that negatively impact the market around them and, counterintuitively, the company itself. People who get their way are just as unfortunate. Don’t be that person.</p><p>总是随心所欲的公司不可避免地会对周围的市场产生负面影响，而且与直觉相反，对公司本身也会产生负面影响。为所欲为的人同样不幸。别做那样的人。</p><p>    “ I am certain that there is too much certainty in the world.” - Michael Crichton</p><p>“我确信世界上有太多的确定性。”--迈克尔·克莱顿。</p><p>  If you’re reading this, you’ve been told a great many things by this point. About yourself, about life, about the world around you. Many cultures would encourage you not only to accept what you were told as the gospel truth but would punish you for questioning it.</p><p>如果你正在阅读这篇文章，那么到目前为止，你已经被告知了很多事情。关于你自己，关于生活，关于你周围的世界。许多文化不仅鼓励你接受别人告诉你的福音真理，还会惩罚你质疑它。</p><p>  You are fortunate to not live in one of these cultures. Accepting something you have been told without question requires faith, and faith is - in my opinion, at least - dangerous. The fact is that a sizable percentage of what you are told will not be correct. Some will deliberately lie to you for their benefit. More often, people will pass along untruths because they believe them to be true.</p><p>你很幸运，没有生活在这些文化中的一种。毫无疑问地接受别人告诉你的事情需要信仰，而信仰--至少在我看来--是危险的。事实是，你被告知的相当大比例的内容将是不正确的。有些人会为了他们的利益而故意对你撒谎。更多的时候，人们会传递不真实的信息，因为他们相信它们是真实的。</p><p>  With the exception of the Red So</p><p>除了红色的苏。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://thisistheway.us/">https://thisistheway.us/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/生活/">#生活</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/manual/">#manual</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/朋友/">#朋友</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
