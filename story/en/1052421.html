Jackson&#39;s e-gold became the world&#39;s first truly successful digital currency, serving over half a million customers and doing billions of dollars&#39; worth of business.</p><p>在20世纪90年代中期，就在PayPal到达之前，比特币前十年来，来自佛罗里达州的肿瘤科医生名为Douglas Jackson创建了一个系统，人们可以通过哪些系统发送由黄金支持的彼此数字支付令牌。杰克逊＆＃39; e-gold成为世界上第一个真正成功的数字货币，服务于超过50万客户，并进行数十亿美元＆＃39;值得的事。</p><p> But after a decade of success, the feds came after him, raiding his company&#39;s office, taking computers, freezing bank accounts, and ultimately extracting a guilty plea for conspiring in an &#34;unlicensed money transmitting business.&#34; Once trailblazing, e-gold was quickly forgotten, derailed first by legal hassles and then by the tsunami of interest in blockchain technology.</p><p> 但经过十年的成功之后，联邦调查局追求他，袭击了他的公司，袭击了他的公司，拿着电脑，冰箱银行账户，并最终提取一个有罪的请求在一个＆＃34;未经许可的货币传输业务。＆＃ 34;一旦开拓者，迅速忘记了电子黄金，首先通过合法麻烦而脱轨，然后通过对区间技术感兴趣的海啸。</p><p> Now Jackson has uncovered information that he thinks can not only overturn his conviction, and thus ease the path to him restarting his business, but help wean alt-currency from what he regards as a ruinous addiction to Satoshi Nakamoto&#39;s brainchild. While the value the markets place on cryptocurrency keeps rising precipitously and no e-currency model closely emulating e-gold has grabbed significant market share in its wake, Jackson remains convinced that if he could only get back in the game, things would be very different. The guilty plea that he now insists was squeezed from him through government trickery blocks his doing legal business in the e-currency space.</p><p> 现在，杰克逊已经发现他认为他不仅可以推翻他的信念，并因此减轻了他的业务的道路，而是帮助Wean Alt-Funcess从他认为是Satoshi Nakamoto＆＃39; Saillchild的毁灭性成瘾。虽然价值在加密货币上的价格急剧上升，但没有密切模拟电子黄金的电子货币模型在其唤醒中抓住了显着的市场份额，但杰克逊仍然相信，如果他只能回到游戏中，事情会非常不同。他现在坚持的内疚关系通过政府诡计阻止他在电子货币空间中的法律业务中挤压他。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s as if I&#39;m the only person in the world not allowed to go and compete in this area where I&#39;d pioneered the industry,&#34; he says. &#34;It&#39;s like everything came off the rails and it&#39;s been a decade of unprecedented malinvestment.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;它和＃39;＆＃39;＆＃39; m是世界上唯一被允许的人在我和＃39; d开展业界的这个领域，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;它和＃39;＆＃39;是一切都离开了铁轨和它＆＃39;已经是前所未有的缺失的初步的十年。＆＃34;</p><p>  Most oncologists don&#39;t bandy about classic Austrian economics terms such as  malinvestment. But Jackson in 1994 came across a Thomas Sowell article in  Forbes celebrating the 50th anniversary of the publication of F.A. Hayek&#39;s  Road to Serfdom. His newly minted interest in Hayek led him to the Laissez Faire Books catalog, and then he was off and running toward his dream of a universally usable, cheap, and easy way to exchange value across the globe that didn&#39;t depend on governments making wise monetary policy choices.</p><p>  大多数肿瘤学家Don＆＃39; T关于经典奥地利经济学术语等澳大利亚人的经济学术语。但1994年杰克逊遇到了福布斯的托马斯萨韦尔文章，庆祝了F.a. Hayek＆＃39; Serfdom的公布50周年。他对哈耶克的新铸造兴趣使他带到了Laissez Faire Books目录，然后他脱离了他的梦想，朝着一个普遍使用，便宜，轻松的方式跑到全球越来越依赖政府的全球价值制定明智的货币政策选择。</p><p> Though he had never taken an economics course and barely understood accounting or double-entry bookkeeping, Jackson was soon on a monetary mission to save civilization from itself. &#34;Many of the worst real-world calamities, wars, in particular,&#34; he told  Barron&#39;s in 2001, can &#34;be causally traced back to economic dislocations—booms and busts—that in turn could be traced to monetary manipulations.&#34;</p><p> 虽然他从未采取过经济学课程，但勉强理解或双入口簿记，杰克逊很快就在货币使命中拯救文明。 ＆＃34;许多最糟糕的真实世界灾难，战争，特别是＃34;他在2001年告诉Barron＆＃39;可以随因果追溯到经济脱离的障碍 - 繁荣和半身像 - 反过来可以追溯​​到货币操纵。＆＃34;</p><p> So Jackson created a system whereby anyone with access to the internet could transfer ownership of digital tokens backed 100 percent by, and transferable into, physical gold (or, later, its cash equivalent), which he either received in bailment from customers or bought in the usual world gold market and kept stored in his office. The company made money off transaction fees, at first a flat 1 percent, then for a time, Jackson says, &#34;capped at the equivalent of 50 cents, very inexpensive.&#34;</p><p> 因此，杰克逊创建了一个系统，任何人都可以访问互联网的任何人可以转移数字代币的所有权，并可转让进入，物理金（或以后，其现金等价物），他们要么从客户收到或购买通常的世界黄金市场并保存在他的办公室。该公司赚取了交易费，起初是一个平坦的1％，然后是一段时间，杰克逊说，＆＃34;加上了50美分，非常便宜的。＆＃34; </p><p> Still later, &#34;we refined the fees to a sliding scale formula,&#34; he says. &#34;The 1 percent made no sense for micro-spends, and 50 cents was too generous for large spends.&#34; Eventually, the maximum fee, which kicked in for transactions amounting to more than about $200, was a gold equivalent which tended to be about $2 at the time. A referral program paid out 10 percent of the company&#39;s transaction fee to any new customer brought in.</p><p>仍然稍后，＆＃34;我们将费用改为滑动尺度公式，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34; 1％的百分比对微花没有意义，50美分对于大量花费太大。＆＃34;最终，最高费用，踢到了超过200美元的交易，这是一个黄金等价物，当时往往约为2美元。推荐计划为任何带来的新客户支付了10％的公司＆＃39;</p><p> Jackson &#34;didn&#39;t have a clue&#34; how to find customers at first, he now admits. He talked up e-gold on cypherpunk-oriented mailing lists and placed some print advertisements in libertarian-oriented publications (which will &#34;probably go down in history as the dumbest, most opaque, confusing print ads ever,&#34; he now says) and even a radio ad on an NPR affiliate in his hometown of Melbourne, Florida.</p><p> 杰克逊＆＃34; Didn＆＃39; T有一个线索＆＃34;如何先找客户，他现在承认。他在Cypherpunk的邮件列表中谈了E-Gold，并将一些印刷广告放在自由主义的出于自由主义的出版物中（这将＆＃34;可能会在历史中作为愚蠢，最不透明，令人兴奋的印刷广告，＆＃34;他现在说）甚至是在佛罗里达州墨尔本的家乡的NPR附属公司的无线电广告。</p><p> But rather than just hard-money hoarders in the rich West, many of e-gold&#39;s customers turned out to be people, often from poorer countries, who were looking for a low-cost, low-hassle, and quick means to, say, send money back to family in India, shop online without a credit card in the Arab world, or sell goods without the fear of clawbacks from buyers that credit cards make possible.</p><p> 但而不是富裕的西部的硬币囤积者，许多电子黄金＆＃39;客户常常是人们，通常来自较贫穷的国家，他们正在寻找低成本，低麻烦和快速手段如图，说，汇款回到印度的家庭，在网上商店没有阿拉伯世界的信用卡，或卖商品而不担心来自买家的信用卡尽可能的买家。</p><p> &#34;The only pathway to business success was to target high volume payment activities,&#34; Jackson explains: &#34;Online retail, bill payment, and remittances of international guest workers.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;唯一的商业成功途径是针对高批量付款活动，＆＃34;杰克逊解释：＆＃34;在线零售，账单，国际客人的汇款和汇款。＆＃34;</p><p> E-gold started gaining media attention around 1999, then &#34;2000 was the breakout year, when exponential growth was clearly evident,&#34; Jackson says. &#34;By February 2000 we had processed only 50,000 payments. Two months later we&#39;d doubled that and by October we passed the million mark.&#34; The gold coins, which were starting to make the office floor groan in Florida, were soon supplanted by gold bars stored in London and Dubai vaults.</p><p> e-gold开始在1999年左右开始介绍媒体关注，然后＆＃34; 2000年是突破年，当指数增长显然明显时，＆＃34;杰克逊说。 ＆＃34;到2000年2月，我们只处理了50,000次付款。两个月后，我们＆＃39; d加倍，到10月我们通过了百万标记。＆＃34;在佛罗里达州开始制作办公室地板呻吟的金币很快被储存在伦敦和迪拜金库的金条。</p><p> In 2000, the e-gold project split its functions into two separate companies: E-gold, which managed digital e-gold accounts and made income solely from user fees; and Gold &amp; Silver Reserve (G&amp;SR), which exchanged currency for e-gold and was thus capable, in monetary policy terms, of engaging in &#34;open market operations,&#34; expanding or contracting the overall supply of e-gold according to market demand.</p><p> 2000年，电子黄金项目将其职能分成两家独立公司：E-Gold，核管理数字电子黄金账户，并仅从用户费用赚取收入;和金＆amp;银储备（G＆amp; SR），其交换电子黄金的货币，因此能够以货币政策术语，从事＆＃34;开放市场运营，＆＃34;根据市场需求，扩大或承担电子黄金的整体供应。</p><p> This bifurcation of functions was vital to moving forward, Jackson says via email. &#34;The model of would-be competitors entailed them buying and selling their medium themselves, effectively engaging in currency exchange. This exposed them to the risk of payment reversal…exchange rate risk…and perhaps even more importantly, if the provider of the system is also the one selling the medium, virtually all of them resort to touting it as an investment (gold is good! Blah blah) and independent providers of exchange are disinclined to compete with them.&#34; A consequence of separating those two functions was that &#34;dozens of independent businesses found it in their economic interest to promote e-gold.&#34;</p><p> 杰克逊通过电子邮件说，这种功能的逐步向前迈进是至关重要的。 ＆＃34;潜在竞争对手的模型需要他们购买和销售他们的媒介，有效地从事货币兑换。这将其视为支付逆转的风险......汇率风险......甚至更重要的是，如果该系统的提供者也是销售中等的人，几乎所有这些都能将其吹捧为投资（黄金是好的！ Blah Blah）和独立交流提供者不愿意与他们竞争。＆＃34;将这两个功能分开的结果是＆＃34;几十名独立企业发现它以其经济利益促进促进电子黄金。＆＃34; </p><p> As Jackson later bragged in a July 2020 online essay, written as part of a public comment process launched by the Financial Stability Board (an international body providing analysis and advice about the global financial system), &#34;e-gold went on by 2006 to serve active customers in over a hundred countries, settle 3 billion (USD-equiv.) worth of P2P payment per annum and amassing gold reserves surpassing those then backing the Canadian Dollar or Mexican Peso.&#34; At its zenith, the alt-currency was backed by 3.8 tons of real gold.</p><p>由于杰克逊后来在7月20日在线文章中被吹嘘，作为金融稳定委员会推出的公众评论过程的一部分（国际机构提供了关于全球金融系统的分析和建议），＆＃34; E-Gold继续前进2006年为一百多个国家提供活跃的客户，结清30亿美元（当时的美元。）每年价值的P2P支付和散发金储量超过那些支持加拿大美元或墨西哥比索。＆＃34;在Zenith，Alt-Funcel被支持了3.8吨真正的黄金。</p><p> &#34;To say Doug was pioneering,&#34; says Kevin Dowd, a Durham University professor of finance and economics who specializes in monetary alternatives and competing currencies, &#34;is an absolute understatement.&#34; Dowd draws attention to e-gold&#39;s market-leading provision of digital payments not tied to any government&#39;s currency with &#34;instantaneous trade at almost zero cost, and that almost 25 years ago.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;说道格是开创性的，＆＃34;凯文迪威表示，达勒姆大学财经教授，专门从事货币替代品和竞争货币，＆＃34;是绝对的轻描淡写。＆＃34; Dowd引起了E-Gold＆＃39;市场领先提供的数字付款，没有与任何政府统一的数字付款＆＃34;瞬间贸易几乎零成本，而且差不多25年前。＆＃34 ;</p><p>  It was a matter of time before e-gold would catch the attention of the government, which does not take kindly to financial transactions that it cannot easily trace and tax. Jackson became aware early on that crooks, from credit card scammers to child porn purchasers, were sometimes using his system to bilk people and traffic in illicit goods. So he volunteered user information on suspected criminals to inspectors of various federal police agencies, most notably the U.S. Postal Service.  Wired later reported that E-gold had become &#34;one of law enforcement&#39;s most productive honey pots, providing information that helped lead to the arrest and conviction of some of the web&#39;s most wanted credit card thieves and hackers.&#34;</p><p>  这是电子黄金将引起政府注意力的时间问题，这不对金融交易慷慨解那说它不容易追踪和税收。杰克逊早早意识到这一骗子，从信用卡诈骗者到儿童色情采购商，有时候使用他的系统在非法商品中携手和交通。因此，他为各种联邦警察机构的检验员提供了关于涉嫌犯罪分子的用户信息，最重要的是美国邮政服务。后来有线报道，电子黄金已成为＆＃34;法律执法之一＆＃39; S最富有成效的蜂蜜盆，提供有助于导致某些网站的逮捕和定罪的信息。和黑客。＆＃34;</p><p> Unlike some of the cyber-anarchists who later promoted bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  Jackson had no ideological or practical interest in helping people commit crimes or evade law enforcement. He even elided his own company&#39;s user agreement in cooperating with cops.</p><p> 与后来促进比特币或其他加密货币的网络无政府主义者不同，杰克逊对帮助人们犯罪或逃避执法没有意识形态或实际兴趣。他甚至在与警察合作中的用户协议时犹豫了他自己的公司和＃39;</p><p> &#34;While inaccurately depicted in the media as a system affording anonymity and hospitable to criminal activity,&#34; Jackson wrote in a 2020 memo about his ongoing legal conflict, &#34;bad actors who believed this and elected to use e-gold as a platform for illicit activities commonly discovered that decision to be their career-ending, game-over mistake.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;在媒体中不准确地描绘为一个提供匿名和热情的犯罪活动的系统，＆＃34;杰克逊在2020年的备忘录中关于他正在进行的法律冲突写道：＆＃34;谁相信这一点，并选择使用电子黄金为非法活动的平台不良行为者普遍发现，决定将自己的职业生涯结束，游戏结束的错误。 ＆＃34;</p><p> None of that was enough to protect e-gold from the feds. In December 2005, Jackson&#39;s home and offices were raided by the Secret Service and FBI, who took everything they could and froze the company&#39;s bank accounts. (The gold by then was safely bailed overseas and held in trust.)</p><p> 没有人足以保护电子黄金免受美联储的影响。 2005年12月，杰克逊＆＃39;家庭和办公室被秘密服务和联邦调查局突击，他们拿走了他们可以汇集的一切，并将公司冻结在一起。 （那种黄金然后被安全地批保了海外并信任。）</p><p> Judge John M. Facciola, who signed the initial warrants, would complain in a later hearing that he&#39;d been misled to believe he was granting warrants to break up some sort of child pornography ring. Though the actual charges against Jackson and his company would have nothing to do with child porn, that didn&#39;t stop prosecutors and the media from rumor-mongering about awful transactions taking place in the shadows.</p><p> John M. Facciola签署初始认股权证，将抱怨后来听到他＆＃39; D被误导，相信他授予了分解某种儿童色情戒指的认股权证。虽然针对杰克逊和他的公司的实际指控与儿童色情无关，但是没有从谣言中停止检察官和媒体关于阴影的可怕交易。 </p><p> &#34;It never occurred to me in my wildest dreams,&#34; Facciola said in a hearing 13 days after the initial raid, &#34;that far from operating surreptitiously, there have been negotiations with this company and the Internal Revenue Service as to…transmitting money and being subject to…the Bank Secrecy Act.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;在我最疯狂的梦想中，我从未发生过，＆＃34; Facciola在最初的RAID，＆＃34后13天在听证会上说;那么远远偷偷地运作，已经与这家公司进行了谈判和内部收入服务......传递资金并受到......银行保密法。＆ ＃34;</p><p> Jackson, his companies, and two of his partners were charged in April 2007 with conspiring to operate and operating an &#34;unlicensed money transmitting business,&#34; conspiring to &#34;launder monetary instruments,&#34; and violating D.C. law (though the companies were not located there) by transmitting money without a license in the District of Columbia.</p><p> 杰克逊，他的公司和他的两家合作伙伴于2007年4月被收取，并在雪地运营和运营AN＆＃34;未经许可的货币传输业务，＆＃34;引领＆＃34;洗涤金钱仪器，＆＃34;并违反了D.C.法律（虽然这些公司没有在没有哥伦比亚地区的许可证的情况下发货。</p><p> Jackson says he sincerely did not believe his companies were required to register or be licensed as a money transmitter. This was not a crazy or purely self-serving thing to believe in 2007. Jackson cited contemporaneous Treasury Department reports that discuss both e-gold and money transmitter laws and do not reach the conclusion that the former is bound by the latter.</p><p> 杰克逊说，他真诚地不相信他的公司被要求注册或被许可作为货币变送器。这不是一个疯狂或纯粹的自我服务，可以相信2007年。杰克逊引用了同期财政部报告，讨论了电子黄金和金钱传输者法律，并没有得出前者被后者约束的结论。</p><p> A 2007 Indiana University Maurer School of Law paper co-authored by Stephen T. Middlebrook, who was at the time senior counsel at the Treasury Department and co-chair of its Working Group on Electronic Payments Systems, observed that four federal statutes regarding money transmitting &#34;all contain different definitions of &#39;money transmitter.&#39;&#34; (The paper came out between the indictment and the guilty plea in the e-gold case.)</p><p> 2007年印第安纳大学Maurer学院由Stephen T. Middlebrook合作，他是财政部和电子支付系统工作组的高级咨询，观察到有关发货的四个联邦章程＆＃34;所有包含不同的＆＃39;钱发射器。＆＃39;＆＃34; （本文在电子金案中的起诉书和内疚关系之间出版。）</p><p> &#34;Because e-gold is operating outside the traditional realm of money transmitters,&#34; Middlebrook&#39;s paper continued, &#34;it is necessary to explore the nuances of the statutory definitions in order to determine whether the laws encompass e-gold. The inconsistencies in the statutes…make advising clients who want to implement novel new payment mechanisms a difficult task.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;因为电子黄金在传统的货币发动机领域外，＆＃34; ＆＃39;纸张继续，＆＃34;有必要探索法定定义的细微差别，以确定法律是否包括电子黄金。法规中的不一致......使希望实施新的新支付机制的建议客户成为一项艰巨的任务。＆＃34;</p><p> As Jackson would insist, his company did not send money from one place or person to another, like Western Union: It merely shifted ownership shares of the technically nonmonetary physical commodity of gold. It did not make loans, so it wasn&#39;t a bank. Since E-gold did not deal in &#34;currency or funds denominated in the currency of any country,&#34; then it should be exempt from statutes governing &#34;money transmitting,&#34; Jackson&#39;s legal team argued. No actual regulatory agency had ever told them otherwise before the arrests.</p><p> 正如杰克逊所希望的那样，他的公司没有像西联盟一样从一个地方或一个人汇款：它只是转向了技术上的金牌的所有权股。它没有贷款，所以它不是一个银行。由于电子黄金没有交易＆＃34;货币或资金以任何国家/地区的货币计价，＆＃34;然后它应该免于管理法规＆＃34;货币传输，＆＃34;杰克逊＆＃39;法律团队争辩说。在逮捕之前，没有任何实际的监管机构在他们身上告诉过他们。</p><p> Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia disagreed, ruling in response to a preliminary motion that the definition of &#34;funds&#34; should encompass the gold value controlled by Jackson&#39;s clients. After butting up against such judgments and shelling out millions in fines and legal defense, the e-gold defendants in July 2008 decided to plead guilty, in Jackson&#39;s case to money laundering and the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was sentenced to 300 hours of community service plus a 36-month supervised release, including a requirement to wear an ankle bracelet, with six months of it pure house arrest.</p><p> 法官美国地区法院罗斯玛丽罗梅尔为哥伦比亚地区不同意，裁决初步动议，以促进＆＃34;资金＆＃34;应该包括由杰克逊＆＃39;客户控制的金价值。在遵守此类判决并剥夺罚款和法律辩护中的数百万判决后，2008年7月的电子金被告决定在杰克逊＆＃39; S案件中辩护有罪，并为洗钱和未经许可的货币传输业务的运作。他被判处300小时的社区服务加上36个月的监督释放，包括戴踝手镯的要求，六个月的纯粹的房子逮捕。 </p><p> Judge Collyer in her sentencing memo seemed to understand that something other than perfidy was at issue, writing that &#34;no doubt Dr. Jackson has respect for law&#34; and that his &#34;intent was not there to engage in illegal conduct.&#34; Collyer added that &#34;there is no reason to shut down e-gold and G&amp;SR, and every reason to have them come into legal compliance….Incarceration for Dr. Jackson would be counterproductive.&#34;</p><p>她的判决备忘录哥伦比尔似乎明白，除了完善的东西是出现问题，写作＆＃34;毫无疑问，杰克逊博士尊重法律＆＃34;那他的＆＃34;意图不是在那里参与非法行为。＆＃34;筹码补充说：＆＃34;没有理由关闭电子黄金和G＆amp; SR，以及让他们进入法律遵守的理由......杰克逊博士的适度遵守。＆＃34;</p><p> Economist Dowd argues that the whole prosecution was a mistake in the first place: &#34;It was a remarkable &#39;own goal&#39; for the U.S. government to go after [Jackson]. He was bringing in a steady stream of crooks.&#34; Dowd, who wrote a 2014 monograph for the Institute of Economic Affairs on government attempts to thwart alternative currencies, contends that Jackson &#34;should have been on the federal payroll.&#34;</p><p> 经济学家德国辩称，整个检控首先是一个错误：＆＃34;这是一个非凡的＆＃39;自己的目标＆＃39;对于美国政府进行[杰克逊]。他带着稳定的骗子流。＆＃34;为政府举办的经济事务研究所编写了2014年专着的Dowd，争夺杰克逊＆＃34;应该是在联邦工资单中。＆＃34;</p><p>  E-gold, embattled, soldiered on after the 2005 raid, despite eventually losing over $4 million to fines and takings, with client holdings tied up in what would be yearslong unfreezing negotiations with the federal government. Jackson tried to keep the company afloat, doing a more thorough job vetting customers, locking out certain suspect nations entirely. But the guilty plea itself was a Catch-22, because someone with his felony record could not obtain the licenses necessary to function legally as a money transmitting business. In 2009, E-gold ceased operations.</p><p>  2005年突袭后，E-Gold，销毁的士兵，尽管最终失去了超过400万美元的罚款和接受，但客户控股在与联邦政府的联邦政府谈判中有什么关系。杰克逊试图让公司漂浮，做一个更彻底的工作审计客户，完全锁定了某些嫌疑人。但有罪的请求本身是一个捕获-22，因为他的重罪记录的人无法获得合法运作所需的许可证作为货币传输业务。 2009年，电子黄金停止运营。</p><p> But now a reprieve could potentially be on the way. Jackson learned a few years ago via a Florida Freedom of Information request that the government hid from him—illegally, he argues—potentially exculpatory evidence that could have changed the course of the case and dissuaded him from pleading guilty.</p><p> 但现在缓刑可能会在路上。杰克逊几年前通过佛罗里达州的信息自由来了解，政府从他非法隐藏起来，他认为可能会改变案件的过程并劝阻他诉讼。</p><p> A draft legal opinion done for the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR) in 2006 concluded that his companies were neither &#34;funds transmitters&#34; nor &#34;foreign currency exchangers&#34; under Florida law, that there is &#34;no evidence that e-gold is money of the United States or of any other country which is designated as legal tender,&#34; and thus that &#34;the activities of e-gold and G&amp;SR are not subject to regulation through&#34; Florida&#39;s relevant money transmitter regulations.</p><p> 2006年为佛罗里达州金融监管办公室（OFR）的法律意见草案得出结论，他的公司既不是＆＃34;资金发射器＆＃34; Nor＆＃34;外币交换者＆＃34;在佛罗里达州法律下，有＆＃34;没有证据表明电子黄金是美国的金钱，也没有被指定为合法招标的国家/地区;因此，＆＃34; e-gold和g＆amp; sr的活动不受＆＃34的规定。佛罗里达州和第39页的相关资金发射器法规。</p><p> The federal indictment stated, despite the contrary draft opinion delivered by a state lawyer to Florida&#39;s OFR, that Jackson&#39;s companies &#34;were required to be licensed…by the State of Florida.&#34; Jackson argues that the government&#39;s obligations under the Brady  Rule, which requires that prosecutors dis-close possibly exculpatory evidence, dictate that the feds should have revealed this OFR opinion.</p><p> 尽管国家律师向佛罗里达州和＃39;杰克逊＆＃39;公司＆＃34所提供的意见草案，但佛罗里达州＆＃39;由佛罗里达州被许可，＆＃34所要求的差异。＆＃34;杰克逊认为，政府＆＃39;在布拉迪统治下的义务，这要求检察官不可思议，可能是漏洞证据，决定联邦政府应该揭示这一意见。</p><p> Had he known about it, Jackson says, he would have sought a similar opinion from the relevant regulatory agency in D.C., whose laws he was charged with breaking despite not being located there. He believes they would have agreed with Florida at the time and insists that, had the feds revealed the Florida OFR opinion, he would not have pleaded guilty in the first place.</p><p> 杰克逊说，如果他知道，杰克逊说，他本来将寻求关于D.C的相关监管机构的类似意见。尽管没有所在的地方，他被指控他的法律。他认为他们当时会同意佛罗里达州并坚持认为，如果美联储揭示了佛罗里达州的意见，他就不会首先恳求内疚。 </p><p> Not only did Jackson not know about this opinion but neither the grand jury that indicted him nor the judge overseeing the case did either. The Secret Service, he discovered, had instructed the OFR to not communicate with Jackson or his associates at all.</p><p>杰克逊不仅不了解这个意见，而且既不是引起他的盛大陪审团也不是监督案件的法官。他发现的秘密服务已指示OFR根本没有与杰克逊或他的员工沟通。</p><p> Jackson filed a petition in July 2020 to overturn his conviction. While motions have been filed on both sides, no decision has come down as of press time.</p><p> 杰克逊于2020年7月提出了一份请愿书以推翻他的信念。虽然两侧归档了动议，但在媒体上没有决定。</p><p> In the wake of the original prosecution, many states have clarified that businesses such as E-gold, even if not actually shifting national currencies from one person to another, do fall under the regulatory aegis of money transmitting laws. The Treasury Department&#39;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ruled in 2011 that any digital currency facilitator involving U.S. citizens operating anywhere in the world is subject to all the domestic regulatory burdens of an official &#34;money services business.&#34; Nowadays, even two citizens engaging in a private trade of bitcoin for dollars can wind up before a judge. And new Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen believes that &#34;we really need to examine ways in which we can curtail&#34; the use of cryptocurrency &#34;and make sure that money laundering doesn&#39;t occur through those channels.&#34;</p><p> 在原始起诉之后，许多国家澄清了e-gold等企业，即使实际上并没有将一个人从一个人转移到另一个人，也落在货币传递法律的监管aegis下。财政部＆＃39; 2011年的金融罪行执法网络裁定，涉及世界上任何地方的美国公民的任何数字货币促进者都受到官方的所有国内监管负担的影响。＆＃34;如今，甚至两个公民甚至从事比特币的私人贸易为美元就可以在法官之前结束。和新的财政部长珍妮特·耶伦相信＆＃34;我们真的需要检查我们可以缩减的方式＆＃34;使用加密电脑和＃34;并确保洗钱不受这些渠道发生的。＆＃34;</p><p> Regulatory authorities continue to have it out for digital currencies. But Jackson believes there is a place for a product like e-gold that offers a usable escape from government monetary policy without striving to evade financial information regulations.</p><p> 监管机构继续为数字货币提供。但杰克逊认为，作为电子黄金这样的产品有一个地方，可以在不努力逃避财务信息法规的情况下，从政府货币政策中提供可用的逃脱。</p><p>  Law enforcement may have pushed E-gold out of the e-currency market, but is it still a usable business model? Crypto has since proliferated into near-infinite varieties and soared to unprecedented market valuations. Internet-enabled monetary competition between various government fiat currencies the past two decades, some economists theorize, may have helped keep price inflation low. Gold—even gold split up into bits and bytes with ownership shifted around the world cheaply and nearly instantaneously—is perhaps just a barbarous relic, destined to be outcompeted in day-to-day transactions by both government money and blockchain coins.</p><p>  法律执法可能已经推动了电子货币市场的电子金，但它仍然是一个可用的商业模式？ Crypto已激增进入近无限品种并飙升到前所未有的市场估值。在过去的二十年中，各种政府菲亚特货币之间的互联网货币竞争，一些经济学家理解，可能有助于保持价格的低位。黄金 - 即使是金融率在世界各地廉价地转移到世界各地的比特和字节，几乎瞬间 - 也许只是一个野蛮的遗物，注定要在日常交易中露面，由政府金钱和区块CONS脱颖而出。</p><p> But Lawrence H. White, a monetary economist at George Mason University specializing in free banking and currency competition, points out that the market had decided as of the mid-2000s that e-gold met consumer demand just fine. &#34;You can say it&#39;s not for me, it doesn&#39;t serve any need I have,&#34; White says. &#34;But it&#39;s up to the market to tell us how useful it is for people. From a standard economic perspective, we don&#39;t second-guess people&#39;s preferences for what choices help them achieve their purposes and realize more gains from trade.&#34;</p><p> 但是，乔治梅森大学的货币经济学家劳伦斯H White专门从事自由银行和货币竞争，指出，市场已截至2000年代中期，即电子黄金达到消费需求。 ＆＃34;你可以说出来＆＃39;不适合我，它不适用于我的任何需要，＆＃34;白说。 ＆＃34;但它＆＃39;达到市场，告诉我们它对人们有用。从标准的经济角度来看，我们不＆＃39; t＆＃39; of the the the-glushe＆＃39;偏好的选择帮助他们实现其目的，从贸易中实现更多的收益。＆＃34;</p><p> Jackson sees the rise of crypto as a direct consequence of what the government did to him. The bitcoin bubble &#34;never would have happened in the first place if we had not had to exit the business,&#34; he contends. &#34;Our exit afforded the foundational myth bitcoin started with, that &#39;look what happened to e-gold!&#39;&#34; If the feds could take down a single alt-currency company, better to build instead an entire decentralized system.</p><p> 杰克逊认为加密的崛起是政府对他所做的事情的直接后果。比特币泡泡＆＃34;如果我们不得不退出业务，＆＃34就永远不会发生在第一个地方他争辩。 ＆＃34;我们的出口提供了基础神话比特币开始，那个＆＃39;看看E-Gold的发生了什么！＆＃39;＆＃34;如果美联储可以取下单一的ALT-COMPECT公司，最好更好地建立一个整个分散的系统。 </p><p> That&#39;s not the lesson one should take from his experience, Jackson insists. He pushes back against the widespread belief that E-gold was &#34;shut down by the government, and the reason was some government antipathy to competition with the almighty buck. That wasn&#39;t the case, neither aspect. We weren&#39;t  shut down, though we did eventually have to close down. And protecting the dollar from competition had nothing to do with it.&#34;</p><p>杰克逊坚持认为，这不是课程的课程，而不是课程。他推动了普遍的信念，即e-gold是＆＃34;被政府关闭，原因是一些政府对全能的降压竞争的政府对抗。那个＆＃39; t这种情况，既不是方面。我们不再关闭，虽然我们最终必须关闭。保护美元与竞争对手无关。＆＃34;</p><p> He points out that in the sentencing, Collyer was explicit that E-gold should continue to exist after adopting proper anti–money laundering standards and getting the appropriate money transmitting licenses. Yet his guilty plea made that impossible.</p><p> 他指出，在判决中，筹码明确认为，在采用适当的反洗钱标准并获得适当的货币运输许可证后，将继续存在电子黄金。然而，他有罪的请求使得这是不可能的。</p><p> With his vision for how to run an e-currency sidelined, Jackson complains that there has been &#34;no progress toward what I was trying to accomplish.&#34; Gold, historically and to this day, has been a great hedge against sovereigns destroying the value of their currency and therefore a great basis for new competition. Those clients of the original e-gold who eventually got their money back out of the system received anywhere from 200 percent to 500 percent more dollar value than they put in, thanks to gold&#39;s price appreciation, he says.</p><p> 杰克逊与如何运行电子货币签名的愿景，杰克逊抱怨有＆＃34;没有进入我试图完成的事情。＆＃34;历史上，这一天，黄金是一个伟大的对冲敌人，摧毁了他们的货币价值，因此是新竞争的重要依据。他说，最终获得了原始电子金的客户，最终收到了70％至500％的人收到了200％到500％，而不是金色的价格升值。</p><p> Bitcoin, he argues, is too slow and too expensive; it&#39;s ess</p><p> 他争辩说，比特币太慢，太贵了;它＆＃39; s ess</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://reason.com/2021/03/13/the-alt-currency-martyr/">https://reason.com/2021/03/13/the-alt-currency-martyr/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/比特币/">#比特币</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/电子/">#电子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/feared/">#feared</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/货币/">#货币</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
