It held about $20,000 in coins belonging to Bank of America and two other banks, Newell said in an interview. He sent it all.</p><p>纽威尔在康涅狄格州斯特拉特福德的分支机构相对较小。Newell在接受采访时说，它持有约2万美元的硬币，属于美国银行和另外两家银行。他都寄来了。</p><p>  The shortage was so large, other New England branches had been told to send money as well.</p><p>短缺如此之大，其他新英格兰分行也被告知要寄钱。</p><p> As Garda’s armored trucks became ubiquitous on American roads, the international security contractor also moved into the little-known but growing business of storing money for U.S. banks. It took just eight years for Garda to become the industry leader, holding money for some of the largest banks in the world.</p><p>随着加尔达的装甲车在美国的道路上变得无处不在，这家国际安全承包商也进入了鲜为人知但正在增长的为美国银行储钱的业务。仅用了八年时间，加尔达就成为了行业领先者，为世界上一些最大的银行持有资金。</p><p>  A  Tampa Bay Times investigation has found that Garda lost track of millions of dollars inside its vaults, then concealed the missing money from the banks that were its clients.</p><p>坦帕湾时报的一项调查发现，Garda在其金库中失去了数百万美元的踪迹，然后向其客户银行隐瞒了丢失的资金。</p><p> Court records and interviews depict some of the vaults as chaotic places where employees routinely ignored protocol and lost money. Some were rife with unsolved thefts and lacked basic safeguards like high-quality security cameras.</p><p>法庭记录和采访将一些金库描述为混乱的地方，员工经常无视礼仪，赔钱。其中一些充斥着未解决的盗窃事件，缺乏高质量安全摄像头等基本保障措施。</p><p> Garda sends banks a daily accounting of their balance in each vault. But as cash went missing, some branches kept reporting that the money was there, the  Times found.</p><p>加尔达向银行发送了他们在每个金库的余额的每日账目。但泰晤士报发现，随着现金丢失，一些分支机构不断报告说，钱在那里。</p><p>  High-level Garda executives became aware of the discrepancies as early as 2014, a company document obtained by the  Times shows. They set out to tally how much was missing and estimated roughly $9 million, according to the document.</p><p>时报获得的一份公司文件显示，加达的高层管理人员早在2014年就意识到了这些差异。根据这份文件，他们开始统计失踪的人数，估计约为900万美元。</p><p> It’s not clear how Garda responded.

But they were unknowingly looking at another bank’s money, he said.</p><p>然后向审计人员展示了他们预期的金额。但他说，他们在不知不觉中查看了另一家银行的资金。</p><p> “They would pretty much bamboozle the auditors, when in fact they have no clue where the money is,” said Newell, who ran the Stratford branch. He said Garda terminated him in 2019 after he complained about safety problems.</p><p>经营斯特拉特福德分行的纽威尔说：“他们几乎会欺骗审计师，而实际上他们根本不知道钱在哪里。”他说，加尔达在他抱怨安全问题后于2019年解雇了他。</p><p> “I don’t know how they have not gotten caught,” he added.</p><p>“我不知道他们怎么没被抓到，”他补充说。</p><p> Garda did not agree to interview requests for this story. In a statement to the  Times last month, the company said it handles about $8 billion a day for 8,000 clients at more than 75 vaults. It said it has “industry-leading controls in place to monitor the constant movement of our clients’ money.” The company added that the banks’ assets are never at risk because the money is insured.</p><p>加尔达不同意就这篇报道接受采访。在上个月给时报的一份声明中，该公司表示，它在75个金库为8000名客户每天处理约80亿美元。该公司表示，它“实施了行业领先的控制措施，以监控我们客户资金的持续流动。”该公司补充说，银行的资产永远不会面临风险，因为这笔钱是有保险的。</p><p> “Any discrepancies detected are immediately investigated, reported and resolved,” the statement continued. “Inventory reconciliation is normal course of business for any cash vault operation.”</p><p>“任何发现的不符之处都会立即进行调查、报告和解决，”声明继续说。“对于任何现金金库操作来说，库存对账都是正常的业务过程。”</p><p> When the  Times sent the company a detailed summary of its reporting, Garda did not respond.</p><p>当泰晤士报向该公司发送了一份详细的报道摘要时，加尔达没有做出回应。</p><p> Garda’s U.S. operation doesn’t publish a client list. But the  Times determined it has held money for at least five of the nation’s 10 largest banks: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PNC Bank and TD Bank.</p><p>加尔达的美国业务没有公布客户名单。但“泰晤士报”确定，它至少为美国十大银行中的五家持有资金：摩根大通(JPMorgan Chase)、美国银行(Bank Of America)、富国银行(Wells Fargo)、PNC银行和道明银行(TD Bank)。</p><p> It is not clear which of those banks currently use Garda’s vaults, whether any knew about issues in Garda’s vaults or whether any money is missing today. The banks declined to comment.</p><p>目前还不清楚这些银行中有哪些目前在使用加尔达的金库，是否有人知道加尔达的金库存在问题，或者今天是否有任何资金丢失。这些银行拒绝置评。</p><p> The company also stores money for the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis was among the banks that received inaccurate reports because money was missing, according to Bolton, who managed Garda’s St. Louis branch.</p><p>该公司还为美联储储存资金，据管理Garda圣路易斯分行的Bolton称，圣路易斯联邦储备银行是因资金丢失而收到不准确报告的银行之一。</p><p> The Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors declined to comment, and the St. Louis bank did not respond to interview requests.</p><p>美联储理事会拒绝置评，圣路易斯银行也没有回应采访请求。</p><p>  As Garda has become a global private-security powerhouse, the company has taken on important and wide-ranging roles far beyond the U.S. currency system. Other divisions of the company provide college campus security and carry out sensitive defense contracts, including protecting the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.</p><p>随着加尔达成为全球私人安保巨头，该公司承担了远远超出美元货币体系的重要而广泛的角色。该公司的其他部门提供大学校园安全，并执行敏感的国防合同，包括保护美国驻阿富汗喀布尔大使馆。</p><p> The Canada-based parent company posts consistently strong operating margins that have allowed it to attract investors and grow at a breakneck pace. In just 15 years, its annual revenue increased from less than $200 million to $2.7 billion. In September, it began its boldest move yet — an ongoing hostile bid to buy G4S, the world’s largest private security firm.</p><p>这家总部位于加拿大的母公司公布了持续强劲的运营利润率，这使得它能够吸引投资者，并以惊人的速度增长。在短短15年内，它的年收入从不到2亿美元增加到27亿美元。今年9月，它开始了迄今最大胆的举动-正在进行的敌意收购世界上最大的私人保安公司G4S。</p><p> The company’s American armored truck empire is run out of Boca Raton. Its trucks have shuttled money between businesses and Garda vaults across the state, including in Tampa, Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville.</p><p>该公司的美国装甲车帝国博卡拉顿(Boca Raton)已经用完了。它的卡车在全州的企业和加尔达金库之间运送资金，包括在坦帕、迈阿密、奥兰多和杰克逊维尔。</p><p> There are indications, however, that the U.S. operation’s growth came at the expense of basic safeguards that are commonplace at other major companies.</p><p>然而，有迹象表明，美国业务的增长是以牺牲其他大公司常见的基本保障措施为代价的。</p><p>  A  Times investigation published in March described the armored truck business taking shortcuts on maintenance and training. Trucks regularly lacked reliable brakes, seatbelts or even seats. The  Times found that hundreds of people had been injured in Garda crashes and at least 19 had died, many in wrecks caused by mechanical failures or driver error. There have been at least three additional fatal crashes since then.</p><p>泰晤士报3月份发布的一项调查描述了装甲车业务在维护和培训方面走捷径。卡车经常缺乏可靠的刹车、安全带甚至座椅。泰晤士报发现，已有数百人在加尔达的撞车事故中受伤，至少19人死亡，其中许多人死于机械故障或司机失误造成的残骸中。自那以后，至少又发生了三起致命的撞车事故。</p><p> Two former Garda employees say the company attempted to conceal the fallout of its safety problems, as well. The employees — whose accounts have not been previously reported — said they were told to manipulate financial records to downplay the potential costs of those wrecks, increasing the company’s value.</p><p>加尔达的两名前员工表示，该公司也试图掩盖其安全问题的后果。这些员工-他们的账户之前没有被报道-说他们被告知操纵财务记录，以淡化这些残骸的潜在成本，从而增加公司的价值。</p><p> Joseph James, a vice president of finance at Garda’s U.S. arm from 2013 to 2015, confirmed those employees’ accounts and the issues in the company’s vaults.</p><p>2013年至2015年担任加达美国分公司财务副总裁的约瑟夫·詹姆斯(Joseph James)证实了这些员工的账户以及公司金库中的问题。</p><p>  Extreme cost-cutting helped the company grow quickly, but it also caused problems, he said. And when it came to Garda’s approach to handling money, he said, the problems were big enough to undermine the premise of the business.</p><p>他说，极端的成本削减帮助公司快速增长，但也带来了问题。他说，当谈到加尔达处理资金的方式时，问题大到足以破坏业务的前提。</p><p> “What do you expect an armored car company to be good at?” he said. “Taking care of money.”</p><p>“你认为一家装甲车公司擅长什么？”他说。“管好钱。”</p><p>  Most major cities have a Garda vault. The biggest ones contain well over $100 million. They operate out of nondescript buildings tucked in industrial city pockets and office parks. The only clue about what happens inside is the armored trucks that roll out of the garage.</p><p>大多数大城市都有加尔达金库。最大的那些包含的资金远远超过1亿美元。他们在隐藏在工业城市口袋和办公园区中的不起眼的建筑中运营。关于里面发生了什么的唯一线索是从车库里开出来的装甲车。</p><p>      Some of the currency is destined for grocery stores, gas stations and malls. But the armored truck industry has long offered its vaults to banks as well.</p><p>一些货币将运往杂货店、加油站和商场。但装甲车行业长期以来也向银行提供金库。</p><p> In December 2013, Garda scored a deal that helped it jump to the top of that field.</p><p>2013年12月，Garda达成了一项交易，帮助其跃居该领域的榜首。</p><p> Bank of America, the nation’s second-largest bank, signed a 12-year agreement outsourcing many of its vaults to Garda. The bank sold Garda a large chunk of its existing vault operation, which included 32 buildings and 1,000 employees.</p><p>美国第二大银行美国银行签署了一份为期12年的协议，将其许多金库外包给Garda。该银行将其现有金库业务的一大部分出售给了Garda，其中包括32栋建筑和1000名员工。</p><p> Both parties called it a win. Bank of America reduced overhead costs, and Garda instantly doubled its vault business.</p><p>两党都称这是一场胜利。美国银行降低了管理成本，Garda立即将其金库业务翻了一番。</p><p> But as Garda boasted about the deal in public, executives in charge of the expansion were discovering a problem: Millions of dollars had gone missing from Garda’s existing vaults, and the company had no idea where the money had gone.</p><p>但就在加尔达公开吹嘘这笔交易时，负责扩建的高管发现了一个问题：加尔达现有的金库里有数百万美元不见了，公司也不知道这些钱到哪里去了。</p><p> Shellie Crandall, who had been hired to oversee Garda’s vaults several months before the Bank of America deal was announced, was “apoplectic” when she learned multiple locations were missing money, according to James, the finance vice president.</p><p>谢莉·克兰德尔(Shellie Crandall)在宣布与美国银行的交易前几个月受雇负责监管加尔达的金库，据该公司财务副总裁詹姆斯(James)称，当她得知多个地点丢失资金时，她“中风了”。</p><p> Crandall previously was a vice president at Chase and also spent more than 18 years at Brink’s, where she and James worked together.</p><p>克兰德尔之前是大通银行的副总裁，也在Brink‘s工作了18年多，在那里她和詹姆斯一起工作。</p><p> James said he watched Crandall relay the news to one of Garda’s highest-ranking officials: Patrick Prince, the chief financial officer for Garda’s operations across the world and second-in-command to Garda’s founder and CEO, Stephan Crétier.</p><p>詹姆斯说，他看到克兰德尔将这一消息传达给加尔达最高级别的官员之一：帕特里克·普林斯(Patrick Prince)，他是加尔达全球业务的首席财务官，也是加尔达创始人兼首席执行官斯蒂芬·克雷蒂埃(Stephan Crétier)的二把手。</p><p>  Crandall, who left Garda in 2016, declined to comment. Garda did not make Prince available for an interview.</p><p>克兰德尔于2016年离开加达，他拒绝置评。加尔达没有让普林斯接受采访。</p><p> Executive Summary: This document is to provide data about current known Out of Balance conditions in the CVS vaults and request direction on resolution of all OOB’s to ensure we drive a culture of accountability for losses.  In summary, $9,140,279 OOB conditions have been identified and many OOB’s date back to previous years.</p><p>执行摘要：本文档旨在提供有关CVS保管库当前已知失衡情况的数据，并要求指导解决所有OOB问题，以确保我们推动对损失负责的文化。总而言之，已经确定了9,140,279美元的OOB条件，许多OOB的日期可以追溯到前几年。</p><p>   Background: The creation and additional CVS infrastructure at the end of 2013 allowed for a focus many operational areas and issues. One focus area was around controls and the mandate to balance each vault and every customer inventory nightly. As the middle management structure was hired/added and their respective CVS sites were visited, it was discovered that the field organization has had known out of balance conditions in several vaults for an extended period of time. Additionally, it was identified that strict adherence to dual control and documented control procedures were not being followed.</p><p>背景：2013年底创建并增加了CVS基础设施，使许多运营领域和问题成为焦点。一个重点领域是关于控制和每晚平衡每个保险库和每个客户库存的任务。在租用/添加中间管理结构并访问其各自的CVS站点时，发现现场组织在较长一段时间内已了解到多个存储库中的不平衡情况。此外，还发现没有严格遵守双重控制和文件化控制程序。</p><p> In January 2014,   ,   , and Shellie Crandall formed a team to identify, review, report known OOB conditions and provide a framework for clearing or closing (paying) all known OOB conditions. The team members included   ,   ,   , and various other GW employees. The objective was to identify any known but unreported (to customers) OOB conditions (defined as vault currency/coin did not equal the amount being reported to the customer)</p><p>2014年1月，、和Shellie Crandall组成了一个团队，以识别、审查、报告已知的OOB条件，并提供一个框架来清算或关闭(支付)所有已知的OOB条件。团队成员包括、、和其他各种GW员工。目标是确定任何已知但未报告(给客户)的OOB情况(定义为金库货币/硬币不等于报告给客户的金额)。</p><p> Once the team was formed and tasks assigned, we met weekly to ensure all vault and customer balances were reviewed, out of balances identified, OOB delineated by vault and customer, and the information captured on a central database. Last week the team met face to face and cumulated all information and data and reported OOB conditions in the amount of $9,140,279.</p><p>团队成立并分配任务后，我们每周开会，以确保在确定的余额中审查所有存储库和客户余额，按存储库和客户描述OOB，并在中央数据库中捕获信息。上周，该小组面对面地会面，积累了所有信息和数据，并报告了9,140,279美元的OOB情况。</p><p> Resolving or paying identified claims is a key priority to ensure site level accountability is reestablished and maintained, customer trust is not eroded, and any financial impacts are realized or accrued for in fiscal year 2014.</p><p>解决或支付已确定的索赔是确保重新建立和维护站点级责任、不损害客户信任以及在2014财年实现或累积任何财务影响的关键优先事项。</p><p>  Research and Reconcile — It is critical we identify resources that can review documentation at the OOB sites and attempt to identify the time and entry error (or theft) that caused the OOB condition. The review will be done to exhaust all efforts in recovering or identifying potential “paperwork” errors versus true loss of funds. The steps listed below is a framework to accomplish this task.</p><p>研究和协调-我们必须确定可以检查OOB站点文档的资源，并尝试确定导致OOB情况的时间和输入错误(或盗窃)。审查将竭尽全力找回或识别潜在的“文书工作”错误与真实的资金损失。下面列出的步骤是完成此任务的框架。</p><p> Engage Regional Directors’ and require region resources be dedicated to research and resolve all identified OOB conditions. The team’s analysis suggests 3 to 4 resources will need to be dedicated to this project for two months.</p><p>与区域总监接洽，并要求区域资源专门用于研究和解决所有已确定的OOB情况。该团队的分析表明，这个项目需要投入3到4个资源，为期两个月。</p><p> Assess the identified OOB condition and determine if recovery of the loss amount is feasible.</p><p>评估确定的OOB情况，并确定恢复损失金额是否可行。</p><p> Quantify the steps necessary to actually recover the loss or, at a minimum, to remove any financial liability from GardaWorld.</p><p>量化实际追回损失或至少从GardaWorld中消除任何财务责任所需的步骤。</p><p> Implement the Steps necessary to recover the loss, coupled with identification and implementation of Operational Procedures necessary to avoid the situations recurrence in the future.</p><p>实施追回损失所需的步骤，以及确定和实施必要的操作程序，以避免将来再次发生这种情况。</p><p> Coordinate and/or provide the procedural training and documentation to ensure the site remains in balance moving forward</p><p>协调和/或提供程序培训和文档，以确保站点保持平衡。</p><p>   Assign a project lead to coordinate activities, gather documents and evidence of OOB condition research to present to the Operating Committee for payment review (if applicable). Resource has been identified.</p><p>指派项目负责人协调活动，收集OOB条件研究的文件和证据，提交给运营委员会进行付款审查(如果适用)。已确定资源。</p><p> Assign audit and risk management resource to large OOB conditions to ensure all research and recovery avenues have been explored and  employees responsible be identified and held accountable. Audit resources will be required when reviewing the OOB conditions that have existed for more than 2 years and/or are complex to resolve.</p><p>将审计和风险管理资源分配给大型OOB条件，以确保所有研究和恢复途径都已探索，并确定负责的员工并追究其责任。在审查已存在两年以上和/或难以解决的OOB情况时，将需要审核资源。</p><p> Customer Engagement — Once all research has been exhausted,  consideration should be given to contact customers and assist their help in resolving any outstanding OOB conditions. This suggestion will need to be explored on a case by case basis and involve the entire Operating Committee for review and approval.</p><p>客户参与-一旦完成所有调查，应考虑联系客户并协助他们帮助解决任何未解决的OOB情况。这项建议需要在个案基础上进行研究，并涉及整个执行委员会进行审查和批准。</p><p> Claims Payment — If an OOB condition cannot be resolved we will need to determine the method of  replenishing the customer’s inventory. It is recommended that a finance resource be assigned to own the end to end payment process.</p><p>索赔付款-如果无法解决OOB条件，我们将需要确定补充客户库存的方法。建议分配财务资源负责端到端支付流程。</p><p> Closing: Please review the information and provide suggestions and input on the suggested approach to resolving the identified OOB conditions.</p><p>总结：请查看信息，并就解决已确定的OOB情况的建议方法提供建议和意见。</p><p> But interviews with former Garda employees and other records show that Garda continued having shortages.</p><p>但对加尔达前员工的采访和其他记录显示，加尔达继续出现短缺。</p><p> The Stratford terminal stopped handing our CVS work some time ago, but our coin inventory remains. Since there has been no activity for quite some time, I would like to have the remaining coin inventory  transferred to LIC as soon as possible. Our currency was removed just after the work was transferred to LIC.</p><p>斯特拉特福德码头在一段时间前停止了我们的CVS工作，但我们的硬币库存仍然存在。由于已经很长一段时间没有活动了，我希望尽快将剩余的硬币库存转移到LIC。我们的货币刚一转到LIC就被撤走了。</p><p>  Can you have this arranged for us or put me in contact with someone who can?</p><p>你能为我们安排这件事吗？或者让我和可以联系的人联系一下吗？</p><p> Our LIC Coin Manger    has contacted    to begin the process.

The audit department told her to “get the proper approval and directive since this involves a significant shortage.”</p><p>目前还不清楚该公司采取了什么行动。审计部门告诉她“要得到适当的批准和指示，因为这涉及到严重的短缺。”</p><p> James, the former vice president of finance, said the scale of the problem across the company meant the issue couldn’t be written off as a few bad employees.</p><p>前财务副总裁詹姆斯说，这个问题在整个公司的规模意味着，这个问题不能被认为是几个坏员工就可以一笔勾销。</p><p> James witnessed internal audits that found vaults were short. Vault managers told him they had shown auditors money that belonged to other banks. He didn’t see another explanation for how Garda continued to pass the banks’ routine audits. It was clear that banks were being kept in the dark, James said.</p><p>詹姆斯目睹了内部审计，发现金库很短。金库经理告诉他，他们已经向审计师展示了属于其他银行的资金。他没有看到加尔达如何继续通过银行例行审计的另一种解释。詹姆斯说，很明显，银行被蒙在鼓里。</p><p> “I can remember some of these vault managers being near nervous breakdowns over the state of where their vault was,” he said.</p><p>他说：“我记得有些金库经理因为金库所在位置的状况而濒临崩溃。”</p><p>  Former Garda employees — from armored truck drivers to higher-ranking managers — described feeling shocked by how little Garda did to keep track of the money in its care.</p><p>前Garda员工-从装甲车司机到更高级别的经理-描述了对Garda在跟踪其管理的资金方面做得如此之少感到震惊。</p><p> Former managers told the  Times that employees had ample opportunity to steal. The footage from some Garda security cameras was of such poor quality that it looked like it had been shot through frosted glass. Some cameras had no ability to zoom.</p><p>前经理告诉泰晤士报，员工有足够的机会偷窃。一些加尔达安全摄像头拍摄的镜头质量非常差，看起来就像是通过磨砂玻璃拍摄的。有些相机没有变焦功能。</p><p> Thefts sometimes went unnoticed until a client pointed out that money was missing, making the crime harder to solve.</p><p>盗窃案有时不会被注意到，直到一名客户指出钱不见了，这使得犯罪更难破案。</p><p> In 2012, Garda lost $76,000 during a delivery in Springfield, Mass. The company didn’t investigate until a month later, then accused two employees of stealing the money.</p><p>2012年，加尔达在马萨诸塞州斯普林菲尔德的一次送货中损失了7.6万美元。直到一个月后，该公司才进行调查，然后指控两名员工窃取了这笔钱。</p><p> Garda told police it had the theft on video. But the company couldn’t provide the video or other evidence, court records show. A judge dismissed the criminal charges against the employees.</p><p>加尔达告诉警方，他们有盗窃的视频。但法庭记录显示，该公司无法提供视频或其他证据。法官驳回了对这些雇员的刑事指控。</p><p> Theft was rampant in that branch, according to emails between Garda managers and company security. Vault employees accused one co-worker of stealing money by stuffing it in her bra and shoes. Another Springfield employee stole $30,000 over a three-month period. A third told Garda investigators he was left alone with open bags of money. He said he couldn’t resist the temptation and had snatched at least $71,900 over several months.</p><p>根据Garda经理和公司安全部门之间的电子邮件，该分行的盗窃活动猖獗。金库员工指控一名同事把钱塞进她的胸罩和鞋子里偷钱。另一名Springfield员工在三个月内窃取了3万美元。第三人告诉加尔达调查人员，他独自一人带着敞开的钱袋。他说，他抵挡不住诱惑，在几个月的时间里至少抢走了71,900美元。</p><p> Erik Quinn, who worked in the Springfield vault in 2014 and 2015, recalled constant problems, especially with coins.</p><p>埃里克·奎恩(Erik Quinn)曾在2014年和2015年在斯普林菲尔德金库工作，他回忆起不断出现的问题，特别是硬币方面的问题。</p><p> He and other employees said that coins were handled less carefully than bills. Some blamed the fact that coins are heavy and cumbersome.</p><p>他和其他员工说，硬币的处理没有钞票那么仔细。一些人指责硬币又重又笨重。</p><p> Quinn said some banks would have too much money and some would come up short. Garda moved money from customer to customer and hoped it would add up later, he said.</p><p>奎恩表示，一些银行的资金会太多，一些银行会出现资金短缺。他说，Garda将资金从一个客户转移到另一个客户，希望以后会增加。</p><p> “It was shifting money around and it was almost controlled chaos,” he said. “But they couldn’t control the chaos.”</p><p>“它在四处转移资金，几乎是一片混乱，”他说。“但他们无法控制混乱局面。”</p><p>  In 2013, in Montana, three bags of money — containing $390,000 — disappeared off a Garda truck. Garda couldn’t figure out how the money went missing. But an ex-employee started spending lavishly in Las Vegas and turned up at a bank with a shoebox full of cash.</p><p>2013年，在蒙大拿州，三袋钱-内含39万美元-从一辆加尔达(Garda)卡车上消失。加尔达想不出钱是怎么失踪的。但一名前雇员开始在拉斯维加斯大手大脚地花钱，并带着装满现金的鞋盒出现在一家银行。</p><p> In 2020, the employee was convicted of money laundering and the transportation of stolen money in connection with the crime.</p><p>2020年，该员工被判与犯罪有关的洗钱和运输赃款罪。</p><p> But federal prosecutors didn’t charge the employee with actually stealing the cash. At trial, they admitted they didn’t know when or where the money was taken, or who took it.</p><p>但联邦检察官并没有指控这名员工实际上窃取了现金。在庭审中，他们承认他们不知道钱是在何时何地被拿走的，也不知道是谁拿走了它。</p><p> Camera coverage that could have documented the theft didn’t exist. A former Garda employee testified that truck doors could be popped open with a broom handle. Trucks were left unattended, the prosecutor noted, even though that’s against Garda’s policy.</p><p>本可以记录失窃的摄像机覆盖范围并不存在。加尔达的一名前雇员作证说，卡车车门可以用扫帚把手打开。检察官指出，卡车没有人看管，尽管这违反了加尔达的政策。</p><p> “This is a strange case in some ways, because there’s some unknowns,” the prosecutor said in his closing statement. “A lot of unknowns, actually.”</p><p>检察官在结案陈词中说：“在某些方面，这是一个奇怪的案件，因为有一些未知因素。”“事实上，有很多未知数。”</p><p> A detective testified that employees regularly didn’t follow Garda’s money-handling policies. The detective said she knew this because her caseload included five other unsolved Garda thefts.</p><p>一名侦探作证说，员工经常不遵守加尔达的资金处理政策。这位侦探说，她之所以知道这一点，是因为她的案件量包括另外五起尚未破获的加尔达盗窃案。</p><p> Brian Fink, who worked on a “SWAT team” that the company sent to branches having operational problems, also said the company was plagued by thefts it couldn’t solve.</p><p>布莱恩·芬克(Brian Fink)在一个“特警队”工作，该小组被公司派往有运营问题的分支机构，他也表示，公司受到无法解决的盗窃的困扰。</p><p> Fink, who worked for Garda from 2016 to 2017, later became a branch manager. He said he left Garda under pressure after he tried to fire two employees, who then accused him of pulling his weapon on them in a room that lacked cameras.</p><p>芬克在2016年至2017年为Garda工作，后来成为一名分行经理。他说，在他试图解雇两名员工后，他给加尔达留下了压力，这两名员工随后指责他在一个没有摄像头的房间里拿枪指着他们。</p><p> Every branch Fink visited as a member of the SWAT team — including West Palm Beach, Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis and Columbus, Ohio — did the job a little differently. But across the company, he saw similar problems: broken-down or subpar equipment and poor protocols that made it easy to lose track of the cash.</p><p>芬克作为特警队成员访问的每一个分支机构-包括西棕榈滩、费城、亚特兰大、圣路易斯和俄亥俄州哥伦布-做这项工作的方式都略有不同。但在整个公司，他看到了类似的问题：设备故障或不合格，以及糟糕的协议，使得很容易失去现金的踪迹。</p><p> The company’s rules said that workers could not leave for the night until every bill and coin was accounted for. But Fink said he hardly ever saw that happen at Garda.</p><p>该公司的规定说，在每一张钞票和硬币都清点完毕之前，工人们晚上不能离开。但芬克说，他几乎没有在加尔达看到过这种情况。</p><p> “I don’t know why anybody would have them take their money,” Fink said.</p><p>芬克说：“我不知道为什么会有人让他们拿走他们的钱。”</p><p> James said that when he was at Brink’s, no one went home until the vault was balanced. At Garda, he said, that often wasn’t the case.</p><p>詹姆斯说，当他在Brink‘s时，在金库保持平衡之前，没有人回家。他说，在加尔达，情况往往并非如此。</p><p> James said he was shocked by how much Garda spent paying claims related to thefts, given the size of the business. It was unlike what he’d seen at Brink’s, he said.</p><p>詹姆斯说，考虑到企业的规模，他对加尔达花在支付与盗窃相关的索赔上的金额感到震惊。他说，这与他在Brink‘s看到的情况不同。</p><p>  “At the end of the night, I would be freaking out about thousands (of dollars) missing, and other people weren’t,” Bolton said. “When there was a shortage or an overage it wasn’t a big deal because it happened just that often.”</p><p>博尔顿说：“当晚结束时，我会被数千美元的失踪吓坏了，而其他人却没有。”“当出现短缺或过剩时，这没什么大不了的，因为这种情况经常发生。”</p><p> Bolton said on multiple occasions he was asked to send money to another branch to cover shortages. At least once, he said, money was sent to his branch.</p><p>博尔顿说，他多次被要求向另一家分行汇款，以弥补短缺。他说，至少有一次，钱被寄到了他的分行。</p><p>  Tricking the audito</p><p>欺骗旁听席。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2020/investigations/garda-world/vaults/">https://projects.tampabay.com/projects/2020/investigations/garda-world/vaults/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rust/">#rust</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/资金/">#资金</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/track/">#track</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/加尔达/">#加尔达</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029492.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_877b326935b05f611380f5d06a4ab4ef.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029492.html">“青少年时代”(或：为什么我不信任运输商)(2016)</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-18 3:20</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029346.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_b33629a2997fa498180553cc76e57b88.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029346.html">在铁锈中使用宏魔术的整个“我的世界”协议</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-10-17 6:41</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029265.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/10/thumb_b02e5f89ae146ec22d532cfd0887bc94.jpeg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1029265.html">
