Business had been slow since the start of the pandemic, but last summer, Hwang said, she started to notice more people disputing charges and claiming missing items through delivery apps. The restaurant was bleeding money and she was spending hours on the phone with the people behind the apps, trying to dispute the chargebacks.</p><p>黄允珍（Hoonjin Hwang）在费尔法克斯（Fairfax）著名的韩国餐厅“ H勺”（Spoon by H）即将关闭。自大流行开始以来，生意一直很缓慢，但去年夏天，黄某说，她开始注意到越来越多的人通过送货上门的应用反驳收费并声称丢失了物品。餐馆在流血，她花了数小时与应用程序背后的人通话，试图对退款进行质疑。</p><p> “We lost orders, time, precious ingredients, and the problems accumulated to the point where we just couldn’t stay in business anymore,” she said. “We’re losing money to these issues, despite all the evidence we provide.”</p><p> 她说：“我们失去了订单，时间，宝贵的原料以及累积的问题，以至于我们无法继续经营下去。” “尽管我们提供了所有证据，但我们在这些问题上仍在赔钱。”</p><p> Spoon by H is one of a growing number of Los Angeles restaurants dealing with customers attempting new ways to dine and dash during the pandemic. Scammers are taking advantage of restaurants that have prioritized safety over in-person security measures such as checking driver’s licenses and manually swiping credit cards. Some people are scamming restaurateurs with fraudulent credit cards, while others request refunds, claiming they never received part or all of an order.</p><p> Spoon by H是洛杉矶越来越多的餐馆之一，该餐馆与在大流行期间尝试新的进餐方式的顾客打交道。诈骗者正在利用优先于人身安全措施（例如检查驾照和手动刷信用卡）安全性的餐馆。有些人用欺诈性的信用卡欺骗餐馆老板，而另一些人则要求退款，声称他们从未收到部分或全部订单。</p><p> One of the worst incidents for Spoon by H happened on Nov. 10, when a customer placed an online order for four “meat lovers” combo meals. It was one of the largest orders Hwang had ever received. The meals were elaborate and each included a galbijjim and oxtail tray, spicy beef japchae and a beef short rib rice cake soup.</p><p> H对Spoon而言最严重的事件之一发生在11月10日，当时一位顾客在线下单订购了四份“肉类爱好者”组合餐。这是黄某收到的最大订单之一。饭菜精心制作，每餐都包括galbijjim和牛尾托盘，辛辣的牛肉饭和牛肉短肋年糕汤。</p><p>   The order was placed through the Tock platform for pickup on Nov. 18. Hwang noticed the customer did not include his vehicle information (make and model of the car) on the order form, her standard procedure since switching exclusively to curbside takeout and delivery during the pandemic. She texted the customer directly and he didn’t respond. But Hwang, happy to receive such a large order, wasn’t alarmed.</p><p>   订单已于11月18日通过Tock平台下达，Hwang注意到该客户未在订单中包含其车辆信息（汽车的型号和型号），这是她的标准程序，因为在此期间仅切换至路边取货和交付。大流行。她直接给客户发短信，但他没有回应。但是，黄某很高兴收到这么大的订单，对此并不感到震惊。</p><p> “I was so grateful for the business,” she said. “I thought it must be because of the holiday season.”</p><p> 她说：“我非常感谢这项业务。” “我认为一定是因为假期。”</p><p> On Nov. 18, at around 4:45 p.m., a man knocked on the door of the restaurant and gave the name on the order. Hwang, who is usually cooking in the kitchen, was waiting to greet the customer. With such a large order, she wanted to thank him personally for his business.</p><p> 11月18日下午4:45左右，一名男子敲开餐厅的门，并在订单上给了名字。通常在厨房做饭的黄某正等着招呼顾客。订单量如此之大，她想亲自感谢他的生意。 </p><p>    He offered to take the food to his car, but Hwang explained that it was far too much for one person to carry, and she grabbed a few bags herself.</p><p>他主动提出要把食物带到车上，但黄某解释说，一个人无法携带的东西太多了，她自己也拿了几个袋子。</p><p> “I asked him why he didn’t give us his vehicle information so that he could just stay in his car, but he didn’t say anything,” she said. “I thought he was an older Asian man like my dad, and that maybe, like my dad, he just wasn’t very talkative.”</p><p> 她说：“我问他为什么不给我们他的车辆信息，以便他只能呆在车里，但他什么也没说。” “我以为他像我父亲一样是个年龄较大的亚洲人，也许像我父亲一样，他不是很健谈。”</p><p>  They walked down the block to a white van and loaded the food into the vehicle.</p><p>  他们沿着街区走到一辆白色货车，然后将食物装到车上。</p><p>  “I asked him if there was a big party for such a big order,” she said. “He told me that it was his boss’ baby’s birthday party. I said, ‘Thank you so much for your support.’ He didn’t respond.”</p><p>  她说：“我问他是否有一个大型聚会来进行如此大的订单。” “他告诉我这是他老板的婴儿的生日聚会。我说：“非常感谢您的支持。”他没有回应。</p><p> On Nov. 25, Tock sent Hwang an email letting her know the customer was disputing the $728.76 charge and the payment had been temporarily removed from her account. The reason for the dispute was listed as “other fraud card absent” (the real cardholder said someone else used their credit card number).</p><p> 11月25日，Tock向Hwang发送了一封电子邮件，告知她该客户正在争议$ 728.76的费用，并且这笔款项已从她的帐户中暂时删除。争执的原因被列为“其他欺诈卡不存在”（真实持卡人说其他人使用了他们的信用卡号）。</p><p>  Hwang sent photo evidence of the customer’s order confirmation and photos of the food to Visa. Then she waited two months. In January, Tock let her know  that she had lost her appeal and that she was responsible for the $728.76.</p><p>  黄某将客户订单确认的照片证据和食品的照片发送给了Visa。然后她等了两个月。 1月份，Tock让她知道她已经失去了上诉，并负责728.76美元。</p><p> “Despite presenting supporting evidence, the issuing card company often sides with the consumer, even in cases that may be fraudulent,” the Tock message stated.</p><p> Tock消息说：“尽管提供了支持证据，但发卡公司经常与消费者并肩，即使在欺诈的情况下也是如此。” </p><p>   After the incident in November, Hwang started taking videos of every order pickup and requiring all customers to show their driver’s licenses. She also started taking photos of every order.</p><p>11月的事件发生后，黄某开始拍摄每次取货的视频，并要求所有客户出示驾驶执照。她还开始为每份订单拍照。</p><p> “Some people order two things and say that they only got one item, so we had to start taking photos,” she said. “When I send them the photo, they [then] claim they found the other item in the car.”</p><p> 她说：“有些人订购两件东西，说他们只有一件东西，所以我们不得不开始拍照。” “当我发送照片给他们时，他们[然后]声称他们在车上找到了另一个物品。”</p><p> But none of these new safety measures was enough to offset the amount of money she was still losing. She plans to close the restaurant by the end of February.</p><p> 但是这些新的安全措施都不足以抵消她仍在亏损的金钱。她计划在2月底前关闭餐厅。</p><p> “It took a huge toll on me mentally, because I found myself becoming more skeptical of large orders,” she said. “It pains me to think that I would grow so suspicious of our customers, and that is not how I want to do business.”</p><p> 她说：“这在精神上给我造成了巨大损失，因为我发现自己对大订单越来越怀疑。” “我以为自己会对客户变得如此可疑，这让我很痛苦，而这并不是我想要做生意的方式。”</p><p>  Nationwide,  the dollar amount of attempted fraudulent credit card charges increased by 35% in April 2020 from a year before, according to Fidelity National Information Services Inc., which monitors banking fraud.</p><p>  监控银行欺诈行为的富达国家信息服务公司（Fidelity National Information Services Inc.）的数据显示，在全国范围内，到2020年4月，欺诈信用卡的未遂费用总额比去年增加了35％。</p><p> Koko’s Mediterranean Cafe owner Shant Bogharian said he started to notice more people claiming missing order items and requesting refunds through third-party food ordering and delivery services about two months ago. The largest refund request was for more than $140. Bogharian said the reason given for the refund requests is often “change of plans.”</p><p> Koko的地中海咖啡馆老板Shant Bogharian表示，大约两个月前，他开始注意到更多人声称缺少订购物品，并通过第三方食品订购和送货服务要求退款。最大的退款要求为140美元以上。 Bogharian说，要求退款的原因通常是“计划变更”。</p><p> “It’s insane that someone tries to get a refund maybe 10 minutes after they pick up the order,” he said. “It’s insulting. We just went through the effort to make the food for this person, they picked it up, then they ask for a refund.”</p><p> 他说：“有人在拿起订单后的10分钟内尝试退款，这真是太疯狂了，” “这很侮辱。我们只是努力为这个人做饭，他们拿起食物，然后要求退款。” </p><p>  Hwang also has had numerous issues with people claiming missing food or the wrong items. On a Postmates order, a customer requested a full refund for one of the restaurant’s dosiraks. The customer claimed she was given the wrong size. The only problem? The dosirak comes in a single size. Hwang sent a photo of the order to Postmates and explained the sizing. She was promptly reimbursed.</p><p>黄某还因声称食物不足或物品不正确而遇到许多问题。根据Postmates的订单，客户要求为餐厅的dosiraks之一全额退款。客户声称给她的尺码错误。唯一的问题？ dosirak具有单一尺寸。 Hwang将订单的照片发送给Postmates，并说明了尺寸。她迅速得到报销。</p><p> While some apps such as DoorDash allow restaurants to press a button once an order has been picked up, others only have an option to confirm that the order is ready. Bogharian said having a way to confirm a pickup on both the merchant and customer side would be helpful. While he said he has successfully disputed some of the claims through the third-party food services, he noted that it takes more than three days for them to credit his account, while customers usually are given refunds instantaneously. And when the services refund money to customers, the restaurants foot the bill.</p><p> 虽然某些应用程序（例如DoorDash）允许餐厅在下订单后按下按钮，但其他应用程序只能选择确认订单已准备就绪。 Bogharian表示，有一种方法可以在商家和客户双方确认提货，这将有所帮助。虽然他说他已经通过第三方食品服务公司成功地对某些索赔提出了异议，但他指出，他们需要超过三天的时间才能将其贷记到他的帐户中，而通常通常会立即向客户退款。当服务退款给客户时，餐馆就会付账。</p><p>  To safeguard against scammers who order directly, Bogharian no longer takes payment via credit card over the phone.</p><p>  为了防止直接订购的诈骗者，Bogharian不再通过电话通过信用卡付款。</p><p> Fern Kaewtathip, who co-owns Luv2Eat Thai Bistro in Hollywood, said every month, she gets about three to six customers who claim they never received their order through third-party partners. She estimates the restaurant lost at least a few thousand dollars last year to disputed charges  but adds that disputing chargebacks is easier with the third-party partners than with the credit card companies.</p><p> 好莱坞的Luv2Eat Thai Bistro合伙人Fern Kaewtathip每月说，她有大约三到六个客户，声称他们从未通过第三方合作伙伴收到订单。她估计，这家餐厅去年因有争议的费用而至少损失了几千美元，但她补充说，与信用卡公司相比，与第三方合作伙伴进行争议的退款很容易。</p><p> “Last year our credit card sales dropped by 80% because they were replaced by third-party companies,” Kaewtathip said. “We pay commission but at least we don’t have the risk of lost orders.”</p><p> “去年我们的信用卡销售下降了80％，因为它们被第三方公司所取代，” Kaewtathip说。 “我们支付佣金，但至少我们没有丢失订单的风险。”</p><p> Kaewtathip now requires that customers show ID and sign for all large orders made over the phone. But sometimes, she said, especially if it’s busy, it’s hard to check everyone’s ID.</p><p> 现在，Kaewtathip要求客户显示通过电话进行的所有大额订单的ID和签名。但她说，有时候，特别是在很忙的时候，很难检查每个人的ID。</p><p>   Eddy Shin, chef-owner of A Cut Above butcher shop in Santa Monica, ascribes the uptick in fraud and scams to opportunities created by the pandemic. As part of the shop’s COVID-19 protocols, Shin is not allowing customers inside the store and is taking orders only by phone or online.</p><p>   圣莫尼卡A Cut Above肉店的厨师老板埃迪·辛（Eddy Shin）将欺诈和诈骗的上升归因于大流行带来的机会。作为商店COVID-19协议的一部分，Shin不允许商店内的客户进入，并且仅通过电话或在线接单。 </p><p> “People are desperate and we need the business, so when someone puts in a big order,  [the business is going] to take it,” said Shin. “You think, ‘Oh my God, it’s too good to be true,’ then you find out it’s a total scam.”</p><p>“人们绝望了，我们需要这项业务，所以当有人下达大笔订单时，（业务将会）接手，” Shin说。 “您认为，‘噢，天哪，太好了，无法置信，’然后您发现这完全是骗局。”</p><p> On Jan. 6, a customer placed an order for $600 worth of meat over the phone. It was a large order but Shin and shop manager Alice Mackenzie said they were not suspicious. They often work with private chefs who place large orders. There was trouble with the credit card, and the customer had to call back a few times before the charge went through.</p><p> 1月6日，一位客户通过电话订购了价值600美元的肉。这是一个大订单，但Shin和商店经理Alice Mackenzie表示他们并不怀疑。他们经常与下大订单的私人厨师合作。信用卡出现了问题，客户必须回拨几次才能进行收费。</p><p> “We are used to working with private chefs that may have households, and they sometimes have multiple cards,” Mackenzie said. “This didn’t really raise any alarms.”</p><p> Mackenzie说：“我们习惯于与可能有家庭的私人厨师合作，有时他们会有多张卡片。” “这并没有真正引起任何警报。”</p><p>  The next day, the customer picked up the food. Later that week, the same person placed an order for $1,300 worth of meat using a different card. He picked the order up the next day.</p><p>  第二天，顾客拿起食物。那个星期晚些时候，同一个人使用另一张卡下了价值1300美元的肉类订单。他第二天接了订单。</p><p> A few weeks later, Mackenzie and Shin received a notice from their credit processor  that both the $600 and $1,300 charges were being disputed. They were given the option to contact the cardholder directly to fight the chargeback but, in an effort to protect sensitive customer information, Mackenzie said she was “trashing out” credit card information almost nightly.</p><p> 几周后，Mackenzie和Shin从他们的信用处理者那里收到了一条通知，告知他们600美元和1300美元的费用存在争议。他们可以选择直接与持卡人联系以解决退款问题，但是为了保护敏感的客户信息，Mackenzie说她几乎每晚都会“清除”信用卡信息。</p><p>  Without a way to contact the customer directly, Shin and Mackenzie filed a report with the Santa Monica Police Department at the end of January. They also implemented new policies to try to prevent something similar from happening again. They now flag any large purchase from a new customer and require that person come into the store and present the credit card to charge in person.</p><p>  由于无法直接与客户联系，Shin和Mackenzie于1月底向圣莫尼卡警察局提交了一份报告。他们还实施了新政策，以试图防止类似事件再次发生。现在，他们会标记来自新客户的任何大额购买，并要求该人进入商店并出示信用卡以亲自进行收费。</p><p>   “It’s disheartening,” added Shin. “But if there’s some kind of loophole or some kind of weakness in the security, people will find a way to take advantage of it.”</p><p>   “这令人沮丧，”辛补充道。 “但是，如果安全性存在某种漏洞或某种弱点，人们将找到一种利用它的方法。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2021-02-23/restaurant-scam-credit-card-fraud">https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2021-02-23/restaurant-scam-credit-card-fraud</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/餐厅/">#餐厅</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/struggle/">#struggle</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/订单/">#订单</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
