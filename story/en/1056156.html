He is one of the few practitioner-writers who can consistently capture the zeitgeist of what’s going on in the startup and venture world through his writing! We won’t cover the getting-to-know-Semil questions in our chat here. I just want to be real, not popular!</p><p>Shah曾经是十年的多产作家。多年来他做了很多采访。他是少数少数家从业者作家之一，他们可以始终通过他的写作持续捕捉初创公司和风险世界中发生的事情的宗教信仰！在我们这里的聊天中，我们不会涵盖上半身的问题。我只是想真的，不受欢迎！</p><p> Sar : We will start with the easy questions. What have been your strongest held beliefs about Silicon Valley broadly and venture specifically over the past decade that you think was challenged the most in 2020?</p><p> SAR：我们将从简单的问题开始。在过去的十年中，您认为您认为在2020年最多挑战了您对硅谷的最强大和冒险的最强大的信仰是什么？</p><p> Semil : There are so many, so perhaps the most useful thing here is to mention one that rises to the top (for me) on each.</p><p> SELIL：有这么多，所以这里最有用的事情就是提到一个上升到顶部（对我）上的一个。</p><p> With respect to the Bay Area (which includes Silicon Valley), one of my strongly held beliefs is that this local ecosystem is nearly impossible to replicate anywhere. There are countless posts and Tweetstorms as to why, but I think it boils down to the intergenerational culture in the area whereby folks are conditioned to accept delayed rewards, to invest in the ground around them, and to pay it forward. Those attributes are really hard to find anywhere else in the world. I do see bits of this happening in NYC. I’m sure there are initial vibes like this in other places, but it really takes generations upon generations to build it into the culture. Over the decade, and specifically in 2020, yes that was a belief that was challenged intensely. California and the Bay Area had very strict lockdowns. That created all sorts of tension, and has shined a light on local governance, policies, education, etc. in a way that’s pretty alarming. Then, the 2020 fires. We had very close friends who just “tapped out,” to borrow a UFC term, of the Bay Area. Despite all of those natural and manmade obstacles, I still believe the Bay Area is a very unique (and flawed) place in this regard, but that was really challenged for me over the past 12–18 months.</p><p> 关于湾区（包括硅谷），我强烈的信仰之一是，这种地方生态系统几乎不可能复制任何地方。有无数的帖子和Tweetstorms为什么，但我认为它归结为该领域的代际文化，其中人们被调节接受延迟奖励，以投资于他们周围的地面，并将其付费。这些属性很难在世界其他地方找到。我确实看到了在纽约的这种情况发生的比特。我相信在其他地方有这样的初始氛围，但它真的需要几代人在几代内建造它进入文化。在十年中，特别是在2020年，是的，这是一个强烈挑战的信念。加利福尼亚州和湾区有严格的锁定。这造成了各种紧张，并以令人惊叹的方式在当地治理，政策，教育等方面发出光明。然后，2020年火灾。我们有非常亲密的朋友，刚刚“开出”，借用湾区的UFC学期。尽管所有人都有自然和人造的障碍，但我仍然相信湾区在这方面是一个非常独特的（和缺陷）的地方，但这对我来说真的在过去12-18个月内对我有挑战性。</p><p> With respect to venture capital, when I started out I thought “venture didn’t scale” and, like many others, didn’t see how funds could scale into the billions of dollars per vehicle and really drive a return without being in one of the very few massive companies, like Facebook. This is a more traditional viewpoint, and that was certainly challenged since 2015 and really in 2020 — the truth verifiably now is that the size of the end markets for cloud software are significantly bigger than even the biggest bulls believed them to be. So, because cloud software can be anywhere, and because the entire world is coming online, and because of accelerants like globalization or the specific responses to the pandemic, the terminal value of an investment position can be orders of magnitude larger than what most traditionalists (like my old self) thought.</p><p> 关于风险投资，当我开始外出时，我认为“企业没有规模”，与许多其他人一样，没有看到资金如何可以扩展到每辆车数十亿美元，而且真正推动退货而不是在其中一个像Facebook这样的巨大公司。这是一个更传统的观点，自2015年以来肯定是挑战，真正在2020年 - 现在真相现在，云软件的最终市场的大小明显大于最大的公牛，甚至最大的公牛才能成为。所以，因为云软件可以是任何地方，因为整个世界都在网上，而且由于加速度如全球化或对大流行的具体回应，投资位置的终端价值可以比最传统主义者更大的数量级（像我的旧自我）的想法。</p><p> Sar : There is a lot of talk about how the biggest companies are now thinking about going back to offices. How are the biggest VC firms thinking about it? For the longest time, Sand Hill firms have prided themselves on “home turf” advantage.</p><p> SAR：有很多谈论最大的公司现在正在考虑返回办公室的人。最大的VC公司是如何考虑的？对于最长的时间来说，Sand Hill公司在“家庭草皮”的优势上享有骄傲。</p><p> Semil : The short answer here is, we don’t know yet. Generally, I think the top VC firms will be the last group of companies in the Bay Area that “blow the conch” to call their employees back to in-person meetings. For many of the top firms, they don’t exactly know where their senior partners are during a given week right now — and for sure the non-partners. During the last 18 months or so, many of these funds have also recorded historic returns on exits and IPOs. There are always folks who are in the Bay Area because they felt they needed to be, and now that’s been relaxed for a bit. So, when you put this all together, I would predict the following: A number of senior partners will not return to their funds, either because they want to live in a different place, or they’re post-economic, or whatever. The majority will be back to in-person meetings in the Bay Area by January, if not sooner. We will also likely see deals begin online (via Zoom) and perhaps close more in person, either in the Bay Area or with the partner hopping on a plane. We see a bit of that now. And while companies can be built anywhere, I don’t see the Bay Area stopping its parade despite how poorly managed it’s been as an area/state. So that home turf advantage for information flow and dealmaking will be there.</p><p> SEMIL：这里的简短答案是，我们还不知道。一般来说，我认为最高VC公司将是湾区的最后一组公司，即“吹胆管”呼吁他们的员工回到众议院会议。对于许多顶级公司来说，他们并不完全了解他们的高级伙伴在立即在给定的一周内 - 并肯定非合作伙伴。在过去的18个月左右期间，许多这些基金也在出口和IPO上录制了历史回报。湾区总有员工，因为他们觉得他们需要成为，现在已经放松了一点。所以，当你把这一切都放在一起时，我会预测以下内容：一些高级伙伴不会回到他们的资金，要么是因为他们想要生活在不同的地方，或者他们是经济的经济，或者什么。如果不是迟早，大多数人将返回到湾区的亲人会议。我们还有可能看到交易在线开始（通过缩放），也许在湾区或伴侣跳上飞机上的人员。我们现在看到了一些。虽然公司可以建立在任何地方，但我没有看到湾区停止旅行，尽管管理有多差是一个区域/国家。因此，家庭草皮有利于信息流程和交易将在那里。 </p><p> Sar : There’s a lot of chatter about how the current pace &amp; valuations are justified because markets are bigger than ever and the search for yields. Are we risking overcapitalizing an entire generation of companies for striking gold a few times?</p><p>SAR：关于当前的步伐和amp有很多聊天。估值是合理的，因为市场比以往任何时候都大，并寻求产量。我们是否冒过几次罢工黄金的整个一代公司的风险？</p><p> Semil : I don’t know if we should worry about this. CEOs and founders have free agency to operate in the manner they choose. Many of them could go public earlier, but they choose not to quite often. Is that good, or bad? I don’t know. For Snap, it was good! For others, maybe not as good? Ultimately, it’s the founders and CEO who call the shots, and it’s a free market, and the capital sources (LPs) who bankroll these growth and pre-IPO funds keep the funds flowing, so why not?</p><p> SEMIL：我不知道我们是否应该担心这一点。 CEO和创始人有自由机构以他们选择的方式运作。他们中的许多人早些时候可以公开，但他们选择不太经常。是好还是坏？我不知道。为了捕捉，它很好！对于别人来说，也许不那么好？最终，这是叫镜头的创始人和首席执行官，它是一个自由市场，以及资本来源（LPS），银行这些增长和IPO前的资金保持资金，所以为什么不呢？</p><p> Sar : That’s fair. You earned respect in Silicon Valley with your writing in the early 2010s. Everyone wanted to talk to you but no one wanted to offer you a sweet gig. How much do you think the reason for that was your industry shunning people that don’t fit a particular mold? I always giggle when your peers go “well I just fell into venture” or “I had a very non traditional path to venture” without any irony on podcasts.</p><p> SAR：那是公平的。在2010年代初，您将在您的撰写中享受硅谷的尊重。每个人都想和你谈谈，但没有人想为你提供一个甜蜜的演出。您认为这是多少的原因是您的行业避免不适合特定模具？当你的同龄人去“嗯，我刚刚进入冒险”时，我总是傻笑，或者“我有一个非常非传统的冒险道路”，没有任何讽刺的播客。</p><p> Semil : I’ll give you a three-part answer. The first part will be about my experience, and my reflection on it; the second will cover the reality of how the very best VC franchises are run and constructed; and the third, I’ll pontificate about the future.</p><p> SELIL：我会给你一个三部分的答案。第一部分是我的经验，以及我的反思;第二个将涵盖如何运行和构建最佳的VC特许经营权的现实;第三，我会谈谈未来。</p><p> So first, about me, when I think back to those moments of rejection, it is devastating. It honestly feels like yesterday. No one cares about someone getting rejected to work at a VC firm, but it’s the mounting rejections, compounding like bad credit card debt. However, as I’ve slithered my way through the inside of many firms, and with a greater appreciation of how the business actually works, I don’t believe those firms made a “mistake” not hiring me. In fact, with hindsight, I think they made the right decision. Eventually in my career, I was flooded with big time offers, but during that period of rejection, the harsh truth is I didn’t offer anything unique, differentiated, or of value. Sure, I was putting my written work out in public, and I knew lots of founders, but that’s not good enough to make the cut. Eventually, over those first 2–3 years, I was able to demonstrate that I could forge relationships with founders, that I could articulate judgment about the opportunity (and the people), that I was comfortable with being public and wrong, and that I could persuade others to give me a chance. Once this became more evident after three years, the offers came in.</p><p> 首先，关于我，当我觉得回到那些拒绝的时刻时，它是毁灭性的。这真的像昨天一样感觉。没有人关心被拒绝在VC公司工作的人，但它是安装的拒绝，像信用卡债务一样复合。然而，正如我通过许多公司的内部滑过我的方式，并欣赏业务如何实际工作的升值，我不相信这些公司没有雇用我的“错误”。事实上，随着后代，我认为他们做出了正确的决定。最终在我的职业生涯中，我被淹没了，但在那段拒绝期间，苛刻的事实是我没有提供任何独特，差异化或价值的任何东西。当然，我把我的书面锻炼在公共场合，我知道很多创始人，但这并不好，不能让削减。最终，在比赛中，我能够证明我可以与创始人建立关系，我可以阐明关于机会（和人民）的判断，我很舒服，我很舒服，而且我可以说服别人给我一个机会。一旦这三年后变得更加明显，提供的优惠进来了。</p><p> Zooming out, when we think about the very top VC franchises, many folks assume that if you just hired there as a junior person or with a cold email, you can work your way up the chain. That is not realistic. The overwhelming majority of the most senior and powerful decision-makers in their respective funds earned that power through by a variety of means, which are hard to attain in the first place — they are mega-successful founders; or they’re former product leaders at cutting edge companies with an active network of recruits and angel investments; or they’ve been poached as up-and-coming investors who broke out from other funds, already coming in the door with institutional investment experience. Sure, a small handful of the top brass at firms have been mostly career VCs, but that is changing rapidly and is generally not the normal path.</p><p> 缩小，当我们考虑最高级的VC特许经营权时，许多人假设如果你刚雇用在那里，或者用冷电子邮件雇用，你可以向上工作。这不是现实的。各自资金中最多的大多数高级和强大的决策者的绝大多数赢得了这一权力，通过各种手段，这是难以达到的地方 - 他们是大型成功的创始人;或者他们是前端产品领导者，用于尖端公司，积极的新兵和天使投资网络;或者他们一直被偷猎，因为从其他资金中爆发出来的上行投资者，已经进入了由机构投资经验的大门。当然，在公司的一部分顶级黄铜大多数都是职业VCS，但这正在迅速变化，并且通常不是正常的路径。</p><p> Finally, a quick story — one of the top Fund of Funds (pools of capital which allocate funds into private equity on behalf of endowments, foundations, and pensions, etc.) cited, in no particular order, the following people as being in the Top 5 younger GPs aged 30 or so, based on unrealized track record — Chetan Puttagunta, Miles Grimshaw, Nikhil Basu Trivedi, Shardul Shah, Vas Natarajan. If you glance at their profiles, most of them have been investors for most of their professional lives, perhaps busting the “operator-to-VC” myth today. That said, if we fast-forward to 2030, who would make the list? We don’t know, which makes it fun to pontificate — will the list consist of women, or underrepresented minorities, or former founders or operators? It will be fun to see!</p><p> 最后，一个快速的故事 - 资金顶级资金之一（代表捐赠，基金会和养老金分配资金，基金会，养老金等资金，在没有特定的秩序，以下人士在基于未实现的曲目记录 -  Chetan Puttagunta，Miles Grimshaw，Nikhil Basu Trivedi，Shardul Shah，Vas Natarajan，5位左右GPS。如果您浏览他们的档案，他们中的大多数都是他们的大部分职业生活的投资者，也许今天破坏了“运营商到VC”神话。那说，如果我们快进到2030，那么谁会制作清单？我们不知道，这使得摆动乐趣 - 列表包括妇女，或不足的少数群体，或前创始人或运营商？看到的很有趣！ </p><p> Sar : You very much have the “do you want to complain or do you want to win?” mindset and that is why I respect your views.</p><p>SAR：你非常有“你想抱怨或你想赢吗？”心态，这就是我尊重你的观点的原因。</p><p> That being said, every other month, I see lots of people joining the venture world with far less demonstrable aptitude than what you had. What they do have is they were in the right networks and went to the right schools. This is not even a matter of opinion. There’s ample stats out there that support it and a cursory look at top 20 firms’ team page would show it.</p><p> 那个据说，每隔一个月，我都会看到很多人加入了风险世界，而不是比你所拥有的能力更少。他们所做的就是他们在合适的网络中，然后去了正确的学校。这甚至不是一个意见问题。在那里有充足的统计数据，支持它，并享受前20名公司的团队页面的奇妙看。</p><p> Are we really saying that 2012 Semil was far less qualified than all the 22–25 years old banking and consulting people getting hired by top tier firms? I do not understand what about short stints at Goldman and McKinsey along with Stanford or Harvard Business School make people more qualified than people who know how to hustle, write prolifically out of natural curiosity and have a knack for building reputations.</p><p> 我们是否真的说2012年第22岁的第22-25岁的银行和咨询人员被顶级公司获得雇用的人更少的资格得多？我不明白在高盛和麦肯锡以及斯坦福或哈佛商学院的短暂依赖于斯坦福或哈佛商学院，使人们比知道如何喧嚣的人更合格，速率地写出自然好奇心，并为建筑物评价提供诀窍。</p><p> Semil : I do believe age is a factor. For “recent college graduates” who are around 22 or maybe 24–25 after a few years at McKinsey (haha!), top firms do still look here as filters for the type of talent they want. So I was in my early 30s at the time without any experience in finance nor in technology. Now, you’re asking about “qualifications,” and those are subjective. What I’ll say is, it depends on the role — if a firm is looking for people to source deals, or to help conduct research or due diligence, or to help win deals and position the firm to win — it’s very rare for one person to have all of this. Most firms for entry level roles or new hires put them out there to conduct DD, do internal research, and maybe occasionally source. That’s why the McKinsey style profile resonates. The senior partners are the dealmakers. And those dealmakers would much rather get to know someone over a long period of time and have them separate from the pack and overpay them than to keep a pool of qualified candidates warm.</p><p> SELIL：我确实相信年龄是一个因素。对于在麦肯锡（哈哈！）几年之后的“最近的大学毕业生”，谁在22岁或24-25岁以下，顶级公司仍然看看他们想要的人才类型的过滤器。所以我在30多岁时在没有任何财务或技术方面的经验。现在，你询问“资格”，而且那些是主观的。我会说的是，这取决于角色 - 如果一家公司正在寻找人们来源交易，或帮助进行研究或尽职调查，或帮助赢得交易并定位公司赢得胜利 - 这是一个非常罕见的拥有所有这些的人。大多数用于入境级别角色或新员工的公司将它们置于达迪，进行内部研究，也许偶尔是源头。这就是麦肯锡风格的形象共鸣的原因。高级合作伙伴是达务。这些抛弃者宁愿在很长一段时间内更加了解某人，并将它们与包装分开，超过它们，而不是保留一个合格的候选人。</p><p> Sar : Do you think 2012–2013 Semil would have many more options for joining established firms today?</p><p> SAR：您认为2012-2013 SEML会有更多的选择，以便今天加入既定公司吗？</p><p>  People in our industry like to complain about how many new funds are being created, especially small micro, rolling, or syndicate funds. It certainly creates a metric tonne of noise, mostly on Twitter and Clubhouse. The reality is everything associated with “startups” has dramatically increased and permeated society — end markets are larger, more industries are transforming, there are more platforms for builders to build things without seeking permission, and the capital required to build software products has fallen dramatically. So even though it feels like there is a lot of investor-related noise in our ecosystem, it still isn’t enough to meet the demand of all the new startups with hopes and dreams of world domination.</p><p>  我们行业中的人们喜欢抱怨正在创造多少新资金，特别是小型微小，滚动或联合资金。它肯定会创造一个公吨的噪音，主要是在Twitter和Clubhouse上。现实是与“初创公司”相关的一切都大幅增加和渗透的社会 - 终端市场更大，更多的行业正在转化，建设者在没有寻求许可的情况下建造东西的平台，并且建立软件产品所需的资本急剧下降。因此，即使我们的生态系统中有很多投资者相关的噪声，它仍然是不够满足所有新初创公司的需求，希望与世界统治的志愿和梦想。</p><p> In the old world, traditional VC firms would hire associates on payroll to dial for dealflow. Those were proprietary networks around the Bay Area and other ecosystems, when the industry felt more like a cottage industry. Fast-forward to today, being an analyst or associate at a big fund is good for exposure, some salary, an expense card, but otherwise it’s largely just a waste of time. Now those would-be associates can put their own capital (or on behalf of a syndicate or rolling fund) to work and reap the benefits of being closest to the deal flow. This has disintermediated many firms, more than they’d care to admit. Out of this commotion, new institutional firms will form — look at incredible franchise platforms today like Forerunner, or Initialized, and Amplify, just to name a few — they’ve risen from modest seed funds into ones that can actually compete for contested Series A rounds with the bigger, established funds. Not all newer investors will reach these heights — some will get a junior partner or GP gig based on their track record; some will build their funds up but stay small (like me); some will just fade away.</p><p> 在旧世界中，传统的VC公司将雇用薪资的员工拨打交易流。那些是湾区和其他生态系统周围的专有网络，当时该行业感觉更像是山寨行业。快进至今天，成为一个大型基金的分析师或联营公司是曝光，一些薪酬，费用卡，但否则这几乎只是浪费时间。现在，那些愿意的员工可以把自己的资本（或代表一个辛迪加或筹集资金）合作，并获得最接近交易流程的福利。这已经宣布了许多公司，而不是他们谨慎承认。出于这种骚乱，新的机构公司将表现出今天的令人难以置信的特许经营平台，如先行者，或初始化，放大，只是为了命名几个 - 他们从适度的种子基金中升起到实际上可以竞争的竞争赛中随着更大的，建立的资金。并非所有新投资者都将达到这些高度 - 有些人将获得基于他们的曲目记录的初级伙伴或GP演出;有些人会建立他们的资金，但保持小（像我一样）;有些人会逐渐消失。 </p><p> All of this is to say, would the “2012–13 Me” have gotten that junior partner gig at a major firm today, in 2021? I don’t think so. I would have been competing with the likes of some recent post-MBA types currently at top firms. I am thinking of two friends who are more than 10 years younger than me, already versed in VC after joining, already had some deal-making experience before business school, and right now, they’re able to cut through the red tape at their own firms and put their names on real deals. We don’t know for sure, but I am not sure I could have been able to pull this off. I can now, but not the “me” back then.</p><p>这一切都说，将说“2012-13我”今天在2021年在今天的一家大公司演出了初级合作伙伴演出？我不这么认为。我将与目前最近的MBA类型的相似之处竞争。我想到了两个比我更年轻的两个朋友，已经在加入后已经熟悉了VC，已经在商学院前有一些交易经验，现在他们能够在他们的繁文缛节中切割自己的公司并将其名称放在实际交易上。我们肯定不知道，但我不确定我能否能够把它拉开。我现在可以，但不是“我”那么。</p><p> Sar : By the way, I do not think that venture firms owe anyone any job. They are entitled to tapping into their homogeneous networks to hire. What many of us take contention with is the lack of honesty. There are countless blog posts from well known people with these stereotypical trajectories on how to break into venture. They advise nothing they themselves did. What I respect about Wall Street bankers is they do not pretend they don’t have lazy and archaic ideas of “target schools” in how they hire. They own their elitiscism. I like that! Anyhow, let’s move on to yet another controversial topic!</p><p> SAR：顺便说一下，我不认为风险公司欠任何任何工作。它们有权进入其同类网络租用。我们中有多许多人争取缺乏诚实。有无数博客帖子来自着名的人，具有这些陈规定型的轨迹，关于如何闯入冒险。他们建议他们自己没有。我尊重华尔街银行家的是他们并没有假装他们没有懒惰和古老的想法是他们雇用的“目标学校”。他们拥有他们的埃特。我喜欢！无论如何，让我们继续又一个有争议的话题！</p><p> Not too long ago I  tweeted that venture is a trap for young people and that either you are lucky enough to get a big break at the right time at a very limited set of top tier firms early on in your early to mid twenties or you are bouncing between second &amp; third tier firms for years hitting a ceiling. That sparked our conversation about career trajectories and very similar backgrounds of rainmakers at established firms today. Can you share your perspective on those topics?</p><p> 不久前我发了推文，那个冒险是一个年轻人的陷阱，无论是你很幸运，在你早期到二十多岁的早期一系列最有限的顶级公司，你的幸运就足够了。第二次＆amp之间的弹跳;第三层公司多年来抵达天花板。这引发了关于职业轨迹的谈话，以及今天既定公司的rainmakers的非常相似的背景。您能在这些主题上分享您的观点吗？</p><p> Semil : Yes, I remember immediately DMing you on Twitter about this. Your insight was so on point. I feel strongly about the following statements — if you are young and able and interested in startups, technology, and venture capital, spending time at the right venture capital firm for you can be incredibly rewarding, up to a certain point. After two years, if you don’t love venture capital, getting into the muck of how the fund is run, fund management, and fighting your way to get to be more active in deals, it is just a colossal waste of time because after a while, any skills you’ve obtained before joining a venture capital firm will essentially atrophy into flab. The cost of this atrophy is compounded by age — wasting years 23 &amp; 24 inside that big firm is an order of magnitude less costly than ages 29, 30, and 31.</p><p> SEMIL：是的，我记得立刻在Twitter上盯着你。你的洞察力是如此。我对以下陈述感到非常态度 - 如果您是年轻且能够对初创公司，技术和风险投资感兴趣，在合适的风险投资公司的花时间可以令人难以置信地获得奖励，直到一定程度。经过两年的时间，如果你不爱风险投资，进入基金如何运行，基金管理以及对待你的方式变得更加活跃，这只是巨大的浪费时间，因为之后有一段时间，在加入风险投资公司之前获得的任何技能都将基本上萎缩到强子。这种萎缩的成本通过年龄浪费年23＆amp复杂化。在那个大公司内部的24级比29,30和31岁的昂贵级。</p><p> If you just look at the evidence today, for example the 5 top GPs by track record who are at or around 30 years old, it is informative — those folks started very early in venture, they loved it, they fought their way into leading deals, and grabbed the GP mantle. That has to be the mentality when entering a firm — up, or out. But the trap is hanging around too long as life passes you by.</p><p> 如果你只是看看今天的证据，例如通过轨道记录的5个顶级GPS谁在或左右，它是信息性的 - 那些人在冒险早期开始，他们喜欢它，他们融入了领先的交易，并抓住了GP地幔。在进入公司时，必须是心态的。但随着生命通过你，陷阱悬挂了太久了。</p><p> Sar : As a VC, you are meeting and exchanging emails with dozens of people every week. You are constantly being introduced to new people. I understand the pressure to expand your surface area. An occupational hazard is being transactional with most people! That dynamic often transfers to how firms hire. You want to keep meeting young interesting people and be non committal to reserve optionality. I have experienced this myself. Any thoughts?</p><p> SAR：作为VC，您每周都会在与数十人交换中交换电子邮件。你不断被介绍给新人。我理解扩展表面积的压力。职业危害是与大多数人的交易！动态经常转移到公司如何雇用。您希望继续满足年轻有趣的人，并非承诺储备可期权。我自己经历过这个。有什么想法吗？</p><p> Semil : Look, the reality is no leading venture capital firm has a “good process” for finding, recruiting, and handling those who want a job at their firms. The firms themselves are stretched very thin, so this slips. These firms are literally flooded with overt overtures and subtle pings or nudges about considering a specific person to hire. They’re lobbied, pitched, and campaigned to no end. This doesn’t excuse the behavior you’re describing, but hopefully explains it. As I’ve seen and helped many people enter different sized venture capital firms at different levels, I’ll share what I see is a pattern that emerges in a successful “intro to hire” situation. First, there is a senior champion internally with the firm who wants to push the hire through. Second, there is a strong external champion who will put his/her reputation behind the candidate. Third, the timing aligns. But, it can take years to get to know a firm, and for that firm to be “in the mood” to bring someone onboard.</p><p> SEMIL：看，现实是没有领先的风险投资公司，有一个“良好的过程”来寻找，招聘和处理那些想要在他们公司工作的人。公司本身伸展很薄，所以这款滑动。这些公司的洪水淹没，有明显的吸引力和微妙的横向，或者在考虑一个特定的人雇用的情况下闻到。他们是开门的，投放，并竞选并没有结束。这并没有原谅您描述的行为，但希望对此进行解释。正如我所看到并帮助许多人以不同的水平进入不同大小的风险投资公司，我会分享我所看到的一种模式，这是一个成功的“雇用”情况的模式。首先，内部有一名高级冠军与想要推动雇用的公司。其次，有一个强大的外部冠军，谁将在候选人背后的声誉。第三，定时对齐。但是，可以花年需要数年时间才能了解一家公司，并为坚定的是“心情”，让船上滚动。 </p><p> What your alluding to specifically is — “Hey, this firm was never gonna hire me (as Sar). So, why didn’t they just say that upfront?” My best answer here would be a mix of the following — most of these people feel bad just saying that, because they know how crushing that can feel to the recipient; many of these folks likely liked you a lot but may not even know the first thing about how someone gets hired in their firm at all; and it can be draining for investors who get lobbied all the time for a gig when they really may just want to talk about other topics, or companies, or such. It can be an unseen weight around the conversation. I know from my 2010–13 experience, and the way you framed it, I am 110% sure just my persistence and presence when I met some of these folks felt too much like I wanted something. The pretense can feel thick, heavy.</p><p>你暗指特定是什么 - “嘿，这家公司永远不会雇用我（按SAR）。所以，为什么他们不只是说前凌乱？“我在这里最好的答案将是以下的混合 - 这些人中的大多数人都感到难过，只是说，因为他们知道收件人可以感受到的粉碎;其中许多人可能会喜欢你，但甚至可能甚至不知道有人在他们公司中被雇用的第一件事;当他们真正想要谈论其他主题或公司或者公司时，它可能会为投资者提供一直播放的投资者。它可以是谈话周围的看不见的重量。我从2010-13的体验中知道，你构成它的方式，我110％的人肯定只是我的坚持和存在，当我遇到其中一些人感觉太多就像我想要的东西一样。假装可以感觉厚厚，沉重。</p><p> As with so many things in VC, I believe Union Square Ventures has the cleanest model for this. At the GP level, partners are only invited into the partnership once they’ve collaborated with the firm before — consider Albert was an executive in the portfolio and an active angel investor prior to joining USV, or Andy was an investor with Betaworks and frequent co-investor. Next, partners join as “half partners” in terms of economics to run through one fund cycle, and then join as a full partner with those economics. They don’t seem to promote from within. They do, however, have an active analyst program, where recent college graduates and younger professionals can apply online in a competitive process and work at the firm for 2–3 years. Those analysts are not promised anything from Day 1, so the engagement is clean.</p><p> 与VC中的许多东西一样，我认为联盟广场风险有可能为此进行清洁。在GP级别，合作伙伴只会在与公司合作的情况下邀请合作伙伴关系 - 考虑Albert是投资组合中的一位高管，并且在加入USV之前是一个活跃的天使投资者，或者安迪是一名带有槟榔和频繁的投资者-投资者。接下来，合作伙伴在经济学方面加入“半伙伴”，以透过一个基金周期，然后加入与这些经济学的完整伙伴。他们似乎没有从内部推广。然而，他们有一个积极的分析师计划，最近的大学毕业生和年轻专业人员可以在竞争过程中在线申请，并在公司工作2  -  3年。这些分析师并不从第1天承诺，所以订婚很干净。</p><p> You may ask why I know all of this? Well, for many years, I pressed Albert, Andy, and Fred hard to bring me in. Looking back, that was a ridiculous plan — but I listen to my gut and I didn’t want to not try. So, I really tried. The bad news is I learned about their model instead; the good news is that, I think, I hope, they respected my overtures and engagement. It’s a very unique fund and there’s so much to learn from them. Perhaps there is a lesson in this, too — for you recently, or me back then, perhaps the real morsel isn’t the job we sought, but that if we view them as learning experiences, we may pick up secrets from others that we can apply later in our career. Because I spent so much time with a handful of firms, I didn’t pick up any offers, but I picked up lots of secrets that I try to mold into Haystack today.</p><p> 你可能会问我为什么知道这一切？好吧，多年来，我按下了Albert，Andy，难以让我兴奋地带走。回头看，这是一个荒谬的计划 - 但我听我的肠道，我不想尝试。所以，我真的尝试过。坏消息是我了解了他们的模型;好消息是，我想，我希望，他们尊重我的吸引力和参与。这是一个非常独特的基金，从他们那里学到很多东西。也许这有一个教训，也是为了你最近，或者我回来了，也许真正的morsel不是我们寻求的工作，但如果我们将他们视为学习经历，我们可能会从其他人中拿起秘密可以在我们的职业生涯后面申请。因为我花了这么多时间与少数的公司，我没有接受任何优惠，但我挑选了许多我试图塑造进入干草堆的秘密。</p><p> Sar : I appreciate you giving us an insider look at how hiring works at these big firms. Yes what you described is an explanation, not a justification for behaving badly and wasting someone’s time. The power dynamics and demand outstripping supply obviously enable VCs to do this while still tweeting about how their portfolio companies should approach hiring. I am onboard with you on learning from these experiences and playing the long game.</p><p> SAR：我很感谢您向我们介绍招聘在这些大公司的兴趣。是的，你所描述的是一个解释，而不是表现得很糟糕并浪费某人的时间的理由。电力动力学和需求超越供应显然使VCS能够实现这一目标，同时仍在推文其投资组合公司应该如何招聘。我船上和你在学习这些经历和漫长的比赛中。</p><p> Semil : Being casual and aloof if one thing — outright misleading young folks to the point where they really think an offer</p><p> SELIL：如果有一件事</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-semi-shah-founding-general">https://sarharibhakti.substack.com/p/a-chat-with-semi-shah-founding-general</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/vc/">#vc</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
