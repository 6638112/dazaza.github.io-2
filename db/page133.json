Now one researcher has found a collection of bugs that allow him to hack ATMs\u2014along with a wide variety of point-of-sale terminals\u2014in a new way: with a wave of his phone over a contactless credit card reader.\n Josep Rodriguez, a researcher and consultant at security firm IOActive, has spent the last year digging up and reporting vulnerabilities in the so-called near-field communications reader chips used in millions of ATMs and point-of-sale systems worldwide. NFC systems are what let you wave a credit card over a reader\u2014rather than swipe or insert it\u2014to make a payment or extract money from a cash machine. You can find them on countless retail store and restaurant counters, vending machines, taxis, and parking meters around the globe.\n Now Rodriguez has built an Android app that allows his smartphone to mimic those credit card radio communications and exploit flaws in the NFC systems&#39; firmware. With a wave of his phone, he can exploit a variety of bugs to crash point-of-sale devices, hack them to collect and transmit credit card data, invisibly change the value of transactions, and even lock the devices while displaying a ransomware message. Rodriguez says he can even force at least one brand of ATMs to dispense cash\u2014though that  &#34;jackpotting&#34; hack only works in combination with additional bugs he says he&#39;s found in the ATMs&#39; software. He declined to specify or disclose those flaws publicly due to nondisclosure agreements with the ATM vendors.\n &#34;You can modify the firmware and change the price to one dollar, for instance, even when the screen shows that you&#39;re paying 50 dollars. You can make the device useless, or install a kind of ransomware. There are a lot of possibilities here,&#34; says Rodriguez of the point-of-sale attacks he discovered. &#34;If you chain the attack and also send a special payload to an ATM&#39;s computer, you can jackpot the ATM\u2014like cash out, just by tapping your phone.&#34;\n Rodriguez says he alerted the affected vendors\u2014which include ID Tech, Ingenico, Verifone, Crane Payment Innovations, BBPOS, Nexgo, and the unnamed ATM vendor\u2014to his findings between 7 months and a year ago. Even so, he warns that the sheer number of affected systems and the fact that many point-of-sale terminals and ATMs don&#39;t regularly receive software updates\u2014and in many cases require physical access to update\u2014mean that many of those devices likely remain vulnerable. &#34;Patching so many hundreds of thousands of ATMs physically, it&#39;s something that would require a lot of time,&#34; Rodriguez says.\n  As a demonstration of those lingering vulnerabilities, Rodriguez shared a video with WIRED in which he waves a smartphone over the NFC reader of an ATM on the street in Madrid, where he lives, and causes the machine to display an error message. The NFC reader appears to crash, and no longer reads his credit card when he next touches it to the machine. (Rodriguez asked that WIRED not publish the video for fear of legal liability. He also didn&#39;t provide a video demo of a jackpotting attack because, he says, he could only legally test it on machines obtained as part of IOActive&#39;s security consulting to the affected ATM vendor, with whom IOActive has signed an NDA.)\n  The findings are &#34;excellent research into the vulnerability of software running on embedded devices,&#34; says Karsten Nohl, the founder of security firm SRLabs and a well-known firmware hacker, who reviewed Rodriguez&#39;s work. But Nohl points to a few drawbacks that reduce its practicality for real-world thieves. A hacked NFC reader would only be able to steal mag-stripe credit card data, not the victim&#39;s  PIN or the data from EMV chips. And the fact that the ATM cashout trick would require an extra, distinct vulnerability in a target ATM&#39;s code is no small caveat, Nohl says.\n  But security researchers like the late IOActive hacker Barnaby Jack and the team at Red Balloon Security have been able to uncover those ATM vulnerabilities for years, and have  even shown that hackers can remotely trigger ATM jackpotting remotely. Red Balloon CEO and chief scientist Ang Cui says that he&#39;s impressed by Rodriguez&#39;s findings and has little doubt that hacking the NFC reader could lead to dispensing cash in many modern ATMs, despite IOActive withholding some details of its attack. &#34;I think it&#39;s very plausible that once you have code execution on any of these devices, you should be able to get right to the main controller, because that thing is full of vulnerabilities that haven&#39;t been fixed for over a decade,&#34; Cui says. &#34;From there,&#34; he adds, &#34;you can absolutely control the cassette dispenser&#34; that holds and releases cash to users.\n  Rodriguez, who has spent years testing the security of ATMs as a consultant, says he began exploring a year ago whether ATMs&#39; contactless card readers\u2014most often sold by the payment technology firm ID Tech\u2014could serve as an in-road to hacking them. He began buying NFC readers and point-of-sale devices from eBay, and soon discovered that many of them suffered from the same security flaw: They didn&#39;t validate the size of the data packet sent via NFC from a credit card to the reader, known as an application protocol data unit or APDU.\n  By using a custom app to send a carefully crafted APDU from his NFC-enabled Android phone that&#39;s hundreds of times larger than the reader expects, Rodriguez was able to trigger a &#34;buffer overflow,&#34; a decades-old type of software vulnerability that allows a hacker to corrupt a target device&#39;s memory and run their own code.\n When WIRED reached out to the affected companies, ID Tech, BBPOS, and Nexgo didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment, and the ATM Industry Association declined to comment. Ingenico responded in a statement that due to its security mitigations, Rodriguez&#39;s buffer overflow technique could only crash its devices, not gain code execution on them, but that, &#34;considering the inconvenience and the impact for our customers,&#34; it issued a fix anyway. (Rodriguez counters that he&#39;s doubtful that Ingenico&#39;s mitigations would actually prevent code execution, but he hasn&#39;t actually created a proof of concept to demonstrate this.)\n Verifone, for its part, said that it had found and fixed the point-of-sale vulnerabilities Rodriguez highlighted in 2018, long before he had reported them. But Rodriguez argues that this only demonstrates the lack of consistent patching in the company&#39;s devices; he says he tested his NFC techniques on a Verifone device in a restaurant last year and found that it remained vulnerable.\n  After keeping many of his findings under wraps for a full year, Rodriguez plans to share the technical details of the vulnerabilities in a webinar in the coming weeks, in part to push customers of the affected vendors to implement the patches that the companies have made available. But he also wants to call attention to the abysmal state of embedded device security more broadly. He was shocked to find that vulnerabilities as simple as buffer overflows have lingered in so many commonly used devices\u2014ones that handle cash and sensitive financial information, no less.\n &#34;These vulnerabilities have been present in firmware for years, and we\u2019re using these devices daily to handle our credit cards, our money,&#34; he says. &#34;They need to be secured.&#34;\n   \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

From hardware like the  Xbox Adaptive Controller, to  legislation that requires all communication options in online multiplayer to be as accessible as possible, to  freely available in-depth development guidelines for interested developers, games have never been more inclusive to disabled players. As the 2010s come to a close, a game called  Deafverse is trying to reach another milestone by becoming the first fully American Sign Language (ASL)-accessible game. Developed through the National Deaf Center (NDC) in Austin, Texas,  Deafverse is a browser-based ongoing-narrative adventure about navigating the world as a deaf teenager. Designed first and foremost (but not exclusively) for classroom use, the game seeks to educate and enlighten players about deaf culture through collaborative play and discussion. Players learn about the real-life challenges of deafness in a safe and sincere way designed by and for the deaf community.\n Deriving inspiration from choose-your-own-adventure books and games,  Deafverse merges aspects of point-and-click sci-fi and fantasy stories from the 1980s and &#39;90s with contemporary standards for accessibility to make something that is as educational as it is engaging.\n  &#34;In deaf culture, we have a very strong culture of telling our own community stories,&#34; Kent Turner, gaming coordinator at the National Deaf Center, told Ars Technica. &#34;We love to share stories, and it&#39;s a very small community, and our language is unique to us. So I wanted to develop a game that really incorporated those values of deaf culture.&#34;\n Turner, a former teacher with a master&#39;s degree in game-based learning, derived much of  Deafverse&#39;s design from his experience &#34;gamifying&#34; his classroom. There, he used a points system akin to  Dungeons &amp; Dragons to reward students for completing homework, doing well in class, and so on.\n Deafverse marries that idea with a story-centered approach akin to  King&#39;s Quest and  The Secret of Monkey Island. Players face common hurdles among the deaf community\u2014like requesting an interpreter or just speaking up for themselves in a tough situation\u2014and examine the issues involved through branching conversations and intuitive puzzles.\n &#34;&#39;Choose your own adventure&#39; is a model of storytelling that, historically, has been text-based, and American Sign Language isn&#39;t really deliverable, so to speak, over text,&#34; Turner said. &#34;So, we have an actor who uses sign language and narrates the story and events using ASL. It also provides the text version as well, for those [who are] not fluent in sign language. We also have audio voiceover as another accessibility feature, and that really overlaps with the gaming features of picking your own adventure and figuring out what happens next in the story.&#34;\n    Empowerment is the central focus\u2014encouraging players to make their own choices and learn from the consequences. Even if things go sideways, the game creates an opportunity to discuss the hows and whys of what happened with other players, playing into the word-of-mouth storytelling that&#39;s at the foundation of deaf community.\n  Deafverse went through a range of beta tests conducted through partnered schools before the first episode, about self-advocacy, became publicly available in September 2019. Built and rebuilt based on student feedback, the game is now effectively in its third iteration, and its increased interactive elements and animations make the universe feel immersive.\n &#34;In terms of building and designing the game with different layers of gaming concepts, we got some inspiration from stories like  The Matrix,&#34; Turner explains. &#34;You know, plugging into and experiencing things in that world, but then you have to come out and come back into the real world. So that&#39;s given us some ideas about how to build out into the future.&#34;\n  Although  Deafverse is primarily designed for deaf teenagers of high school age (in service of the NDC&#39;s primary goal of supporting deaf young people&#39;s transition into active employment), much of its subject matter is useful for anyone who wants to learn about deafness. Using federal funding through the NDC, the  Deafverse development team was able to cast a wide net for research on ways deaf young people are and are not succeeding after their teen years. The findings, Turner says, were cross-checked against a set list of broad learning outcomes to create a game that teaches lessons while still being true to life.\n But  Deafverse is also about connecting to those who may feel isolated. Pop culture&#39;s rare, usually inaccurate depictions of deafness are often not much help in that regard.\n &#34;My two favorite examples are, first, people who can&#39;t sign or they use a different version of sign language that we can&#39;t understand,&#34; William Albright, senior software engineer on  Deafverse, said of some common &#34;deafness in pop culture&#34; tropes. &#34;And then, when a deaf character is chatting with other people in a movie, and the person is hearing and they speak back to the deaf person. It&#39;s not what really happens in our life. If we can&#39;t hear them, if a hearing person speaks to me, I sort of shut down and run away because it&#39;s not that easy for me to engage with them as they often show in a movie or a TV show.&#34;\n As a way of addressing these issues,  Deafverse is serving as a benchmark of sorts for overall accessibility within the games industry. While standards are much better than they were, there&#39;s still a lot of room for improvement, not least in basic aspects like uniformity among subtitling and options available. Making  Deafverse has involved incorporating as many variations of sign language as possible, so anyone who speaks it at any level can use it.\n    &#34;We didn&#39;t want to use American Sign Language the entire time because we didn&#39;t want people to feel like, &#39;Oh, I don&#39;t sign like so and so,&#39; or &#39;I don&#39;t sign at all, I can&#39;t play,&#39;&#34; Albright said. &#34;We want them to feel like they have options of accessibility, and we&#39;ve really tried to keep that key. When advertising the game, if you look at the video, it does look like it&#39;s only for kids who were born and raised in the deaf community, went to a deaf school, and only used sign language their whole life. So we try to counter that by really emphasizing that it&#39;s accessible to all hearing levels and all different types of diverse deaf people within our community.&#34;\n  Although games are becoming more and more common within a school setting (major releases like   Minecraft and   Assassin&#39;s Creed have\u00a0 specific  versions available for teaching), there&#39;s still a looming skepticism toward their wider usage in education.  Deafverse, however, has been met with open arms by teachers relieved to have such a wide-ranging resource. Students, meanwhile, have almost uniformly reported a growth in confidence in surveys conducted after playing the game. More than that, there are also small but valuable knock-on effects for players, like understanding proper signing etiquette by following the narrator.\n  &#34;I&#39;m continually surprised at how positive people are receiving  Deafverse,&#34; Turner said. &#34;I mean, we get so many positive comments about how great it is... The teachers are really able to take it and run with it, and often students will play  Deafverse on their own.&#34;\n With the first episode of  Deafverse a success, a total of four more episodes have been planned, each tackling one of the NDC&#39;s &#34;pre-employment transitional services.&#34; The second, due sometime in 2020, will tackle entering the workplace; it will look at interviewing and resume writing while building on the communication &#34;soft skills&#34; from the first episode.\n Developers are currently ironing out remaining minor issues with the engine and getting the upcoming achievement systems for tracking progress ready for roll out. In the long term, the team hopes to be able to make the jump to mobile and deepen the branching storylines that can make  Deafverse feel so dynamic.\n &#34;Right now, the story is told through very basic &#39;if&#39; and &#39;then&#39; statements,&#34; Turner explained. &#34;It&#39;s pretty basic, as we have it. We do want to add some more features like conditional branching... so when a player makes a decision here it&#39;ll impact something later down in the story again.&#34;\n &#34;The branching increase[s] the value for players, who can play it repeatedly and have all kinds of different things happen because of one choice,&#34; Albright added. &#34;The game [currently] feels more linear: you make one decision and it will tell you to keep navigating down the same road. So we are planning to branch out and give people different results, so not everybody comes to the same conclusion at the end.&#34;\n &#34;We&#39;re looking forward to providing that versatile experience for our players as we move through the development.&#34;\n Special thanks to interpreter Amanda Katz who was an immense help in translating many of the interviews in this piece from sign language.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 16:20:10", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u7834\u574f,deaf", "title": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u7834\u574f\u804b\u54d1\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u624b\u8bed ", "title_en": "Breaking deaf stereotypes and normalizing sign language through gaming", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/breaking-deaf-stereotypes-and-normalizing-sign-language-through-gaming/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6e38\u620f", "\u7834\u574f", "deaf"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "85b1266df273129ace3d3bfc97d54df4.jpg", "infoid": 1068194, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u75be\u75c5\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u9884\u9632\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8f89\u745e\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5236\u9020\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u5236\u9020\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u75ab\u82d7\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u8fc71200\u540d\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u7ea630\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f500\u5c81\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u3002\n \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u514d\u75ab\u7684\u597d\u5904\u6781\u5927\u5730\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caC.D.C\u7684\u987e\u95ee\u3002\u5f3a\u70c8\u63a8\u8350\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba12\u5c81\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5fc3\u808c\u708e\uff0c\u5fc3\u808c\u708e\u75c7;\u5fc3\u5305\u708e\uff0c\u5fc3\u810f\u5468\u56f4\u886c\u91cc\u7684\u708e\u75c7\u3002\u5728MRNA\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5242\u91cf\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u5242\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u7537\u6027\u6bd4\u5973\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\n \u4f46\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u526f\u4f5c\u7528\u975e\u5e38\u7f55\u89c1 -

Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna may have caused heart problems in more than 1,200 Americans, including about 500 who were younger than age 30, according to data reported on Wednesday by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n Still, the benefits of immunization greatly outweighed the risks, and advisers to the C.D.C. strongly recommended  vaccination for all Americans 12 and older.\n The heart problems reported are myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle; and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining around the heart. The risk is higher after the second dose of an mRNA vaccine than after the first, the researchers reported, and much higher in men than in women.\n But overall, the side effect is very uncommon \u2014 just 12.6 cases per million second doses administered. The researchers estimated that out of a million second doses given to boys ages 12 to 17, the vaccines might cause a maximum of 70 myocarditis cases, but would prevent 5,700 infections, 215 hospitalizations and two deaths.\n Agency researchers presented the data to members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which makes recommendations on vaccine use in the United States. (The scientists grouped pericarditis with myocarditis for reporting purposes.)\n Most cases were mild, with symptoms like fatigue, chest pain and disturbances in heart rhythm that quickly cleared up, the researchers said. Of the 484 cases reported in Americans under age 30, the C.D.C. has definitively linked 323 cases to vaccination. The rest remain under investigation.\n \u201cThese events are really very rare, extremely rare,\u201d said Dr. Brian Feingold, an expert on heart inflammation in children at the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh. \u201cThat needs to be taken in context with illness and morbidity and mortality related to Covid.\u201d\n  Separately, more than a dozen federal and professional medical organizations said in a joint statement on Wednesday that myocarditis \u201cis an extremely rare side effect, and only an exceedingly small number of people will experience it after vaccination.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration nonetheless is expected to add a warning to the vaccines\u2019 packaging regarding possible heart problems in the coming days.\n Federal researchers on Wednesday also presented early safety data regarding the six million doses of vaccines administered to children ages 12 to 15. The side effects \u2014 usually fatigue and pain at the injection site \u2014 were similar to those observed in young people ages 16 to 25.\n \u201cTo date, the Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. have demonstrated a high degree of safety,\u201d said Dr. Matthew F. Daley, a senior investigator at Kaiser Permanente Colorado and a member of the advisory committee.\n The C.D.C. advisers met as the Biden administration  publicly acknowledged that it expected to fall short of its goal of getting 70 percent of Americans at least partly vaccinated by July 4. The shortfall, officials said on Tuesday, resulted in part from reluctance among younger Americans to be immunized.\n About two out of every 100,000 people aged 15 to 18 \u2014 about two-thirds of them male \u2014 are hospitalized each year with myocarditis, according to data presented at the meeting. Patients with the most severe cases may require mechanical support, like a ventilator, or a heart transplant.\n Even those with mild symptoms must refrain from exercise for about six months after recovery. It\u2019s unclear what typically causes the condition, or why it\u2019s more common in young men than in women.\n  The first cases of myocarditis linked to coronavirus vaccines were reported in Israel, mostly among young men aged 16 to 19. Israel recorded 148 cases from December to May, 95 percent of them mild.\n In the United States, too, myocarditis has been more common in men and boys: Up to 80 percent of cases diagnosed after the second dose were in males. There has also been a clear age difference, with the side effect clustered in individuals in their late teens and early 20s.\n About 318 million coronavirus vaccine doses have been administered in the United States as of June 21, and 150 million people are considered to be fully protected. Most of the myocarditis symptoms emerged within about four days of the first or second dose.\n \u201cWe have clear evidence here of onset for the vaccinated cases within the first week,\u201d said Dr. Tom Shimabukuro, a vaccine expert at the C.D.C. who presented the new data. There is also a dose effect, he said, adding, \u201cThe rates are higher for both vaccines after dose two.\u201d\n The vast majority of patients with the side effect fully recover, noted Dr. James de Lemos, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who reported  one of the first cases in January.\n Covid-19 itself may cause heart problems in young people. A large  study of collegiate athletes showed that 2.3 percent of those who had recovered from Covid-19 had heart abnormalities consistent with myocarditis.\n \u201cIt\u2019s going to be manifold more common to get heart muscle inflammation from getting Covid than you would from getting a vaccine, even in young men,\u201d Dr. de Lemos said.\n More than 4,000 children infected with the coronavirus developed multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which includes heart symptoms. Some children have also died, while none have died from vaccination, Dr. Feingold noted. \u201cYou can say no to the vaccine, but you\u2019re assuming other risks.\u201d\n The C.D.C. recommends vaccination for all Americans over age 12. But on Wednesday, officials suggested that anyone who develops myocarditis after the first dose should defer a second dose until they discuss the risks with a health care provider.\n The C.D.C.\u2019s recommendations may influence decisions about whether to immunize children younger than 12 as vaccines become available for that age group. Some experts have questioned whether the benefits to children outweigh the potential risks, given the low odds of developing serious illness from the virus in young children.\n Still, the agency  reported this month that the number of Covid-19-related hospitalizations among adolescents in the United States was about three times higher than hospitalizations linked to influenza over three recent flu seasons.\n The overall number of infections has steeply dropped since January, but as more adults have been vaccinated, the proportion of children in the total has risen. About one-third of new infections reported in May were in Americans aged 12 to 29, and 316 deaths have been recorded in this age group since April.\n Vaccination is becoming an even more urgent priority, given more contagious variants of the coronavirus now circulating in the United States, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine safety committee, said in an interview.\n \u201cWe are not close to being near where we need to be\u201d in terms of the percentage of Americans who should be vaccinated, said Dr. Offit, who is also a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to head into winter when you\u2019re going to have a generally undervaccinated population.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25

Carroll\u2019s  Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland, \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d This question from Alice is at once a critique of her sister\u2019s pictureless tome, and a paving the way for the delight of words and images to follow. Indeed, John Tenniel\u2019s famous illustrations \u2014 for both the first edition of  Wonderland and its sequel  Through the Looking-Glass \u2014 have become integral to how we experience the story, in both books and  film. Tenniel, however, was not the first to illustrate the tale. That honor belongs to Carroll himself, whose original manuscript of the story (then titled \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d) is littered with thirty-seven of his own sepia-ink drawings. It seems this entwining of word and image \u2014 so important to the published version \u2014 was there from the beginning.\n Carroll&#39;s illustrations are slightly more reserved and less caricatured than John Tenniel\u2019s efforts so familiar to us today. In a vertical sketch that stretches out across the manuscript\u2019s right margin, spanning part of the indelible  mushroom scene, Alice\u2019s \u201cimmense length of neck\u201d assumes the form of a fuzzy tree trunk, capped with an almost  Pre-Raphaelite face, which gazes solemnly across the distant forest below. It&#39;s an oddly mournful countenance that recurs throughout. On the final page Carroll stuck a small photographic portrait of Alice Liddell (1852\u20131934) the family friend for whom he wrote (and drew) the story. Underneath the photograph is his attempt at a drawn portrait, with which he seems to have been displeased enough to cover with the photograph. Did he intend his heroine to look like Alice herself? It&#39;s not so easy to tell, though there is something of her look in his drawings.\n  The manuscript was presented to Alice so that she could revisit a story that he had improvised while rowing her and her sisters down one of Oxford\u2019s rivers.  As Carroll put it:\n Many a day had we rowed together on that quiet stream. . .and many a fairy tale had been extemporized for their benefit. . .yet none of these many tales got written down: they lived and died, like summer midges, each in its golden afternoon. . .\n While  unsubstantiated theories about the author\u2019s consumption of hallucinogenic compounds or  undiagnosed temporal lobe epilepsy are often trotted out as an explanation for the fictional Alice\u2019s phantasmagoric adventure, the other-worldly pleasures of these idle river trips seem to be a more likely source for the unparalleled visions of Wonderland. As Walter de la Mare observed, when writing about Carroll, \u201cafternoons in July, if fair and cloudless, are apt to be narcotics. The rhythm of sculling quiets the mind and sets the workaday wits drowsing\u201d.\n In addition to his clerical and mathematical pursuits, Carroll was as much a visual artist as a storywriter. In 1899, there was enough unpublished material for his nephew, Stuart Carroll Collingwood, to publish   The Lewis Carroll Picture Book, a collection of lesser-known texts, many complete with illustrated margins, alike in kind to \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d. Carroll was also  a talented photographer, keeping a darkroom in his College rooms. As  Diane Waggoner has argued, \u201cCarroll\u2019s photographs of children equaled the status of his children\u2019s books. His pictures served as a vehicle for the emotional and imaginative appeal of. . . childhood\u201d. A similar set of concerns and proclivities can be glimpsed in his original  Alice illustrations, which capture both the playful innocence and unselfconscious sincerity of childhood adventure.\n When Carroll decided to publish his story, excising certain family-specific details from \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d, he chose John Tenniel (1820\u20131914) as illustrator, well-known for his cartoons in the magazine  Punch. Tenniel based several of his drawings, engraved onto  woodblock electrotypes by the Dalziel brothers, off of Carroll\u2019s own illustrations, but found the Oxford Don to be rather exacting with his interventions. Some of this scrupulousness was warranted: Tenniel introduced  several interpretive ambiguities into his illustrations, few of which escaped Carroll\u2019s notice, or his time-consuming calls for correction. And, after working on  Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, Tenniel initially declined to illustrate  Through the Looking-Glass (1871), which scholars have read as a sign that the collaboration between author and illustrator had temporarily soured.\n Below you can browse all thirty-seven of Carroll\u2019s manuscript illustrations, which carry bittersweet associations. On one hand, it is a joy that they have survived. It was treasured by Alice Liddell until she was forced to auction the text in 1928 to pay for her husband\u2019s death duties. Thankfully, it was eventually purchased, after passing through the possession of several intermediary owners, by American benefactors, who donated the manuscript to the British Library as a symbol of a special, postwar relationship between the nations in 1948. On the other hand, these illustrations conjure an unfathomable depth of creative loss  when we remember that the Alice stories were just a few of the many \u201coriginal, funny, starling, and brilliant\u201d tales that Carroll extemporized for children, most of which were never transcribed or drawn at all, only given over to the wind and river on idle summer afternoons.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 14:55:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "carroll,\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d", "title": "Lewis Carroll\u7684\u63d2\u56fe\u201cAlice\u5728\u5730\u4e0b\u7684\u5192\u9669\u201d\uff081864\u5e74\uff09 ", "title_en": "Lewis Carroll\u2019s Illustrations for \u201cAlice\u2019s Adventures Under Ground\u201d (1864)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/carroll-illustrations-for-alice-undergound", "via": "", "real_tags": ["carroll", "\u7231\u4e3d\u4e1d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "644c38c28dd7eb882af1caa3d838dd0e.jpg", "infoid": 1068189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f\uff1a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b89\u5168\u5c40\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f51\u7edc\u6218\u58eb\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u6765\u963b\u6b62\u7f51\u7edc\u653b\u51fb\u3002\n D3Fend\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8865\u5145\u4ef2\u88c1\u8d5b\uff06amp;

Whereas ATT&amp;CK focuses on standardizing the way cyber warriors understand and talk about offense, D3FEND focuses on cyber defenses.\n  Together, the frameworks provide cyber warriors with a common understanding of cyber concepts and a standardized vocabulary to use when talking about them, which should facilitate clearer communication for sharing information and coordinating defensive operations both in and between organizations.\n ATT&amp;CK can be used to build threat models, as well as cyber kill chains of actual incidents, to include adversaries\u2019 behaviors and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), in part because ATT&amp;CK is based on real-world threats.\n  Likewise, D3FEND can be used to develop cyber defenses  by \u201cillustrat[ing] the complex interplay between computer network architectures, threats, and cyber countermeasures\u2026 illuminat[ing] previously-unspecified relationships between defensive and offensive methods.\u201d\n Because D3FEND is so detailed, it can serve as a useful guide for architecting, designing, and implementing cyber defenses.\n    D3FEND is based, in part, on 500 countermeasure patents from the last two decades, according to its website. Notably, however, D3FEND and ATT&amp;CK are vendor-agnostic frameworks, which can be applied to safeguarding a wide range of IT environments, including national security systems, Defense Department networks, and defense industrial base assets.\n NSA funded  MITRE\u2019s research for developing D3FEND, but like ATT&amp;CK, it\u2019s freely available online now. Cyber professionals can provide comments and recommend improvements at the  D3FEND website.\n Breaking Defense reached out to NSA for comments, but did not receive any before publication.\n Risk reduction is vital in the development of this new Air Force bomber. Northrop Grumman is driving risk out of the program with digital capabilities throughout design, build, prototype, and test.\n Recommended  \u201cThe Department of Defense officially recognizes five domains of warfare,\u201d Rep. Langevin said. \u201cFor four of those domains, the senior civilian is a service secretary. Cyber has a deputy assistant secretary, which is four rungs lower than the other warfighting domains.
