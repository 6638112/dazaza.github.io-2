The Wynn luxury hotel, with its indoor gardens, seafood restaurants, and extravagant shopping, had been this group&#39;s world for the past few days, with law enforcement officials from the U.S., Canada, and Australia grilling Ramos. Four or five officials lay down after another session of questioning their suspect.</p><p>挤在拉斯维加斯酒店套房里的人都睡着了，除了文斯·拉莫斯。永利豪华酒店拥有室内花园、海鲜餐厅和奢华的购物场所，在过去的几天里一直是这群人的天下，来自美国、加拿大和澳大利亚的执法官员正在盘问拉莫斯。四五名官员在另一次讯问嫌疑人后躺下。</p><p>  Ramos had short breaks to see his wife and one of his children, who were staying in their own room nearby. Fearing he wouldn&#39;t be able to see his family if he didn&#39;t do so, Ramos spoke at length with the agents. Ramos looked like a ghost during those breaks when his family saw him, they said.</p><p>拉莫斯有短暂的休息时间去看望他的妻子和一个孩子，他们住在附近自己的房间里。拉莫斯担心，如果他不这样做，他将无法见到家人，于是他与特工们进行了详细的交谈。他们说，拉莫斯在休息期间，当他的家人看到他时，他看起来像个幽灵。</p><p>    He’d travelled to meet an associate as part of his multi-million dollar business, selling encrypted phones under the brand name Phantom Secure. Phantom&#39;s customized BlackBerry phones used dedicated software designed to make an ordinary wiretap impossible. The associate and Ramos planned to attend a fight in Vegas. But instead the FBI were waiting and cornered Ramos, dangling charges above his head usually reserved for taking down mob bosses. Biker gangs in Australia, drug traffickers in California, and even members of the Sinaloa Cartel all used Phantom&#39;s phones. Rather than treat Phantom as an innocent third party to crime like Apple or Google when criminals use phones made by those companies, authorities said Ramos himself was part of criminal conspiracies. The agents had Ramos on tape suggesting he made the phones to help drug smugglers. On the other side of that hotel room door, when the agents finally stopped asking their questions, there was likely a long prison sentence.</p><p>作为他数百万美元生意的一部分，他去见了一位同事，以幻影安全(Phantom Secure)的品牌销售加密手机。幻影定制的黑莓手机使用了专门设计的软件，使普通的窃听变得不可能。这位同事和拉莫斯计划参加在拉斯维加斯举行的一场拳击比赛。但取而代之的是，联邦调查局在等待并将拉莫斯逼入绝境，在他的头顶上悬挂着指控，通常是为扳倒黑帮头目而保留的。澳大利亚的摩托帮派，加州的毒贩，甚至锡那罗亚卡特尔的成员都使用幻影的手机。当局表示，当犯罪分子使用苹果或谷歌制造的手机时，Phantom没有像苹果或谷歌那样被视为无辜的第三方犯罪，而是拉莫斯本人参与了犯罪阴谋。特工们有拉莫斯的录音，表明他制造手机是为了帮助毒品走私者。在酒店房间门的另一边，当特工们最终停止提问时，很可能会被判长期监禁。</p><p>  He slipped out into the corridor without waking his captors. Ramos walked to his wife&#39;s room and said goodbye. He had a chance to get up to Washington state and cross the border back to his home in Canada.</p><p>他没有叫醒抓他的人就溜进了走廊。拉莫斯走到他妻子的房间道别。他有机会到达华盛顿州，越过边境回到他在加拿大的家。</p><p>  He headed downstairs, moved through the boiler area and basement, and left the hotel. Embarrassingly for the agents still in the suite, the person they had been hunting for years had just walked away.</p><p>他下了楼，穿过锅炉区和地下室，离开了酒店。让仍然在套房里的特工们感到尴尬的是，他们追捕多年的人刚刚离开了。</p><p>  Ramos had always been a businessman. Before launching Phantom Secure and becoming the target of an international investigation, he worked with multi-level marketing company Amway, and went on to corporate sales for Rogers, the Toronto-headquartered telecom conglomerate. Ramos received employee of the month awards both for selling bathtubs and then for selling phones, a family member said. His mother was a nurse; his father, a janitor.</p><p>拉莫斯一直是个商人。在推出Phantom Secure并成为国际调查目标之前，他曾在多层次营销公司安利工作，然后为总部位于多伦多的电信集团罗杰斯(Rogers)从事企业销售。拉莫斯的一位家庭成员说，拉莫斯因销售浴缸和手机而获得了月度最佳员工奖。他的母亲是一名护士，他的父亲是一名看门人。</p><p>  &#34;He was very business-savvy. His whole life, he was sales,&#34; the family member said. Ramos was &#34;definitely a businessman to the core. Not a gangster in the slightest,&#34; a source with knowledge of Phantom&#39;s operations added.</p><p>他非常精通商业。这位家庭成员说，他一生都在做销售。拉莫斯绝对是个彻头彻尾的商人。一点也不是黑帮分子，一位了解幽灵运作的消息来源补充道。</p><p>  Ramos coached his son’s flag football team, the Richmond Raiders. He practiced jujitsu with one of his daughters and wore a Hello Kitty backpack while making bracelets with his children.</p><p>拉莫斯是他儿子的旗帜足球队里士满袭击者队的教练。他和他的一个女儿练习柔术，和孩子们一起做手镯时还背着Hello Kitty背包。</p><p>  He also got involved with a wide range of companies and ventures. Ramos gave a video testimonial for Allysian, a wellness and nutritional supplements company. In the clip on YouTube, Ramos said in a quiet, slightly nervous tone, that he looked up to Rod Jao, the founder of Allysian, because he had &#34;always seen him as being a successful entrepreneur.&#34;</p><p>他还参与了广泛的公司和企业。拉莫斯为Allysian，一家健康和营养补充剂公司提供了一段视频推荐信。在YouTube上的这段视频中，拉莫斯用平静而略带紧张的语气说，他尊敬Allysian的创始人罗德·饶，因为他一直认为他是一个成功的企业家。</p><p>  Ramos was a bit of a positive power kind of person, the source with knowledge of Phantom&#39;s operations added. Ramos didn&#39;t want to hear complaints. In his Allysian testimonial, Ramos said, &#34;I tried the Mastermind, the Genesis, and the vitamins, and the chocolates,&#34; referring to some of the company&#39;s products.</p><p>拉莫斯是一个有点积极力量的人，这位了解幻影运作的消息人士补充道。拉莫斯不想听到抱怨。在他的Allysian推荐信中，拉莫斯说，我试过MasterMind、Genesis、维生素和巧克力，指的是该公司的一些产品。</p><p>  &#34;All natural ingredients, what I&#39;m putting into my body, actually makes me feel really good,” he said. “I feel like I have a lot more energy, and, you know what, I even have that extra motivation to go to the gym, and work extra hard.”</p><p>他说：“所有的天然成分，我放进身体里的东西，实际上让我感觉真的很好。”“我觉得自己精力充沛，而且，你知道吗，我甚至有额外的动力去健身房，更加努力地工作。”</p><p>  Motherboard spoke to over half a dozen sources around Phantom, including family members of Ramos, distributors who sold Phantom phones in multiple countries on his behalf, and people with knowledge of the company&#39;s operations. In most cases, the sources requested anonymity to protect them from retaliation, especially from law enforcement and criminals. Four of Ramos&#39;s co-defendants, people who allegedly helped run the company or sell phones, remain wanted international fugitives. Motherboard also obtained multiple documents from within Phantom and a law enforcement file that gives deep insight into the investigation.</p><p>Motherboard采访了Phantom周围的六个消息来源，包括拉莫斯的家人，代表他在多个国家销售Phantom手机的分销商，以及了解该公司运营的人。在大多数情况下，消息人士要求匿名，以保护他们免受报复，特别是免受执法和犯罪分子的报复。拉莫斯的四名共同被告，据称帮助经营公司或销售手机的人，仍然是被通缉的国际逃犯。母板公司还从幻影内部获得了多份文件，并获得了一份执法文件，为调查提供了深刻的见解。</p><p>  Many of the sources described Ramos not as a hardened criminal, but as a person who was naive and ignorant about the situation he put himself in. They described him as negligent, not malevolent. But as the company expanded, and eventually competition ramped up, something changed, and Ramos knowingly served the criminal market.</p><p>许多消息来源将拉莫斯描述为一个天真和无知的人，而不是一个顽固的罪犯。他们形容他粗心大意，而不是恶毒。但随着公司的扩张，最终竞争加剧，情况发生了变化，拉莫斯在知情的情况下为犯罪市场服务。</p><p>   In 2008, Phantom started innocuously. Ramos got approval from lawyers in Canada to create the firm, went through the proper channels, and got his business license, according to the family member. Business records show Phantom Secure Communications was registered in Richmond, Canada.</p><p>2008年，Phantom开局无伤大雅。据拉莫斯的家人说，拉莫斯获得了加拿大律师的批准，通过了适当的渠道，并获得了营业执照。商业记录显示，幻影安全通信公司是在加拿大里士满注册的。</p><p>  On  the company&#39;s early, barebones website, Ramos, under the handle &#34;CEO,&#34; laid out in part why he said he started Phantom.</p><p>在该公司早期的赤裸裸的网站拉莫斯(Ramos)上，首席执行官拉莫斯(Ramos)列出了他说自己创办Phantom的部分原因。</p><p>  &#34;I truly believe in our right to privacy and like many internet users I have always had a concern with the security of my email storage and communications,&#34; Ramos wrote. He said that he used to send emails that contained seemingly trivial details, like dates and times when he was coming home, but also more important information like specific business details. Realizing that email as a medium was not especially private, he looked for a way to protect his communications over the internet.</p><p>拉莫斯写道：我真的相信我们的隐私权，像许多互联网用户一样，我一直担心我的电子邮件存储和通信的安全。他说，他过去常常发送电子邮件，其中包含看似琐碎的细节，比如他回家的日期和时间，但也包含更重要的信息，比如具体的商业细节。意识到电子邮件作为媒介并不是特别隐私，他就寻找一种方法来保护他在互联网上的交流。</p><p>  Ramos wasn&#39;t much of a tech guy; he was never really a nerd or geek, his family member said. Instead, another person, the company&#39;s chief technology officer (CTO), handled the technical aspects of the operation. Court records don&#39;t name this person, instead referring to him as Individual A and a &#34;high-ranking officer of Phantom Secure.&#34; Motherboard found his identity and a photo of him in an FBI document, and uncovered Canadian corporate records related to secure communications companies that mention his name. Motherboard is not naming him publicly because he has not been charged with a crime, and when reached for comment he feared for his and his family&#39;s safety.</p><p>拉莫斯的家人说，拉莫斯不太喜欢技术；他从来都不是一个真正的书呆子或极客。取而代之的是，另一个人，该公司的首席技术官(CTO)，负责操作的技术方面。法庭记录没有提到此人的名字，而是将他称为个人A和幻影安全公司(Phantom Secure.)的一名高级官员。母板在一份FBI文件中发现了他的身份和一张他的照片，并发现了与提到他名字的安全通信公司有关的加拿大公司记录。母板没有公开他的名字，因为他没有被指控犯罪，当记者联系到他请其置评时，他担心自己和家人的安全。</p><p>  &#34;He was a very difficult person so Vince [Ramos] kept him away from the clients,&#34; the source with knowledge of Phantom&#39;s operations said of the CTO.</p><p>他是一个非常难相处的人，所以文斯[拉莫斯]让他远离客户，这位了解幻影运营情况的消息人士在谈到首席技术官时说。</p><p> Do you know anything else about Phantom Secure? We&#39;d love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, OTR chat on  jfcox@jabber.ccc.de  , or email  joseph.cox@vice.com  .</p><p>你还知道关于幻影安全的其他事情吗？我们很高兴收到你的来信。使用非工作电话或计算机，您可以通过Signal(+44 20 8133 5190)、Wickr(Josephcox)、OTR Chat(Email：jfcox@jabber.ccc.de)或电子邮件(joseph.cox@vice.com)安全地联系约瑟夫·考克斯(Joseph Cox)。</p><p>  Phantom&#39;s phones used a version of Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP encryption, meaning that only the intended recipient is supposed to be able to decrypt messages sent to them. Phantom went further, however, and also physically removed the GPS functionality from the BlackBerry, as well as the microphone and camera. With this drastically locked down device, a user couldn&#39;t make ordinary calls on the phone and instead could only send encrypted emails. Phantom also introduced a remote wipe feature, where a user could contact the company, and Phantom would delete messages on the phone without having physical control of the device. The company ran its infrastructure outside of Canada, and routed data through servers in Panama and Hong Kong in an attempt to keep it out of the reach of third-parties.</p><p>Phantom&#39；的手机使用的是Pretty Good Privacy或PGP加密的一个版本，这意味着只有预定的收件人才能解密发送给他们的消息。然而，幻影走得更远，还在物理上移除了黑莓手机的GPS功能，以及麦克风和摄像头。有了这个被彻底锁定的设备，用户不能在手机上打普通电话，而只能发送加密的电子邮件。幻影还引入了远程擦除功能，用户可以联系公司，幻影会删除手机上的信息，而不会对设备进行物理控制。该公司在加拿大以外运行其基础设施，并通过巴拿马和香港的服务器路由数据，试图使其远离第三方。</p><p>  The privacy protection on messages from encrypted phones typically only works if the user is texting someone else who also has an encrypted phone, and sometimes companies force their devices to only communicate with phones from the same manufacturer. That way, if there was someone you needed to chat to and they had such a phone, you had to buy one too. From a business perspective, it was a way to pull in and retain customers.</p><p>对来自加密手机的消息的隐私保护通常只有在用户给也有加密手机的其他人发短信时才有效，有时公司会强制他们的设备只与同一制造商的手机通信。这样一来，如果有你需要聊天的人，而他们有这样一部手机，你也必须买一部。从商业角度来看，这是吸引和留住客户的一种方式。</p><p>  Bruno (not his real name) said he started using Phantom phones in 2008 when he worked in Toronto&#39;s nightlife. Motherboard granted him anonymity to speak more candidly about the potentially grey area of selling encrypted phones. This was the heyday of BlackBerry&#39;s own messaging system, BBM, when typing out texts on a clunky QWERTY keyboard was considered stylish. Bruno said having a Phantom phone was originally a status symbol with VIP crowds, ranging from businessmen to escorts, and Ramos described the devices as the Louis Vuitton of the phone world. A phone cost thousands of dollars a year in subscription fees. Phantom marketed itself as the only full privacy solution, and its marketing worked, Bruno added.</p><p>布鲁诺(化名)说，他在2008年开始使用幻影手机，当时他在多伦多的夜生活中工作。主板允许他匿名，以便更坦率地谈论销售加密手机的潜在灰色地带。这是黑莓(BlackBerry)自己的通讯系统BBM的全盛时期，在笨重的QWERTY键盘上打字被认为是时髦的。布鲁诺说，拥有一部幻影手机最初在VIP人群中是一种身份象征，从商人到护送人员，拉莫斯将这些设备描述为手机世界的路易威登(Louis Vuitton)。一部手机每年的订阅费高达数千美元。布鲁诺补充说，幻影将自己推销为唯一的完整隐私解决方案，其营销奏效了。</p><p>  &#34;I had to be in contact with VIP clients to cater to their every need for bookings, reservations, etc,&#34; Bruno said, adding that he&#39;s worked with real estate agents and accountants who purchased Phantom devices.</p><p>布鲁诺说：我必须与贵宾客户保持联系，以满足他们在预订、预订等方面的各种需求。他补充说，他与购买幻影设备的房地产经纪人和会计师合作。</p><p>  Ramos gave free Phantom phones to rappers and athletes, including members of the Toronto Raptors, who would then use the devices with their own social network, Bruno said.</p><p>布鲁诺说，拉莫斯向说唱歌手和运动员免费赠送幻影手机，其中包括多伦多猛龙的成员，然后他们将通过自己的社交网络使用这些设备。</p><p>  Mitsy Ramos, Vince Ramos&#39; ex-wife and a Los Angeles-based Instagram model, said she worked for Phantom Secure and a connected company called VMD Ventures, according to social media posts. &#34;I&#39;ll give you a deal,&#34; she tweeted to a Miami modeling agency in September 2011, along with a link to the Phantom website. Mitsy Ramos did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p>米茜·拉莫斯(Mitsy Ramos)是文斯·拉莫斯(Vince Ramos)的前妻，也是一名洛杉矶的Instagram模特。社交媒体帖子称，她曾为Phantom Secure和一家名为VMD Ventures的互联公司工作。2011年9月，她在推特上给迈阿密一家模特经纪公司发了一条推特，并附上了幻影网站的链接，我会给你一笔交易。米齐·拉莫斯(Mitsy Ramos)没有回复多个置评请求。</p><p>  &#34;Vince was selling BB’s [BlackBerries] like he sold Amway. He was always talking about direct marketing, etc,&#34; the source with knowledge of Phantom&#39;s operations said. Ramos read books about sales, the source added. Much of the exposure was done through word-of-mouth, multiple sources said.</p><p>文斯卖BB的[黑莓]手机就像卖安利一样。这位了解幻影运营情况的消息人士说，他一直在谈论直销等问题。消息人士补充说，拉莫斯阅读有关销售的书籍。多位消息人士称，大部分接触是通过口碑进行的。</p><p>  Later on, Phantom coated its website  in a slick, black and chrome design, with silhouetted figures holding their phones. Images showed men in black suits and ties  and luxury Bentley cars.</p><p>后来，Phantom在其网站上涂上了光滑的黑色和铬合金设计，剪影中的人物拿着手机。图片显示，男子穿着黑色西装，打着领带，开着豪华宾利汽车。</p><p>  &#34;Designed exclusively for the sophisticated executive,&#34; Phantom&#39;s website later read. Some people who sold Ramos&#39; phones included photos of Phantom devices surrounded by gold jewelry on their social media accounts.</p><p>Phantom&34；Phantom的网站稍后会读到，这是专为老练的高管设计的。一些销售拉莫斯手机的人在他们的社交媒体账户上附上了幻影设备被黄金首饰包围的照片。</p><p>  In a Phantom promotional video, a guitar twangs as the screen displays the company&#39;s logo. The video is littered with stock footage: men smoking cigars, leather seats, and a towering skyscraper with the company&#39;s logo obviously photoshopped onto its side.</p><p>在“幻影”的宣传视频中，屏幕上显示着公司的标志，吉他叮当作响。视频中充斥着库存镜头：男人们抽着雪茄，坐在真皮座椅上，还有一座高耸的摩天大楼，侧面显然印着该公司的标志。</p><p>    &#34;Offshore Swiss Account password,&#34; one fictional text between Phantom users in the video reads, demonstrating what sort of sensitive information clients might want to use the phones to send to one another.</p><p>离岸瑞士账户密码，视频中幻影用户之间的一段虚构文字这样写道，展示了客户可能想要使用手机相互发送什么样的敏感信息。</p><p>    &#34;Did you know that using cell phones is the least secure form of communication?&#34; the video asks. &#34;Did you know regular email is similar to sending post cards? Did you know that SMS texts are sent in plaint text?&#34;</p><p>你知道使用手机是最不安全的交流方式吗？视频问道。你知道普通电子邮件类似于寄明信片吗？你知道短信都是用感叹的文字发送的吗？</p><p>  Ramos typically didn&#39;t directly interact with his user base, which at the time was primarily Canadian. Administrators for Phantom handled new subscriptions, initiated device wipes, or removed accounts, according to court records. Bruno, who visited a Phantom office in Vancouver, said it was a 300-square-meter modern, clean office, but wasn&#39;t like an ordinary tech or startup space. Below the administrators, Ramos hired distributors, who essentially acted as middlemen between individual agents who sold phones to users, and the main Phantom company itself that the distributors would send their cut back up to. Bruno graduated from being a Phantom user to a distributor; a common route among other encrypted phone companies. Eventually he became a wholesaler.</p><p>拉莫斯通常不会直接与他的用户群互动，当时他的用户群主要是加拿大人。根据法庭记录，幻影的管理员处理了新的订阅，启动了设备擦除，或删除了账户。布鲁诺参观了温哥华的一家幻影办公室，他说这是一间300平方米的现代化、干净的办公室，但与普通的科技或创业空间不同。在管理员之下，拉莫斯雇佣了分销商，他们实质上是向用户销售手机的个人代理商和主要幻影公司本身之间的中间人，分销商将把他们的分成寄回给他们。布鲁诺从幻影用户成长为分销商；这在其他加密电话公司中是一条常见的路线。最终他成了一名批发商。</p><p>  Bruno and the source with knowledge of Phantom&#39;s operations both said that the company had a customer support center based in India. Website registration and online corporate records reveal a company linked to Phantom&#39;s CTO which does remote customer support and has a branch in Jalandhar, Punjab.</p><p>布鲁诺和了解幻影运营情况的消息人士都表示，该公司在印度有一个客户支持中心。网站注册和在线公司记录显示，有一家公司与幻影的首席技术官(CTO)有关联，该公司提供远程客户支持，并在旁遮普邦的贾兰达尔(Jalandhar)设有分支机构。</p><p>  With Phantom&#39;s structure, Ramos was fairly hands-off with a large chunk of his customers, letting the workers sell the phones in their own geographic territories.</p><p>有了幻影的结构，拉莫斯对他的一大批客户相当放手，让工人们在自己的地理区域销售手机。</p><p>     But Phantom had holes in how it hired distributors. Bruno said he moved to Asia to start selling the devices there. At first, Bruno said he simply sold the phones in exchange for envelopes of cash, but soon tried to tighten up the operation. He said he started to carry out due diligence on the sellers underneath him to make sure he was providing phones to legitimate industries and clients. He requested personal details so he could work out banking compliance and asked distributors to fill out anti-money laundering (AML) forms, where they provided names, addresses, and a form of identification so the company could verify who they were dealing with. Bruno provided Motherboard with a cache of internal Phantom documents, including filled out AML forms and bank statements, as well as driver licenses of distributors, to demonstrate some of the checks he carried out.</p><p>但幻影在招聘分销商的方式上存在漏洞。布鲁诺说，他搬到了亚洲，开始在那里销售这些设备。起初，布鲁诺说，他只是简单地出售手机，以换取现金信封，但很快就试图收紧操作。他说，他开始对他下面的卖家进行尽职调查，以确保他向合法行业和客户提供手机。他要求提供个人信息，这样他就可以制定银行合规问题，并要求分销商填写反洗钱(AML)表格，他们在表格上提供姓名、地址和身份证明表格，以便公司可以核实他们在与谁打交道。布鲁诺向Motherboard提供了一批内部Phantom文档，包括填写的AML表格和银行对账单，以及分销商的驾驶执照，以展示他进行的一些检查。</p><p>  Early on, there were signs that Phantom&#39;s client base included criminals. Bruno said he turned down some &#34;unsavory characters&#34; looking to do business, &#34;simply out of fear, let alone God knows what they were doing.&#34; Bruno filtered out the more suspicious individuals, he said.</p><p>早些时候，有迹象表明，幻影的客户群中包括罪犯。布鲁诺说，他拒绝了一些想做生意的讨厌人物，纯粹是因为害怕，更不用说天知道他们在做什么了。布鲁诺过滤掉了更多可疑的人，他说。</p><p>  Ramos, meanwhile, wasn&#39;t asking for much of this verification himself, according to Bruno. One of Phantom&#39;s policies was that it did not collect client names, but parts of the company also weren&#39;t verifying who was selling phones in the first place.</p><p>与此同时，根据布鲁诺的说法，拉莫斯本人并没有要求太多的核实。幻影的政策之一是不收集客户姓名，但该公司的部分部门也不会核实最初是谁在销售手机。</p><p>  &#34;Lack of screening anyone who resold the product, lack of formal contracts based on jurisdictions,&#34; Bruno said. Bruno added that he had to make a contract for Ramos to sign and return because Phantom itself never got around to making one. Bruno provided Motherboard with a copy of the contract.</p><p>布鲁诺说，缺乏对转售产品的任何人的筛查，缺乏基于司法管辖区的正式合同。布鲁诺补充说，他必须为拉莫斯签订并回归一份合同，因为幻影本身从未抽出时间来制作一份合同。布鲁诺向母板公司提供了一份合同副本。</p><p>  &#34;As [Ramos] built the business, he didn&#39;t really know who he was dealing with,&#34; Ramos&#39; family member said. But ultimately, &#34;we knew there were probably some people who were getting it for more nefarious purposes.&#34;</p><p>拉莫斯的家人说，在[拉莫斯]建立业务的时候，他并不真正知道自己在和谁打交道。但最终，我们知道可能有一些人是为了更邪恶的目的而染上它的。</p><p>  And some distributors were clearly keen to sell Phantom&#39;s phones to criminals. &#34;I sold to people only that we&#39;re  [sic] recommended or were from the zoo,&#34; a worker who used to advertise Phantom devices online said, using a slang term for prison. &#34;That&#39;s how I kept law enforcement out; even if someone contacted my site, I wouldn&#39;t answer.&#34; This reseller also uploaded images with the phrase &#34;Snitches Get Stitches&#34; to their Instagram account.</p><p>一些分销商显然热衷于将Phantom&#39；的手机卖给犯罪分子。一位曾经在网上为幻影设备做广告的工作人员说，我只卖给我们推荐的人，或者是动物园的人。他说，这是一个俚语，意为监狱。这就是我把执法人员拒之门外的方法；即使有人联系我的网站，我也不会回答。这个经销商还把带有“告密者得到缝合”的图片上传到他们的Instagram账户。</p><p>  When Ramos would visit Bruno, he would be more interested in partying than sitting down to conduct business, Bruno said.</p><p>布鲁诺说，当拉莫斯访问布鲁诺时，他更感兴趣的是聚会，而不是坐下来做生意。</p><p>  &#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong. He was a super nice guy. Soft-spoken, friendly, and cool to be around. But I was always pushing for a more professional relationship. Instead I got a guy who wanted to hang out as bros and party,&#34; he added. Rather than looking to solve conflict or tackling problems head on, Ramos wanted to be everyone&#39;s friend, Bruno said.</p><p>别误会我的意思。他是个超级好人。说话轻声细语，友好，周围很酷。但我一直在推动一段更专业的关系。取而代之的是，我认识了一个想当兄弟和派对的人，他补充道。布鲁诺说，拉莫斯希望成为每个人的朋友，而不是寻求解决冲突或正面解决问题。</p><p>  &#34;It was a shit show how he ran the business,&#34; Bruno said. &#34;I warned him to take things more seriously, and to enforce some form of compliance as the carelessness of his actions and the actions of other distributors was bad for his company and myself and others.&#34;</p><p>布鲁诺说，这是一场狗屎表演，他是如何经营生意的。我警告他要更认真地对待事情，并强制执行某种形式的合规，因为他的行为和其他经销商的行为的粗心对他的公司和我自己以及其他人都是不利的。</p><p>  Ramos kept saying he wanted to be like Uber—just flood the market with devices and figure out regulations later, Bruno said. Soon, Phantom would have a monopoly over one country in particular.</p><p>布鲁诺说，拉莫斯一直说他想成为优步那样--只是用大量的设备涌入市场，稍后再制定监管规定。很快，幻影将特别垄断一个国家。</p><p>  A kilogram of cocaine in Australia can go for over eight times what it costs in the United States because of how difficult it is to smuggle drugs into the country. And top-level drug dealers needed a tool they could rely on and wouldn&#39;t let law enforcement listen in.</p><p>澳大利亚一公斤可卡因的价格是美国的八倍多，因为向该国走私毒品是非常困难的。而顶级毒贩需要一种他们可以依赖的工具，而且不会让执法部门监听。</p><p>    &#34;Uncrackable phones provided by Phantom Secure linked to murder of Hells Angels bikies,&#34; the  headline on a March 2014 ABC article read. The report said that Australian law enforcement agencies were unable to monitor the communications of powerful criminals because of their use of encrypted phones. Even the Australian Signals Directorate, the country&#39;s version of the NSA, could not break through the encryption, it added. Intelligence agencies often can&#39;t crack encryption itself—instead, they work around it by hacking phones or introducing vulnerabilities themselves—but prospective viewers didn&#39;t need to know that.</p><p>2014年3月，美国广播公司(ABC)的一篇文章的标题是：幻影安全公司(Phantom Secure)提供的不可破解手机与地狱天使自行车谋杀案有关。报道称，澳大利亚执法机构无法监控有权势的犯罪分子的通讯，因为他们使用的是加密手机。它补充说，即使是澳大利亚信号局(澳大利亚版的NSA)也无法破解加密。情报机构通常不能自己破解加密--相反，他们通过侵入电话或自己引入漏洞来解决这个问题--但潜在的观众不需要知道这一点。</p><p>  ABC also aired a TV-spot including interviews with cyber security experts explaining Phantom&#39;s remote wipe feature and how that could specifically help if law enforcement seized the phone, as well as how Phantom deletes credit card information after a customer has paid for their device.</p><p>美国广播公司还播放了一个电视广告，其中包括对网络安全专家的采访，解释了幻影的远程擦除功能，如果执法部门没收了手机，这项功能会有什么特别的帮助，以及幻影是如何在客户支付了设备费用后删除信用卡信息的。</p><p>  In the article, the outlet wrote that &#34;the ABC does not suggest the company itself is aware its products are being used by criminals, only that criminals have become aware of the phone&#39;s utility and have taken advantage.&#34; Phantom did not respond to a request for an interview from ABC at the time, the report added.</p><p>该媒体在文章中写道，ABC并没有暗示该公司本身知道其产品正被犯罪分子使用，只是说犯罪分子已经意识到了这款手机的用途，并利用了这一点。报道补充说，当时美国广播公司没有回应Phantom的采访请求。</p><p>    &#34;This is the best verification on what we have been saying all along—proven and effective for now over 9 years,&#34; Ramos wrote to a Phantom employee in a message after the article was published, according to a copy of the text published in court records. &#34;It is the highest level of official authority confirming our effectiveness. It can&#39;t get better than that.&#34; For Ramos, that criminals were using Phantom wasn&#39;t an issue, but a business opportunity. One Phantom reseller uploaded the ABC TV-spot to their own YouTube channel, promoting their devices.</p><p>根据法庭记录中公布的一份文本副本，这是对我们一直以来所说的最好的验证-9年多来被证明是有效的，拉莫斯在文章发表后给一名幻影员工的消息中写道。这是最高级别的官方权威，证实了我们的有效性。没有比这更好的了。对拉莫斯来说，犯罪分子使用幻影不是一个问题，而是一个商机。一个Phantom经销商将ABC的电视广告上传到他们自己的YouTube频道，宣传他们的设备。</p><p>    Phantom&#39;s use exploded in Australia, with distributors in the country selling the devices to criminals. Li Wang, one Phantom seller, had around 800 clients from different criminal networks, and his apartment was littered with BlackBerries, tens of thousands of dollars in cash, and meth, according to  Australian media reports.</p><p>幽灵在澳大利亚的使用呈爆炸式增长，该国的分销商将这种设备出售给犯罪分子。据澳大利亚媒体报道，幻影卖家李旺(音译)有大约800名客户，他们来自不同的犯罪网络，他的公寓里散落着黑莓、数万美元的现金和冰毒。</p><p>  Phantom distributors based all across the country were selling the phones, according to an FBI document obtained by Motherboard. Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, and other areas all had teams of people selling Phantom phones. The FBI document added that Phantom initially got a foothold in the country because it partnered with large scale drug traffickers—or &#34;influencers&#34;—who required anyone wishing to do business to also use a Phantom device.</p><p>根据Motherboard获得的一份FBI文件，全国各地的Phantom分销商都在销售这款手机。昆士兰、维多利亚州、新南威尔士州和其他地区都有销售幻影手机的团队。联邦调查局的文件补充说，幻影最初在美国站稳脚跟是因为它与大规模毒贩(或有影响力的人)合作，后者要求任何希望做生意的人也要使用幻影设备。</p><p>  One former Phantom distributor in Australia who is named in the FBI document told Motherboard that selling the phones &#34;was perfectly legal, our company was registered.&#34;</p><p>FBI文件中提到的一位前幻影在澳大利亚的经销商告诉主板，销售这些手机是完全合法的，我们的公司是注册的。</p><p>  The New South Wales Crime Commission, an Australian government body that aims to reduce organized crime in the region, wrote in  one of its annual reports that &#34;the prolific use of encrypted Blackberry devices continued unabated and, as in previous years, these devices were used to facilitate drug trafficking.&#34; Australia&#39;s national criminal intelligence agency  specifically named Phantom as a go-to choice for organized crime groups, as well as the encrypted messaging app Wickr.</p><p>旨在减少该地区有组织犯罪的澳大利亚政府机构新南威尔士州犯罪委员会在其一份年度报告中写道，加密黑莓设备的大量使用仍然有增无减，就像前几年一样，这些设备被用来为毒品交易提供便利。澳大利亚国家刑事情报机构特别将Phantom列为有组织犯罪集团的首选，加密通讯应用Wickr也是如此。</p><p>  One legal document obtained by Motherboard describes how lawyers for a Phantom seller had &#34;high level meetings with executive members of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) concerning Phantom Secure&#39;s operations in Australia.&#34; The letter is from several years after Phantom had already attracted the attention of Australian law enforcement.
