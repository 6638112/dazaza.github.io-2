", "note_en": "When we were dressing the original set for Agent Mulder\u2019s office on \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d I came up with the poster with a U.F.O. on it that reads \u201cI Want to Believe.\u201d And I think that\u2019s where most people come down on the whole extraterrestrial business. Not quite there yet, but waiting for a sign.\n The universe is just too vast for us to be alone in it. Carl Jung wanted to believe, as did Carl Sagan. Both wrote books on the subject.  Now videos from Navy aircraft tracking unidentified aerial phenomena (as they\u2019ve been relabeled) suggest that maybe  we have seen them. Based partly on the videos, a much-anticipated  government study on the topic landed in Congress on Friday. Answers were promised. But answers are always promised.\n I have never seen a U.F.O. or an alien, as much as I\u2019d like to. But as a result of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d I\u2019ve met many people who claim they have. I have seen grainy videos of gray aliens on someone\u2019s back patio. I know an award-winning movie director who told me straight-faced he\u2019d seen a U.F.O. when he was in college. Annie Jacobsen, the author of the terrific book \u201cArea 51,\u201d introduced me to a man who worked at that top secret facility for many years and saw strange craft coming and going on the air base. For a decade I became a magnet for this stuff.\n The plot of \u201cThe X-Files\u201d was built on a conspiracy theory: The government is lying to you about the existence of U.F.O.s and extraterrestrials. Do I believe the government lies to us? Absolutely. I\u2019m a child of Watergate. Do I believe in conspiracies? Certainly. I believe, for example, that someone is targeting C.I.A. agents and White House officials with microwave radiation, the so-called  Havana syndrome, and your government denied it.\n Can the new report, or any government report, give us clear answers? I\u2019m as skeptical now as I\u2019ve ever been.\n In 1996 I was invited to the clinic of the Harvard psychiatrist John Mack to witness the regression hypnosis of a self-professed alien abductee. I first met Dr. Mack, who studied and ultimately believed in alien abduction, when he came to Fox Studios to discuss his work. I had used a Roper survey he was involved in (a poll of 6000 Americans on their belief in the existence of extraterrestrials) to sell \u201cThe X-Files\u201d as a TV show in 1992, and later read his book, \u201cAbduction.\u201d So I knew something about what I was going to see. I went in doubtful, unprepared for the drama of a woman sitting next to me in tears and in terror over the encounter with aliens that she described, on a beach in Mexico. The experience turned out to be powerful and not a little unsettling.\n Years later I attended a  conference in San Mateo, Calif., that focused on a purported underground government program. Attendees believed that this program used, among other things, reverse-engineered technology from captured U.F.O.s to weaponize space. By outward appearances, these were respectable and accomplished professionals, including former government officials and lawyers. Some of them also believe that the military has hidden bases on the dark side of the moon and meet secretly there with reptilian aliens.\n This radical element has bedeviled high-minded \u201cufologists\u201d for decades and colored the public\u2019s perceptions of the phenomena. Many people are afraid to admit they believe for the real fear of being laughed at. (Fear itself may be the reason some of us refuse to believe that aliens exist at all.)\n We are living in times of uncertainty, where truth may be unknowable. I don\u2019t have to tell you this has bred a universe of rampant conspiracy theories. From the Covid conspiracy documentary \u201c Plandemic\u201d to the idea that  we\u2019re living in a black hole created by the CERN\u2019s Large Hadron Collider when we discovered the Higgs boson. Darin Morgan, a writer on \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d calls this the \u201cPost Conspiracy Era.\u201d PoCo \u2014 the industrialization of conspiracy theories. Rigorous science and scientists are castigated and vilified. Rigorous journalism is decried as fake news.\n \u201cThe Truth Is Out There,\u201d \u201cTrust No One,\u201d \u201cDeny Everything\u201d went the provocative catchphrases on \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d but that was in the \u201990s, when we had a relatively shared reality. The slogans are now a fact of life.\n In addition to the Navy videos, the reason U.F.O.s are getting their big moment is due to a bombshell  2017 article in this paper. The piece exposed a secret program inside the Department of Defense searching for the truth about U.F.O.s. The combined evidence engendered the government\u2019s recent report.\n But for me, the report on U.F.O.s was D.O.A. Ordered up by a bipartisan group of legislators during the Trump administration, the  interim report revealed nothing conclusive about U.F.O.s or their extraterrestrial origins. And the portions that remain classified will only fuel more conspiracy theories.\n This is \u201cX-Files\u201d territory if there ever was any. But it\u2019s also cause for some important questions.\n How did the Defense Department keep a budgeted project \u2014 sponsored principally by  Senator Harry Reid in 2007 \u2014 secret for 10 years? Why, when Mr. Reid sought even higher security \u2014 and asked to see physical evidence of U.F.O.s \u2014 was he denied? And why only a $22 million budget when looking for answers about sentient life visiting us from worlds far away? (That\u2019s roughly the cost of three episodes of the Netflix series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d)\n Ardent disbelievers have explained the latest Navy videos as  tricks of the eye \u2014 even though the fighter pilots describe the unidentified aerial phenomena, or U.A.P., in great detail as having no flight surfaces, no exhaust plumes, and the ability to perform impossible maneuvers at hypersonic speeds. This opposition, scientific and not, dates back to the 1940s, when a pilot,  Kenneth Arnold, saw nine \u201cflying disks\u201d over Mount Rainier.\n But the prosecution raises a good question: Where is the Deep Throat of the U.F.O. world? Why no credible deathbed confessions? As Enrico Fermi\u2019s  famous paradox asked, if aliens are out there, why haven\u2019t we seen them? Could the government actually be telling the truth that it really doesn\u2019t know what to make of the phenomena? Or is the truth above top secret?\n Curiously, Barack Obama, who once joked sarcastically about U.F.O.s on late night TV, is now admitting there are objects in the sky that can\u2019t be explained. Even Donald Trump, under whose aegis the latest study was cooked up, admits there may be something to it.\n I think in all likelihood this report will come and go, and with it the mainstream chatter around U.F.O.s, until definitive proof is exposed. A planet that can\u2019t come together on climate change or a global pandemic might not pay much attention even if wreckage or an alien corpse is discovered. The culture wars alone might eclipse it, so rabidly are we in their grips.\n But what if we had direct contact? With actual alien beings from an exoplanet who\u2019ve traveled light years to seek us out?

Free community support is available through the Rocky Linux  Mattermost,  IRC, and  forums. Paid commercial support is currently available through CIQ.\n        Corporations come and go, their interests as transient as they are self-serving. But a community persists, and that\u2019s who we dedicate Rocky Linux to: you.\n Rocky is more than the next free and open, community enterprise operating system. It\u2019s a community. A commitment to an ideal bigger than the sum of its parts, and a promise that our  principles\u2014embedded even within our repositories and ISOs\u2014are immutable.\n We\u2019d like to extend a special thanks to our sponsors and our partners, whose contribution of resources, financial backing, software, and infrastructure were all critical in supporting our efforts:\n  Each one brings something special to the community, and we\u2019re grateful for their support.\n  This is just the beginning, and the RESF is more than just Rocky Linux\u2014it\u2019s a home for those that believe that open source isn\u2019t just a switch that can be toggled at will, and that projects that many rely on not be subject to the whims of a few. To this point, you can easily find all of our sources, our build infrastructure, Git repositories, and everything else anyone would need to fork our work and ensure that it continues if need be. Expect more from the RESF in the coming weeks and months.\n When we announced our release candidate, we asked you to come build the next free, open, community enterprise operating system with us. Now we\u2019re asking you for more: join us as we build our community.\n \u201cWe set out to develop a free, open, community enterprise operating system that is bug-for-bug compatible with the upstream Enterprise Linux standard. What we built is so much more: a community.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:28:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

from the platform. This is just the latest in a shocking spike in attacks on unsuspecting gamers.\n Sony reportedly left a folder with every  PS3 console ID online unsecured, and it was discovered and reported by a Spanish YouTuber with the handle \u201cThe WizWiki\u201d in mid-April. Sony is depicted in his  reveal video as the hind end of a rhinoceros defecating, for a general idea of the reaction posted on April 18 for non-Spanish speakers.\n Now, several weeks later, players on PlayStation Network message boards are complaining that they can\u2019t sign on and are receiving the error message 8071006. After enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), one player was able to sign back in without issue, according to posts on the  PS3 subreddit, which includes a link to instructions on how to  opt into 2FA on the PS3.\n It appears threat actors have started using the stolen PS3 console IDs for malicious purposes, causing the legitimate players to get banned.\n Another player on the PSNProfies forum put the  stolen PS3 IDs and the ban together back on June 18.\n \u201cThis has just happened to me now, tried to sign in and it says the console has being banned or temporarily suspended,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cMy account is fine, I can log in on my other PS3, but my main PS3 has got a ban. I signed in fine about 2 hours ago and all I did was use Netflix.\u201d\n The player added that Sony should be doing more to explain the issue and stop it.\n \u2018If It\u2019s Not a Console ID Leak, What the Hell is Going On?\u2019\n \u201cThis is very worrying, if it\u2019s true that console IDs have been leaked then over the next few months, I think we will see a huge increase in this happening, I can\u2019t think of what Sony could do to stop this issue?\u201d the person wrote. \u201cIf it\u2019s not a console ID leak then what the hell is going on?\u201d\n Sony has not responded to Threatpost\u2019s request for comment or confirmed a connection between the PS3 ID breach and player reports of being locked out of the platform.\n \u201cWhile it has not yet been confirmed that a data leak of PS3 IDs is correlated with the user bans on the PS3 network, this underscores the importance for all businesses to ensure enterprise-wide visibility of this type of sensitive data, to enable the facilitation of more robust real time security controls,\u201d Kate Kuehn, researcher with vArmour, told Threatpost.\n She added that this an example of a company\u2019s lack of appropriate security protections and real-time visibility into their sensitive data.\n \u201cThere are many concerns around these console IDs being leaked, not the least the impact of potentially minor or underage user credentials being now out on the Dark Web,\u201d Kuehn added. \u201cThe main concern is once again, due to lack of proper application relationship management, mainstream personal data has again been potentially stolen with malicious intent.\u201d\n  Sony is hardly the only gaming company leaking data like a sieve. A report from January found a half a million  credentials stolen from the Top 25 gaming companies on caches of breached data for sale in criminal marketplaces. In June, the \u201cBattle of the Galaxy\u201d  mobile game leaked 6 million gamer profiles, and attackers are working out how to use  gaming platforms like Steam to host or deliver malware.\n And, coincidentally, Akamai released a report just this week showing that bored gamers stuck at home during the pandemic pushed the  rate of cyberattacks on the gaming industry up 340 percent in 2020.\n There\u2019s no cheat code required to get the idea that its past time for gaming to take cybersecurity more seriously.\n \u201cAs we have seen in recent weeks through attacks like this and the initiatives the government is enacting in response, implementing robust zero-trust architecture is key to mitigate the risks associated with critical data exploitations by bad actors, as we see potentially again playing out in this latest Sony PS3 case,\u201d Kuehn said.\n Join Threatpost for \u201c  Tips and Tactics for Better Threat Hunting \u201d \u2014 a LIVE event on\u00a0  Wed., June 30 at 2:00 PM ET \u00a0in partnership with Palo Alto Networks.

Known as  mesoscale convective systems, these storm complexes provide  up to 90 percent of the region&#39;s total annual rainfall.\n Their  intensity and frequency have been increasing, yet our best climate models still struggle to predict just how and when they&#39;ll arise.\n To help refine climate models for the Southern Great Plains, paleoclimatologist Christopher Maupin from Texas A&amp;M University and colleagues used oxygen and hydrogen isotopes to track the ferocity of past storms.\n Water molecules based on elements wielding an additional neutron or two tend to require a little more energy to vaporize, and release more energy as they condense. This leaves a clear signature in the ratios of isotopes separated by rainfall under various conditions.\n By comparing the results of analyses taken today with historic ratios of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes found trapped by stalactites in Texan caves, the researchers developed an accurate picture of weather events in the past.\n &#34;These thunderstorms are so big that even if most of the rain occurs in Oklahoma, rain in Texas will still carry isotopic signature of these huge storms,&#34;  said\u00a0Maupin.\n   &#34;You&#39;re fingerprinting these systems despite where they occur, and they don&#39;t have to be super localized to be recognized. Big storms cause depleted isotopic signatures.&#34;\n Using another set of isotopes, this time measuring those of uranium and thorium, the team dated the stalactites and stalagmites to around the last Ice Age, 30-50 thousand years ago.\n Measuring the shifts in oxygen and hydrogen isotopes down their lengths allowed the researchers to see the storms cycled from weakly to strongly organized, roughly every thousand years. The more strongly organized the complex of storms becomes, the more intense and damaging they are.\n They discovered these changes in thunderstorm intensities coincided with well-known, abrupt shifts in global climate, known as  Dansgaard\u2013Oeschger events.\n The researchers also found these intensity increases coincide with a reduction in rain in southwestern US and greater atmospheric upwelling in the Santa Barbara Basin area.\n They believe the observed pattern suggests an increased frequency or intensity of the giant global atmospheric waves that drive the weather, called  Rossby waves, may be providing the extra lift needed to fuel these greater storms.\n   &#34;Modern anthropogenic climate forcing has increasingly favored an amplification of these  synoptic factors,&#34;  the team wrote in their paper.\n &#34;This work will help predict trends of storms in the future,&#34;  explained\u00a0geoscientist Courtney Schumacher.\n &#34;If we can run a climate model for the past which is consistent with cave records, and run that same model moving forward, we can trust its findings more if it matched the cave records versus if they didn&#39;t. Out of two models, if one really matches the cave isotopes then you can trust that one in understanding storm distribution in the future.&#34;\n These findings can have potential practical applications too, says geologist and civil engineer Audrey Housson, who contributed to the research as an undergraduate:\u00a0Understanding the correlation between  climate change and weather can help us better plan for important infrastructure in the future, including water resources.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:26:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20,stalactites", "title": "\u949f\u4e73\u77f3\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u96f7\u66b4\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5168\u7403\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5f02\u6027 ", "title_en": "Isotopes in Stalactites May Link Intensifying Thunderstorms to Global Climate Variability", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/increasing-thunderstorm-intensities-have-been-linked-to-abrupt-shifts-in-past-climates", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u540c\u4f4d\u7d20"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "806292900a15ee9ff82a8b2aab06d08b.jpeg", "infoid": 1068581, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "U.K.\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u5f53\u5c40\u5728\u6700\u5927\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ea4\u6362\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u540c\u76df\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u5173\u8054\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u65b0\u76d1\u7ba1\u9547\u538b\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u75af\u72c2\u8d38\u6613\u3002\n  \u8be5\u56fd\u503a\u6743\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u7684U.K.\u91d1\u878d\u884c\u4e3a\u6388\u6743\u544a\u8bc9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u661f\u671f\u516d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f53\u5730\u90e8\u95e8\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0e\u53d7\u7ba1\u5236\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u6d3b\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u3002\n  \u4e8c\u672c\u884c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u671f\u8d27\u7b49\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u884d\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u7684U.K. ARM\uff0c\u6b66\u88c5\u90e8\u961f\uff0c\u80a1\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u7533\u8bf7\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u884c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u5e76\u57285\u670817\u65e5\u64a4\u56de\u5176\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n  \u201c\u5c11\u6570\u52a0\u5bc6\u9057\u4f20\u5546\u5bb6\u672a\u5728\u6d17\u94b1\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6240\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u201d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u7684\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u5230\u65e5\u671f\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc790\uff05\u7684\u4ecb\u7ecd\u540e\u64a4\u56de\u4e86\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\u201d\n  \u65e5\u672c\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7763\u5458\u4e8e6\u670825\u65e5\u53d1\u8868\u9648\u8ff0\uff0c\u79f0\uff0c\u4e8c\u660e\u56e2\u672a\u5728\u8be5\u56fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n  \u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\uff08\u5982\u679c\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u7387\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002 ", "note_en": "Authorities in the U.K. and Japan took aim at affiliates of Binance Holdings Ltd., the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange network, in the latest regulatory crackdown on the wildly popular trade in bitcoin and other digital assets.\n  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the country\u2019s lead financial regulator, told consumers Saturday that Binance\u2019s local unit wasn\u2019t permitted to conduct operations related to regulated financial activities.\n  Binance offers trading of cryptocurrencies and derivatives linked to them such as futures.

Supreme Court ruled Friday in a Houston case that Facebook is not a \u201clawless no-man\u2019s-land\u201d and can be held liable for the conduct of pimps who use its technology to recruit and prey on children.\n   The ruling came in a trio of Houston civil actions involving teenage trafficking victims who met their abusive pimps through Facebook\u2019s messaging functions. They sued the California-based social media juggernaut for negligence and product liability, saying that Facebook failed to warn about or attempt to prevent sex trafficking from taking place on its internet platforms. The suits also alleged that Facebook benefited from the sexual exploitation of trafficking victims.\n  The justices said trafficking victims can move forward with lawsuits on the grounds that Facebook violated a provision of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code passed in 2009.\n  Facebook lawyers argued the company was shielded from liability under Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which states that what users say or write online is not akin to a publisher conveying the same message. Essentially, they said, Facebook is immune to these types of lawsuits.\n  The majority wrote, \u201cWe do not understand Section 230 to \u2018create a lawless no-man\u2019s-land on the Internet\u2019 in which states are powerless to impose liability on websites that knowingly or intentionally participate in the evil of online human trafficking.\u201d\n  \u201cHolding internet platforms accountable for the words or actions of their users is one thing, and the federal precedent uniformly dictates that Section 230 does not allow it,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cHolding internet platforms accountable for their own misdeeds is quite another thing. This is particularly the case for human trafficking.\u201d\n   The justices explained that Congress recently amended Section 230 to add the possibility of civil liability for websites that violate state and federal human-trafficking laws. They said under the amended law states may protect residents from internet companies that knowingly or intentionally participate in human trafficking through their action or inaction.\n  The  lawsuits were brought by three Houston women recruited as teens through Facebook apps and trafficked as a result of those online connections. The young women said in court filings that the social media giant cloaked traffickers with credibility and provided \u201ca point of first contact between sex traffickers and these children\u201d and \u201can unrestricted platform to stalk, exploit, recruit, groom, and extort children into the sex trade.\u201d\n    One young woman who sued was 15 when a friend of a mutual friend reached out to her on Facebook in 2012. The adult who began messaging her had images on his profile of \u201cscantily-clad young women in sexual positions\u201d with money stuffed in their mouths and \u201cother deeply troubling content,\u201d the justices wrote. She confided in him and he complimented her, offering her a modeling job. After they met in person, the trafficker posted photos of her in prostitution ads on Backpage, an online platform shuttered due to its promotion of human trafficking. The young woman said she was \u201craped, beaten, and forced into further sex trafficking.\u201d\n   Another plaintiff was 14 in 2017 when a man contacted her on Instagram, another Facebook property. The pimp in this instance lured her with \u201cfalse promises of love and a better future.\u201d She said the easy access to her through social media made it possible for the man to traffic her, using Instagram to advertise her as a prostitute and set up \u201cdates,\u201d during which she was raped numerous times. After the teen was rescued from his operation, traffickers kept using her profile to lure in other minors, according to the ruling. In this case the family says the girl\u2019s mother reported what had happened to Facebook and the company never responded.\n  The third girl who sued identified herself as being 14 on Instagram in 2016. A man of about 30 whom she didn\u2019t know sent her a friend request on Instagram. They exchanged messages for two years in what plaintiffs said was a calculated effort to \u201cgroom\u201d her and prepare her for sex-trafficking. In March 2018, the man asked the teen to leave home and meet him. He brought the girl to a motel, photographed her and posted images in Backpage ads, according to the opinion. The johns who responded to the post raped her.\n       Annie McAdams, a lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said it was a groundbreaking decision. This is the first case to beat Facebook on its argument that it had immunity under Section 230, she said.\n   \u201cWhile we have a long road ahead, we are grateful that the Texas Supreme Court will allow these courageous trafficking survivors to have their day in court against Facebook,\u201d McAdams said. She said with the help of an anti-trafficking provision under the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code called Chapter 98, \u201cWe believe trafficking survivors in Texas can expose and hold accountable businesses such as Facebook that benefit from these crimes of exploitation.\u201d\n  A Facebook spokesperson said in a statement that the company is considering possible next steps.\n  \u201cSex trafficking is abhorrent and not allowed on Facebook,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe will continue our fight against the spread of this content and the predators who engage in it.\u201d\n  Gabrielle Banks covers federal court for the Houston Chronicle.

People love the concept of the back-up camera or automatic parking. Other, more opaque features like rear cross-traffic alert (which needs a definition to understand) didn\u2019t register as much interest.\n   More people are concerned about autonomous vehicles than they are excited. It\u2019ll take more convincing and safety assurances to get people involved.\n  People have expectations for how they plan on using autonomous cars, so those cars should cater to those expectations and use those expectations to clarify the benefits of owning or using AV tech.\n Consumers feel that Tesla is most likely to develop safe AV tech, but at the same time, consumers are  also\u00a0more likely to lose trust in a brand that overpromises and underdelivers.\n   It is important to note that fully-autonomous technology is  not available right now. We don\u2019t have that technology. We aren\u2019t really close to having that technology. All driver assist systems on the market right now require a degree of human input and monitoring to function smoothly \u2014 so this autonomous future is still quite a few years away.\n Weekends at Jalopnik.

adjusted and would benefit more people and traffic than private autonomous cars", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:25:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Almost everyone had been working at home since the firm was started in spring 2020, so when the founder, Chris James, went into the office for a rare visit on May 26 this year to watch the results during Exxon Mobil\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, he propped his computer up on a rented desk. As an activist investor, he had bought millions of dollars\u2019 worth of shares in Exxon Mobil to put forward four nominees to the board. His candidates needed to finish in the top 12 of the 16 up for election, and he was nervous. Since December, James and the firm\u2019s head of active engagement, Charlie Penner, had been making their case that America\u2019s most iconic oil company needed new directors to help it thrive in an era of mounting climate urgency. In response, Exxon Mobil expanded its board to 12 directors from 10 and announced a $3 billion investment in a new initiative it called Low Carbon Solutions. James paced around the empty office and texted Penner: \u201cI was doing bed karate this morning thinking about how promises made at gunpoint are rarely kept. Exxon only makes promises at gunpoint.\u201d\n  At his apartment in TriBeCa, Penner, who had conceived and run the campaign since its inception, was obsessively focused on making sure that even the last moments before the annual meeting were used strategically. For weeks he had kept a tally of whom he thought big shareholders would back, but because they could change their votes until the polls closed there would be no certainty until the end. He had stayed up late the previous night writing a speech to give during the five minutes he was allotted to address shareholders, scribbling in longhand in a spiral notebook. He was hearing from major investors that the company was mounting a last-minute push, calling shareholders to swing the vote in its favor.\n Penner took a quick shower and sat down at his desk for his speech. He had been sitting at the same spot since the start of the pandemic, holding virtual meetings to drum up support for Engine No. 1\u2019s four nominees. Doubling down on fossil fuels as society tries to decarbonize was only one criticism he levied against Exxon Mobil; he also underscored the company\u2019s declining profitability and the fact that, when the campaign started, no one on the board had experience in the energy industry. When the meeting began, Penner was the first shareholder to speak. \u201cRather than being open to the idea of adding qualified energy experience to its board, we believe Exxon Mobil once again closed ranks,\u201d he said. Driving humanity off a cliff wasn\u2019t good business practice anymore, he added, and shareholders knew it.\n  Forty minutes after the meeting started, Exxon Mobil called for an hourlong recess. It was an unusual move; shareholders couldn\u2019t remember the company suspending an annual meeting right in the middle of the proceedings. It had been a bruising year for the industry, with oil prices trading negative last spring and record numbers of shareholder votes pressing major, publicly traded petroleum companies to prepare for a zero-carbon world. Just that morning, as the meeting was starting, the news broke that a Dutch court had declared that Shell must accelerate its emissions-reduction efforts. As Exxon Mobil\u2019s meeting was underway, so was Chevron\u2019s, and shareholders there voted in favor of a proposal to reduce the emissions generated by the company\u2019s product, which would call for a re-evaluation of the core business. Exxon Mobil\u2019s management had appeared confident about the activist threat, but in the last moments of the battle, it seemed that assurance was flagging.\n During the break, company management and sitting board members continued making calls to some of the largest investors. Exxon Mobil said it was explaining to shareholders how to vote. The Engine No. 1 crew, huddled around laptops in their office or alone in front of their screens across the country, started speculating about what was going on \u2014 they suspected that Exxon Mobil executives saw the vote counts coming in and wanted to buy themselves time to try to make up for a shortfall. Penner texted James and told him to get an Exxon Mobil board member on the phone. \u201cSeriously, tie them up if you can,\u201d he wrote. Engine No. 1 sent out a statement criticizing the company for using \u201ccorporate machinery\u201d to undercut the process. James was incredulous.  Is this legal? he kept thinking.  Can they really do this? An Engine No. 1 public-relations adviser started shouting on the phone at a CNBC producer who didn\u2019t seem to be sufficiently appreciating the significance of the moment. A few minutes later,  Penner went live on air. \u201cThis is classic skulduggery,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not the way to move this company forward.\u201d\n  When the meeting reconvened, Exxon Mobil\u2019s chief executive, Darren Woods, sounded hoarse and weary. He took questions for nearly an hour and then abruptly stopped talking so that the election results could be announced. Almost all the people at Engine No. 1 had their heads in their hands, and they went still while the list was read. One of their candidates, Greg Goff, was an oilman who had led a smaller refining company to legendary profitability and thought that mitigating environmental harm was part of corporate responsibility. Goff was elected. So was Kaisa Hietala, a former vice president for renewable energy at Neste, a Finnish petroleum company.\n But Penner started shaking his head in exasperation \u2014 what about the other two candidates? Andy Karsner, an energy entrepreneur, was still in the running; the vote was too close to call. Anders Runevad, a former wind-power chief executive, was out. Penner didn\u2019t have the final tally, but it was now clear that  at least two seats had been wrested from management. Engine No. 1 had gained a foothold at the board of Exxon Mobil based largely on the strength of its argument that failing to plan for the impact of climate change could spell the demise of a business. Penner, usually subdued, raised a clenched fist.\n  In the corporate world, successful proxy battles are the equivalent of shareholder insurrection. Usually motivated by displeasure with management, activist investors in a company can put forward proposals, including board candidates, to be voted on at companies\u2019 annual meetings. Investors have taken activist stances in their companies at least since a shareholder named Isaac Le Maire started complaining about money management at the Dutch East India Company in 1609. But the practice was weaponized in the United States during the 1980s, when a set of ambitious moneymakers conducted what were eventually called corporate raids, intended to pump up the value of a company\u2019s stock even if that meant carving up the business.\n  Famous activist investors, like Carl Icahn or Bill Ackman, are often seen as predatory, but they are skilled at reading a company\u2019s vulnerabilities and marshaling shareholder dissatisfaction. Because recruiting and putting forward a slate of candidates is expensive and time-consuming, though, investors often try to engage with a company behind the scenes before initiating proxy battles for board seats. \u201cIn terms of corporate America, it\u2019s very aggressive,\u201d said Jeff Gramm, author of the 2016 book \u201cDear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism.\u201d Companies have been known to respond with comparable aggression, holding annual meetings in remote locations or adjourning them suddenly to stifle dissent.\n While activist investing typically focuses on a company\u2019s financials, socially minded investors have used the levers available to them to press for fairer business practices. Shareholders need to hold only a small stake in a company to put forward a resolution, but disputed proposals have to be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has rules limiting shareholder influence over day-to-day business operations. Depending on the disposition of a company\u2019s management, though, sometimes even a small amount of shareholder disquiet is enough to change a company\u2019s behavior. In 1969, a civil rights organization of doctors and nurses filed a proposal at the Dow Chemical Company to stop selling napalm for use as a weapon; the S.E.C. backed the company\u2019s decision to block the proposal from reaching the annual meeting. Dow stopped producing napalm for the U.S. military that year.\n In the past few years, an increasing number of proposals have aimed to pressure large corporations, and especially oil-and-gas companies, to respond to climate change; more than 1,600 such proposals have been filed since 2010. Of those, less than half were put to a vote, and just a tiny sliver gained majority support; even successful resolutions are nonbinding, so companies can still dismiss them afterward. But when an activist wins board seats, companies have to choke back their dissatisfaction and accept their new directors.\n Because the rules for filing a shareholder proposal are different in Europe, generally requiring a bigger stake in the company but not dependent on approval by a regulator, investors have submitted more ambitious climate proposals at the major oil companies there. In 2015, a Dutch activist named Mark van Baal started raising money to buy shares in Shell, and the next year, he went in front of shareholders with demands that the company invest its profits in renewable energy and \u201ctake the lead in creating a world without fossil fuels.\u201d\n The resolution convinced only 2.7 percent of Shell shareholders, but van Baal returned again with a proposal to put the company\u2019s trajectory in line with the goals set out in the Paris climate accord \u2014 the 2015 global agreement committing countries to aim to keep global temperatures below a 1.5-degree-Celsius increase and not allow them to rise more than a maximum of two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels \u2014 and this one garnered 6.3 percent shareholder support. Van Baal saw his approach as an incremental slow burn; as his proposals gained more support at each annual meeting, companies had little choice but to respond and adapt. Last year, many of the major European oil companies, including BP, Shell and Total, said they intended to cut carbon-dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050.\n At Engine No. 1, Penner was sensitive to coming across as a fire-breathing activist investor during the Exxon Mobil campaign. But the core of his argument rested on mobilizing shareholders with classic activist tactics: focusing on the company\u2019s financials, underscoring its flagging profitability and setting out an argument for how to raise the value of the company\u2019s stock by making smarter expenditures. He didn\u2019t aim to undercut the core business necessarily; rather than urging Exxon Mobil to give up all oil and gas, he wanted the company to practice what finance people like to call \u201ccapital discipline,\u201d which basically just means not spending prodigiously. He also reasoned that, given mounting pressure from society and governments to decarbonize the global economy, it would be strategically smarter for Exxon Mobil to be part of an energy transition, rather than letting itself be outstripped by other companies innovating to meet demand for low-carbon power. There might still be money in oil now, but Penner and James wanted to convince shareholders that the key to profitability involved taking a longer view on the health of the business.\n That argument reflected the changing nature of investment and the increasingly powerful role that large funds play in corporate decisions. Three of the largest asset managers, BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, own nearly 20 percent of Exxon Mobil. Big pension funds, including the California and New York state funds, also own stakes in the company. The New York state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, said that the basis of his fund\u2019s engagement with Exxon Mobil was about making sure that its investments would remain fiscally sound over the next 100 years. Once a portfolio is big enough, the risk exacerbated by one part can also start threatening other positions. \u201cDiversification is meant to be one of our risk-management tools,\u201d said Anne Simpson, managing investment director of California\u2019s state pension fund. \u201cBut if you\u2019re facing systemic risk, you can run, but you can\u2019t hide. In other words, we can decide not to hold a company that\u2019s producing emissions \u2014 that\u2019s the divestment case. However, if the emissions continue, we\u2019re still exposed to the risk of climate change.\u201d\n In many ways, Exxon Mobil had made itself an ideal target. Before the proxy battle started, the company\u2019s directors were primarily former chief executives from other industries like pharmaceuticals and insurance. With plans to increase oil-and-gas production by 25 percent over the next five years, the company seemed out of step with the market. Profitability had already been slipping for a decade. Exxon Mobil earned the largest annual profit in U.S. history in 2008 and nearly eclipsed that record in 2012; last year it lost $22 billion.\n In part, the loss was due to a historic $19 billion write-down on the value of its assets. That assessment may still be too rosy;  a whistle-blower reportedly told the S.E.C. in January that Exxon Mobil had overvalued its assets by at least $56 billion, in part by pressuring employees to inflate expectations about the drilling timelines in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, which remains the company\u2019s U.S. cash cow. (Exxon Mobil called the claims \u201cdemonstrably false.\u201d) Although it managed to keep shareholders\u2019 dividends intact \u2014 mostly by cutting costs, including announcing thousands of layoffs \u2014 the company\u2019s stock value plunged in 2020 by 40 percent, its market valuation taking a $120 billion drop. The company has more than $60 billion in debt, borrowed to fund purchases of its own stock to buoy its price and to pay out stockholder dividends. Despite the buybacks, and a significant improvement in the stock\u2019s value since late last year, it is still nearly 30 percent lower than it was five years ago. After almost a century on the Dow Jones industrial average, the corporation that descended from John D. Rockefeller\u2019s Standard Oil was replaced last August by a tech company.\n Chris James, the lanky and energetic 51-year-old founder of Engine No. 1, didn\u2019t establish his firm to go after Exxon Mobil. A tech investor who speaks in the parlance of Silicon Valley start-up culture, James decided in 2019 to abandon his hedge fund and seek to reconcile what he saw as an uncomfortable tension between the consequences of his work and his volunteering at a San Francisco homelessness nonprofit. On a hunting trip near his cattle ranch near Jackson, Wyo., James decided to go into impact investing and start a new firm dedicated to reimagining the concept of value. The firm would create an E.T.F., or exchange-traded fund, and then vote actively in favor of positive measures at the companies included in it. It would also have a private offering. For James, the goal was to build something that could convey his belief that the effect a company had on society would determine its long-term success. He was influenced by  a 2017 paper by the economists Oliver Hart and Luigi Zingales that rejected Milton Friedman\u2019s canonical argument,  published in 1970 in this magazine, that companies should focus exclusively on making money; they instead posited that shareholder welfare includes more than just market worth.\n A few months later, in late 2019, James met Penner, now 48, at his office in New York City, having been introduced through a mutual acquaintance. Studious and analytical, Penner had just come off an activist campaign he led as a hedge-fund partner, pressuring Apple to improve parental controls on its smartphones. He also led an effort, resolved privately, to persuade McDonald\u2019s to offer plant-based burgers. A committed campaigner with a deep sense of what he thought constituted right action, Penner had already set his sights on Exxon Mobil, and he was talking to investors who might be interested in taking on the oil company. James told Penner he should join his new firm, which hadn\u2019t yet opened, and spearhead a proxy contest. Penner left his job at Jana Partners, a hedge fund in New York, and joined James in spring 2020. They would take until December to find nominees for the board and articulate a strategy to persuade shareholders. Penner already sensed that Exxon Mobil was an industry outlier, more reluctant than others to recognize that if the world enacted the emissions reductions that its governments had committed to, there would be no viable business for a publicly traded oil company in 30 years.\n \u2018Do you know how you\u2019re going to fulfill your business plan without burning down the planet?\u2019 Penner asked.\n As they planned the campaign, James retreated from San Francisco to his ranch and spent the summer learning about what it would mean to rejigger the way society powers itself. What he found astounded him. As a tech investor, he was used to innovations growing on an S-curve, with a long tail of early adopters that suddenly became mainstream. Through conversations with experts, researchers and power-grid operators, he began to see potential energy-sector S-curves everywhere. Grids often rely on natural gas to help bridge over times of peak energy consumption, for example, but James talked to experts who said battery technology had advanced enough that it was poised to replace gas by storing renewably produced energy for later use. Internal-combustion engines in cars waste around 75 percent of the energy produced burning gasoline. James became convinced that, because electric vehicles use energy much more efficiently, they would simply beat out everything else in the market. He had initially thought that, optimistically, maybe half the cars on roads would be electric in the next two decades; now he revised it up to at least 80 percent. \u201cAt a price point in the energy transition,\u201d James said, \u201cadoption could just explode.\u201d\n One of the most difficult parts of building a system powered by something other than hydrocarbons is that it\u2019s not clear what technology will outpace others in the market; from the perspective of oil executives, that means any particular path is fraught with potentially costly missteps. Companies like Exxon Mobil have more readily committed to reducing emissions intensity by lowering the amount of carbon released per unit of gas or oil than agreed to reduce absolute emissions. Still, in order to keep global warming under certain thresholds, there\u2019s only so much more carbon dioxide that can be emitted into the atmosphere. According to most experts, annual carbon emissions must start declining in the next few years, be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 in order to stay within that budget. But in the largest areas of fossil-fuel consumption, which include transportation, buildings, industrial manufacturing and power generation, there are still unresolved problems about how to decarbonize.\n Because the cost of wind and solar power has fallen so much over the last 10 years, to the point that they can compete with natural gas and coal, converting power grids to renewable energy and then electrifying as much as possible is one of the most popular routes to zero carbon. The approach could work in transportation with electric vehicles, but also in buildings, if gas-and-oil-consuming appliances and heating systems are systematically replaced with electrics and heat pumps. That would mean substituting the notion of energy efficiency, which still ultimately relies on fossil fuels, with the goal of emissions efficiency. \u201cThe shorthand for decarbonization is\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:24:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u5b5a,mobil", "title": "\u57c3\u514b\u68ee\u7f8e\u5b5a\u5728\u80a1\u4e1c\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u53d7\u5230\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u6311\u6218 ", "title_en": "Exxon Mobil Challenged by Activist Investors at Its Shareholder Meeting", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/magazine/exxon-mobil-engine-no-1-board.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u5b5a", "mobil"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c9bba27666a4b9d99cc07369363491b6.jpg", "infoid": 1068576, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u6355\u98df\u8005\u6740\u6b7b\u6d77\u9e1f\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u5c9b\u5c7f\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u6fd2\u4e34\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u3002\n \u5c11\u6570\u9b54\u9b3c\u88ab\u8fd0\u5f80\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e1c\u90e8\u7684\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\uff0c2012\u5e74\u3002\n \u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u514d\u53d7\u81f4\u547d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u9677\u5165\u706d\u7edd\u3002\n  \u5bf9\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u9b54\u9b3c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\uff06\uff0334;\u6839\u636e\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n  \u5f15\u7528\u653f\u5e9c\u8c03\u67e5\uff0cBirdlife Tasmania\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e00\u7fa4\u5c0f\u4f01\u9e45\uff0c2012\u5e74\u7f16\u53f73,000\u5bf9\u80b2\u79cd\u5bf9\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c9b\u5c7f\u4e0a\u4e22\u59313,000\u5bf9\u4f01\u9e45\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u516c\u56ed\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7269\u79cd\u7684\u907f\u96be\uff0c\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6253\u51fb\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u96c6\u56e2\u7814\u7a76\u5458\u57c3\u91cc\u514b\u00b7\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\u3002\n \u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u5f15\u5165\u6d77\u6d0b\u5c9b\u5c7f\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u5947\u602a\u3002 \n2011\u5e74\uff0c\u7531\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u4e3b\u8981\u4ea7\u4e1a\u90e8\uff0c\u516c\u56ed\uff0c\u6c34\u548c\u73af\u5883\u90e8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4efd\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9b54\u9b3c\u4f1a\u6709\uff06\uff0334;\u5bf9\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u7684\u5c0f\u4f01\u9e45\u548c\u7267\u8349\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd;\n \u53bb\u5e74\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u4fdd\u62a4\u671f\u520a\u4e0a\u53d1\u8868\u7684\u6587\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u6709\uff06\uff0334;\u6d88\u9664\uff06\uff0334;\u7267\u7f8a\u72ac\u6b96\u6c11\u5730\uff0c\u4e00\u53ea\u6d77\u9e1f\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u975e\u5e38\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u5bf9\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e0a\u7684\u9e1f\u7c7b\u52a8\u7269\u7fa4\u4f53\u6709\u707e\u96be\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6001\u5f71\u54cd;\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\u3002\n   \u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u907f\u514d\u6355\u83b7\u764c\u75c7\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u751f\u6d3b\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e94\u5e74\n  \u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\u88ab\u62ef\u6551\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u8ba1\u5212\uff08STDP\uff09\uff0c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u548c\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5021\u8bae\u642c\u5230\u4e86\u5c9b\u5c7f\u3002\n  \u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7531IUCN\u7ea2\u8272\u5217\u8868\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u4e3a\u6fd2\u4e34\u706d\u7edd\u7684\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u52a8\u7269\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u72b6\u51b5\u4e0a\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u3002\n \u4f46\u6c83\u5c14\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u5728\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u5927\u9646\u6062\u590d\u8fc7\uff0c\u9b54\u9b3c\u5728\u4e0a\u4e2a\u6708\u51e0\u5343\u5e74\u4e2d\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u751f\u3002 \n\u636e\u9274\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u6c83\u970d\u52d2\u535a\u58eb\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ece\u739b\u4e3d\u4e9a\u5c9b\u4e0a\u5220\u9664\u54fa\u4e73\u52a8\u7269\uff06\uff0334;\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4e0d\u5229\u540e\u679c\u3002  \u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u653f\u5e9c\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\uff06\uff0334;\u7ee7\u7eed\u7b26\u5408\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u65b0\u5174\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u7684\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\uff0334;

said Dr Eric Woehler, a researcher for the group.\n Dr Woehler said the outcome was no surprise given what research shows about the introduction of mammals to oceanic islands.\n  In 2011, a report by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment suggested the introduction of devils would have &#34;a negative impact on little penguin and shearwater colonies on Maria Island&#34;.\n Last year,  a paper published in the Biological Conservation journal said the devils had &#34;eliminated&#34; a colony of shearwater, a species of sea bird.\n &#34;It&#39;s very clear that the devils have had a catastrophic ecological impact on the bird fauna on Maria Island,&#34; Dr Woehler said.\n   They can live for more than five years in the wild, if they avoid catching cancer\n  The mammals were moved to the island under the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program (STDP), a joint initiative of the Australian and Tasmanian governments.\n  Tasmanian devils are classified as an endangered species by  the IUCN Red List, which keeps a database on the conservation status of animals.\n But Dr Woehler said their numbers had recovered in Tasmania and on the Australian mainland, where devils were born for the first time in thousands of years last month.\n  Given this, Dr Woehler said removing the mammals from Maria Island would &#34;not have any adverse consequences for the devil&#34;.\n A Tasmanian government spokesperson said the programme would &#34;continue to evolve in line with new knowledge in science and emerging priorities&#34;.\n However, the spokesperson said, &#34;Maria Island remains an important part of the broader devil programme to help restore and maintain an enduring and resilient wild devil population in Tasmania.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:24:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a,protect,\u9b54\u9b3c", "title": "\u4fdd\u62a4\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a\u9b54\u9b3c\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u5c9b\u672c\u7684\u4f01\u9e45\u4eba\u53e3 ", "title_en": "Effort To Protect Tasmanian Devils Devastates Island's Penguin Population", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-57558396", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5854\u65af\u9a6c\u5c3c\u4e9a", "protect", "\u9b54\u9b3c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b5e8a7cba9e21c1c6d825d160c30ae88.jpeg", "infoid": 1068575, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\uff08CNN\uff09\u4f60\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u54ea\u91cc\uff0c\u706b\u661f\u806a\u660e\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\uff1f\u867d\u7136\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u5c0f\u65a9\u6ce2\u5668\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b89\u9759\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u73ed - \u751a\u81f3\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u90ca\u6e38\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee4\u4eba\u8ba8\u538c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n \u6839\u636eTeddy Tzanetos\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c4\u78c5\u7684\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u5730\u98de\u884c\u4e86\u516b\u6b21Mars\uff0c\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u8fd0\u8425\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u5e15\u8428\u8fea\u7eb3\u7684\u55b7\u5c04\u63a8\u8fdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3002\n \u5728\u5176\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u90ca\u6e38\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u7684\u98de\u5411\u5357\u90e8\u548c\u4e1c\u5357\u90e8\u7684525\u82f1\u5c3a\uff08160\u7c73\uff09\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u573a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u8fde\u7fd8\uff06\uff0339;\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e2a\u822a\u73ed\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u6f14\u793a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u6b63\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4fa6\u5bdf\u7684\u6709\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5e72\u6270\u575a\u6301\u4e0d\u61c8\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u7ad9\uff06\uff0339;\u79d1\u5b66\u4f7f\u547d - \u5bfb\u627e\u706b\u661f\u4e0a\u53e4\u4ee3\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\n         \u806a\u660e\u624d\u667a\u7ee7\u7eed\u505a\u5f97\u597d\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u8ba1\u5212\u8ba1\u5212\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u822a\u73ed\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u505a\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u7684\u9ebb\u70e6\uff06\uff0334;\u770b\u95e8\u72d7\uff06\uff0334;\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u5f97\u5230\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u5728\u7b2c\u516b\u6b21\u98de\u884c\u524d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u3002\n  \u770b\u95e8\u72d7\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u751f\u5728Engenuity\uff06\uff0339;

While it seems like the little chopper has been quiet, it turns out that Ingenuity has aced more of its flights -- and even got a software update to fix an annoying issue that impacted some of its previous outings.\n The 4-pound helicopter has successfully flown eight times on Mars as of June 21, according to an update from  Teddy Tzanetos, the helicopter operations lead at NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\n On its latest outing, Ingenuity flew 525 feet (160 meters) to the south and southeast to a new airfield. This was the copter&#39;s third flight of the operations demo phase, in which Ingenuity is proving its usefulness as an aerial scout without interfering with the  Perseverance rover&#39;s science mission -- searching for evidence of ancient life on Mars.\n         Ingenuity continues to do well, and the team is planning for more flights that will push its capabilities. And the helicopter is doing even better now that its troublesome &#34;watchdog&#34; software issue has been fixed. That was deployed before the eighth flight.\n  The watchdog issue occurred before Ingenuity&#39;s first flight in April. Essentially, this watchdog timer acts like a safe mode when it detects a timing issue, preventing the helicopter&#39;s software from moving into flight mode and allowing the chopper blades to reach full speed or ascend.\n While a temporary workaround was developed to bypass this issue, it was still possible that the watchdog timer would go off 15% of the time.\n Last week, the helicopter&#39;s team successfully deployed a flight software update to Ingenuity to permanently fix the issue, providing more reliability as future flights are planned.\n &#34;Flight 8 confirmed that the FC flight software update was a success and that Ingenuity is ready to proceed with confidence into the next flights of the ops demo,&#34; according to an update from Tzanetos.\n   Ingenuity is also due for a navigation computer software update that will fix the issue that occurred during the chopper&#39;s sixth flight. Images captured by the navigation camera, which feed into the helicopter&#39;s navigation computer, had timing delays. Those images help Ingenuity to track its location, among other critical factors during flight. When the incorrect times and images were associated, it caused the chopper to wobble in the air.\n Sign up for CNN&#39;s Wonder Theory science newsletter.  Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n  Ingenuity was able to land safely, but the team wants to prevent the issue from happening again so the chopper doesn&#39;t spiral out of control. It&#39;s also why the helicopter didn&#39;t capture any color images during its last two flights.\n    &#34;This update will provide a mechanism for the Helicopter to detect and correct when image timestamps in the pipeline become out-of-synch/are dropped/skipped, while also re-enabling the capture of high-resolution 13-megapixel color images. This update is planned to occur in the coming days, followed by Ingenuity&#39;s ninth flight on Mars,&#34; Tzanetos wrote.\n Although Ingenuity has already achieved the goals initially set by its team during its first few flights, the chopper continues to push the limits of what it can do -- and tag along with the Perseverance rover as it explores the site of an ancient lake bed on Mars.",

something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our  ethics statement.\n Windows 11 is arriving later this year as a  free upgrade for Windows 10 users, but many are discovering that their hardware isn\u2019t compatible. Microsoft has  altered its minimum hardware requirements, and it\u2019s the CPU changes that are most surprising here. Windows 11 will only officially support 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, alongside Apollo Lake and newer Pentium and Celeron processors.\n That potentially rules out millions of existing Windows 10 devices from upgrading to Windows 11 with full support, and even devices like Microsoft\u2019s own Surface Studio 2 which the company is still  selling right now for $3,499. Older devices that aren\u2019t officially supported will be met with a warning during the Windows 11 install that the upgrade is not recommended, but the OS should still install.\n Windows 11 will also only officially support AMD Ryzen 2000 and newer processors, and 2nd Gen or newer EPYC chips. You can find the full list of  supported processors on Microsoft\u2019s site, but here\u2019s the basic breakdown:\n     Originally,  Microsoft noted that CPU generation requirements are a \u201csoft floor\u201d limit for the Windows 11 installer, which should have allowed some older CPUs to be able to install Windows 11 with a warning, but hours after we published this story,  the company updated that page to explicitly require the list of chips above. We\u2019ve reached out to Microsoft to clarify its CPU requirements and support, and we\u2019ll update you accordingly.\n Many Windows 10 users have been downloading Microsoft\u2019s PC Health App ( available here) to see whether Windows 11 works on their systems, only to find it fails the check. As Microsoft now requires a TPM (Trusted Platform Module), this has led to some additional confusion around hardware support.\n That earlier page said Windows 11  would also require TPM capable of at least 1.2 support and UEFI Secure Boot. Both of these technologies are designed to improve the security of Windows, and prevent malware and ransomware from tampering with encryption keys and other secure elements of the operating system. Now, it appears Microsoft may be mandating TPM 2.0, but again, we\u2019re checking on that.\n While Microsoft has required TPM support for OEM hardware certification since Windows 10, it hasn\u2019t actively required Windows to have this fully enabled. That\u2019s changing in Windows 11, and it means if your laptop or PC shipped without these BIOS options enabled then you\u2019re going to have to go searching for a setting to switch on.\n   \u201cAlmost every CPU in the last 5-7 years has a TPM,\u201d  explains David Weston, director of enterprise and OS security at Microsoft. Weston is recommending that Windows 10 users failing Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 upgrade checker requirements should ensure BIOS options for \u201cPTT\u201d on Intel systems are enabled, or \u201cPSP fTPM\u201d on AMD devices. As every BIOS has different settings, you might need to refer to your laptop\u2019s manual if you\u2019re struggling to find the option.\n If you\u2019ve enabled TPM support but you\u2019re still not passing the Windows 11 upgrade checker, it\u2019s likely because your CPU isn\u2019t on the fully supported list. Intel has confirmed Microsoft\u2019s Windows 11 CPU requirements. \u201cA broad range of Intel-based platforms are expected to support Windows 11: 8th Gen and newer Intel Core processors, as well as Intel Pentium processors and Intel Celeron processors from the \u2018Apollo Lake\u2019 generation and newer,\u201d says an Intel spokesperson in a statement to  The Verge.\n This is the first significant shift in Windows hardware requirements since the release of Windows 8 back in 2012, and the CPU changes are understandably catching people by surprise. Microsoft is also requiring a front-facing camera for all Windows 11 devices except desktop PCs from January 2023 onwards. It\u2019s another change that will shape the hardware that Windows 11 will run on in the coming years.\n Update, 5:45AM ET : Added details about Microsoft\u2019s soft limit for the Windows 11 installer.\n Update, 4:06PM ET:  Added that Microsoft\u2019s compatibility page has now changed, with different CPU and TPM requirements.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:23:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "windows,cpu,list", "title": "Windows\u7528\u6237\u60ca\u8bb6\u4e8eWindows 11\u7684\u652f\u6301CPU\u5217\u8868 ", "title_en": "Windows Users Surprised by Windows 11's Short List of Supported CPUs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements", "via": "", "real_tags": ["windows", "cpu", "list"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8e3ca1ad7620172a416275f2e495f24a.png", "infoid": 1068572, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4eca\u5929\u7684MWC\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684SmartWatch\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u624b\u8868\u3002\u8be5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c06\u5728\u65b0\u7684WEAR OS\u4e4b\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0eGoogle\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u90a3\u4e9b\u9075\u5faa\u4e09\u661f\u7684\u4eba\u4f1a\u7559\u610f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u624b\u8868 - \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u610f\u56fe\u5728\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u548c\u624b\u8868\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u754c\u9762\u611f\u89c9\u66f4\u52a0\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u4eca\u5929\u6240\u770b\u5230\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u4f69\u6234\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u65b0UI\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4e2aUI\u89c2\u770b\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5e73\u53f0\u4e00\u8d77\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u65b0\u7684Galaxy Watch\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u5f53\u8c37\u6b4c\u5ba3\u5e03\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u4e09\u661f\u5408\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5408\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5206\u4eab\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u97e9\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u4f18\u5316\u67d0\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u5bf9\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u5982\u53cc\u51fb\u7269\u7406\u6309\u94ae\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u4eec\u5c1a\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u5d29\u6e83\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4e8b\u60c5\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5f53\u60a8\u5728\u624b\u673a\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u60a8\u7684SmartWatch\u4e0a\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5230\u60a8\u7684SmartWatch\u4e0a\u3002\u624b\u673a\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e5f\u5c06\u4fb5\u5165\u624b\u8155 - \u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u949f\uff0c\uff06\uff0339\u6240\u9009\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u57ce\u5e02\u5c06\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u60a8\u5219\u4e3a\u60a8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u4e14ve\u88ab\u5c01\u9501\u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u963b\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u963b\u6b62\u4f60\u7684\u624b\u8868\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u7535\u8bdd\u4e0a\u62ff\u51fa\u9ed1\u540d\u5355\u3002\u6839\u636e\u65b0UI\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u624b\u8868\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\uff0339;

This software will run on top of  the new Wear OS, which the company co-developed with Google. Those who follow Samsung closely will remember a version of  One UI already exists for watches \u2014 it&#39;s meant to make the interface between Galaxy phones and watches feel more coherent. From what we saw today, it appears the latest One UI for Wear OS will attempt to do that too. In  a press release, the company said &#34;One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience.&#34;\n When Google announced the latest wearable platform was made in collaboration with Samsung, it shared how it learned from the Korean company how to optimize certain processes for better responsiveness and battery performance. We also saw some changes to navigation, like a double click of a physical button to switch between running apps. But we have yet to get a full breakdown of the updated OS.\n  Today, Samsung showed a few more details on how things will work. For example, when you install compatible apps on your phone, they&#39;ll also be downloaded onto your smartwatch. Settings from your phone will also port over to your wrist \u2014 the various clocks for different cities you&#39;ve picked will show up, while the numbers you&#39;ve blocked will remain blocked. This also works the other way around, so if you block a person from your watch, they&#39;ll also get blacklisted on your Galaxy phones. According to a video of the new UI, the layout of the watch&#39;s Settings menu will also &#34;closely reflect&#34; that on your phone.\n  One of Tizen&#39;s shortcomings was a lack of third-party app support, and with the new Wear OS that opens up a whole new library of titles you can install. One UI Watch will offer the Google Play Store so you can get apps directly from your wearable. Some of the apps this brings include Couch25K, Facer, Adidas, GolfBuddy, Calm, as well as Google&#39;s apps like Maps, Messages, YouTube Music and more.\n Samsung and Google both also said there will be a new watch face design tool for Android developers to create more useful options that better display the data their users want at a glance.\n While this is by no means an exhaustive look at the new Wear OS or One UI Watch, it gives us a better idea of what to expect.

Its most recent publicly disclosed financing was a $27 million Series B in October of 2018.\n Terms of the Discord acquisition weren\u2019t disclosed, though in recent months the startup seemed to abandon most of the products it had spent its first several years building, suggesting that Ubiquity6 had been having some issues finding wide audiences for its products.\n   Launching back in 2017, Ubiquity6 hoped to build an app that would be the central way mobile phone users would browse augmented reality content. In late 2019, the startup  launched a product called Displayland, which aimed to gamify the process of 3D scanning physical environments with a smartphone\u2019s camera.\n The company\u2019s efforts to find mass adoption were hampered by a mobile AR market, which has largely failed to gain any momentum in recent years despite hefty investment from tech giants, including Apple and Google.\n In early 2020, CEO Anjney Midha told TechCrunch that the startup had some 65 employees.\n  In recent months, Ubiquity6 had executed a pretty drastic pivot, leaving augmented reality completely behind in favor of building out a desktop platform that allowed users to play simple online party games together remotely. The beta platform, called  Backyard, was designed for pandemic era habits that seem to be on the decline as the US springs back into action. Backyard was discontinued this week as part of the acquisition announcement.\n In a  Medium post announcing the acquisition, Midha seems to downplay any expectations that Ubiquity6\u2019s augmented reality technology will be living on inside Discord.\n \u201cOur mission at Ubiquity6 has always been to unlock new ways for people to connect through shared experiences,\u201d Midha wrote. \u201cJoining Discord today allows us to accelerate that mission \u2014 Ubiquity6\u2019s team, Backyard product and multiplayer technology will be integrated into Discord.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:22:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,\u534f\u4f5c,collaborative,\u6536\u8d2d", "title": "Discord\u83b7\u53d6\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u542f\u52a8\u6cdb\u7d20ithiquity6\uff0c\u5b83\u7b79\u96c6\u4e8637.5\u7c73\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u67a2\u8f6c\u6210\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u670d\u52a1 ", "title_en": "Discord acquires augmented reality startup Ubiquity6, which had raised $37.5M and recently pivoted to become a collaborative service for simple online games", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/discord-acquires-augmented-reality-startup-ubiquity6/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6e38\u620f", "\u534f\u4f5c", "\u6536\u8d2d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "558be2d47a7c345a5128f7a0a3f8d302.jpg", "infoid": 1068570, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Coinbase\u5df2\u6536\u5230\u5fb7\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\uff08Bafin\uff09\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u6258\u7ba1\u8bb8\u53ef\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e50\u961f\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fd\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5df4\u592b\u6797\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u3002\n Bafin\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0cCoinbase\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u5bb6\u6536\u5230\u8bb8\u53ef\u8bc1\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n 2019\u5e7411\u6708\uff0c\u5fb7\u56fd\u7684\u8bae\u4f1a - \u8054\u90a6\u8bae\u9662 - \u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u6cd5\u5f8b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u4e3a\u5fb7\u56fd\u7533\u8bf7\u52a0\u5bc6\u62d8\u7559\u8bb8\u53ef\u6216\u79bb\u5f00\u5fb7\u56fd\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u7533\u8bf7\u3002 2020\u5e741\u67081\u65e5\u5728\u8be5\u56fd\u5728\u8be5\u56fd\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u88ab\u8981\u6c42\u5ba3\u5e03\u5176\u76ee\u7684\u7533\u8bf7\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e2a\u5e74\u5ea631\u65e5\u7533\u8bf7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e8e11\u670830\u65e5\u7533\u8bf7\u3002\n \u6279\u51c6\u53d1\u751f\u5728\u4e50\u961f\u961f\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0a\u5e02\u540e\u516c\u5f00\u516c\u5f00\u3002\n  \u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u94f8\u9020\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u6307\u6325\u5b98\u5df2\u88ab\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u8b66\u544a\uff0c\u4ee5\u505c\u6b62\u5728U.K.\u548c\u65e5\u672c\u5728\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u7701\u7701\u5916\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u5b89\u5927\u7565\u7701\u8bc1\u5238\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\uff08OSC\uff09\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\n \u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u5230\u5173\u4e8eCOINDESK\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u60a8\u540c\u610f\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6761\u6b3e\u548camp;\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u3002\n   COINDESK\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8de8\u8d8a\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u653f\u7b56\u3002 COINDESK\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u96c6\u56e2\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u8425\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u6295\u8d44\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002 ", "note_en": "Coinbase has received a crypto custody license from Germany\u2019s Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), allowing Coinbase to continue serving the German market.
