That sounds more like a definition for indoctrination, not true education. The word ‘systematic’ is there to highlight that everything is controlled by the system.</p><p>教育被定义为“接受或给予系统指导的过程，尤其是在学校或大学中。”但这根本不是教育。这听起来更像是对灌输的定义，而不是真正的教育。这里有“系统的”一词，以强调一切都是由系统控制的。</p><p> In my opinion real education is teach  ing someone  how to think and not  what to think. It is not based on memory but more on being able to find, disseminate and then use information in areas with which you are not familiar. As Albert Einstein once said,  “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.” That is completely true.</p><p> 在我看来，真正的教育是在教某人如何思考而不是思考。它不是基于内存，而是基于能够在您不熟悉的区域中找到，传播和使用信息。正如爱因斯坦曾经说过的那样：“教育是人们忘记了在学校学到的东西之后剩下的东西。”那是完全正确的。</p><p> We are all geniuses. We are all intelligent in our own unique ways, but as Einstein also once said, “ …if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” And that is exactly what is happening in today’s world. The most obvious example of this insanity is the modern educational system. So let’s take a look at the ‘educational’ system and see if what they teach is really ‘education’ or just an indoctrination of the system’s version of reality.</p><p> 我们都是天才。我们都以自己独特的方式变得聪明，但正如爱因斯坦也曾说过的那样：“……如果您以爬树的能力来判断一条鱼，那么它会终生相信它的愚蠢。”而这正是当今世界正在发生的事情。这种精神错乱最明显的例子就是现代教育体系。因此，让我们看一下“教育”系统，看看他们教的是真正的“教育”还是对系统现实版本的灌输。</p><p>   If you are an older reader you might remember school as something that was quite fun, something enjoyable, a nice to place to go to and meet up with your friends and learn new things and therefore might be a bit shocked and disturbed reading such a title. Well let me explain.</p><p>   如果您是老读者，您可能会记得学校很有趣，很有趣，很适合去和朋友见面并学习新事物，因此读这样的书可能会有些震惊和不安。 。好吧，让我解释一下。</p><p> School might have been all those good things in the past when you were a child, but a lot has changed since then. School is now an environment that very much resembles a prison, with its rules, authority figures and students, which are being stripped of their individuality on the daily — I will get to that later.</p><p> 过去，您小时候，学校也许就是这些美好的事物，但是从那以后，发生了很多变化。学校现在是一个非常类似于监狱的环境，其规则，权威人物和学生每天都被剥夺个性，我将在稍后讨论。</p><p>  They are both buildings with huge fences around them to keep the prisoners/students from escaping.</p><p>它们都是建筑物，周围有巨大的围栏，以防止囚犯/学生逃脱。</p><p> They both have an authority figure which the prisoners/students must listen to and whose orders they must obey.</p><p> 他们俩都有一个囚犯/学生必须听从的权威人物，必须服从谁的命令。</p><p> They both have a mandatory uniform to strip the prisoner/student of their individuality and to make them feel like they are like everybody else.</p><p> 他们俩都有一套强制制服，以剥夺囚犯/学生的个性，并使他们感到自己像其他人一样。</p><p> There is a huge emphasis on silence and order along with set times for walking, running, eating and even going toilet.</p><p> 人们特别强调安静和秩序，以及步行，奔跑，进食甚至上厕所的时间。</p><p> No prisoner/student is allowed to take part in decision making as all the decisions are already made for them.</p><p> 囚犯/学生不允许参与决策，因为所有决策已为他们做出。</p><p> They are not allowed to question their environment and their current situations without being punished.</p><p>未经惩罚，不得质疑他们的环境和现状。</p><p> But do you know what the only difference between the two is? You actually have to commit a crime to be put in prison, but to be put in these schools, all you have to do is simply be born and you are automatically thrown into these brainwashing institutions called schools. And of course, you have no say in whether you want to go there or not. That’s insane — absolutely outrageous! Talk about child abuse!</p><p> 但是你知道两者之间唯一的区别是什么吗？实际上，您必须犯罪才能入狱，但要进入这些学校，您所要做的只是出生，您就会自动被送入这些被称为学校的洗脑机构。当然，您是否要去那里也没有发言权。太疯狂了-绝对令人发指！谈论虐待儿童！</p><p>   I’ll start off with the authority figures; the principals, the teachers, the boards of education and the most destructive ones out of them all, pushy parents.</p><p>   我将从权威人物开始；校长，老师，教育委员会以及其中最具破坏性的人都是勤奋的父母。</p><p> From a very young age, some even as young as 3–4, children are told to look-up to these people, listen to them, respect them and so on. They are told to obey their orders and not question the nature of them. Simple obedience is what these teachers and principals are looking for — “We tell you what to do and you go do it, whether you like it or not.”</p><p> 从很小的时候开始，甚至是3至4岁，孩子们就被告知要照料这些人，听他们说话，尊重他们，等等。他们被告知要服从命令，而不要质疑其性质。这些老师和校长正在寻求简单的服从-“无论您是否喜欢，我们都会告诉您该做什么，然后您去做。”</p><p> The child becomes traumatised. He is just after coming into this world, curiously asking questions and wanting to learn, and he is already involuntarily thrown into a stuffy classroom with a teacher — an authority figure — and other children his age with whom he probably has very little in common, and is expected to be happy and joyous. Just ask any child you see if he likes school. Most, if not all, will say “no!” without hesitation. And those who say that they do will explain that they only like to go to school to see their friends and to play games, thus implying that it is not school that they like but simply having fun.</p><p> 这孩子受伤了。他刚来到这个世界，好奇地问问题并想学习，他已经不由自主地与老师（一个权威人物）和他这个年龄的其他孩子一起被扔进一个闷闷的教室，并会感到高兴和高兴。只需问一个孩子，看看他是否喜欢学校。大多数（如果不是全部）都会说“不！”不加思索。那些说自己愿意的人会解释说，他们只喜欢上学去见朋友和玩游戏，从而暗示他们不喜欢上学，而只是开心。</p><p> Then take a look at the teachers; even they don’t enjoy being in these classrooms for six to seven hours straight. Most of them are always miserable and depressed and end up taking out their anger on these poor kids. And that is just me describing primary education where the children are young and only beginning their journey in this world. Don’t even get me started on the insanity that goes on in secondary education.</p><p>然后看看老师们。即使他们不喜欢连续六到七个小时在这些教室里。他们中的大多数人总是痛苦和沮丧，最终对这些可怜的孩子发怒。这就是我所描述的小学教育，那里的孩子还很小，他们才刚刚开始这个世界的旅程。甚至不要让我开始着手中学教育的疯狂。</p><p> As the child passes through the school educational system from primary to secondary school, the authority figures demand more and more from the child causing him to become more stressed out and to eventually develop a depression. Most of this stress comes from high expectations around exams. Confronted with the question, “Who do you want to be when you grow up?” the inner child inside the now teenager sparks again, only to realise that his dreams are considered ‘too unrealistic’ and ‘unachievable’ by the teachers and principles. The child is told to be realistic and by that continual repetition his dreams become crushed and he slowly begins to die inside. That is the aim of the schooling system; to kill the inner child, the individual and to make them a cog in the machine; a slave for the system.</p><p> 当孩子从小学到中学通过学校教育系统时，权威人士对孩子的要求越来越高，这使他变得压力更大并最终发展为抑郁症。这些压力大部分来自对考试的高期望。面对一个问题，“长大后想成为谁？”现在这个少年中的内心孩子再次产生火花，只是意识到他们的梦想被老师和原则认为“太不现实”和“无法实现”。那个孩子被告知要现实，通过不断的重复，他的梦想变得粉碎，他慢慢开始死在里面。这就是学制的目的；杀死内心的孩子，个人并使他们成为机器中的齿轮；系统的从属。</p><p> “When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life.</p><p> “当我五岁时，妈妈总是告诉我幸福是生活的关键。</p><p> When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down ‘happy’.</p><p> 我上学时，他们问我长大后想要做什么。我写下“快乐”。</p><p> They told me I didn’t understand the assignment, and I told them they didn’t understand life.”</p><p> 他们告诉我我不了解任务，我告诉他们他们不了解生活。”</p><p>  Secondly, who came up the idea of mandatory uniforms in these schools? They are of no good to anyone and all they do is strip these children of their individuality.</p><p>其次，谁提出了这些学校必须穿制服的想法？他们对任何人都没有好处，他们所做的就是剥夺这些孩子的个性。</p><p> Clothes are a great way for the kids to express themselves, their inner being and their originality. But that’s not what these schools want. They don’t want people thinking that they are individuals; they want them to believe that they are all the same. They want them to be robot-like, dead inside; zombies.</p><p> 衣服是孩子表达自我，内在世界和独创性的好方法。但这不是这些学校想要的。他们不希望人们认为自己是个人；他们希望他们相信他们都是一样的。他们希望它们像机器人一样，死在里面。僵尸。</p><p> Children who not allowed to express themselves through their appearance start losing their individuality. What do I mean by losing their individuality? I mean that the children are not able to do what they want with their clothes, their hair, their shoes, their flesh. Their creativity is taken away from them. They have taken the only thing they have control over. They have taken away what they see as beautiful and made them subscribe to what “they” think is beautiful. I am all for getting rid off school uniforms and believe that students should simply refuse to wear them.</p><p> 不允许通过外表表现自己的孩子会开始失去个性。我失去个性是什么意思？我的意思是孩子们不能用衣服，头发，鞋子和肉来做他们想要的事情。他们的创造力被剥夺了。他们采取了他们唯一可以控制的东西。他们带走了他们认为美丽的东西，并让他们认同“他们”认为美丽的东西。我全力以赴摆脱校服，并相信学生应该拒绝穿校服。</p><p> Of course people always come up to me with the question, “Isn’t it nice to wake up and not have to pick out new clothes to wear  every single day?” To that I reply, “No it is not!” Waking up and picking out clothes through which you can express yourself, your individuality and your creativity and then getting dressed in them is a wonderful thing. It is similar to an artist picking paint colors and then using those colors to paint a painting. Your style is your painting; a painting of your individuality. It is a direct reflection of your being. If  that is taken from the child, then the very backbone of his creativity and the way in which he expresses himself is killed in him.</p><p> 当然，人们总是会问我一个问题：“醒来就好，不必每天都挑选新衣服穿吗？”我回答说：“不，不是！”醒来并挑选衣服来表达自己，个性和创造力，然后穿上衣服是一件很棒的事情。这类似于艺术家选择绘画颜色，然后使用这些颜色绘画。你的风格就是你的绘画。一张你的个性画。这直接反映了你的存在。如果这是从孩子身上夺走的，那么他的创造力和表达方式的骨干就被他杀死了。</p><p> Another common argument that I get from people is that it would be unfair for children coming from poorer families which do not have the money to buy clothes that are considered ‘fashionable’ and ‘in’ for their child. This would then inevitably result in bullying and calling of names, which could be easily resolved with everyone having to wear the same clothes. I do not agree with this at all.</p><p> 我从人们那里得到的另一个普遍论点是，对于来自贫困家庭的孩子来说，这是不公平的，他们没有钱买被认为对他们的孩子“时髦”和“穿着”的衣服。这样就不可避免地导致欺负和骂人，而每个人都必须穿同样的衣服就可以轻松解决。我完全不同意。</p><p> Take a look at it this way: If you as a parent teach your child to be tolerable and nice and to respect everyone then the problem would be easily solved. Demanding the children to wear uniforms is simply solving the symptom of the problem. It is like when a disease infects your body, and your body presents symptoms to try fight it off and to show you that the body is in fact infected and you go on taking your medicine — mainly pain-killers — trying to cure the disease. You will never cure the disease that way, all you will do is ease the symptoms. You have to cut the root of the problem to permanently get rid of it.</p><p>以这种方式看一下：如果作为父母，您教孩子要宽容，友善，并尊重每个人，那么问题就很容易解决。要求孩子穿校服只是解决问题的征兆。就像疾病感染您的身体，您的身体表现出症状以试图消除它，并向您表明身体实际上已被感染，然后您继续服用药物（主要是止痛药）来试图治愈该疾病。您将永远不会以这种方式治愈疾病，您所要做的就是缓解症状。您必须削减问题的根源才能永久消除它。</p><p> “Problems are like plants; you’ve got to get to the roots in order to prevent them from popping up again.”</p><p> “问题就像植物；您必须扎根，以防止它们再次弹出。”</p><p>  This bullying and name-calling is a clear, evident symptom of the problem that is the parents, the media and society teaching the child not to be respectful and to be judgmental. If we looked at the actual root of the problem — the mindset of these children — then we would easily be able to resolve this problem.</p><p>  这种欺凌和辱骂是问题的明显症状，父母，媒体和社会都在教孩子不要尊重和有判断力。如果我们看问题的真正根源-这些孩子的心态-那么我们很容易就能解决这个问题。</p><p> Another thing I have to say about that argument, and this will probably shock and perhaps even annoy quite a few of you, is that it is the fault of the child if he gets offended and believes what these low-life, disrespectful kids are saying to him. My advice to these children is: simply ignore them, let them talk crap, let them laugh at you and mock you. All they are looking for is a reaction from you, so if you completely ignore them and keep on going without paying attention to them or their words, they will be disturbed and confused. They will begin to fear you as you will be unpredictable in their eyes or they will just simply get bored of picking on you. They grow and get stronger with every reaction they get from you and without one they will see no point in continuing their bullying. Do not buy into their game!</p><p> 关于这一论点，我不得不说的另一件事，这可能会令您震惊，甚至会让很多人感到烦恼，那就是如果孩子得罪了并相信这些低龄，无礼的孩子在说什么，那是孩子的错。给他。我对这些孩子的建议是：无视他们，让他们说话胡扯，让他们嘲笑你并嘲笑你。他们正在寻找的只是您的反应，因此，如果您完全不理会它们，并且在不注意他们或他们的言语的情况下继续前进，他们会感到困扰和困惑。他们会开始害怕您，因为您在他们的眼中无法预测，否则他们只会对您的选择感到无聊。他们会从您得到的每一个反应中成长并变得更强壮，没有他们他们就不会继续欺负他们。不要购买他们的游戏！</p><p> The next insane thing that goes on in these schools which makes them more prison-like than anything is the children being told when they can walk, talk, run, eat, drink or even go to the toilet. If you think about it, that’s completely nuts! Being told when you can go to the toilet? Having to put up your hand to ask if you can leave the class to go urinate? And the most insane part about this is that some teachers actually do not let their students go to the toilet during their class. And they insist that school is a good environment for the child? I do not think so!</p><p> 在这些学校中发生的下一个疯狂的事情是，告诉孩子们何时他们可以走路，说话，奔跑，吃饭，喝水甚至上厕所，这使他们比监狱更像监狱。如果您考虑一下，那简直就是疯了！被告知何时可以上厕所？是否必须举手询问您是否可以离开班级去小便？而与此有关的最疯狂的部分是，有些老师实际上在上课时不让学生上厕所。他们坚持认为学校是孩子的好环境吗？我不这么认为！</p><p> Then there is the bell, which indicates the end of one class and either the beginning of the next one or lunch break. Dictated by the bell, the children are told when to stand up, when to walk out of class and when they are allowed to go and eat their lunches. This is a tool for making the students more and more robot-like; like when you press a key on your keyboard and the computer performs a certain action, the child is programmed to stand up, walk out and go to his next class when the bell rings. It’s a way of making the child more obedient and to make him react appropriately to the authority figures and their orders without questioning anything. It’s all planned out to make the child a perfect slave for the system.</p><p>然后是铃，它指示一堂课的结束以及下一堂课的开始或午休时间。在钟声的指示下，孩子们被告知何时该站起来，何时下课，何时被允许去吃午餐。这是一种使学生越来越像机器人的工具。例如，当您按键盘上的某个键并且计算机执行特定操作时，孩子会被编程为站起来，走出去，然后在铃响时上下一堂课。这是一种使孩子更服从并让他对权威人物及其命令做出适当反应而又不质疑任何东西的方法。所有这些都计划使孩子成为系统的完美奴隶。</p><p> Lastly, the children are deprived of their basic freedom in their formative years, from when they are around 6 or 7 all the way up until they are 18, not including colleges and universities which go on for another 3 to 5 years, when they are forced to go to school. And yes,  forced is a great word to use in this case, as I believe that that is what best describes what these kids are put through every single day. Let’s take a look at a normal school day of a child that is in school.</p><p> 最后，儿童在成长的岁月中被剥夺了基本的自由，从6岁到7岁一直到18岁，这还不包括继续学习3到5年的高校。被迫上学。是的，在这种情况下，强迫是个好词，因为我认为这最能描述这些孩子每天的生活。让我们看一看在校儿童的正常上学日。</p><p>  Woken up by his alarm at around 7 a.m., he gets up out of bed, already dreading the day. He has a huge frown on his face as he knows that he is going to have to spend the next 6 to 7 hours of his day in an environment which he absolutely despises. He goes to the bathroom to brush his teeth and looks in his mirror and sighs, muttering to himself how much he hates his life. He then goes downstairs and eats some breakfast, packs his school lunch and heads off to prison, I mean school. Upon arriving in school, he is already surrounded by people whom he has nothing in common with apart from being the same age as them.</p><p>  凌晨7点左右，他被闹钟惊醒了，他起床了，已经很忙了。他脸上皱着眉头，因为他知道他将不得不在他绝对鄙视的环境中度过接下来的6至7个小时。他去洗手间刷牙，看着镜子，叹了口气，喃喃自语自己多么讨厌自己的生活。然后他下楼去吃早餐，收拾学校午餐，然后去监狱，我的意思是学校。到达学校后，他已经被与他同龄的人包围了。</p><p> When the first bell rings, indicating the start of the school day, he goes to his first class. As he enters the classroom he looks his teacher, who is sitting at his desk with a coffee in his hand to wake him up as he, too, was woken up far too early by his alarm and is also dreading the day, in the eyes and sits down at his desk. The class then begins with the teacher calling the roll; checking if every student is present in the class to receive the system’s indoctrination that day. He then spends over 40 minutes listening to his teacher talk about something which he has no interest in and which will not help him in life at all. The bell then rings signifying the end of period one. This is then repeated 7, 8 or even 9 times a day, as that is the number of classes a student has in a day.</p><p> 当第一个钟声响起，表明上学日开始时，他去上了第一堂课。当他进入教室时，他看着他的老师，他坐在办公桌前，手里拿着一杯咖啡，叫醒了他，因为他也被闹钟惊醒得太早了，并且他也很害怕这一天。坐在他的办公桌前然后，课程开始于老师给学生点名。检查当天是否有所有学生参加该系统的灌输。然后，他花了40分钟以上的时间听老师讲讲自己不感兴趣的事情，这对他的生活毫无帮助。然后，钟声响起，表示第一期结束。然后每天重复7、8甚至9次，因为这是学生一天上的课数。</p><p> Then comes lunch, after about 3 hours of the child continuous listening to teachers rambling on about some useless crap. He is finally allowed to eat. What a relief! As he walks into the school cafeteria, if the school has one, he either goes and gets the food that is being served there, which is disgusting looking and very much resembles prison food, or simply takes out his pre-prepared lunch. When lunch ends, again signalled by the bell, he goes to his last few classes. When the school day is over, he now has a huge smile on his face as he is finally allowed to go home.</p><p> 然后是午餐，大约三个小时后，孩子不断地听老师讲一些没用的废话。他终于被允许吃饭。终于解脱了！当他走进学校食堂时，如果学校有食堂，他要么去那里拿取的食物，看上去很恶心，很像监狱里的食物，要么干脆拿出自己准备好的午餐。午餐结束后，钟声再次响起，他上了最后几节课。放学后，当他终于被允许回家时，他的脸上露出灿烂的笑容。</p><p> Oh but wait, did I mention homework? So apparently the teachers aren’t able to teach the kids in all those hours, five times a week for all those years, that they have to give homework? Again, going back to the fact that the children are being deprived of their freedom, this homework forces them to spend their free time, their them-time, when they return home from school, doing more school work, more revision and study. And all that for what? “Well, so they can keep up the good work and get good grades.” Nonsense! The only reason homework is there is to cut down the child’s free time even more and to distract him from the real world and from doing his own research.</p><p>哦，等等，我有提到作业吗？因此，显然，老师们在所有这些时间里都不能教孩子们，这些年里每周要教五次，所以他们必须做功课吗？再一次，回到儿童被剥夺自由这一事实，这项家庭作业迫使他们度过闲暇时间，他们的时间，当他们放学回家时，做更多的功课，更多的复习和学习。而这一切是为了什么？ “好吧，这样他们就可以保持出色的工作并获得良好的成绩。”废话！做作业的唯一原因是要更多地减少孩子的空闲时间，并使他从现实世界和进行自己的研究中分散注意力。</p><p> This brings us back to the question I asked at the start, what is education? Is it going to school and getting spoon-fed the system’s version of the world and of all that is, or is it doing your own research and finding out that which truly matters to you and that which you know will be helpful in your life?</p><p> 这使我们回到开始时我问的问题，什么是教育？它是在上学并获取该系统的世界及其所有版本的信息，还是在进行自己的研究并发现对您而言真正重要的东西以及您知道对您的生活有帮助的东西？</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lukakorba.medium.com/the-truth-about-the-education-system-and-school-586a3a48303c">https://lukakorba.medium.com/the-truth-about-the-education-system-and-school-586a3a48303c</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/制度/">#制度</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/education/">#education</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/孩子/">#孩子</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
