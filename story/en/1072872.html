One of the accusers claims that Harvard also obtained her psychotherapy records without her consent and handed them to the professor, who used them to “gaslight” her.</p><p>本周，三名女性对哈佛提起诉讼，声称哈佛未能保护她们免受一位著名人类学学者的性骚扰，然后威胁说如果她们挺身而出，就会毁掉她们的职业生涯。其中一名原告声称，哈佛大学也在未经她同意的情况下获得了她的心理治疗记录，并将其交给了教授，教授用这些记录“点燃”了她。</p><p> On Thursday, Harvard  issued a statement about the women’s harassment claims against professor John Comaroff and the university’s investigation of them. But the Ivy League school’s remarks centered on the disturbing accusations about the woman’s medical records, which were obtained by Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution (ODR) after she filed a complaint about Comaroff’s alleged harassment and unwanted advances.</p><p>周四，哈佛大学发表了一份声明，阐述了这些女性对约翰·科马罗夫教授的骚扰指控以及哈佛大学对她们的调查。但这所常春藤盟校的言论集中在对这名女子的医疗记录的令人不安的指控上。哈佛争议解决办公室（ODR）在她就科马罗夫的骚扰和不必要的进展提出投诉后获得了这些记录。</p><p> The university even appeared to shift blame to the woman’s therapist, saying, “HIPAA privacy obligations apply to medical care providers, not the ODR” and “ODR receives information from that care provider only with the party’s consent. We scrupulously follow this practice.”</p><p>该大学甚至似乎将责任推到了这位女性的治疗师身上，称“HIPAA隐私义务适用于医疗保健提供者，而不是ODR”，并且“ODR只在征得当事人同意的情况下才从该医疗保健提供者处接收信息。我们严格遵循这一做法。”</p><p> If you have any information about botched sexual harassment cases at Harvard or other universities, contact The Daily Beast via text, Signal, or WhatsApp at:  +1 (929) 414-3153.</p><p>如果你有任何关于哈佛或其他大学拙劣性骚扰案件的信息，请通过文本、信号或WhatsApp联系每日野兽，电话：+1（929）414-3153。</p><p>  Margaret Czerwienski, Lilia Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava—the grad students behind the suit—say Comaroff “kissed and groped students without their consent, made unwelcome sexual advances, and threatened to sabotage students’ careers if they complained.” When women did seek help from university officials, the lawsuit adds, Harvard “brushed them aside and opted to protect its star professor over vulnerable students.”</p><p>该诉讼背后的研究生玛格丽特·切尔温斯基、莉莉亚·基尔伯恩和阿穆利亚·曼达娃说，科马罗夫“未经学生同意，亲吻和抚摸学生，进行不受欢迎的性行为，并威胁如果学生投诉，将破坏他们的职业生涯。”诉讼补充道，当女性确实向大学官员寻求帮助时，哈佛“将她们置之不理，选择保护明星教授而不是弱势学生”</p><p> The students’ complaint, filed in Massachusetts federal court, alleges Harvard’s eventual probe into Comaroff’s alleged harassment “only exacerbated [their] nightmare” by prolonging the process, allowing the professor to “tamper with evidence” by intimidating potential student witnesses, and sharing Kilburn’s private therapy records with Comaroff.</p><p>学生们向马萨诸塞州联邦法院提交的诉状称，哈佛大学最终对科马罗夫所谓的骚扰进行的调查“只会延长程序，让教授通过恐吓潜在的学生证人来“篡改证据”，从而“加剧了他们的噩梦”，和科马罗夫分享凯尔本的私人治疗记录。</p><p> Comaroff then used these notes to “gaslight” Kilburn during the university investigation, the lawsuit claims, and tell her “that she must have imagined that he sexually harassed her because she was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.” She says she developed this condition, however, as a result of his sexual misconduct.</p><p>诉讼称，在大学调查期间，科马罗夫用这些笔记“点燃”了凯尔本，并告诉她“她一定以为他性骚扰她是因为她患有创伤后应激障碍。”然而，她说她患上这种疾病是因为他的性行为不当。</p><p>  Indeed, the lawsuit says, when Kilburn filed a complaint with Harvard’s OPR in 2020, school investigators contacted her psychotherapist, a private therapist unaffiliated with the university, and obtained notes from their sessions. It’s unclear why the mental health professional, who has not been publicly identified, turned over the information and allegedly did so without Kilburn’s written consent.</p><p>事实上，诉讼称，当基尔伯恩在2020年向哈佛大学的OPR提起诉讼时，学校调查人员联系了她的心理治疗师，一位与哈佛大学无关的私人治疗师，并从他们的会议中获得了记录。目前尚不清楚这名尚未公开身份的心理健康专业人士为何在未经Kilburn书面同意的情况下提交了这些信息。</p><p> The complaint states that ODR then “withheld the full notes from Ms. Kilburn, redacting swaths of the notes and refusing to disclose the redacted portions even as ODR’s investigator grilled her about the redacted contents during an interview.”</p><p>诉状称，ODR随后“拒绝向Kilburn女士提供完整的笔记，对笔记进行了大量编辑，并拒绝披露编辑的部分，尽管ODR的调查人员在采访中询问了她编辑的内容。”</p><p> ODR allegedly went as far as publishing Kilburn’s therapy notes in a final report about her complaint and “appended them as exhibits, making Ms. Kilburn’s medical records available to anyone with access to” the document.</p><p>据称，ODR甚至在一份关于Kilburn投诉的最终报告中公布了Kilburn的治疗记录，并“将其作为证物附上，使任何有权接触到该文件的人都能获得Kilburn的医疗记录”。</p><p> For its part, Harvard said ODR informs parties involved in a complaint that all medical records and other documents the office obtains “will be shared with both parties to the investigation,” adding that “a party may not supply information of any kind to be considered in the process if it cannot be shared with an opposing party.”</p><p>哈佛大学表示，ODR告知投诉相关方，办公室获得的所有医疗记录和其他文件“将与调查双方共享”，并补充说，“如果无法与对方共享，一方不得提供任何类型的信息，以供在调查过程中考虑。”</p><p> In a statement, Harvard noted that it issued sanctions against Comaroff on Jan. 20 that included putting him on unpaid administrative leave for the spring semester and restricting his “teaching and advising activities through at least the 2022-23 academic year.”</p><p>哈佛大学在一份声明中指出，该校于1月20日对科马罗夫进行了制裁，其中包括让他在春季学期休无薪行政假，并限制他“至少在2022-23学年从事教学和咨询活动”</p><p>  “Harvard University disputes the allegations of the lawsuit brought by Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP,” the school said, referring to the women’s attorneys, “which are in no way a fair or accurate representation of the thoughtful steps taken by the University in response to concerns that were brought forward, the thorough reviews conducted, and the results of those reviews.”</p><p>“哈佛大学对桑福德·海斯勒·夏普律师事务所提起的诉讼的指控提出异议，”该校在提到这些女性律师时说，“这绝不能公平或准确地反映大学针对提出的问题采取的深思熟虑的措施、进行的彻底审查以及这些审查的结果。”</p><p> After Comaroff’s suspension, 38 faculty members  signed an open letter supporting him, saying, “We are dismayed by Harvard’s sanctions against him and concerned about its effects on our ability to advise our own students.” As the   Harvard Crimson reported, nearly all of those academics have now retracted their signatures.</p><p>在科马罗夫被停职后，38名教职员工签署了一封支持他的公开信，称“我们对哈佛大学对他的制裁感到失望，并对其对我们为自己的学生提供建议的能力的影响感到担忧。”正如《哈佛深红报》报道的那样，几乎所有这些学者现在都撤回了自己的签名。</p><p> Lawyers for the women told The Daily Beast that Kilburn “never provided full and informed consent” for her therapist to release her records to Harvard.</p><p>这些女性的律师告诉《每日野兽报》，Kilburn“从未提供完全和知情的同意”，让她的治疗师将她的记录公布给哈佛大学。</p><p> In response to Harvard’s statement, attorney Carolin Guentert said the university doesn’t address how they obtained Kilburn’s records and whether and how they’d obtained the necessary written informed consent required under HIPAA.</p><p>在回应哈佛大学的声明时，律师卡罗琳·甘特说，哈佛大学没有说明他们是如何获得基尔伯恩的记录的，以及他们是否以及如何获得了HIPAA要求的必要书面知情同意书。</p><p> Her co-counsel, Russell Kornblith, added, “It is incredibly important that anybody who has access to this kind of record treat it with extreme care, and make sure that the student, the patient, the person who is vulnerable, understands exactly what’s going to happen.”</p><p>她的联合律师拉塞尔·科恩布里斯补充说，“任何能够接触到此类记录的人都要极其小心地对待它，并确保学生、患者和易受伤害的人准确地了解将要发生的事情，这一点非常重要。”</p><p> Guentert and Kornblith also questioned why the university hasn’t found a way to create a safe space for survivors in light of the  Crimson’s previous reporting on Comaroff and two other anthropology professors accused of sexual misconduct:  Gary Urton and  Theodore Bestor.</p><p>Guentert和Kornblith还质疑，鉴于《绯闻》之前对科马罗夫和另外两名被控性行为不端的人类学教授加里·乌顿（Gary Urton）和西奥多·贝斯特（Theodore Bestor）的报道，该大学为什么没有找到为幸存者创造安全空间的方法。</p><p> The Harvard faculty that withdrew their support for Comaroff haven’t apologized to their clients for rushing to judgment and coming to his aid, the attorneys said.</p><p>律师们说，撤回对科马罗夫支持的哈佛大学教员没有向他们的客户道歉，因为他们匆忙做出判断并帮助科马罗夫。</p><p>  “The retraction is the least they can do but obviously there is a network of powerful people out there whose instincts are to protect their colleagues, to close rank around them,” Kornblith said. “And our clients were fortunate enough to have the courage, to have each other, and to bring accusations to light publicly in a way that prompted some public attention on their matter.</p><p>科恩布里斯说：“撤回是他们能做的最起码的事情，但显然有一个有权势的人组成的网络，他们的本能是保护他们的同事，接近他们周围的级别。”。“我们的客户很幸运，他们有勇气，有彼此，并以一种引起公众关注的方式公开指控。</p><p> “But if you are somebody making the decision to come forward to file an ODR complaint to speak up about what you experienced… knowing this network is out there is truly terrifying,” he added.</p><p>“但如果你是一个决定挺身而出提出ODR投诉的人，说出你的经历……知道这个网络就在那里真的很可怕，”他补充道。</p><p> “Retaliation works,” Guentert said, “and students have known for generations that there are huge risks attached to speaking out about powerful faculty, and this case just goes to show the worst case scenario.”</p><p>“报复是有效的，”甘特说，“学生们世代以来都知道，公开谈论强大的教师会带来巨大的风险，而这起案件正好说明了最糟糕的情况。”</p><p> The complaint alleges that in spring of 2017, Czerwienski and Mandava learned that Comaroff “was making ongoing sexual advances” on a second-year graduate student who was his advisee by forcibly kissing her, groping her and sending texts demanding to know with whom she was sleeping. The women reported this alleged harassment to an incoming anthropology department chair, while the advisee contacted the university’s Title IX Office.</p><p>诉状称，在2017年春天，切尔温斯基和曼达娃得知科马罗夫“正在对一名二年级研究生进行性侵犯”，他建议科马罗夫强迫她亲吻、抚摸她，并发送短信要求知道她与谁睡觉。这些女性向即将上任的人类学系主任报告了这一骚扰指控，而顾问则联系了该大学的第九篇办公室。</p><p> The university, the lawsuit says, chose not to investigate the women’s complaints and “enabled retaliation” by Comaroff. In October of that year, Comaroff allegedly called Mandava to his office and warned her that he was aware she and Czerwienski were speaking to others about his bad behavior. “He threatened that if they continued to do so, they would have ‘trouble getting jobs,’ as his detractors had in the past,” the filing alleges.</p><p>诉讼称，这所大学选择不调查这些女性的投诉，并“促成了科马罗夫的报复”。同年10月，据称科马罗夫给曼达娃打电话到他的办公室，警告她，他知道她和切尔温斯基正在与其他人谈论他的不良行为。该文件称：“他威胁说，如果他们继续这样做，他们将“难以找到工作”，就像他的批评者过去那样。”。</p><p> At the time, Mandava met with Comaroff to discuss a grant application and he informed her that he knew graduate students including herself were circulating “nasty rumors” about him. Comaroff then told Mandava, who was an undergrad at the University of Chicago when Comaroff taught there, that these rumors weren’t true and claimed he had “been sexually inactive for seven years” and was “impotent,” the lawsuit claims.</p><p>当时，曼达娃与科马罗夫会面讨论了一项拨款申请，科马罗夫告诉她，他知道包括她自己在内的研究生都在散布关于他的“恶劣谣言”。科马洛夫接着告诉曼达瓦，他是芝加哥大学的一名研究生，当科马洛夫在那里教书时，这些谣言不是真的，他声称自己“七年来性生活不活跃”，而且是“无能为力”。</p><p> The professor then allegedly threatened that his wife, fellow professor Jean Comaroff, would no longer serve as Mandava’s recommender.</p><p>据称，这位教授随后威胁说，他的妻子让·科马罗夫教授将不再担任曼德瓦的推荐人。</p><p> “He reminded Ms. Mandava that he and his wife were responsible for her admission to Harvard and reiterated multiple times how much ‘support’ they had given her over the years,” the lawsuit states. “He cautioned that Professor Jean Comaroff would be ‘furious’ at anyone who told her about his conduct.”</p><p>“他提醒曼达娃，他和妻子对她进入哈佛大学负有责任，并多次重申多年来他们给予她的‘支持’，”诉讼称。“他警告说，让·科马罗夫教授会对任何告诉她他的行为的人感到‘愤怒’。”</p><p> Before Mandava left, Comaroff warned that if she and Czerwienski continued spreading “gossip” about him, he and his wife would find out because “our students will always tell us.”</p><p>在曼达娃离开之前，科马罗夫警告说，如果她和切尔温斯基继续散布关于他的“流言蜚语”，他和他的妻子会发现，因为“我们的学生总是会告诉我们。”</p><p> Czerwienski reported Comaroff’s retaliation to Harvard’s Title IX Office but the university allegedly didn’t take any action to stop the professor. “Because of Harvard’s inaction,” the lawsuit states, “Professor Comaroff abused Lilia Kilburn.”</p><p>Czervienski向哈佛大学第九章办公室报告了科马罗夫的报复行为，但哈佛大学据称没有采取任何行动阻止这位教授。“因为哈佛的不作为，”诉讼称，“科马罗夫教授虐待了莉莉亚·基尔伯恩。”</p><p> Before Kilburn enrolled at Harvard, she visited the campus in February 2017 and Comaroff “kissed her on the mouth without her consent,” the complaint says.</p><p>诉状称，在Kilburn进入哈佛大学之前，她于2017年2月参观了校园，Comaroff“未经同意吻了她的嘴”。</p><p> The alleged encounter occurred when Kilburn met with Comaroff and his wife Jean to discuss her acceptance into Harvard’s anthropology program. “As they approached the building in which his office is located, Professor Comaroff stepped in front of Ms. Kilburn, hugged her tightly—pressing the length of his body against hers—and kissed her on the lips without her consent,” the suit states. “Continuing to hug her tightly, he whispered in her ear that she should ‘go visit Columbia [University], but then come back here.’”</p><p>所谓的邂逅发生在基尔伯恩与科马罗夫和他的妻子简会面，讨论她被哈佛大学人类学项目录取的问题时。“当他们走近科马罗夫教授办公室所在的大楼时，科马罗夫教授走到了基尔伯恩女士面前，紧紧地拥抱她，将他身体的长度按在她的身上，并在没有得到她的同意的情况下吻了她的嘴唇，”诉状写道。“他继续紧紧抱住她，在她耳边低声说她应该‘去哥伦比亚大学，然后再回来。’”</p><p>   During an August 2017 meeting to discuss her planned study of a country in Central Africa, Comaroff “repeatedly described various ways in which Ms. Kilburn would be raped and killed in South Africa—approximately 3,000 miles away from Central Africa—because she is in a same-sex relationship,” the complaint alleges.</p><p>申诉称，在2017年8月的一次会议上，科马罗夫讨论了她计划对中非一个国家进行的研究，她“反复描述了Kilburn女士在距离中非约3000英里的南非被强奸和杀害的各种方式，因为她处于同性关系中”。</p><p> Comaroff allegedly told her, “There are many places where you would go where you would be raped,” “you would certainly be raped,” and “you would be raped and killed.”</p><p>据称，科马罗夫告诉她，“有很多地方你会被强奸”，“你肯定会被强奸”，以及“你会被强奸和杀害”</p><p> “He then identified specific places where ‘corrective rapes’ had been carried out, and stated over and over that Ms. Kilburn, too, ‘would be raped,’ ‘would be killed,’ would be ‘left for dead,’ and that ‘they would finish you off.’ Ms. Kilburn sat frozen in shock, while Professor Comaroff continued for approximately five minutes,” the filing says.</p><p>“然后，他确定了实施‘纠正性强奸’的具体地点，并一遍又一遍地说，基尔伯恩女士也‘会被强奸’、‘会被杀’、‘会被留到死里去’、‘他们会把你干掉’。基尔伯恩女士坐在那里震惊得发呆，而科马罗夫教授则持续了大约五分钟s、 “文件说。</p><p> That September, Comaroff allegedly preyed on Kilburn at an annual brunch at his home, putting his hand on her lower back and telling her he was disappointed she wasn’t drinking alcohol. When Kilburn began to leave the party, Comaroff followed her and “hugged her forcibly and kissed her on the mouth without her consent,” the lawsuit says. When she pushed him away and wiped her mouth, she saw Comaroff smiling at her.</p><p>那年9月，据说科马罗夫在家里一年一度的早午餐会上吃了凯尔本，把手放在她的下背部，告诉她，他对她没有喝酒感到失望。诉讼称，当吉尔本开始离开派对时，科马罗夫跟着她，“未经她同意，强行拥抱她并亲吻她的嘴”。当她推开他，擦了擦嘴时，她看到科马罗夫朝她微笑。</p><p> “Harvard allowed Professor Comaroff’s behavior to continue for two years—subjecting Ms. Kilburn to a continuing nightmare that included more forced kissing, groping, persistent invitations to socialize alone off-campus, and coercive control,” the lawsuit alleges. “When Ms. Kilburn tried to avoid Professor Comaroff, he forbade her to work with her other advisor.”</p><p>该诉讼称，“哈佛大学允许科马罗夫教授的行为持续两年，让基尔伯恩陷入持续不断的噩梦，包括更多的强迫接吻、摸索、持续邀请她在校外单独社交，以及强制控制。”。“当吉尔本试图避开科马罗夫教授时，科马罗夫教授禁止她与其他导师合作。”</p><p> In May 2019, Kilburn complained to Harvard’s Title IX Office, which apparently didn’t investigate her claims but allegedly admitted it was well aware of Comaroff’s behavior.</p><p>2019年5月，Kilburn向哈佛大学第九篇办公室投诉，该办公室显然没有调查她的说法，但据称承认它非常了解Comaroff的行为。</p><p> “In fact, a Harvard Title IX Resource Coordinator referred Ms. Kilburn to one of Professor Comaroff’s other victims: the graduate student who reported similar abuse two years earlier. Professor Comaroff, meanwhile, continued teaching and mentoring students,” the complaint alleges.</p><p>“事实上，一位哈佛大学第九章资源协调员将Kilburn女士介绍给了科马罗夫教授的另一位受害者：两年前报告过类似虐待行为的研究生。与此同时，科马罗夫教授继续教授和指导学生，”诉状称。</p><p> The women argue that Harvard only launched an investigation into Comaroff in May 2020, after the  Crimson and the  Chronicle of Higher Education reported on their claims against the professor and asked the Title IX Office for comment.</p><p>这些女性辩称，哈佛大学只是在2020年5月才对科马罗夫展开调查，当时《深红》和《高等教育纪事报》报道了她们对这位教授的指控，并要求第九篇办公室置评。</p><p> That’s when Title IX Officer Seth Avakian allegedly informed the women that he’d filed a formal complaint with Harvard’s ODR. But, according to the lawsuit, Avakian “openly disparaged the ODR process” and told Kilburn that “reporting to the press would be more impactful.”</p><p>就在那时，第九头衔官员塞思·阿瓦基安（Seth Avakian）据称通知这些女性，他已向哈佛大学的ODR提交了正式投诉。但是，根据诉讼，阿瓦基安“公开贬低ODR过程”，并告诉基尔伯恩“向媒体报道会更有影响力”</p><p> Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian also supposedly encouraged the women to speak to the  Harvard  Crimson, saying “that would give Harvard a reason to act.”</p><p>人类学主席Ajantha Subramanian据说还鼓励这些女性向哈佛大学深红学院发表演讲，称“这将给哈佛大学一个行动的理由”</p><p> “Ms. Kilburn, Ms. Czerwienski, and Ms. Mandava had been reluctant to go public with their stories,” the lawsuit states. “But, because Harvard’s faculty, Title IX Resource Coordinator, and top-level decision-making officials now disparaged the ODR process and urged them to go to the press, they did so.”</p><p>“基尔伯恩女士、切尔温斯基女士和曼达瓦女士一直不愿公开他们的故事，”诉讼称。“但是，由于哈佛大学的教员、第九篇资源协调员和高层决策官员现在贬低ODR过程，并敦促他们向媒体报道，他们这样做了。”</p><p> Their lawsuit points to the alleged harassment the publications exposed, saying that “for over a decade, Harvard willfully ignored sexual harassment complaints against not just Professor Comaroff, but also against two Department Chairs, Gary Urton and Theodore Bestor.</p><p>他们的诉讼指向这些出版物揭露的所谓骚扰，称“十多年来，哈佛故意无视针对科马罗夫教授的性骚扰投诉，也无视针对两位系主任加里·乌顿和西奥多·贝斯特的性骚扰投诉。</p><p> “As a result, from 2007 to 2018—11 of the past 14 years—the Department was chaired by men who, according to these reports, leveraged their power to prey on women students and junior faculty.”</p><p>“因此，从2007年到2018年11月，在过去14年中，该系由男性担任主席，根据这些报告，男性利用自己的权力掠夺女学生和初级教师。”</p><p> The lawsuit also details multiple sexual harassment complaints Comaroff faced during his decades of teaching at The University of Chicago, where he also allegedly had affairs with his students and retaliated against them before Harvard hired him in 2012.</p><p>这起诉讼还详细描述了科马洛夫在芝加哥大学的几十年教学中所面临的多重性骚扰指控，他还据称与他的学生发生了关系，并在2012哈佛大学雇用他之前对他们进行报复。</p><p> According to the lawsuit, Comaroff “continued to harass students with impunity” at Harvard.</p><p>根据诉讼，科马罗夫在哈佛大学“继续骚扰学生而不受惩罚”。</p><p> During an October 2017 dinner attended by faculty and grad students, Comaroff was allegedly so bold as to compare himself to Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie producer and convicted rapist. “They’re coming for me next!” Comaroff said, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>在2017年10月的一次有教职员工和研究生参加的晚宴上，据称科马罗夫如此大胆地将自己与哈维·韦恩斯坦（Harvey Weinstein）相提并论。哈维·韦恩斯坦是一位名誉扫地的电影制片人，也是一名被定罪的强奸犯。“他们下一个要来找我！”根据诉讼，科马罗夫说。</p><p> His wife Jean then allegedly scorned accusers who report serial predators like Weinstein, saying, “Whatever happened to rolling with the punches?”</p><p>据称，他的妻子琼随后嘲笑了那些举报像韦恩斯坦这样的连环捕食者的原告，并说，“拳打脚踢到底发生了什么？”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags
