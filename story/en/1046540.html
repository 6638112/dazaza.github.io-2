Because, as we’ll see with Clubhouse, moderation is becoming a challenge for modern tech platforms - both large and small.</p><p> 我为什么要告诉你呢？因为，正如我们将在Clubhouse上看到的那样，适度成为现代技术平台（无论大小）的挑战。</p><p> In this newsletter, I’ll also be touching on some product psychology concepts that Clubhouse has used to attract a global audience and build incredible levels of hype, including variable rewards, anticipatory rewards, and the scarcity principle.</p><p> 在本新闻通讯中，我还将介绍Clubhouse用来吸引全球受众并建立令人难以置信的炒作水平的一些产品心理学概念，包括可变奖励，预期奖励和稀缺性原则。</p><p>    If you’re active on the tech scene, you’ve probably heard of the hottest new app,  Clubhouse. With a recent valuation of around US$1 billion (despite only having launched in April 2020 and being in beta mode), it’s all the tech industry is abuzz about.</p><p>    如果您活跃在技术领域，则可能听说过最热门的新应用Clubclub。最近的估值约为10亿美元（尽管仅在2020年4月推出并处于beta模式），所有科技行业对此都很关注。</p><p>   Clubhouse is essentially an audio-only social media app that feels like an interactive podcast. You can pop in and out of “rooms” (except private rooms, which are - naturally - private) that are usually focused on a particular topic or theme (e.g. female entrepreneurs, Sydney startups, etc). The rooms are run by volunteer moderators who have the power to make other moderators, as well as bring audience members onto the “stage” where they can speak. If speaking isn’t your thing, you can just listen to the chat.</p><p>   Clubhouse本质上是一个纯音频的社交媒体应用程序，感觉就像是一个交互式播客。您可以弹出或退出通常专门针对特定主题或主题的“房间”（自然是私人的“私人房间”除外）（例如，女企业家，悉尼初创企业等）。这些房间由自愿主持人主持，他们有权任命其他主持人，并将听众带到他们可以发言的“舞台”上。如果您不想说话，可以直接听聊天。 </p><p> The appeal of the app is supposed to be that you can drop in on authentic, often unpolished, discussions around topics that interest you - it’s sometimes intimate, and the casual format feels like you’re meeting people at a house party. With two million users, including high-profile celebrities like John Mayer, Oprah Winfrey, Ashton Kutcher, and Drake, and well-known industry heavy-weights like Naval, Ryan Hoover, Gary Vee, and Marc Andreessen, Clubhouse is flying high.</p><p>该应用程序的吸引力在于，您可以围绕真实的，经常未经修饰的主题感兴趣的话题进行讨论-有时是亲密的，随意的感觉就像是在参加家庭聚会。 Clubhouse拥有200万用户，其中包括约翰·梅耶（John Mayer），奥普拉·温弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey），阿什顿·库彻（Ashton Kutcher）和德雷克（Drake）等知名人士，以及海军，瑞安·胡佛（Ryan Hoover），加里·维（Gary Vee）和马克·安德森（Marc Andreessen）等行业知名重量级人物，Clubhouse飞速发展。</p><p>   One of the key drivers of Clubhouse’s current success is their exclusive, invite-only approach to its users. Clubhouse has limited the number of people on the platform by making it so that you can only join if (1) you have an iPhone (an Android version will be released at a later date), and (2) someone invites you…and boy, are invites hard to come by.</p><p>   Clubhouse当前成功的主要推动力之一是其独有的，仅邀请用户使用的方法。 Clubhouse通过限制它来限制平台上的人数，只有在以下情况下您才能加入：（1）您拥有iPhone（稍后会发布Android版本），以及（2）有人邀请您…和男孩，很难被邀请。</p><p>  When you are invited by someone, you are usually given one invite to hand out yourself - but more interaction on the app (like moderating rooms) will reward you with more invites to hand out (cleverly encouraging us to spend more time on the app). This seems to be variable - most people report only having one invitation when they first sign up but for some reason, I got two. Further, the number of additional invites you get for engaging seem to be quite random.</p><p>  当您被某人邀请时，通常会向您发出一次分发自己的邀请-但在应用程序上进行更多互动（例如主持房间）会奖励您发出更多邀请（明智地鼓励我们在应用程序上花费更多时间） 。这似乎是可变的-大多数人在首次注册时报告只收到一个邀请，但由于某种原因，我收到了两个邀请。此外，您参与的其他邀请数量似乎是随机的。</p><p> This is a solid tactic.  In his 1950s research, psychologist B.F. Skinner discovered the power of variable rewards. He rewarded lab mice that pressed a lever by giving them food, and found that varying the rewards (i.e. sometimes giving food and sometimes not) actually resulted in  even more compulsive lever-pressing behaviour. This behaviour continued even after the rewards stopped coming. In other words, rewards are more powerful when they were unpredictable.</p><p> 这是一个可靠的策略。心理学家B.F. Skinner在1950年代的研究中发现了可变奖励的力量。他通过给老鼠喂食来奖励它们给老鼠按杠杆，并发现改变奖励（即有时给食物而有时不给食物）实际上会导致更具强迫性的按杠杆行为。即使奖励停止了，这种行为仍在继续。换句话说，当奖励不可预测时，奖励会更强大。</p><p> After realising I had randomly been awarded an extra three invites (I don’t know if it was one room in particular that led to this, or because I was given stage time in another room, or because I have been in a number of rooms), I found myself wanting to spend more time on the app, trying different things, to see if I could get more invites.  (Even knowing the variable reward principle in theory didn’t stop me from this behaviour! 😅 )</p><p> 意识到之后，我随机获得了额外的三份邀请（我不知道是不是特别是一个房间导致了这个邀请，还是因为我被安排在另一个房间里上演，或者因为我去过很多房间），我发现自己想花更多的时间在该应用上，尝试其他方法，看看是否能获得更多邀请。 （即使知道理论上的可变奖励原则也没有阻止我这种行为！😅）</p><p> I posted a post on a product management Facebook group asking if anyone else was on the app so that I could connect with them, and I’d estimate that 35%-40% of the responses were from people who were desperate to get an invitation.  The unfortunate reality is that most people are unlikely to invite those that they don’t know, because you’re required to have the other person’s number and give out your own (not sure how many people like handing out their phone number to strangers), and also because each user’s profile clearly states who invited them (big thanks to  Lauren Capelin!), so you probably want to be a bit picky about who your name is associated with.</p><p> 我在一个产品管理Facebook小组中发布了一个帖子，询问是否有人在该应用上，以便我可以与他们建立联系，我估计35％-40％的回复来自那些迫切希望获得邀请的人。不幸的现实是，大多数人不太可能邀请他们不认识的人，因为您需要拥有对方的电话号码并自己分配（不确定有多少人喜欢向陌生人分发电话号码） ，还因为每个用户的个人资料都清楚地说明了邀请他们的人（感谢Lauren Capelin！），所以您可能希望对与您的姓名相关的人有所挑剔。</p><p>  If you can’t get your hands on an invite, Clubhouse has cleverly allowed people to reserve their usernames (on iPhones only at the moment). I’ve heard that if you reserve your username, your phone contacts who are already on Clubhouse can be notified that you’re waiting for an invite, and extend one to you that way.</p><p>  如果您无法获得邀请，Clubhouse会巧妙地允许人们保留其用户名（目前仅在iPhone上）。据了解，如果您保留用户名，可以通知您已经在Clubhouse上的电话联系人正在等待邀请，并以此方式向您发送邀请。 </p><p> Why bother doing this though?  Studies have shown that it’s not necessarily a reward that makes the pleasure centres of our brains light up, but rather, the anticipation of it. By reserving your username, you are not only somewhat invested in the app already, but you are also anticipating the reward of getting on the platform, contributing to its hype. This reward anticipation activates the release of dopamine before you even get your invite.</p><p>为什么还要这么做呢？研究表明，不一定能使我们大脑的愉悦中心发光，而是对它的期待。通过保留您的用户名，您不仅已经在该应用程序上有所投资，而且还期待着进入该平台的收益，并为该平台的炒作做出了贡献。这种奖励预期会在您收到邀请之前激活多巴胺的释放。</p><p>  I’m not six years old. Why do people care about being part of an exclusive club?</p><p>  我还不到六岁。人们为什么关心成为独家俱乐部的一部分？</p><p> This is a classic example of the scarcity principle: the more difficult it is to obtain something, the more valuable it becomes. If you’ve ever seen the “Hurry! 1 room left!” warning sign on any hotel booking website, you’ll be familiar with this.</p><p> 这是稀缺性原则的一个典型例子：获得某种东西越困难，它就变得越有价值。如果您曾经看过“快点！还剩1个房间！”任何酒店预订网站上的警告标志，您都将熟悉。</p><p>  In a  study by Worchel, Lee, and Adewole, volunteers were given a chocolate chip cookie to taste and rate. In some cases, the cookie was drawn from a jar with lots of cookies, while in others, from a jar with only two. For some participants, the number of cookies in the jar were increased, and for others, the number was decreased. Despite the fact that all of the cookies were the same, volunteers rated the cookie drawn from the jar containing two cookies as better than the one from the jar with 10 cookies. In fact, they went so far as to rate the cookies that had gone from many to few as more valuable than those that were few to begin with!</p><p>  在Worchel，Lee和Adewole进行的一项研究中，为志愿者提供了巧克力曲奇，以品尝和评分。在某些情况下，该Cookie是从装有大量Cookie的罐子中提取的，而在其他情况下，则是从只有两个Cookie的罐子中提取的。对于某些参与者，罐子中的cookie数量增加了，而对于其他参与者，数量减少了。尽管所有的cookie都是相同的，但志愿者对从装有两个cookie的罐子中抽取的cookie的评价要好于从带有10个cookie的罐子中抽取的cookie。实际上，他们甚至对那些从一开始就很少有价值的Cookie进行评分，将其价值由原来的许多提高到了很少！</p><p> Clubhouse takes advantage of the scarcity principle through its exclusive, invite-only approach that has helped it create a viral sensation (kind of like Gmail back in the day - that’s probably showing how old I am!). With this comes the added benefit that a number of the users who are on the platform are genuinely enthusiastic first adopters, making meaningful contributions to the rooms and hosting lively discussions. This is incredibly important to any product that relies on creator content - if you have crappy content, users won’t stay. So by limiting numbers to those who are passionate about the concept (and presumably more willing to invest their time in creating better content), the entire platform is elevated.</p><p> Clubhouse通过其稀有性原则，通过其专有的，仅受邀请的方法来帮助其创造一种病毒式的轰动感（就像以前的Gmail一样-可能表明我已经多大了！）。随之而来的另一个好处是，平台上的许多用户都是真正的热情第一批用户，为会议室做出了有意义的贡献并进行了生动的讨论。对于任何依赖创作者内容的产品，这都是极其重要的-如果您的内容不实，用户将不会留下来。因此，通过将人数限制在那些热衷于此概念的人（大概是更愿意花时间来创建更好的内容）上，整个平台将得到提升。</p><p>  There has been some chatter about how the app is essentially a *excuse my French* circle jerk for Silicon Valley tech bros. One person commented that Clubhouse was a place for VCs to talk about Clubhouse. Others have raised concerns about whether there’s diversity on the app.</p><p>  关于该应用程序本质上如何成为硅谷科技兄弟的“法国人”混蛋，已经引起了一些热议。有人评论说，俱乐部会所是风投人士谈论俱乐部会所的地方。其他人则担心应用程序是否多样化。</p><p> In my experience so far, I’ve seen a number of what (on the surface) would appear to be people from marginalised / under-represented communities in the rooms, but I haven’t really seen an abundance as speakers - and fewer still as moderators. That might just be a reflection of the rooms I’ve been in (which tend to be tech focused), or maybe it is a reflection of the invite-only approach, which has a danger of creating echo chambers full of like-minded people. It’s hard not to imagine private rooms being created full of flat-earthers, conspiracy theorists, Proud Boys, and extremists, all propagating misinformation.</p><p> 到目前为止，根据我的经验，我已经看到许多（表面上）看起来是来自房间中边缘化/代表性不足的社区的人，但是我并没有真正看到很多演讲者，而且仍然很少作为主持人。这可能只是我所去过的房间的反映（倾向于以技术为中心），或者可能只是邀请方式的反映，这可能会造成充满志趣相投的人的回声室。很难想象私人房间里充斥着平庸的人，阴谋论者，骄傲的男孩和极端主义者，这些人都在传播错误的信息。 </p><p>  Now this is where things get interesting. We’ve already seen Facebook and Twitter making the move to suspend Donald Trump’s accounts, we’ve seen AWS kick Parler off its servers - so it seems (at least for now) that the trend in big tech is towards being more open-minded to moderating content on their platforms.</p><p>现在，事情变得有趣了。我们已经看到Facebook和Twitter采取了暂停Donald Trump账户的举动，我们已经看到AWS将Parler从其服务器上撤下-因此（至少目前如此）大型技术的趋势似乎正在变得更加开放审核他们平台上的内容。</p><p> But in the case of Clubhouse, most of the rooms are run by volunteer moderators with no real “moderator training”. Each club and each room are permitted to set up their own rules, and recording and transcribing conversations in rooms without every participant’s permission is strictly against Clubhouse’s terms and conditions.</p><p> 但是对于Clubhouse，大多数房间都是由自愿主持人经营的，没有真正的“主持人培训”。每个俱乐部和每个房间都可以设置自己的规则，未经每个参与者的允许，在房间中记录和记录谈话内容完全违反Clubhouse的条款和条件。</p><p> From what I’ve seen, the vast majority of the conversations are not recorded, which begs the question: how will Clubhouse moderate what’s being said?</p><p> 从我所看到的情况来看，绝大多数对话都没有记录下来，这引出了一个问题：Clubhouse将如何审核所说的内容？</p><p>   The first is to rely on users reporting rooms with bad behaviour. Apparently right now, a room can be reported by users, and if enough people report it, then it will be shadow banned (i.e. does not appear in search or on the home page). The problem with this idea is that a number of people could simply report a room because they don’t agree with what is being said.</p><p>   首先是依靠用户报告不良行为的房间。显然，现在，用户可以报告一个房间，如果有足够的人报告它，那么该房间将被禁止显示（即未出现在搜索结果或主页上）。这个想法的问题在于，许多人可能只是报告房间，因为他们不同意所讲的内容。</p><p> One moderator in a room I was listening to said that he had hosted a LGBTQI+ chat with celebrity Perez Hilton, which attracted a number of homophobic users who were allowed onto the stage by the moderators (who obviously had no idea of their views) and were extremely vocal and abusive. What’s to stop them reporting the room and getting it automatically shadow banned just because they don’t like it?</p><p> 我正在听的一个房间的主持人说，他与名人Perez Hilton主持了一次LGBTQI +聊天，吸引了许多同性恋用户，主持人允许他们进入舞台（他们显然不知道他们的看法），并且极度发声和辱骂。是什么阻止他们报告房间并仅仅因为他们不喜欢它而自动禁用阴影？</p><p> You could say that perhaps rooms that have been reported could be reviewed by moderators - but this obviously doesn’t work when the audio is unrecorded. Furthermore, some rooms are private, and it goes against the sanctity of such rooms to have their audio reviewed. Even if you were to record the audio, some of these rooms go on for hours (I’ve literally sat in on a few that have gone on for 6+ hours), so having someone trawl through the recording would likely be a costly and time-consuming exercise.</p><p> 您可以说主持人可能会审查已举报的房间-但是，当未录制音频时，这显然不起作用。此外，一些房间是私人的，并且对这些房间的声音进行审查有违其神圣性。即使您要录制音频，这些房间中的一些也要开几个小时（我实际上是坐在几个已经开了6个多小时的房间里），所以让某人拖拉整个录音可能会很昂贵，而且耗时的运动。</p><p> Perhaps you could have a transcription logged at the end of the chat? The problem with this is that audio isn’t just about the words that are said - it’s also about tone (sarcasm being an obvious case in point) and even something as innocuous as a snide cough could reflect ill intentions - but this nuance won’t be captured on a transcript.</p><p> 也许您可以在聊天结束时记录转录？这样做的问题在于，音频不仅与所说的话有关，还与语气有关（讽刺是一个明显的例子），甚至像咳嗽一样无害的东西也可能反映出不良意图-但这种细微差别不会赢得人们的注意。不能记录在成绩单上。 </p><p>  And then, of course, there’s the question of whether recording should be done by the platform at all. The drawcard of Clubhouse is that you can have a casual, unedited conversation; something that isn’t recorded and uploaded to the Internet for posterity to hear and retrospectively judge you on. Perhaps a solution here would be that only Clubhouse employees  (sidenote: they are  hiring for their Trust &amp; Safety team) should be allowed to listen to the recordings.</p><p>然后，当然存在一个问题，即是否应该由平台完全进行记录。 Clubhouse的吸引力在于您可以进行随意的，未经编辑的对话；未记录的内容并上传到Internet上以供后代聆听并追溯您的判断。也许这里的解决方案是仅允许会所员工（旁注：他们正在为其信任与安全团队雇用）听录音。</p><p> But this is likely to trigger people’s sensitivities towards privacy issues.  As I reported in last week’s newsletter, WhatsApp’s change of T&amp;Cs caused an online furore about user privacy rights, not to mention caused a significant increase in the number of downloads of its competitors. The mere mention that Clubhouse will record audio conversations for review may be enough to undo all the hype they’re building.</p><p> 但这可能会触发人们对隐私问题的敏感度。正如我在上周的时事通讯中报道的那样，WhatsApp更改了T＆amp; C引起了网上对用户隐私权的热烈抗议，更不用说引起了竞争对手下载量的大幅增加。仅提及Clubhouse将记录音频对话以供审核，就足以消除他们正在进行的所有宣传。</p><p> Maybe one day we’ll have an audio-based AI willy detector that’s good enough to handle moderation. Until then, it’s going to be an interesting ride.</p><p> 也许有一天，我们将有一款基于音频的AI Willy检测器，足以应付审核。在那之前，这将是一个有趣的旅程。</p><p>  PS. I ended up changing the newsletter name to  This Week in Tech. As much as I loved Fix My Printer and the story behind it (which is  here), I figured it didn’t make SEO sense. Plus, some people were expecting hardware tutorials. Sorry to those folks! 😂</p><p>  PS。我最终将新闻通讯的名称更改为“ This Week in Tech”。尽管我很喜欢“修复我的打印机”及其背后的故事（在这里），但我认为它没有SEO的意义。另外，有些人期待硬件教程。对不起那些人！ 😂</p><p>    For those who want to understand why they can’t convince Nonna that Donald Trump was a bad President:  Why Facts Don’t Change Minds by James Clear. In the words of Leo Tolstoy,  “The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him.”</p><p>    对于那些想了解为什么他们无法说服唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）是糟糕的总统的人：詹姆斯·克莱尔（James Clear）为何事实不能改变思想。用托尔斯泰（Leo Tolstoy）的话说：“如果最聪明的人还没有对它们做出任何构想，就可以向他们解释最困难的主题。但是如果最有才华的人坚定地说服他已经毫无疑问地知道了摆在他面前的东西，那么最简单的事情就无法向最聪明的人阐明。”</p><p> For those who have too many newsletters in their inbox:  The T-Shaped Information Diet by Nick deWilde on how you should be intentional when curating your information diet. After all,  “Our attention spans are finite, which raises the opportunity cost for subscribing to any given source. The challenge is to weed out sub-optimal information streams to make room for those that consistently deliver valuable insight.”</p><p> 对于那些收件箱中的新闻通讯过多的人：Nick deWilde撰写的T型信息饮食，介绍在策划信息饮食时应如何有意识地进行。毕竟，“我们的关注范围是有限的，这增加了订阅任何给定资源的机会成本。挑战在于淘汰次优的信息流，以便为那些始终如一地提供有价值的见识的人腾出空间。”</p><p> For those who love some of the product psychology concepts in today’s article: The book    Hooked by Nir Eyal.</p><p> 对于那些喜欢今天文章中的某些产品心理学概念的人：Nir Eyal着迷的书。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://thisweekintech.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-clubhouse">https://thisweekintech.substack.com/p/welcome-to-the-clubhouse</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/来到/">#来到</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/club/">#club</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/邀请/">#邀请</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
