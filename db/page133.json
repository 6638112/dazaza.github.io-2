", "note_en": "Personal data will continue to flow unimpeded from the EU to the UK, the bloc&#39;s member states have agreed in a unanimous decision that will relieve many businesses on both sides of the Channel of spending much time and money on complex legal paperwork.\n All 27 member states\u00a0 voted in favor of granting the UK an adequacy decision\u00a0\u2013 a special status that recognizes that the country&#39;s data laws do as good a job as the European GDPR at protecting personal information.\n     Countries that are granted adequacy gain the right to receive and process the personal data of EU citizens, which many organizations rely on to do business.\n  The UK&#39;s departure from the EU has meant that the country has ceased to be protected by the GDPR, and instead relies on domestic laws to manage citizens&#39; personal data. Those laws had to be assessed by EU regulators to ensure that they meet the bloc&#39;s standards on data protection.\n Without an adequacy decision, organizations would have had to design special contracts called Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure that they were lawfully processing the data of European citizens. Economists estimate that the total cost of implementing those new contracts to keep data flowing legally could amount to \u00a31.6 billion ($2.14 billion), with smaller firms hit the hardest.\n Achieving adequacy, therefore, was a key part of Brexit negotiations. Earlier this year, the European Commission\u00a0 published a draft document outlining the details of an adequacy decision for the UK, which determined that UK laws do indeed provide a level of data protection that is equivalent to the GDPR.\n   The decision was approved by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in April and has now been green-lighted by member states, meaning that adequacy is on course to be implemented. Unsurprisingly, organisations and businesses across the EU and the UK have welcomed the announcement.\n &#34;A positive decision on data adequacy is a huge relief for thousands of businesses across the UK \u2013 over half of businesses surveyed by the DMA just before Brexit stated this was important for the future of their business,&#34; says Chris Combemale, the CEO of the Data and Marketing Association (DMA). &#34;The government estimated that without adequacy the UK economy could lose up to \u00a385 billion, so this announcement is a significant boost after a challenging year.&#34;\n The volume of personal data that is exchanged between the UK and the EU is significant and spans virtually all industries \u2013 think legal and financial services, but also e-commerce, human resources, and even healthcare.\n The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM), for example, stressed that the delivery of cross-border health and social care for thousands of European citizens relies on data flowing without restrictions with the UK. Health data transfers are also key to advance scientific research.\n &#34;With this (adequacy) decision, the EU and the UK can continue to benefit from the continued secure flow of personal data to facilitate the development of new treatments and to improve patient safety and care across Europe,&#34;\u00a0 said FEAM in a statement.\n While adequacy has been granted to the UK for the time being, however, the decision only applies to UK data law as it is written now. Also known as the &#34;UK GDPR&#34;, the country&#39;s domestic rules are currently modelled on European law and as such, provide a high level of data protection for citizens. But if that were to change, the EU has made clear that it could re-evaluate the decision and withdraw the agreement.\n The issue might become a point of contention. Over the past few months, the UK has repeatedly sent signals that it aims to\u00a0 seize the Brexit opportunity to diverge from the standards set by the bloc&#39;s GDPR\u00a0in an effort to boost growth and innovation.\n &#34;Adequacy was received on the basis that the UK would not diverge and not change the level of protection,&#34; Estelle Mass\u00e9, senior policy analyst and data protection lead at digital rights organisation Access Now, tells ZDNet. &#34;If the UK government were to follow through with this, then the whole legal system on which the EU has based its adequacy determination will no longer be in place and will need to be re-evaluated.&#34;\n     Just days before the EU member states voted in favor of adequacy,\u00a0 a government taskforce submitted a report to the UK prime minister with recommendations to reform the country&#39;s regulatory landscape\u00a0\u2013 including some changes to the UK GDPR.\n Describing the GDPR as &#34;out of date&#34;, the taskforce called for the government to leverage its &#34;newfound regulatory freedom&#34; to replace GDPR with a new UK-made framework for data protection.\n According to the report, GDPR compliance can cost businesses up to 30 working days-worth of time a year, and as such constitutes a significant barrier to innovation and growth. To create a more business-friendly environment, said the taskforce, the UK should implement data laws that are more proportionate, and place lower compliance burdens on smaller organisations.\n In particular, the report&#39;s authors called for the removal of a GDPR provision that lets citizens refuse to be subjected to a decision based solely on an automated decision-making system \u2013 which means that organisations must always have an alternative, human-based process in place to use as an alternative.\n  Instead, the taskforce suggested that automated decisions should be subjected to a test determining whether they are in the public&#39;s interest, and whether they meet critical fairness and transparency criteria.\n The authors also pointed to the GDPR&#39;s restrictions on using data for any purposes other than those for which it was collected, and argued that this means that organisations cannot experiment with data to understand its potential value in new applications.\n The report&#39;s recommendations are yet another red flag for some in the EU. &#34;If this is removed, it could potentially mean that the UK wants to be able to develop the use of automated decision-making systems in the public and private sectors in a way that people couldn&#39;t say no,&#34; says Mass\u00e9.\n &#34;The UK is completely free to take that path is they find it is more beneficial for them. But there will be consequences: if the UK chooses to diverge a lot from the EU, then it will lose its adequacy, and all the industries that rely on exchanging data between the EU and the UK will be in trouble.&#34;\n The next few months are likely to reveal how far the UK wishes to go in transforming the country&#39;s domestic rules on data protection \u2013 and crucially, how much leeway the EU will be willing to give. On both sides, says Mass\u00e9, the outcome of the strategy is still unclear.\n &#34;It&#39;s really quite incomprehensible to work so much to secure this adequacy and when just about to get it, to also give indication to the EU that it may change,&#34;

The subjects are evergreen and deals with the essence of investing, mental models, and concepts.\n      Inflation has been a trending subject for the past few months of 2021, and it gets all the more heated as we see recent Consumer Price Index measurements that show ~5% rise, along with higher inflation expectations from the Fed.\n Whether inflation will go rampant or not is a very complex subject beyond this article. This article assumes you did your own research and got some conclusions on incoming inflation, and you want to know how best to hedge against it.\n Determining how much inflation you think is coming and managing this risk is a crucial step. It will decide how much of your portfolio will be devoted to inflation hedges and how you&#39;ll pay for &#34;opportunity cost&#34; - for example, whether you should pull out 20% or 100% off of a promising growth company you&#39;re invested in.\n  When looking at asset allocation statistically, the details are often hiding behind big numbers. So, for example, a statement like &#34;gold is a great inflation hedge&#34; is factually accurate but might not be right at certain times.\n What if everyone already fears inflation, and the media pumped gold as a hedge so much so that gold at this point had a huge run-up that makes it an overprices hedge that will be counter-productive?\n Another example might be real estate - it is generally a good vehicle against inflation. But if there&#39;s a particular housing crisis in California that got their real estate prices too high already, buying a house there won&#39;t be a good investment regardless.\n You might be competing with much bigger players than you like  most institutional investors are now buying real estate in masses.\n  While we can&#39;t say that all stocks suffer from inflation, the data shows more volatility and more downturns for stocks with inflations.\n I collected all the data since 1928 about inflation and the S&amp;P 500 (or its equivalent) returns. Here&#39;s a visualization of the results:\n   As inflation rises above 3.5%, we see much more downturns, while times of stable inflation, 1-2%, have much fewer downturns.\n This doesn&#39;t mean that the stock market will go down with inflation, but it means that there are significantly higher chances of that happening and higher chances for individual stocks to suffer.\n  Understanding what is in inflation that harms productive companies is vital for the bigger picture.\n Inflation impact different businesses in different ways, and covering it all is impossible. Instead, I&#39;ll cover some common cases to give you an idea and a framework of thought when analyzing other companies:\n  Let&#39;s say you have a lemonade stand, and your capital expenditure is mostly lemons. In the first year, you buy 1,000$ lemons to produce 1,100$ worth of lemonade that you sell.\n That&#39;s a 10% margin on regular days. Next year, you can choose to reinvest and expand your business, buying 1,100$ worth of lemons to sell 1,210$ of lemonade.\n  You&#39;ve got 1,100$ after the first year. But since inflation this year was 10%, those 1,100$ buys you the same amount of lemons as 1,000$ used to buy the year before. So inflation ate up all your margins.\n This is an oversimplification, but it effectively demonstrates the effect rising prices have on businesses. But, of course, there are caveats - when will you raise the lemonade price, whether you can raise it at all in the face of competition, etc. All affecting the outcome, but the story remains the same.\n  Many growth companies today are losing money as a strategy. Often for every 1$ they spend on marketing, bring back a customer that buys for &gt;1$ through the customer&#39;s lifetime with the company, making it worthwhile to spend as much as possible now to grab as much of the market earlier.\n Inflation will not stop these otherwise great companies, but it will require an adjustment to the growth models.\n Marketing platforms and sales processes are getting affected by inflation almost instantaneously. That means that these companies will have to spend more on marketing in an inflationary environment to get the same results.\n All while their pricing power is limited. Customers have contracts pre-signed for years often, with limited optionality for price uplifts even when the current contract ends (as these are enterprise contracts for the most part).\n Higher expenses to grow, with lower real-value income from all existing recurring customers, will harm the growth of the growth companies. However, they will still grow, albeit slower, and it needs to be accounted for.\n   Why inflation is bad news for SASS, money-losing, but great, growth companies  Super-quick thoughts \ud83e\uddf5 $SNOW  $MNDY  $ASAN  $PLTR\n\u2014 Snir David (long term investing) (@snird)  June 18, 2021\n  The last example is delayed inflation, which is somewhat demonstrated in the example above for growth companies.\n Sometimes, prices that a company pays to produce their products (including wages) rise before the company can raise their product prices, creating disparity.\n Stranded in a long-term agreement with predetermined prices, or a crowd that isn&#39;t accustomed to the new price tag, so it avoids the product.\n Furniture company selling to offices in a catalog price for a year, while lumber prices jump 3x on them in the meantime.\n Hairdresser pays higher rent and other living costs, while the crowd prefers to cut their hair at home, as paying 10$ more for a haircut sounds exaggerated to them.\n   Gold is well known for being a good inflation hedge. It&#39;s under limited supply, has underlying value for real-world usage, and has been historically good storage of value, so people trust it.\n I collected the prices of gold through time compared to inflation to visualize how this kind of asset if working:\n   As you can see, gold prices are rising just before inflation increases - as the market always trades on the future, so the action is always slightly before reality.\n But it also typically fall right after the highs of inflation. Thus, making timing a crucial step if you want to trade gold. The market always overprices, both in the ups and the downs of unproductive assets.\n But over time, gold keeps its value and corrects itself. Thus, making it a good hold against inflation, but a total 0% real return if you hold it for the long-term, and not just temporarily as an inflation hedge.\n The same story is told for any other commodity. However, right now, we see other craziness in prices of things like lumber and tomato that has more to do with turbulence in the global shipping and production system rather than a reaction to inflation alone.\n    To drive the point forward that commodities are similar to gold, here are the lumber prices in the 1980s inflation spike:\n    The behavior is very similar to gold. It rises until ~1980 then it drops. While in the long-term, it keeps its underlying value against inflation.\n  There is something to be said about Bitcoin, but I&#39;ll keep it short, even though I know I&#39;ll get a lot of heat for that.\n Unproductive assets like gold and commodities are not like Bitcoin for a simple reason: they have intrinsic, underlying value. There are industrial uses for gold and obviously for lumber. Bitcoin doesn&#39;t have any use other than its existence.\n We can&#39;t compare Bitcoin to gold, but it doesn&#39;t mean it invalidates Bitcoin as a whole. It just invalidates the usage of Bitcoin as an unproductive asset to hedge against inflation. Whether there are other reasons for Bitcoin to take the world by storm is another discussion.\n  If we take the lessons from stocks (productive companies) and gold, commodities (unproductive assets), we can see why real estate is considered the best investment for inflation.\n Real estate is productive through rent with minimal capital expenditure. So you will produce more money following inflation without harming the production by the need to put more money in.\n Real estate is limited and real, like gold. Any real asset, as we saw, is rising in price alongside inflation.\n Real estate is the best against inflation  overall. In the short term, when inflation initially rises, commodities will go higher much faster. But as we saw, they fall back down after. Real estate increases more moderately but doesn&#39;t have the fallback later, making it overall more stable and delivering higher returns in the long term.\n Here&#39;s a graph from an  excellent research paper from state street that demonstrates the performance of assets in different inflation quantiles (the higher quantile, the higher the inflation).\n    REITs perform very well in every quantile, making them the best hedge against inflation for the long-term, providing good returns.\n P.S - I lied. There is something better than real estate - farms. For the same reasons, just better in every step. But as individual investors, we usually can&#39;t buy farms, unlike  Bill Gates that went on a massive purchase extravaganza, making him the biggest farmland owner in America.\n  There are other options, of course. However, I focused on the most prominent and reasonable ones for individual investors.\n Things like TIPS (bonds that follow inflation) naturally protect against inflation, but they come with a 1% coupon these days. Irrelevant. So as government bonds and others, all affected by the extremely low interest rate, I didn&#39;t touch here either.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0,assets", "title": "\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u6f14\u6297\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u8d44\u4ea7 ", "title_en": "Best performing assets against inflation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.the-investing-desk.com/blog/best-investments-for-inflation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0", "assets"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "06b661eea79be7f1260fc1574148c93f.jpg", "infoid": 1067448, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Bumble\uff0c\u5987\u5973\u8d1f\u8d23\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e3e\u63aa\u7684\u7ea6\u4f1a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u672c\u5468\u6682\u65f6\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\uff0c\u4ee5\u6253\u51fb\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u538b\u529b\u3002\n  \u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e3b\u7ba1\uff0c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u60e0\u7279\u5c3c\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u725b\u5fb7\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\uff06\uff0334;\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8054\u7cfb\u7740\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5026\u6020\uff06\uff0334;\n Bumble\u6bd4\u5927\u591a\u6570\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fd9\u788c\u7684\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u80a1\u5e02\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7528\u6237\u53f7\u7801\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e4\u6708\uff06\uff0334\u5ba3\u5e03;\u6240\u6709\u7684\u7b28\u62d9\u5458\u5de5\u90fd\u4f1a\u5728\u516d\u6708\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u4e00\u5468\u5047\u671f\u6709\u4e00\u5f20\u5df2\u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u8131\u673a;\n Bumble\u7684\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9047\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5458\u5de5\u4f11\u5047\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f11\u5047\u4e00\u5468\u3002\n  \u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u671f\u95f4\uff0cBumble\u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u671f\u95f4\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5237\u65b0\u4ee5\u67e5\u627e\u62fe\u53d6\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\n \u6839\u636e\u5176\u6700\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e0e3\u67083\u65e5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u671d\u9c9c\u5927\u9ec4\u8702\u548cBadoo\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u7528\u6237\u6570\u76ee\u5212\u5206\u4e3a30\uff05\uff0c\u6bd4\u53bb\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002 \n\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u7267\u7fa4\u5973\u58eb\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u572831\u5c81\u65f6\uff0c\u57282\u6708\u4efd\u4e3e\u884c\u5927\u9ec4\u8702\uff06\uff0339;

These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave.\n  Bumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up.\n The number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year,  according to its most recent set of results.\n Ms Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble&#39;s stock market debut in February.\n  She rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet &#34;a kinder, more accountable place&#34;.\n     Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd&#39;s quest to make the internet a &#34;kinder&#34; place extends to the company&#39;s head office. And then some.\n Back in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble&#39;s signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as &#34;you look bee-autiful honey&#34;. Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to &#34;shine bright like a diamond&#34;.\n It also boasts a &#34;Mommy Bar&#34; - described as a &#34;private lactation space&#34; by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and &#34;blowouts&#34; which the founder said showed &#34;appreciation for our busy bees&#34;.\n  Working hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done.\n Could the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don&#39;t hold out for free manicures though.\n  Workers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being.\n Earlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night.\n A spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: &#34;A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that&#39;s why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.&#34;\n Prior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November after  prolonged insomnia led to exhaustion.\n  Following his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health.\n  Bumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens.\n Twitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office.  That&#39;s despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that employees could work from home &#34;forever&#34;.\n And Google rejigged its timetable for bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so.\n But Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook&#39;s plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June.\n It followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September.\n   The key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. &#34;Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it&#39;s about doing what you can with the things you can control,&#34; says Siobhan Murray, author of &#39;The Burnout Solution&#39;.\n Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is &#34;important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they&#39;re socially connected.&#34; He advises:\n  But companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an &#34;occupational hazard&#34; she says and it &#34;requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff&#34;.\n  Other companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up.\n Voice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls.\n It is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG&#39;s UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to &#34;stop moaning&#34; during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions.\n According to the Financial Times, Mr Michael also told employees to stop &#34;playing the victim card&#34;. Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned.\n  How has working during coronavirus affected you? Are you feeling burnt-out? Is your company doing anything to help?

", "note_en": "I\u2019ve worked with a number of clients on Elixir projects and I\u2019ve onboarded myself, I\u2019ve been onboarded and I\u2019ve onboarded others. And compared to my experiences with PHP/Python/Javascript and my limited experience with C#/.Net I have experienced quite a difference.\n Elixir projects tend to be very consistently laid out. Especially Phoenix-based web projects. The basic Phoenix generators provide a fair number of opinions on where things go. Even without that the general shape of an Elixir project is surprisingly stable.\n So across a few different clients I\u2019ve seen a number of Elixir projecs that have a few years on them and while there were variations such as not actually utilizing the module hierarchy and putting all of it in the widest possible namespace or overriding some common conventions, overall even the old projects were very reasonable to explore. They tend to flow from the mix.exs projects file and from there you can logically follow what parts of the system are started as you run the application. That will let you figure out what routes it exposes, what work it does in the background and much more. The Elixir supervision tree (inherited from Erlang) makes the shape of the application more clear to you as a developer.\n My first onboarding onto an Elixir project was a project that essentially predated Phoenix having a stable release and so it was built right on top of Cowboy and WebSockets. I was pretty familiar with Elixir already. The guy who introduced me to the system and product on the other hand, was doing some Elixir, but was primarily doing other work. I estimated some work for this client, around a 100 hours, for the initial engagement of adding some API endpoints to provide some new functionality for external parties. And then I built it. Knowing Elixir but with no experience of this particular system and without the strong conventions of Phoenix I successfully over-delivered with some added niceties at a couple of hours shy of the estimate. I like to think I\u2019m competent at what I do but I\u2019m not convinced I would have that turnaround on a similarly sized Python or PHP project. The compounding complexity tends to be much higher.\n Comparatively the same work in a PHP client\u2019s code base would likely have taken me around twice the time. Why? Mostly due to clarity. Elixir is a functional programming language with a very strong pragmatic streak. It makes it easy to write clear code, rather than clever code. Comparing two codebases is of course anecdotal but it lines up with all my experiences of dynamic OOP code bases vs Elixir code bases. The consequences of making changes are much clearer, the data you have access to and how it gets passed around is plain to see. It removes a lot of guess-work.\n Same Elixir code base, a number of months later I\u2019m the person who will onboard a new developer. He has been doing PHP for a long time, no Elixir experience. No real issues, he certainly spent some time delving in and picking up the syntax and concepts of the language. He is at the time of writing productively the main maintainer of the code base. I think we had two video pairing sessions to introduce the concepts and how the thing was set up. It really didn\u2019t take more.\n Another client, a significant fintech code base in Elixir. A few different services, some with Phoenix, some without. I was brought on, given help to get things set up and started. Due to the strong conventions around how Elixir and Phoenix is used that mostly entailed giving me credentials and answering some questions on specifics. I believe I had my first commit the same week. My first major contribution was probably the next week and then we were off to the races.\n So bringing on people that know Elixir tends to go well in my experience and I\u2019ve even had good luck bringing on an experienced PHP dev that didn\u2019t know Elixir. How about less experienced folks?\n I\u2019ve introduced at least three coding school students to Elixir during their internships or part time work with me. They typically knew some PHP, some Python and some Node.js at that point but hadn\u2019t really used any of them in anger. One is presently working professionally with a production Elixir application and another is currently working with me as an assistant developer and doing well using Elixir on client work.\n I haven\u2019t found much difficulty in teaching Elixir or training people into the language. There are some Functional Programming concepts to work through and some habits to break. Thankfully Elixir does not look or feel incredibly different from your typical OOP languages. Most of it will be familiar to any developer. It simply brings some very different powers to the table.\n One of the things I find makes onboarding easier is that you can effectively approach Elixir both bottom-up and top-down depending on what you are trying to do. If you want to get a foundational overview of what the application is and how it hangs together, look at the supervision tree, the dependencies and you can absorb the shape of the system. And the moment you need to implement a small change or add something, you can figure out the place where those things happen in the system and work there, in relative isolation and you don\u2019t have to know everything about the surrounding system to be productive. Immutability and no shared state makes your system easier to reason about in separate parts. And that means you need to know less to make useful changes.\n I\u2019ve picked up another client\u2019s Phoenix project without any guidance or real introduction to the code and been able to provide changes on the same day. Just by knowing my way around the conventions. Certainly this will vary by person and experience but it isn\u2019t just due to some stroke of brilliance on my part. Strong conventions and a clear language where code is easy to reason about.\n All in all, I\u2019ve found onboarding in Elixir to be ridiculously straight-forward compared to a lot of other projects and I think that\u2019s an important factor and I believe it says something about the long-term ease of development as well. A lot of Elixir developers tend to describe \u201cboring\u201d Elixir projects that just keep working and are easy to maintain.\n Boring is a rare and powerful property in software systems. Especially when they can achieve exciting outcomes such as near real-time, strong concurrency and parallelism with distributed computing just baked in. Nothing quite like it.\n  If you want to hear me (and others!) go on about Elixir in further detail I\u2019d suggest  BEAM Radio but if you\u2019d rather get more variety in topics I\u2019d suggest the  Regular Programming podcast or my  newsletter.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:49:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "onboarding,elixir", "title": "onboarding\u5230Elixir.
