Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.</p><p>我们今天所知的自行车直到1800年代末才发明。但这是一个简单的机械发明。它似乎不需要出色的发明见解，当然也不需要科学背景。</p><p>  I asked this question  on Twitter, and read some discussion  on Quora. People proposed many hypotheses, including:</p><p>  我在Twitter上问了这个问题，并阅读了有关Quora的一些讨论。人们提出了许多假设，包括：</p><p> Technology factors. Metalworking improved a lot in the 1800s: we got improved iron refining and eventually cheap steel, better processes for shaping metal, and ability to make parts like hollow tubes. Wheel technology improved:  wire-spoke (aka tension-spoked) wheels replaced heavier designs; vulcanized rubber (1839) was needed for tires; inflatable tires weren’t invented until 1887. Chains, gears, and ball bearings are all crucial parts that require advanced manufacturing techniques for precision and cost.</p><p> 技术因素。在1800年代，金属加工得到了很大的改善：我们改进了铁精炼工艺，最终获得了廉价的钢材，更好的金属成型工艺，以及制造空心管等零件的能力。车轮技术得到改进：钢丝辐条（又名张力辐条）车轮取代了更重的设计；轮胎需要硫化橡胶（1839年）。充气轮胎直到1887年才发明。链条，齿轮和滚珠轴承都是至关重要的零件，它们需要先进的制造技术来保证精度和成本。</p><p>  Design iteration. Early bicycles were inconvenient and dangerous. The first version didn’t even have pedals. Some versions didn’t have steering, and could only be turned by leaning. (!) The famous “penny-farthing” design, with its huge front wheel, made it impossible to balance with your feet, was prone to tipping forward on a hard stop, and generally left the rider high in the air, all of which increased risk of injury. It took decades of iteration to get to a successful bicycle model.</p><p>  设计迭代。早期的自行车不方便且危险。第一个版本甚至没有踏板。某些版本没有转向，只能靠倾斜来转动。 （！）著名的“竹enny”设计具有巨大的前轮，不可能用双脚保持平衡，容易在急停时翻倒，并且通常将骑手高高悬空，所有这些受伤风险增加。一个成功的自行车模型花了数十年的迭代。</p><p>  Quality of roads. Roads in the 1800s and earlier were terrible by modern standards. Roads were often dirt, rutted from the passage of many carts, turning muddy in the rain.  Macadam paving, which gave smooth surfaces to roads, wasn’t invented until about 1820. City roads at the time were paved with cobblestones, which were good for horses but too bumpy for bicycles. (The unevenness was apparently a feature, assisting in the runoff of sewage—leading  one Quora answer to claim that the construction of city sewers was what opened the door to bicycles.)</p><p>  道路质量。按照现代标准，在1800年代或更早的时期，道路是糟糕的。道路经常是泥泞的，由于许多推车的通过而发痒，在雨中变得泥泞。碎石路面直到1820年才发明出来，使路面光滑。直到那时，城市道路上都铺满了鹅卵石，虽然对马匹有益，但对于自行车却过于坎bump。 （不均匀性显然是造成污水流失的一个特征，Quora的一个回答是声称城市下水道的建设是打开自行车之门的原因。）</p><p>  Competition from horses. Horses were a common and accepted mode of transportation at the time. They could deal with all kinds of roads. They could carry heavy loads. Who then needs a bicycle? In this connection, it has been claimed that the bicycle was invented in response to food shortages due to the “ Year without a Summer”, an 1816 weather event caused by the volcanic explosion of Mt. Tambora the year earlier, which darkened skies and lowered temperatures in many parts of the world. The agricultural crisis caused horses as well as people to starve, which led to some horses being slaughtered for food, and made the remaining ones more expensive to feed. This could have motivated the search for alternatives.</p><p>  马匹比赛。当时，马是一种普遍接受的运输方式。他们可以应对各种道路。他们可能会搬运重物。谁需要自行车？在这方面，据称发明这种自行车是为了应对因“ Mt. No. Summer”（无夏之年）而造成的食物短缺，这是由Mt. Mt.火山爆发引起的1816年天气事件。一年前的坦波拉（Tambora），使世界许多地方的天空变暗，气温降低。农业危机导致马匹和人民挨饿，导致一些马匹被宰杀作为食物，并使其余马匹的饲养成本更高。这可能促使人们寻找替代品。</p><p>  General economic growth. Multiple commenters pointed out the need for a middle class to provide demand for such an invention. If all you have are a lot of poor peasants and a few aristocrats (who, by the way, have horses, carriages, and drivers), there isn’t much of a market for bicycles. This is more plausible when you realize that bicycles were more of a hobby for entertainment before they became a practical means of transportation.</p><p>  总体经济增长。多个评论者指出，中产阶级需要提供这种发明的需求。如果您只有贫穷的农民和几个贵族（顺便说一下，有马，马车和司机），那么自行车的市场就没有多少了。当您意识到自行车在成为一种实用的交通工具之前，它更是一种娱乐性的爱好时，这似乎更合情合理。 </p><p>  Cultural factors. Maybe there was just a general lack of interest in useful mechanical inventions until a certain point in history? But when did this change, and why?</p><p>文化因素。也许直到历史上的某个特定时刻，人们才对有用的机械发明普遍缺乏兴趣？但是什么时候改变了，为什么呢？</p><p>   The quality of roads is relevant, but not really the answer. Bicycles can be ridden on dirt roads or sidewalks (although the latter led to run-ins with pedestrians and made bicycles unpopular among the public at first). And historically, roads didn’t improve until  after bicycles became common—indeed it seems that it was in part the cyclists who called for the improvement of roads.</p><p>   道路的质量是相关的，但并不是真正的答案。可以在土路或人行道上骑自行车（尽管后者导致行人磨合，并且起初使自行车在公众中不受欢迎）。从历史上看，直到自行车普及后，道路才有所改善。实际上，部分原因是骑自行车的人呼吁改善道路。</p><p> I don’t think horses explain it either. A bicycle, from what I’ve read, was cheaper to buy than a horse, and it was certainly cheaper to maintain (if nothing else, you don’t have to feed a bicycle). And it turns out that inventors were interested in the problem of human-powered vehicles, dispensing with the need for horses, for a long time before the modern bicycle. Even Karl von Drais, who invented the first two-wheeled human-powered vehicle after the Year without a Summer, had been working on the problem for years before that.</p><p> 我也不认为马会解释它。根据我的阅读，自行车比马便宜，而且维护当然也便宜（如果没有别的，则不必养活自行车）。事实证明，发明人对人力车辆的问题很感兴趣，因为在现代自行车出现之前很长一段时间内，人们不再需要马。甚至在“无夏之年”之后发明了第一台两轮人力车的卡尔·冯·德赖斯（Karl von Drais）在此问题上工作了多年。</p><p> Technology factors are more convincing to me. They may have been necessary for bicycles to become practical and cheap enough to take off. But they weren’t needed for early experimentation. Frames can be built of wood. Wheels can be rimmed with metal. Gears can be omitted. Chains can be replaced with belts; some early designs even used treadles instead of pedals, and at least one design drove the wheels with levers, as on a steam locomotive.</p><p> 技术因素使我更有说服力。对于自行车的实用性和廉价性而言，它们可能是必要的，以使其起飞。但早期实验并不需要它们。框架可以用木头建造。车轮可以用金属加框。齿轮可以省略。链条可以换成皮带；一些早期的设计甚至使用踏板代替踏板，并且至少有一种设计像在蒸汽机车上那样用杠杆驱动车轮。</p><p>      The concept of a human-powered vehicle goes back many centuries. The earliest reference I have found is to Venetian engineer Giovanni Fontana, who in the early 1400s described a four-wheeled carriage powered by a driver pulling on a loop of rope connected by gears to the wheels (it’s unclear if he ever even attempted to build such a machine; Fontana sketched  a lot of strange things).</p><p>      人力车辆的概念可以追溯到多个世纪。我发现的最早参考文献是威尼斯工程师乔瓦尼·丰塔纳（Giovanni Fontana），他在1400年代初描述了一种四轮马车，由驾驶员拉动由齿轮连接至车轮的绳索环驱动（目前尚不清楚他是否曾尝试制造这样的机器；丰塔纳（Fontana）勾勒出很多奇怪的东西）。</p><p>   More than three centuries ago, the distinguished French mathematician Jacques Ozanam spelled out the theoretical advantages of a human-powered carriage “in which one can drive oneself wherever one pleases, without horses.” Its owner could freely roam along the roads without having to care for an animal and might even enjoy a healthy exercise in the process. Moreover, this particular type of “self-moving” vehicle, in contrast to those that called for wind or steam for propulsion, would run on that most abundant and accessible of all resources: willpower. But how to construct such a valuable vehicle? That was the twenty-third of some fifty “useful and entertaining” problems Ozanam identified and addressed in his famous  Récréations Mathématiques et Physiques, published in 1696.</p><p>   三个多世纪以前，杰出的法国数学家雅克·奥扎纳姆（Jacques Ozanam）阐明了人力马车的理论优势：“马车可以随心所欲地驾驶。”它的所有者可以在道路上自由漫游，而无需照顾动物，甚至可以在此过程中享受健康的锻炼。此外，与要求使用风或蒸汽进行推进的车辆相比，这种特殊类型的“自移动”车辆将在所有资源中最丰富，最容易获得的上运行：意志力。但是如何构造这样一种有价值的工具呢？这就是奥扎南（Ozanam）在1696年出版的著名的《数学与物理学》中发现并解决的大约五十个“有用和有趣”的问题中的二十三个。</p><p> Ozanam’s book presented a proposed solution from another inventor: another four-wheeled carriage, driven by two people (one to steer, one to power the vehicle by stepping up and down on large treadles connected to the wheels by ropes, pulleys, and gears).</p><p> 奥扎南（Ozanam）的书提出了另一位发明家提出的解决方案：另一辆四轮马车，由两个人驱动（一个人驾驶，一个人通过踩在通过绳索，滑轮和齿轮连接到车轮的大踏板上来驱动车辆） 。 </p><p>  It seems that for centuries, the carriage was the model for human-powered vehicles. Various inventors tried their hand at designs, and some were even built. There is a record in a London journal of an attempt in 1774 that went up to six miles an hour. French inventor Jean-Pierre Blanchard (who would later go on to fame in ballooning) built a human-powered carriage that went a dozen miles from Paris to Versailles. An American mechanic named Bolton built a version in 1804 that used mechanical leverage from interlocking gears. Presumably, all these attempts went nowhere because the machines were too large and heavy to be practical.</p><p>似乎几个世纪以来，马车一直是人力车辆的模型。各种各样的发明者尝试了设计，甚至完成了一些。伦敦日记中记录了1774年的一次尝试，时速达每小时六英里。法国发明家让·皮埃尔·布兰查德（Jean-Pierre Blanchard）（后来因热气球而成名）制造了一辆人力车，从巴黎到凡尔赛仅十几英里。一位名叫Bolton的美国机械师在1804年制造了一个版本，该版本使用了互锁齿轮的机械杠杆作用。据推测，所有这些尝试都无济于事，因为这些机器太大，太重而无法实用。</p><p>  The key insight was to stop trying to build a mechanical carriage, and instead build something more like a mechanical horse. This step was taken by the aforementioned Karl von Drais in the early 1800s. Drais was an aristocrat; he held a position as forest master in Baden that is  said to have given him free time to tinker. His first attempts, beginning in 1813, were four-wheeled carriages like their predecessors, and like them failed to gain the support of authorities.</p><p>  关键的见解是停止尝试制造机械托架，而改为制造更像机械马的东西。前面提到的卡尔·冯·德赖斯（Karl von Drais）在1800年代初期就采取了这一步骤。德拉斯是一位贵族。他在巴登（Baden）担任森林主管，据说这给了他腾空的时间进行修补。他的首次尝试始于1813年，像他们的前辈一样，是四轮马车，但他们未能获得当局的支持。</p><p>  But in 1817 (possibly motivated by the aforementioned food crisis and resultant shortage of horses, although this is unclear), he tried again with a new design: a two-wheeled, one-person vehicle that is a recognizable ancestor of the modern bicycle. It was made of wood, with iron tires. He called it the  Laufmaschine, or “running machine”; it had no pedals, and instead was powered by directly pushing off the ground with one’s feet. It was also called the “velocipede” (from the Latin for “swift foot”) or the “draisine” (English) or “draisienne” (French) after its inventor; an improved version made by a London coachmaker was known in England as the “pedestrian curricle”.</p><p>  但是在1817年（可能是由于前述的粮食危机和由此导致的马匹短缺，尽管目前尚不清楚），他再次尝试了一种新设计：两轮单人车辆，是现代自行车的公认祖先。它是用木头制成的，带有铁胎。他称它为Laufmaschine，即“跑步机”。它没有踏板，而是直接用脚踩下地面来驱动。它的发明者也叫“ velocipede”（拉丁语为“ swift foot”）或“ draisine”（英语）或“ draisienne”（法语）。伦敦教练的改进版本在英格兰被称为“步行课程”。</p><p>   Without pedals or gears, this proto-bicycle couldn’t achieve the speed or efficiency of modern designs. But, like the scooters still used by children today, it allowed you to coast, especially downhill, and it held your weight as you moved forward. Drais got up to 12 miles per hour on his machine. It became a fad in Europe in 1818–19, then faded. It seems the reasons were a combination of the potential for injury and the general annoyance of the public that these things were being driven through pedestrian areas such as sidewalks and parks (some things never change; we’re repeating this today with the scooter wars in San Francisco and other cities).</p><p>   没有踏板或齿轮，这种原型自行车就无法实现现代设计的速度或效率。但是，就像今天孩子们仍在使用的踏板车一样，它可以让您滑行，尤其是下坡，并且在前进时可以保持体重。 Drais的机器每小时可以攀升12英里。 1818-19年在欧洲风行一时，然后逐渐消失。这些原因似乎是由潜在的伤害和公众的普遍厌恶共同造成的，这些事情是通过人行道和公园等行人专用区行驶的（有些事情永远不会改变；今天，我们在踏板车大战中重复这种情况）旧金山和其他城市）。</p><p>   The next key advance didn’t come until decades later, when someone put pedals on the bike. There are conflicting claims to first inventor (going back to 1839), but it was definitely done by the 1860s in France. In any case, it was in the 1860s that bicycle development really took off. Pedals allowed the rider to propel the machine faster and more efficiently. This model was manufactured in France, at first with wooden frames, later with iron, and became commonly known as the “boneshaker” (which gives you an idea of how rough the ride still was).</p><p>   直到几十年后，有人踩着脚踏车，下一个关键的进步才出现。对第一位发明家的说法相互矛盾（可追溯到1839年），但这肯定是在1860年代法国完成的。无论如何，直到1860年代，自行车的发展才真正开始。踏板可使骑手更快，更有效地推动机器。这种模型最初是在法国制造的，最初是木制框架，后来是铁制的，因此通常被称为“ boneshaker”（使您了解行驶的崎rough程度）。</p><p>   At this point, though, there were still no gears or chains. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. This gave the rider little mechanical advantage: it’s the same as a  fixie with a 1:1 gear ratio (vs. the ratios most commonly used today which are closer to 3:1). Think of what it’s like to pedal a bike that’s in too low a gear: you pump your legs a lot without going very fast.</p><p>   但是，在这一点上，仍然没有齿轮或链条。踏板直接安装在前轮上。这给了骑手一点机械上的好处：它与齿轮比为1：1（相对于当今最常用的接近3：1的齿轮比）的固定器相同。想一想踩低档的自行车会是什么样的感觉：脚踩得太多了却步伐不快。</p><p>  The only solution was to make the wheel larger, leading around 1870 to the ridiculous-looking “penny-farthing” or “high-wheel” design with the huge front wheel, which you’ve probably seen and may associate with the late 1800s. By around this time, bicycles were being made with metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and solid rubber (not yet inflatable) tires. This design did give a faster ride, and a smoother one, since the large wheel absorbed shocks better. But it required acrobatic balance to ride, and as noted above it was prone to nasty spills and injuries, including “taking a header” if you stopped suddenly.</p><p>  唯一的解决方案是增大车轮，直到1870年左右，才有了带有巨大前轮的外观怪异的“一分钱”或“高轮”设计，您可能已经看到这种轮毂，并且可能与1800年代后期结合使用。到这个时候，自行车已经制成了金属框架，钢丝轮和实心橡胶（尚未充气）轮胎。这种设计的确能提供更快的行驶速度和更平稳的行驶，因为大轮毂可以更好地吸收震动。但这需要杂技平衡才能骑行，而且如上所述，它容易造成讨厌的溢出物和伤害，包括如果突然停下来就“抬头”。 </p><p>  The third and final key advance, then, was to separate the pedals from the wheel. Variations on this “safety bicycle”, including at least one driven by treadles and levers, were attempted from the 1870s if not before. The first commercially successful model, using the familiar crank and chain design, was produced in 1885 by John Starley. Finally, in 1888, inflatable (pneumatic) tires were introduced by John Dunlop, cushioning the ride and eliminating the last advantage of the penny-farthing.</p><p>然后，第三个也是最后一个关键是将踏板与车轮分开。从1870年代开始就尝试对这种“安全自行车”进行改动，包括至少由脚踏板和杠杆驱动的一辆。约翰·史塔利（John Starley）于1885年生产了第一个商业上成功的模型，采用了熟悉的曲柄和链条设计。最终，在1888年，约翰·邓洛普（John Dunlop）推出了充气（充气）轮胎，为行驶提供了缓冲，并消除了便士制轮胎的最后优势。</p><p> So, by the end of the 1880s, bicycles had evolved into the form we know them today, with (approximately) equal-sized wheels, pedals, chains, metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and inflatable rubber tires.</p><p> 因此，到1880年代末，自行车已经发展成为我们今天所知的形式，它具有（大约）相等大小的车轮，踏板，链条，金属框架，钢丝辐条轮和充气橡胶轮胎。</p><p>    First, the correct design was not obvious. For centuries, progress was stalled because inventors were all trying to create multi-person four-wheeled carriages, rather than single-person two-wheeled vehicles. It’s unclear why this was; certainly inventors were copying an existing mode of transportation, but why would they draw inspiration only from the horse-and-carriage, and not from the horse-and-rider? (Some commenters have suggested that it was not obvious that a two-wheeled vehicle would balance, but I find this unconvincing given how many other things people have learned to balance on, from dugout canoes to horses themselves.) It’s possible (I’m purely speculating here) that early mechanical inventors had a harder time realizing the fundamental impractiability of the carriage design because they didn’t have much in the way of mathematical engineering principles to go on, but then again it’s unclear what led to Drais’s breakthrough.</p><p>    首先，正确的设计并不明显。几个世纪以来，进展一直停滞不前，因为发明人都在尝试制造多人四轮车，而不是单人两轮车。目前尚不清楚这是为什么；当然，发明家们正在模仿现有的运输方式，但是为什么他们只能从马车上而不是从马车上汲取灵感呢？ （一些评论者认为，两轮车不会很平衡，但是鉴于人们学会了平衡的其他东西，从独木舟到马匹，我发现这一点令人信服。）这是可能的（我是纯粹是在这里推测）早期的机械发明家很难意识到滑架设计的基本可行性，因为他们没有太多的数学工程原理可以进行下去，但是仍然不清楚是什么导致了Drais的突破。</p><p> And even after Drais hit on the two-wheeled design, it took multiple iterations, which happened over decades, to get to a design that was efficient, comfortable, and safe.</p><p> 甚至在Drais推出了两轮设计之后，它还是经过了数十年的多次迭代，才能获得高效，舒适和安全的设计。</p><p>  Second, advances in materials and manufacturing were probably necessary for a commercially successful bicycle. It’s a bit hard, from where I stand, to untangle which advances in design were made possible by new materials and techniques, and which were simply sparks of inventive imagination that hadn’t been conceived or developed before. But the fact that people were willing to put up with the precarious high-wheeled design indicates to me that pneumatic tires were crucial. And it’s plausible to me that advanced metalworking was needed to make small, lightweight chains and gears of high and consistent quality, at an acceptable price—and that no other design, such as a belt or lever, would have worked instead. It’s also plausible to me that wooden frames just weren’t light and strong enough to be practical (I certainly wouldn’t be eager to ride a wooden bicycle today).</p><p>  第二，材料和制造的进步对于商业上成功的自行车可能是必要的。从我的立场来看，这有点困难，因为新材料和新技术使设计的进步成为可能，而这仅仅是以前未曾设想或发展的创造性想象的火花。但是人们愿意忍受不稳定的高轮设计这一事实向我表明，充气轮胎至关重要。在我看来，需要先进的金属加工技术来以可接受的价格制造出高质量，稳定质量的轻巧链条和齿轮，并且没有其他设计（例如皮带或杠杆）可以代替。对我来说，木制框架还不够轻巧，结实，无法实用（我今天当然不急于骑木制自行车）。</p><p> But we can go deeper, and ask the questions that inspired my intense interest in this question in the first place. Why was no one even experimenting with two-wheeled vehicles until the 1800s? And why was no one, as far as we know, even considering the question of human-powered vehicles until the 1400s? Why weren’t there bicycle mechanics in the 1300s, when there were clockmakers, or at least by the 1500s, when we had watches? Or among the ancient Romans, who built water mills and harvesting machines? Or the Greeks, who built the  Antikythera mechanism? Even if they didn’t have tires and chains, why weren’t these societies at least experimenting with draisines? Or even the failed carriage designs?</p><p> 但是，我们可以更深入地提出这些问题，这些问题首先激发了我对这个问题的浓厚兴趣。为什么直到1800年代都没有人尝试过两轮车？而且，据我们所知，为什么没有人考虑直到1400年代的人力车辆问题？为什么在1300年代没有钟表匠的自行车修理工，或者至少在1500年代有钟表的自行车修理工？还是在古罗马人当中，谁建造了水磨和收割机？还是建立了Antikythera机制的希腊人？即使他们没有轮胎和链条，为什么这些社会至少没有尝试过葡萄干？甚至失败的车架设计？</p><p> To even begin to answer this, we have to realize that it’s part of a much wider phenomenon. I asked the same question of the  cotton gin, which unlike the bicycle did not require advanced materials: it’s a wooden box, a wire mesh, and a drum with wire teeth; in fact, it was so simple that once the concept was out, plantation owners made bootleg copies by hand (depriving Eli Whitney of most of his patent royalties). The same question can be asked of all of the key inventions of  textile mechanization; Anton Howes, an economic historian who chimed in on the Twitter thread linked above, has  noted of John Kay’s flying shuttle:</p><p> 为了甚至开始回答这个问题，我们必须意识到这是更广泛的现象的一部分。我问过同样的问题，那就是棉杜松子酒，这与自行车不需要高级材料不同：它是一个木箱，一个金属丝网和一个带有金属丝齿的鼓；实际上，它是如此简单，以至于一旦概念出台，种植园所有人就可以手工制作盗版副本（剥夺了Eli Whitney的大部分专利使用费）。对于纺织机械化的所有关键发明，可以提出相同的问题。经济历史学家安东·豪斯（Anton Howes）引用了上面链接的Twitter帖子，他提到约翰·凯（John Kay）的飞梭： </p><p> Kay’s innovation was extraordinary in its simplicity. As the inventor Bennet Woodcroft put it, weaving with an ordinary shuttle had been “performed for upwards of five thousand years, by millions of skilled workmen, without any improvement being made to expedite the operation, until the year 1733”. All Kay added was some wood and some string. And he applied it to weaving wool, which had been England’s main industry since the middle ages. He had no special skill, he required no special understanding of science for it, and he faced no special incentive to do it. As for institutions, the flying shuttle was technically illegal because it saved labour, the patent was immediately pirated by competitors to little avail, and Kay was forced to move to France, hounded out of the country by angry weavers who threatened his property and even his life. Kay faced no special incentives — he even innovated despite some formidable social and legal barriers.</p><p>凯的创新之处在于其简单性。正如发明人Bennet Woodcroft所说的那样，“用普通的梭子进行编织已经“由数百万熟练的工人进行了长达五千年的历史，直到1733年都没有进行任何改进以加快操作速度”。凯只添加了一些木头和一些绳子。他将其应用于编织羊毛，从中世纪开始，编织羊毛就一直是英格兰的主要产业。他没有特殊的技能，不需要特殊的科学知识，并且没有特殊的动机去做科学。至于机构，从技术上讲，这是因为它节省了劳力，因此是非法的，竞争对手立即盗用了该专利，但收效甚微，而凯被迫搬到法国，被愤怒的织布工赶出该国，织布工威胁他的财产，甚至生活。凯没有面临任何特殊的激励措施-尽管有一些巨大的社会和法律障碍，他仍然进行了创新。</p><p> There are also other stories in which an early attempt at invention was demonstrated, the idea found no backers if it wasn’t already fully viable, and then development was dropped for decades. Richard Trevithick’s early, failed experiments with locomotives come to mind.</p><p> 在其他故事中，还展示了早期发明的尝试，如果这个想法还没有完全可行，就找不到支持者，然后几十年就放弃了开发。理查德·特雷维西克（Richard Trevithick）早期尝试失败的机车试验就浮现在脑海。</p><p> In light of this, I think the deepest explanation is in general economic and cultural factors. Regarding economic factors, it seems that there needs to be a certain level of surplus to support the culture-wide research and development effort that creates inventions. Note that Karl von Drais was a baron who apparently had a cushy job and invented in his spare time. This is common of researchers of that era: they were often aristocrats or otherwise independently wealthy (and those who weren’t had to scramble for support from wealthy patrons). Today we have research labs in both universities and corporations, plus venture capitalists to fund development of new products and services. The moment it becomes clear that a certain type of innovation  might be possible, there are multiple teams funded and hustling to bring it to market. There are no multi-decade gaps in the innovation timeline anymore, or at least vastly fewer.</p><p> 有鉴于此，我认为最深层的解释是一般的经济和文化因素。关于经济因素，似乎需要一定程度的盈余，以支持创造发明的全文化研究和开发工作。请注意，卡尔·冯·德赖斯（Karl von Drais）是一位男爵，显然工作休闲，并且是在业余时间发明的。这在那个时代的研究人员中很常见：他们通常是贵族或以其他方式独立地富有的人（以及那些不必为获得富裕顾客的支持而争夺的人）。今天，我们在大学和公司中都有研究实验室，另外还有风险投资家为新产品和服务的开发提供资金。当很明显某种创新类型成为可能时，就会有多个团队投入资金并竭力将其推向市场。在创新时间表中不再存在数十年的差距，或者至少更少。</p><p> Looking at economic factors on the demand side, surplus also would seem to create markets for new products. Maybe GDP per capita just has to hit a certain point before people even have time, attention and energy to think about new inventions that aren’t literally putting food on the table, a roof over your head, or a shirt on your back.</p><p> 从需求方面的经济因素来看，过剩似乎也会为新产品创造市场。也许人均GDP必须达到某个水平，然后人们才有时间，精力和精力去思考新发明，而这些发明实际上并没有把食物放在桌子上，头顶上的屋顶或背上的衬衫上。</p><p> Finally, there are cultural factors. Howes says that “innovation is not in human nature, but is instead received. … when people do not innovate, it is often simply because  it never occurs to them to do so.” Joel Mokyr says, similarly, that “ progress isn’t natural” (and his book on this topic,   A Culture of Growth, helped inspire this blog). I agree with both.</p><p> 最后，还有文化因素。豪斯说：“创新不是人类本性，而是创新。 ……当人们不进行创新时，通常只是因为他们从未进行过创新。”同样，乔尔·莫基尔（Joel Mokyr）表示，“进步不是自然而然的”（他关于该主题的书《成长的文化》对这个博客的启发也很大）。我都同意。</p><p> Fully elucidating these economic and cultural factors is a major future project of this blog.</p><p> 充分阐明这些经济和文化因素是此博客的未来重大项目。</p><p>  Sources and further reading: Excerpt from   Bicycle, by David V.
