As e-bike and scooters pass by, they’re watching as several venture-capital backed start-ups — like JOKR, getir, Buyk — are now undercutting them on prices, and offering huge discounts on service in an attempt to dominate the rapid delivery market.</p><p>这并不是一夜之间发生的，但下东区的酒馆和街角店主们已经意识到了一个新的现实——15分钟的杂货送货司机在街上穿梭，向顾客分发分散的家庭主食，这曾经是酒馆的利基。随着电动自行车和踏板车的路过，他们看到了几家由风险投资支持的初创公司——如JOKR、getir、Buyk——在价格上低于他们，并在服务上提供巨大折扣，试图主导快速配送市场。</p><p> &#34;These bodegas are facing the ultimate threat from these 15-minute delivery apps,” said Christopher Marte, the new City Council member for the Lower East Side.</p><p>&#34;这些酒馆正面临来自这些15分钟送货应用程序的终极威胁，”下东区市议会新成员克里斯托弗·马特说。</p><p> Marte grew up working in a bodega not far from the one he stood outside of last week on the corner of Rivington and Suffolk Street. As a teenager, he stocked shelves in the store his Dominican immigrant-family owned, he saw how they, and his community at large, were held together by the bodega. It was where neighborhood news was passed, where people could get a hot meal on a cold day, grab shovels to dig out their walkways, and where the grocery stock was able to accommodate the community, selling vegetables and goods from their home countries that weren’t always on offer in larger stores.</p><p>马特从小在一家酒馆工作，离他上周站在里文顿和萨福克街拐角处的那家酒馆不远。十几岁的时候，他在多米尼加移民家庭开的商店里摆满了货架，他看到了他们和整个社区是如何被酒馆团结在一起的。在那里，人们可以在寒冷的日子里吃到热腾腾的一餐，抓起铲子挖出走道，杂货店也可以容纳社区，出售来自本国的蔬菜和商品，而这些商品在大型商店并不总是有售。</p><p> Now he’s worried these small businesses could be forced down a dark path — one that immigrant business owners, many from the same Yemeni and Dominican communities that once bought price-inflated taxi medallions, are still reeling from.</p><p>现在，他担心这些小企业可能会被迫走上一条黑暗的道路——许多来自也门和多米尼加社区的移民企业主，他们曾经购买价格过高的出租车奖章，现在仍然在蹒跚前行。</p><p>  “What we saw with Uber and Lyft, and how it disrupted the taxi and limousine service, we&#39;re seeing the same patterns with this,” he said.</p><p>“我们在优步和Lyft上看到的情况，以及它如何扰乱出租车和豪华轿车服务，我们在这方面看到了相同的模式，”他说。</p><p> He said he worries about commercial rents rising as  sales continue to lag behind pre-pandemic numbers, leading to bodega owners going broke, unable to pay off the huge debts they need to rack up just to run their businesses. Right now, bodega owners don’t have the data on how the new delivery companies have affected their businesses, but they don’t want to wait for sales to dip before organizing and asking elected officials to take action.</p><p>他说，他担心，随着销售额继续落后于大流行前的数字，商业租金上涨，导致酒馆老板破产，无力偿还经营业务所需的巨额债务。目前，酒馆老板还没有关于新快递公司如何影响其业务的数据，但他们不想等到销售额下降后再组织并要求当选官员采取行动。</p><p> The new grocery delivery companies allow customers to place orders using their phones, often without any ordering minimum. Users are able to get products as small as a single onion, or as large as a full grocery list, at their door in 15 minutes (and often less).</p><p>新的杂货配送公司允许顾客使用手机下单，通常不需要任何最低订购量。用户可以在15分钟内（通常不到15分钟）在家门口买到小到一个洋葱的产品，或大到一张完整的购物清单的产品。</p><p> “The bodegas can’t compete with them. They’re eliminating the human interaction of getting goods and services,” said Frank Gonzalez, co-founder of the Lower East Side Small Business Alliance, which came together during the pandemic to help small businesses access relief programs. “Immigrants work hard and create generational wealth through these small businesses. Local vendors work with these small businesses, creating even more opportunities for the community.” Gonzalez says he&#39;s worried that if bodegas were to shutter, older people and non-English speakers would have a tough time navigating the apps they would need to order food and other necessities.</p><p>下东区小企业联盟联合创始人弗兰克·冈萨雷斯说：“酒馆无法与他们竞争。他们正在消除获取商品和服务的人际互动。”该联盟在疫情期间成立，帮助小企业获得救济项目。“移民努力工作，通过这些小企业创造世代财富。当地供应商与这些小企业合作，为社区创造更多机会。”冈萨雷斯说他&#39；s担心如果酒馆被关闭，老年人和非英语使用者将很难浏览他们订购食物和其他必需品所需的应用程序。</p><p> The sheer amount of companies that have sprung up on city streets in the past few months is staggering. JOKR, Gorillas, Gopuff, Fridge No More, Buyk, and others, are competing for the patronage of people who have become accustomed to delivery culture, which  exploded during the pandemic. But while meal delivery companies like Grubhub and Uber Eats work with existing restaurants to source their meals, instant delivery services have set up storage hubs across the city, where delivery drivers are handed pre-packed bags of groceries and immediately dispatched to waiting customers. Although these hubs are popping up all over the city, there has been a concentration of them in Manhattan. A December study commissioned by then-Borough President Gale Brewer found that 25 of these hubs were operating in Manhattan, with many concentrated below 14th street.</p><p>过去几个月，在城市街道上涌现的公司数量之多令人震惊。小丑、大猩猩、Gopuff、冰箱不再、Buyk和其他动物正在争夺那些已经习惯了分娩文化的人的赞助，这种文化在大流行期间爆发。但是，尽管格鲁布和优步食肆等送餐公司与现有餐厅合作寻找食物来源，但速递服务公司在全市各地都建立了仓储中心，送货司机可以拿到预先包装好的食品袋，并立即发送给等待的顾客。虽然这些枢纽正在城市各处涌现，但它们集中在曼哈顿。时任自治区主席盖尔·布鲁尔（Gale Brewer）12月委托进行的一项研究发现，其中25个枢纽在曼哈顿运营，其中许多集中在14街以下。</p><p>  Just across the street from the Stop 1 Deli on the Lower East Side, is one of those delivery hubs, on the unfinished ground floor of a new luxury condo. Run by Gopuff (which received a  $1 billion dollar round of investment this past summer), the hub looks almost exactly like a grocery store, with products lining shelves on orderly rows. But instead of prices and coupon offers, there’s just barcodes, as Gopuff employees and contractors swiftly circulate to fill incoming orders.</p><p>就在下东区1号站熟食店的街对面，是一个配送中心，位于一栋新豪华公寓尚未完工的底层。该中心由Gopuff（去年夏天获得了10亿美元的一轮投资）经营，看起来几乎完全像一家杂货店，货架上整齐排列着产品。但除了价格和优惠券优惠，这里只有条形码，因为Gopuff的员工和承包商会迅速循环，以填写收到的订单。</p><p> These hubs are where local business owners and politicians feel that the companies are stepping outside the bounds of the law. According to research done by now-Council Member Gale Brewer’s office, these hubs could fall outside of local zoning rules. Because they’re essentially warehouses, they should be confined to zoning that’s mostly found along the West Side of Manhattan, where warehouses have traditionally been located on the island for over a century. Instead, they’re now often found alongside local retail businesses, with some occupying storefronts that have gone vacant during the pandemic.</p><p>在这些中心，当地企业主和政界人士感到，这些公司正在超越法律的界限。根据现在的委员会成员盖尔·布鲁尔办公室所做的研究，这些中心可能不属于当地的分区规则。因为它们本质上是仓库，所以它们应该被限制在曼哈顿西侧的区域内，那里的仓库传统上在岛上已经存在了一个多世纪。取而代之的是，它们现在经常与当地零售企业一起出现，一些占据的店面在疫情期间空置。</p><p>   In a letter to the city’s Department of Buildings in October 2021, Brewer wrote that these stores, which are often not accessible to the public, “deaden our streetscapes, as windows are sometimes papered over and there is no ability to actually enter and shop, thereby reducing foot traffic, which ultimately impacts adjacent small businesses.”</p><p>在2021年10月的一封给城市建筑部的信中，Brewer写道，这些商店，通常是不可接近公众的，“使我们的街景变得枯燥，因为窗户有时被裱糊，而且没有能力进入和购物，从而减少了步行交通，这最终影响了邻近的小企业。”</p><p> At the Gopuff hub on Rivington Street, employees told Gothamist that recently, a new “walk-in” grocery store was built for the community to use, where they could pick up orders they placed online, or browse a small selection of groceries at the front of the store. The aisles with the rest of the groceries were still off-limits. A Gopuff spokesperson refused to respond on the record to questions about the company’s use of retail spaces.</p><p>在Rivington街的Gopuff hub，员工们告诉Gothamist，最近，一家新的“步入式”杂货店被建成供社区使用，在那里他们可以在网上接受订单，或者在店前浏览一小部分杂货。还有其他杂货的过道仍然禁止入内。Gopuff的一位发言人拒绝在记录中回答有关该公司使用零售空间的问题。</p><p> In response to a request for comment on the zoning concerns, a Gopuff spokesperson, who refused to be identified, said that the company’s stores operate within local laws, take &#34;corrective action&#34; when needed and provide regular guidance to employees on how best to provide both the walk-in and delivery experience.</p><p>一位拒绝透露姓名的Gopuff发言人在回应有关分区问题的置评请求时表示，该公司的门店在当地法律的范围内运营，采取&#34；纠正措施&#34；必要时，定期指导员工如何最好地提供上门服务和送货体验。</p><p>    It’s possible without the use of these spaces, these 15-minute delivery companies would be unable to follow through on the very promise of speedy delivery, or push their workers ever harder to make sure the delivery was received on time. At the Gopuff hub on the Lower East Side, many of the workers were from the community itself, a mix of independent contractors and employees. Unlike their food delivery counterparts, rapid delivery companies tend to use employees as delivery drivers, as the time it would take for an independent delivery driver to accept a delivery would slow down the already-tight process.</p><p>如果不使用这些空间，这些15分钟的快递公司可能无法兑现快速送货的承诺，也可能无法迫使员工更努力地确保按时收到快递。在下东区的戈帕夫中心，许多工人来自社区本身，由独立承包商和雇员组成。与食品配送公司不同，速递公司倾向于使用员工作为配送司机，因为独立配送司机接受配送所需的时间会减缓本已紧张的流程。</p><p> Marte, the Council Member, thinks that the city needs to step up its targeting of hubs that might be in operation outside of local zoning laws, before they pop up elsewhere in the city.</p><p>该委员会成员马特认为，该市需要加强针对可能在当地分区法之外运行的枢纽的行动，以免它们在该市其他地方出现。</p><p> “We can’t wait. We have to be proactive, because this will spread to northern Manhattan, the outer-boroughs, we need to take action immediately,” he said.</p><p>“我们等不及了。我们必须积极主动，因为这将蔓延到曼哈顿北部的外围行政区，我们需要立即采取行动，”他说。</p><p> He’s also working with the Lower East Side Small Business Alliance to craft legislation that would both bolster bodegas, and provide more protections for workers for the 15-minute delivery companies.</p><p>他还与下东区小企业联盟（Lower East Side Small Business Alliance）合作制定立法，既支持酒馆，又为15分钟快递公司的员工提供更多保护。</p><p>    Gothamist spoke to a delivery driver, who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn’t authorized to speak by the company for which he’s an independent contractor. The driver is a native New Yorker who’s been working for delivery companies for the past six years. He owns his own bike and said he loves being able to ride around the city all day.</p><p>哥特哈密主义者与一名送货司机交谈，该司机要求匿名，因为他没有获得该公司的授权，他是该公司的独立承包商。司机是土生土长的纽约人，过去六年一直在快递公司工作。他拥有自己的自行车，并说他喜欢整天在城市里骑车。</p><p> “This is the best job I’ve ever had,” the driver told Gothamist. “The deliveries are easy because the hubs already have the groceries ready and they’re right there. Most of my deliveries take under 10 minutes.”</p><p>“这是我做过的最好的工作，”司机告诉哥达米亚人。“送货很容易，因为中心已经准备好了食品杂货，而且它们就在那里。我大部分的送货时间都不到10分钟。”</p><p> The driver estimates he makes around $600 a day, working shifts as long as 14 hours, even though he’s not obligated to. He said the money is too good to pass up and sometimes he even sleeps in his car so he can easily get back to the hub to make more deliveries.</p><p>这位司机估计他每天挣600美元左右，轮班工作长达14小时，尽管他没有义务这么做。他说，这笔钱太好了，不能放弃，有时他甚至会睡在车里，这样他就可以轻松地回到中心，进行更多的送货。</p><p> From his perspective, he doesn’t feel as if these 15-minute delivery companies are competing with the local bodegas.</p><p>从他的角度来看，他不觉得这些15分钟的快递公司在与当地的酒馆竞争。</p><p> “I don’t deliver to anyone from the neighborhood, really. These are hungover young people looking for pedialyte, snacks, and toilet paper. They really would be shopping at one of the bigger grocery stores, anyway,” he said.</p><p>他说：“真的，我不会给附近的任何人送货。这些人都是宿醉的年轻人，他们在寻找小儿科、零食和卫生纸。不管怎样，他们真的会去一家更大的杂货店购物。”。</p><p> And it’s not all doom and gloom at the local bodega, either. On a recent rainy Thursday at the Stop 1 Deli on Rivington, construction workers, young people puffing on Juuls, and women in suits looking for an iced coffee on a cold and dreary morning, huddled around the counter at the bodega, picking up what they needed to get through the day.</p><p>当地的酒馆也不全是厄运和阴郁。最近的一个下雨的星期四，在里文顿的Stop 1熟食店，建筑工人、年轻人在一个寒冷而沉闷的早晨吸着Juuls，穿着西装的女人们在酒馆的柜台前挤在一起，拿着一天需要的东西。</p><p> Dylan Carrillo opened his grocery bag to show off some Monster Energy drinks, chips, and a container of ham he had just purchased. He lives right above the Gopuff hub, but says he goes to this bodega everyday. He estimates he gets half of his groceries at the bodega, and the other half at the nearby Trader Joe’s or Target.</p><p>迪伦·卡里略打开他的购物袋，炫耀他刚买的一些怪兽能量饮料、薯条和一容器火腿。他住在戈帕夫中心的正上方，但他说他每天都去这家酒馆。他估计自己的食品杂货有一半在酒馆，另一半在附近的商人乔或塔吉特那里。</p><p> For him, the 15-minute delivery offers aren’t quick enough. “This took five minutes, which is quicker than 15. It’s right there, and I like carrying my own things. Plus, there’s no service fees.”</p><p>对他来说，15分钟的送货时间不够快。“这花了五分钟，比15分钟快。就在那里，我喜欢自己拿东西。另外，不收服务费。”</p><p>  Jose Rodriguez, 26, owns the Stop 1 Deli, buying it two years ago after he had worked there for several years. He doesn’t blame the 15-minute delivery companies for operating across the street from him or even undercutting his own prices by using investment capital to buy quantities in bulk. The bigger problems for him right now are the rising costs of goods, while he has to keep prices low for his customers.</p><p>26岁的何塞·罗德里格斯（Jose Rodriguez）拥有Stop 1熟食店，两年前在那里工作了几年后买下了它。他不会责怪15分钟快递公司在他对面的街道上运营，甚至通过使用投资资本大量购买来降低自己的价格。目前对他来说，更大的问题是商品成本不断上升，而他必须为客户保持低价。</p><p> “We should be the cheaper place to shop for the community, but that’s just not the case right now,” he said, explaining that you won’t get anywhere by fighting innovation. “You can’t knock on someone else’s business because they have more money than us. They have way more products than us, they’re cheaper than us, and they deliver it to your house.”</p><p>他说：“我们应该是社区购物更便宜的地方，但现在不是这样，”他解释说，反对创新是行不通的。“你不能敲打别人的生意，因为他们的钱比我们多。他们的产品比我们多，他们比我们便宜，而且他们把产品送到你家。”</p><p> Rodriguez doesn’t see himself in competition with these rapid-delivery apps, some of whom have already burned through their investment and  are possibly looking to get out of the market.</p><p>罗德里格斯并不认为自己会与这些快速交付应用程序竞争，其中一些应用程序已经耗尽了投资，可能正在寻求退出市场。</p><p> “My customers are the construction workers, people on the way to school, people going to local jobs. People who have no fixed address during the day to accept a delivery,” he said. “What would help me the most is the pandemic ending and prices going down. That’s more important to me than taking down huge companies. You can’t fight good ideas.”</p><p>他说：“我的客户是建筑工人、上学路上的人、去当地工作的人。他们白天没有固定的地址来接受送货。”。“最能帮助我的是大流行的结束和价格的下降。对我来说，这比打倒大公司更重要。你不能对抗好的想法。”</p><p>        newsletter signup       Terms     By submitting your information, you&#39;re agreeing to receive communications from New York Public Radio in accordance with our  Terms.</p><p>通过提交您的信息，您可以&#39；We’我们同意按照我们的条款接收纽约公共广播电台的通讯。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/应用程序/">#应用程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/grocery/">#grocery</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
