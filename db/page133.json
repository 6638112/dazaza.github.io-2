Although we still don&#39;t know if this is correct, or how subsequent generations of forensic tracking technologies might work, it is probably safest to assume that  all modern color laser printers do include some form of tracking information that associates documents with the printer&#39;s serial number. (If any manufacturer wishes to go on record with a statement to the contrary, we&#39;ll be happy to publish that here.)\n (Added 2017)  REMINDER: IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT ALL RECENT COMMERCIAL COLOR LASER PRINTERS PRINT SOME KIND OF FORENSIC TRACKING CODES, NOT NECESSARILY USING YELLOW DOTS. THIS IS TRUE WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CODES ARE VISIBLE TO THE EYE AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PRINTER MODELS ARE LISTED HERE. THIS ALSO INCLUDES THE PRINTERS THAT ARE LISTED HERE AS NOT PRODUCING YELLOW DOTS.\n  Forensic investigations of the source of documents produced with other printing technologies are also possible, but, as far as we know, printers other than color laser and similar technologies do not deliberately encode their serial numbers in their output.\n  This is a list of color laser printer models that do or do not print yellow tracking dots on their output.\n We tried to interpret the information conveyed by these dots as part of our  Machine Identification Code Technology Project.\n  A &#34;no&#34; simply means that we couldn&#39;t see yellow dots;  it does not prove that there is no forensic watermarking present. (For example, the HP Color LaserJET 8500 series does not include any yellow tracking dots that we can see, but it may still include some kind of forensic marking, since the majority of other Color LaserJET models do.  Other forensic marking techniques have been invented, and we do not yet know how to determine whether these techniques are used by a particular printer.)\n A &#34;yes&#34; simply means that we (or another source, as noted)  saw yellow dots that appeared anomalous to us. Until we decipher the marking schemes or receive other confirmation, this does not constitute proof that any particular kind of information is represented by these dots. In a very few cases, for example, they might be the result of a  dithering technique, rather than a forensic mark, or they could be the result of a poorly calibrated printer.

she said.\n  Generous benefits offer an incentive to stay home and make it difficult for businesses to hire, the governors claim. Critics say benefits aren&#39;t having a large effect on worker decisions and that curtailing funds will harm the economy by cutting household spending.\n  &#34;You&#39;d think they&#39;d be searching more,&#34; Konkel said. &#34;At least right now, this does push back on the idea that federal unemployment benefits are the main reason there are labor market frictions.&#34;\n  It&#39;s difficult to say with certainty what effect enhanced benefits are having on the labor market without allowing more time to pass, according to Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at right-leaning think tank American Enterprise Institute.\n  But it&#39;s likely the labor market has recovered to a point where the $300 weekly supplement is having a negative effect, he said.\n &#34;The challenge for public policy is balancing the good with the bad,&#34; Strain said. &#34;In June 2021, my view is unemployment benefits of the generosity we&#39;re providing them are doing more harm than they are doing good \u2014 to workers and the economy as a whole.&#34;\n  Congress raised weekly aid by $600 in the early days of the Covid pandemic. Lawmakers also gave funds to the long-term unemployed and groups like the self-employed and gig workers who are typically ineligible for state benefits.\n  They&#39;ve since cut the weekly subsidy in half \u2014 to $300 a week \u2014 and made federal benefits available through Labor Day.\n That extra $300 pays about 42% of recipients as much or more than their prior wages, according to an estimate from University of Chicago economist Peter Ganong. (These are primarily low-wage workers.)\n &#34;That makes it a bad financial deal to get a job for a large share of the workforce,&#34; Strain said.\n  Labor force participation has  stayed relatively flat, a concern especially as there were a record number of job openings in April, he said.\n   A highly contagious Covid variant has  accounted for a greater share of U.S. cases, and just 56% of U.S. adults are  fully vaccinated against Covid-19. The Biden administration said Tuesday it  will likely miss its goal to get 70% of adults vaccinated by the Fourth of July.\n  Child care may continue to pose a challenge for families if day care remains permanently closed, schools haven&#39;t resumed in-person learning or summer camps aren&#39;t at full capacity.\n Restarting the economy (and its associated job uptake) isn&#39;t as easy as flipping a switch, economists said.\n &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the whole puzzle,&#34; Konkel said of enhanced benefits. &#34;I think it&#39;s one piece of the puzzle.&#34;\n  &#34;No one says it&#39;s a &#39;customer shortage&#39; if companies only offer high prices and bad service,&#34; National Economic Council deputy director Bharat Ramamurti said in a tweet. &#34;Yet some say it&#39;s a &#39;labor shortage&#39; if companies only offer low wages and bad benefits.&#34;\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  estimated the $300 supplement has had a &#34;small but likely noticeable&#34; impact on job search and worker availability in early 2021.\n If 7 out of 28 unemployed individuals get job offers they&#39;d normally accept, the availability of the extra $300 a week pushes 1 of the 7 to decline the offer, according to its projection.\n Beyond the $300, most of the Republican states are also ending Pandemic Unemployment Assistance for the self-employed and gig workers ahead of schedule. These workers are losing benefits entirely.\n &#34;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right thing to do from a policy perspective to take those workers down to zero,&#34; Strain said.\n Instead, he said eligibility for these benefits should gradually tighten and workers should be given notice.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 05:09:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u524a\u51cf,unemployment,\u653f\u7b56", "title": "\u63d0\u65e9\u524a\u51cf\u5931\u4e1a\u6551\u6d4e\u91d1\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u4eec\u5bfb\u627e\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Cutting off unemployment benefits early is not pushing people to find work", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/23/ending-unemployment-benefits-early-may-not-be-having-desired-effect.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u524a\u51cf", "\u653f\u7b56"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "33e98ac721aa20e37f72e530f6eff85a.jpg", "infoid": 1068106, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\uff06\uff0339;\u901a\u8fc7\u5ef6\u8fdfChrome\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9Cookie\u652f\u6301\u6765\u5347\u7ea7Web\u5e7f\u544a\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u5df2\u88ab\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u963b\u6b62\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8ddf\u8e2acookie\uff0c\u4f46\u8c37\u6b4c - \u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u516c\u53f8 - \uff06\uff0339;

Most browsers block third-party tracking cookies now, but Google\u2014the world&#39;s largest advertising company\u2014wasn&#39;t going to follow suit without protecting its business model first. The company&#39;s replacement plan for cookies is a\u00a0controversial system called &#34;FLoC,&#34; but after many\u00a0 big Internet players came out against the idea (and the EU launched  an antitrust investigation into the plan) Google now says that &#34;it&#39;s become clear that more time is needed across the ecosystem to get this right.&#34; The new timeline pushes back the death of third-party cookies by about a year and a half.\n Back in  January 2020, Google announced a plan to drop support for third-party cookies in Chrome &#34;within two years.&#34; The Chrome &#34;Privacy Sandbox&#34; would block the third-party cookies typically used for ad targeting, but given Google&#39;s multibillion-dollar ad business, &#34;not tracking users at all&#34; is not an option. A replacement tracking system called &#34;FLoC,&#34; or &#34;Federated Learning of Cohorts,&#34; was the primary alternative floated by the Chrome team. Instead of letting individual companies hide a third-party cookie on your computer that tracks what websites you visit for ad interest tracking, FLoC would let  Chrome build an ad profile locally on your computer and ship that profile to advertisers whenever they ask. Google says this plan is better than third-party cookies because it will take  individual identification out of the ad-tracking process by combining people into groups, though many opponents of the idea have disputed this idea.\n     Everyone who isn&#39;t an advertising company seems to have come out against FLoC. The  EFF,\u00a0 Brave,  Vivaldi, and\u00a0 DuckDuckGo\u00a0have all put out strong statements against the idea. Meanwhile, other browser vendors\u2014like Apple, Opera, Mozilla, and Microsoft\u2014have floated more tepid &#34;no plans to implement&#34; statements.  Amazon is already blocking FLoC on Amazon.com, Wholefoods.com, and Zappos.\n Google says it has received &#34;substantial feedback&#34; from the web community after its first trial of FLoC, and now it&#39;s going to take things a bit slower. Google says this delay\u00a0will &#34;allow sufficient time for public discussion on the right solutions, continued engagement with regulators, and for publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services.&#34; While FLoC is Google&#39;s primary pitch for a user-tracking ad cookie replacement, it&#39;s not the only plan. The company says that &#34;Chrome and others have offered more than 30 proposals, and four of those proposals are available in origin trials.&#34;\n Google has committed to a public development and testing period, with &#34;Stage 1&#34;\u2014the completion of testing and the launch of user tracking APIs\u2014happening in late 2022. Stage 1 will last for nine months, giving publishers and the advertising industry time to migrate their services. &#34;Stage 2&#34; starts in mid-2023, when Chrome will phase out support for third-party cookies over a three-month period.

The language in the email is terse, but it appears to say that the attacks target devices that are exposed to the Internet. When the attackers succeed in accessing the device, the email further appears to say, they are then able to connect to previously unknown accounts hardwired into the devices.\n  \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the situation and have been working our best to investigate and resolve it,\u201d the email, which was  posted to Twitter, said. \u201cThe threat actor attempts to access a device through WAN; if successful, they then bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts, such as \u2018zyxel_silvpn,\u2019 \u2018zyxel_ts,\u2019 or \u2018zyxel_vpn_test,\u2019 to manipulate the device&#39;s configuration.\u201d\n It remains unclear if the weaknesses under attack are new or were previously known. Equally unclear is how many customers are under attack, what their geographical breakdown is, and if attacks are successfully compromising customer devices or simply attempting to do so.\n  Initially reported from users in Europe, Zyxel became aware of a sophisticated threat actor that attempts to access a subset of Zyxel security devices through the WAN in order to bypass authentication and establish SSL VPN tunnels with unknown user accounts. Zyxel is currently evaluating the attack vectors to determine whether this is a known or unknown vulnerability.\n Zyxel has developed guidance to enable users to temporarily mitigate the security incident and contain the threat. A SOP was sent out to all registered users of USG/ZyWALL, USG FLEX, ATP, or VPN series devices. Zyxel is developing a firmware update to address user interface security practices as described in the SOP to reduce the attack surface.\n The number of affected customers is unknown at this time because it appears that the devices being exploited have their web management publicly accessible and are not locked down.\n Based on the vague details available so far, the vulnerability sounds reminiscent of  CVE-2020-29583, which stemmed from an undocumented account with full administrative system rights that used the hardcoded password \u201cPrOw!aN_fXp.\u201d When Zyxel  fixed the vulnerability in January, however, the account was listed as \u201czyfwp,\u201d a name that doesn\u2019t appear in the email Zyxel sent to customers this week.\n    In any event, the email said that the best way for customers to secure their Zyxel devices is to following guidelines published  here. The guidelines contain generic advice such as configuring appliances using the lowest privileges possibile, patching devices, using two-factor authentication, and remaining wary of phishing attacks.\n The email comes as firewalls, VPNs, and other devices used to secure networks have emerged as a key vector for hackers pushing ransomware- or espionage-motivated attacks. The appliances typically sit at the network perimeter to filter or block traffic moving into or out of the organization. Once breached, these devices often give attackers the ability to pivot to internal networks.\n In the past few years, vulnerabilities in the Fortigate SSL VPN, and the competing Pulse Secure SSL VPN  have  come  under  attack. Devices from  Sonicwall have also been compromised through security vulnerabilities. The threats show how security appliances can actually make networks less secure when they\u2019re not carefully locked down.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 04:32:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,unknown,\u653b\u51fb", "title": "\u9ed1\u5ba2\u6b63\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5e10\u6237\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4dZyxel\u9632\u706b\u5899\u548cVPN ", "title_en": "Hackers are using unknown user accounts to target Zyxel firewalls and VPNs", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/zyxel-scrambles-to-thwart-active-hacks-targeting-customers-firewalls-and-vpns/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ed1\u5ba2", "unknown", "\u653b\u51fb"]}]
