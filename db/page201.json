"note_en": "From England, my brother set up the Zoom calls every Sunday, our boisterous lockdown ritual, two siblings joining from Lagos, three from the United States, and my parents, sometimes echoing and crackly, from Abba, our ancestral home town, in southeastern Nigeria. On June 7th, there was my father, only his forehead on the screen, as usual, because he never quite knew how to hold his phone during video calls. \u201cMove your phone a bit, Daddy,\u201d one of us would say. My father was teasing my brother Okey about a new nickname, then he was saying that he hadn\u2019t had dinner because they\u2019d had a late lunch, then he was talking about the billionaire from the next town who wanted to claim our village\u2019s ancestral land. He felt a bit unwell, had been sleeping poorly, but we were not to worry. On June 8th, Okey went to Abba to see him and said that he looked tired. On June 9th, I kept our chat brief so that he could rest. He laughed quietly when I did my usual playful imitation of a relative. \u201c Ka chi fo,\u201d he said. (\u201cGood night.\u201d) His last words to me. On June 10th, he was gone. My brother Chuks called to tell me, and I came undone.\n  My four-year-old daughter says I scared her. She gets down on her knees to demonstrate, her small clenched fist rising and falling, and her mimicry makes me see myself as I was, utterly unravelling, screaming and pounding the floor. The news is like a vicious uprooting. I am yanked away from the world I have known since childhood. And I am resistant: my father read the newspaper that afternoon; he joked with Okey about shaving before his appointment with the kidney specialist in Onitsha the next day; he discussed his hospital test results on the phone with my sister Ijeoma, who is a doctor, and so how can this be? But there he is. Okey is holding a phone over my father\u2019s face, and my father looks asleep, his face relaxed, beautiful in repose. Our Zoom call is beyond surreal, all of us weeping and weeping and weeping, in different parts of the world, looking in disbelief at the father we adore now lying still on a hospital bed. It happened a few minutes before midnight, Nigerian time, with Okey by his side and Chuks on speakerphone. I stare and stare at my father. My breathing is difficult. Is this what shock means, that the air turns to glue? My sister Uche says that she has just told a family friend by text, and I almost scream, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t tell anyone, because if we tell people, then it becomes true.\u201d My husband is saying, \u201cBreathe slowly; drink some of this water.\u201d My housecoat, my lockdown staple, is lying crumpled on the floor. Later, my brother Kene will jokingly say, \u201cYou better not get any shocking news in public, since you react to shock by tearing off your clothes.\u201d\n  Grief is a cruel kind of education. You learn how ungentle mourning can be, how full of anger. You learn how glib condolences can feel. You learn how much grief is about language, the failure of language and the grasping for language. Why are my sides so sore and achy? It\u2019s from crying, I\u2019m told. I did not know that we cry with our muscles. The pain is not surprising, but its physicality is, my tongue unbearably bitter, as though I ate a loathed meal and forgot to clean my teeth, on my chest a heavy, awful weight, and inside my body a sensation of eternal dissolving. My heart\u2014my actual physical heart, nothing figurative here\u2014is running away from me, has become its own separate thing, beating too fast, its rhythms at odds with mine. This is an affliction not merely of the spirit but of the body. Flesh, muscles, organs are all compromised. No physical position is comfortable. For weeks, my stomach is in turmoil, tense and tight with foreboding, the ever-present certainty that somebody else will die, that more will be lost. One morning, Okey calls me a little earlier than usual, and I think, Just tell me, tell me immediately, who has died now. Is it Mummy?\n  In my American home, I like to have National Public Radio on as background noise, and whenever my father was staying he would turn it off if nobody was there listening to it.\n  \u201cI just thought about how Daddy was always turning off the radio and I was always turning it back on. He probably thought it was wasteful in some way,\u201d I tell Okey.\n  \u201cLike he always wanted to turn off the generator too early in Abba. I\u2019d so happily let him now if he\u2019ll just come back,\u201d Okey says, and we laugh.\n  \u201cAnd I will start to wake up early, and I\u2019ll start to eat  garri, and I\u2019ll go to Mass every Sunday,\u201d I say, and we laugh.\n I retell the story of my parents visiting me in my graduate-student apartment at Yale, where I say, \u201cDaddy, will you have some pomegranate juice? And he says, \u2018No, thank you, whatever that is.\u2019 \u201d\n Pomegranate juice became a standing joke. All those standing jokes we had, frequently told and retold, my father\u2019s expression this minute utterly deadpan and, in the next, wide open with delighted laughter. Another revelation: how much laughter is a part of grief. Laughter is tightly braided into our family argot, and now we laugh, remembering my father, but somewhere in the background of the laughter there is a haze of disbelief. The laughter trails off. The laughter becomes tears and becomes sadness and becomes rage. I am unprepared for my wretched, roaring rage. In the face of this inferno that is sorrow, I am callow and unformed. But how is it that in the morning he was joking and talking, and at night he was gone forever? It was so fast, too fast. It was not supposed to happen like this, not like a malicious surprise, not during a pandemic that has shut down the world. Throughout the lockdown, my father and I talked about how strange it all was, how scary, and he told me often not to worry about my doctor husband. \u201cYou actually drink warm water, Daddy?\u201d I asked one day, surprised, after he said with sheepish humor that he\u2019d read somewhere that drinking warm water might prevent the coronavirus infection. He laughed at himself and told me that warm water was harmless, after all, not like the nonsense that went around during the Ebola scare, when people were bathing in saline before dawn. To my \u201cHow are you, Daddy?,\u201d he would always respond, \u201c Enwerom nsogbu chacha.\u201d (\u201cI have no problems at all. I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d) And he really was, until he wasn\u2019t.\n  Messages pour in, and I look at them as through a mist. Who is this message for? \u201cOn the loss of your father,\u201d one says. Whose father? My sister forwards a message from her friend, saying that my father was humble despite his accomplishments. My fingers start to tremble, and I push my phone away. He  was not. He  is. There is a video of people trooping into our house for  mgbalu, to give condolences, and I want to reach in and wrench them away from our living room, where already my mother is settled on the sofa in placid widow pose. A table is in front of her like a barrier, to maintain social distance. Already friends and relatives are saying that this must be done and that must be done. A condolence register must be placed by the front door, and my sister goes off to buy a bolt of white lace to cover the table, and my brother buys a hardcover notebook, and already people are bending to write in the book. I think, Go home! Why are you coming to our house to write in that alien notebook? How dare you make this thing true? Somehow, these well-wishers have become complicit. I feel myself breathing air that is bittersweet with my own conspiracies. Needle pricks of resentment flood through me at the thought of people who are more than eighty-eight years old, older than my father and alive and well. My anger scares me, my fear scares me, and somewhere in there is shame, too\u2014why am I so enraged and so scared? I am afraid of going to bed and of waking up, afraid of tomorrow and all the tomorrows after. I am filled with disbelieving astonishment that the mailman comes as usual and people are inviting me to speak somewhere and regular news alerts appear on my phone screen. How is it that the world keeps going, breathing in and out unchanged, while in my soul there is a permanent scattering?\n  Grief is forcing new skins on me, scraping scales from my eyes. I regret my past certainties: Surely you should mourn, talk through it, face it, go through it. The smug certainties of a person yet unacquainted with grief. I have mourned in the past, but only now have I touched grief\u2019s core. Only now do I learn, while feeling for its porous edges, that there is no way through. I am in the center of this churning, and I have become a maker of boxes, and inside their unbending walls I cage my thoughts. I torque my mind firmly to its shallow surface alone. I cannot think too much; I dare not think too deeply, or else I will be defeated, not merely by pain but by a drowning nihilism, a cycle of thinking there\u2019s no point, what\u2019s the point, there\u2019s no point to anything. There is a grace in denial, Chuks says, words that I repeat to myself. A refuge, this denial, this refusal to look. Of course, the effort is its own grieving, and so I am un-looking in the oblique shadow of looking, but imagine the catastrophe of a direct, unswerving stare. Often, too, there is the urge to run and run, to hide. But I cannot always run, and each time I am forced to squarely confront my grief\u2014when I read the death certificate, when I draft a death announcement\u2014I feel a shimmering panic. In such moments, I notice a curious physical reaction: my body begins to shake, my fingers tap uncontrollably, one leg bobs. For the first time in my life, I am enamored of sleeping pills, and, in the middle of a shower or a meal, I burst into tears.\n  My wariness of superlatives is forever stripped away: June 10, 2020, was the worst day of my life. The week before June 10th, while running around playing with my daughter, I fell and hit my head and suffered a concussion. For days, I felt unmoored, sensitive to sound and light. I did not call my parents daily as usual. When I finally called, my father wanted to talk not about his feeling unwell but about my head. Concussions can be slow to heal, he told me. \u201cYou just said \u2018concoction\u2019; the word is \u2018concussion,\u2019 \u201d my mother said from the background. I wish I had not missed those few days of calling them, because I would have sensed that he wasn\u2019t only mildly unwell, and I would have insisted that he go to the hospital much sooner. I wish, I wish. The guilt gnaws at my soul. I think of all the things that could have happened and all the ways that the world could be reshaped, to prevent what happened on June 10th, to make it un-happen. I worry about Okey, a stalwart, sensitive soul, whose burden is different from ours because he is the one who was there. He agonizes about what else he could have done when my father that night started to show discomfort, telling him, \u201cHelp me sit up\u201d and then saying, no, he would rather lie back down. Okey says that my father prayed, calmly, quietly, what sounded like lines from the rosary in Igbo. Does it comfort me to hear this? Only in the sense that it must have comforted my father.\n  The cause was complications from kidney failure. An infection, the doctor said, exacerbated his long-term kidney disease. But what infection? Of course, I wonder about the coronavirus. Some journalists had come to our house to interview him a few weeks before, about the case of the billionaire who wanted to take our home town\u2019s land\u2014a dispute that consumed my father these past two years. Might he have been exposed then? The doctor doesn\u2019t think so, even though he was not tested, because he would have had symptoms, and nobody else around him had symptoms. He needed hydration, and so he was admitted to the hospital and put on I.V. fluids. Okey stripped the tatty hospital bedsheets and brought sheets from home.\n  Because I loved my father so much, so fiercely, so tenderly, I always at the back of my mind feared this day. But lulled by his relative good health, I thought we had time. I thought it was not yet time. \u201cI was so sure Daddy was nineties material,\u201d my brother Kene says. We all did. But did I sense a truth that I also fully denied? Did my spirit know, the way anxiety sat sharp like claws in my stomach once I heard that he was unwell, the hovering, darkening pall that I could neither name nor shake off? I am the Family Worrier, but even for me it was extreme, how desperately I wished that Nigerian airports were open so I could get on a flight to Lagos, and then on a flight to Asaba and drive the hour to my home town to see my father for myself. So I knew. I was so close to my father that I knew, without wanting to know, without fully knowing that I knew. A thing like this, dreaded for so long, comes at last, and among the avalanche of emotions there is a bitter and unbearable relief. It comes as a form of aggression, this relief, bringing with it strangely pugnacious thoughts. Enemies beware: the worst has happened; my father is gone; my madness will now bare itself.\n  How quickly my life has become another life, how pitiless this becoming is, and yet how slow I am to adapt. Okey sends me a video of an elderly woman who walks through our front door, crying, and I think, I have to ask Daddy who she is. In that small moment, what has been true for the forty-two years of my life is still true\u2014that my father is tactile, inhaling, exhaling, reachable to talk to and to watch the twinkle of his eyes behind his glasses. Then, with a horrible lurch, I remember again. That brief forgetting feels like both a betrayal and a blessing. Do I forget because I am not there? I think so. My brother and sister are there, face to face with the desolation of a house without my father. They can see that he is not at the dining table for breakfast, on his chair backing the window\u2019s light, and that after breakfast he is not settled on the sofa in his midmorning ritual of napping, reading, and napping again. If only I could be there, too, but I am stuck in America, my frustration like a blister, scouring for news on when the Nigerian airports will open. Even the Nigerian authorities don\u2019t seem to know. A report says July, then August, then we hear it might be in October, but the aviation minister tweets to say \u201cmay be earlier than October.\u201d Maybe, maybe not, like playing yo-yo with a cat.\n   I back away from condolences. People are kind, people mean well, but knowing this does not make their words rankle less. \u201cOn the demise of your father.\u201d Demise. A favorite of Nigerians, it conjures for me dark distortions. \u201cHe is resting\u201d brings not comfort but a scoff that trails its way to pain. He could very well be resting in his room in our house in Abba, fan whirring warm air, his bed strewn with folded newspapers, a sudoku book, an old brochure from a funeral, a Knights of St. Mulumba calendar, a bag filled with his bottles of medicine, and his notebooks with the carefully lined pages, where he recorded every single thing he ate, a diabetic\u2019s account-taking. \u201cHe is in a better place\u201d is startling in its presumptuousness and has a taint of the inapt. How would you know\u2014and shouldn\u2019t I, the bereaved, be privy to this information first; should I really be learning this from you? \u201cHe was eighty-eight\u201d so deeply riles because age is irrelevant in grief; at issue is not how old he was but how loved. \u201cIt has happened so just celebrate his life,\u201d an old friend wrote, and it incensed me\u2014how facile to preach about the permanence of death, when it is, in fact, the permanence of death that is the source of anguish. I wince now at the words I said in the past to grieving friends. \u201cFind peace in your memories,\u201d I used to say. Rather than succor, my memories bring eloquent stabs of pain that say, \u201cThis is what you will never again have.\u201d\n  What does not feel like the deliberate prodding of wounds is a simple \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d because in its banality it presumes nothing.  Ndo, in Igbo, comforts more, a word that is \u201csorry,\u201d with a metaphysical heft. Concrete and sincere memories from those who knew him comfort the most, and it warms me that the same words recur: \u201chonest,\u201d \u201ccalm,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cstrong,\u201d \u201cquiet,\u201d \u201csimple,\u201d \u201cpeaceful,\u201d \u201cintegrity.\u201d My mother says that Ayogu called her to say that my father was the only boss who \u201cnever gave him any trouble.\u201d I remember Ayogu, tall with a genteel manner, my father\u2019s driver when my father was the deputy vice-chancellor of the University of Nigeria, in the nineteen-eighties. Was it Ayogu, or was it the other driver, Kevin, the charming firebrand, of whom my father once calmly said, when I had asserted with the haughtiness of a seven-year-old that I wanted my driver to take me to school, \u201cHe is  my driver, not your driver.\u201d\n  There is value in that Igbo way, that African way, of grappling with grief, the performative, expressive outward mourning, where you take every call and you tell and retell the story of what happened, where isolation is anathema and \u201cstop crying\u201d a refrain. But I am not ready. I talk only to my closest family. It is instinctive, my recoiling. I imagine the bewilderment of some relatives, their disapproval even. At first, it is a protective stance, but later it is because I want to sit alone with my grief.\n  My parents\u2019 cold-weather clothes hang in the closet of the guest room that my daughter calls \u201cGrandpa and Grandma\u2019s room.\u201d I touch my father\u2019s puffy olive jacket. In the drawer are his maps of Maryland, just as he has maps of New England in a drawer in my sister\u2019s Connecticut home. During the months that he and my mother spent yearly in the U.S., he would study his beloved maps, the boundaries of counties, what was north and south of what, and trace every journey, even trips out to brunch. Scenes from my father\u2019s last visit: He is walking up and down the driveway, his daily morning exercise, no longer as briskly as before, and he has decided to keep count with stones, and so we find a pile of stones near the front door. He is getting cookies in the pantry, blithely unaware of his trail of crumbs. He is standing right in front of the television, his code for \u201cyou all need to stop talking,\u201d watching Rachel Maddow, whom he calls \u201cbright,\u201d while shaking his head at the imbroglio America has become.\n  I reread \u201cBiography of Nigeria\u2019s Foremost Professor of Statistics, Prof. James Nwoye Adichie,\u201d by Emeritus Professor Alex Animalu, Professor Peter I. Uche, and Jeff Unaegbu, published in 2013, three years before my father was made professor emeritus of the University of Nigeria. The printing is uneven, the pages slightly askew, but I feel a euphoric rush of gratitude to the authors. Why does this line\u2014\u201cthe children and I adore him\u201d\u2014from my mother\u2019s tribute soothe me so; why does it feel pacifying and prophetic? It pleases me that it exists, forever declared in print. I rummage in my study for the old letters he sent from Nigeria when I first came to the U.S. to attend college, and when I find them there is an intense pathos to looking at his handwriting. It tells his story, that handwriting, the curvy script of a certain kind of colonial African education, prudent and proper, Latin-loving and rule-following.  Nnem ochie, he called me. (\u201cMy grandmother.\u201d) He always ended with \u201cYour dad\u201d and his signature. He wrote his signature even on our birthday cards, which made my siblings and I laugh. \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s not a university memo,\u201d we\u2019d say. I look everywhere for the piece of paper on which he drew for me our family tree going back four generations, and I cannot find it\u2014and that I cannot find it causes me distress for days, boxes and files flung open, papers thrown aside. I look at old photographs, and from time to time my whole body swells with a sob. My father often looked stiff in photos because he grew up knowing photography as a rare and formal event at which you dressed up and sat, uncomfortable, before a man with a tripod. \u201cDaddy, relax; Daddy, smile.\u201d Sometimes I tried pinching his neck. There is a photo of him I remember \n......", "posttime": "2020-11-10 09:59:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7b14\u8bb0,notes,\u7236\u4eb2", "title": "\u5173\u4e8e\u60b2\u75db\u7684\u7b14\u8bb0", "title_en": "Notes on Grief", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/notes-on-grief", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7b14\u8bb0", "notes", "\u7236\u4eb2"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6e037297b68f4d92a5d454aa5adb3c8e.png", "infoid": 1034186, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u665a\u4e0a9\u70b9\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u670b\u53cb\u5bb6\uff0c\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u770b\u7684\u8282\u76ee\u7ed3\u675f\u4e86\u3002\u4f60\u4e89\u5148\u6050\u540e\u5730\u6362\u9891\u9053\uff0c\u4f46\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u9065\u63a7\u5668\u3002\u4f60\u76ef\u7740\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u6309\u94ae\uff0c\u5374\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u54ea\u91cc\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u89c9\u5f97\u81ea\u5df1\u5f88\u8822\u5417\uff1f\u4e00\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u6709\u6240\u6536\u83b7\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4f60\u5c31\u662f\u60f3\u4e0d\u51fa\u6765\u5462\uff1f\n\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e38\u5e38\u81ea\u8d23\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u591f\u806a\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u591f\u8010\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u591f\u80fd\u5e72\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u23e4\u4ea7\u54c1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u9020\u6210\u5e94\u529b\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u539f\u56e0\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u83b7\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u786e\u5b9e\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f53\u9a8c\u6765\u521b\u9020\u65b0\u7684\u611f\u89c9\u3002\n\u4e0b\u6b21\u4f60\u9047\u5230\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u65f6\uff0c\u82b1\u70b9\u65f6\u95f4\u96c6\u601d\u5e7f\u76ca\uff0c\u60f3\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u4f60\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f1a\u628a\u4f60\u5e26\u5230\u54ea\u91cc\u3002", "note_en": "It\u2019s 9pm, you\u2019re at your friend\u2019s house, and the show you\u2019re watching ends.

The source language&#39;sspeech content is transcribed to text, translated, and automaticallysynthesized into target language speech using the original speaker&#39;s voice. Thevisual content is translated by synthesizing lip movements for the speaker tomatch the translated audio, creating a seamless audiovisual experience in thetarget language. The audio and visual translation subsystems each contain alarge-scale generic synthesis model trained on thousands of hours of data inthe corresponding domain. These generic models are fine-tuned to a specificspeaker before translation, either using an auxiliary corpus of data from thetarget speaker, or using the video to be translated itself as the input to thefine-tuning process.

I wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to sit down at a piano for the first time and immediately play a concerto.\u201d \u2014 Nathan Barry\n Your time for money : the only skills you need are showing up consistently, being reliable, and learning new skills on the job. Nathan goes on to say, \u201cThen in order to take the next step up the ladder you will need to specialize in certain skills (design, copywriting, legal, becoming a nurse, etc) to gain a salaried position.\u201d\n Your own service business : This next rung on the ladder requires skills such as setting up a company, finding clients, creating proposals, pricing services, hiring employees, establishing an online presence, accounting, finance, business ops, etc.\n However, these two are probably the most important: follow up with customers and doing what you said you were going to do.\n Productized services : Nathan mentions, \u201c\u2026To truly reach new levels of income you need to learn a different lesson: how to sell without ever talking to the customer.\u201d This rung of the ladder requires you to learn how to write quality sales copy, design a sales page, process online payments, and create systems to deliver repeatable quality with each service.\n Selling products : Nathan continues, \u201cA product takes far more work to create upfront, but then each individual sale and the fulfillment of that sale happens without much (or any) additional effort from the business owner.\u201d\n \u201cAll across society extra money\u2014whether from a raise or working extra\u2014disappears into lifestyle inflation or temporary purchases, when it could be put to work so much more effectively.\u201d \u2014 Nathan Barry\n You should always trade your time for money if: You\u2019re getting paid to learn a new skill while growing your earning potential\n It\u2019s a step in getting to a higher rung or on to the next ladder\n    There\u2019s no secret formula for building wealth. It takes a ton of hard work and time. At the end of the day, it boils down to how much of your time you\u2019re willing to give up to make more money. If you\u2019re able to learn how to make more money while giving up less of your time, you\u2019re learning how to build wealth.

Engineering, accountant and business development positions are listed on its website, the type of jobs that suggest that The Boring Company sees enough opportunity in Austin to set up more permanent operations there.\n Rumor has it that &#34;Austin Chalk&#34; is geologically one of best soils for tunneling. Want to find out? Austin jobs now available. https://t.co/imlQMDfprJ\n Austin is becoming a hotbed of Musk-related activity. Tesla, which Musk leads, picked in July a site near Austin for its next U.S. factory, a four to five-million-square foot $1.1 billion plant that will assemble the automaker\u2019s futuristic Cybertruck, the Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for sales to customers on the East Coast.\n Musk described the future factory as an \u201cecological paradise,\u201d with a boardwalk and bike lanes and where the public will be welcome. It\u2019s unclear if the first customer of The Boring Company will be Tesla.\n  The Boring Company has five product lines, all of which are centered around tunneling. The startup, which raised  $120 million in new funding in summer 2019, offers the base tunnel to customers as well as those designed for use by utilities, pedestrians, freight and it\u2019s so-called Loop service.\n The company describes the Loop as an underground public transportation system in which passengers are transported via in autonomous vehicles at up to 150 miles per hour through tunnels between stations. The company says the autonomous vehicles are Tesla Model S, 3, and X. (It should be noted that while Tesla vehicles do have robust advanced driver assistance systems, they are not considered by government bodies such as the U.S. DOT as fully autonomous.)\n The Loop is what Las Vegas Las Vegas Convention Center officials sprang for. Under its contract, the LVCC Loop is supposed to transport attendees through two 0.8-mile underground tunnels in Tesla vehicles, four or five at a time. Planning files reviewed by TechCrunch seem to show that the Loop system will not be able to move anywhere near the number of people LVCC wants, and that TBC agreed to.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 09:41:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u57c3\u9686\u00b7\u9a6c\u65af\u514b,musk", "title": "\n\u57c3\u9686\u00b7\u9a6c\u65af\u514b(Elon Musk)\u7684\u94bb\u63a2\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u5965\u65af\u6c40\u5f00\u5c55\u4e1a\u52a1", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tElon Musk\u2019s Boring Company is setting up operations in Austin\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/elon-musks-boring-company-is-setting-up-operations-in-austin/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u57c3\u9686\u00b7\u9a6c\u65af\u514b", "musk"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "941648c9180a1c7c4a242804b418cba4.png", "infoid": 1034181, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7531\u590d\u5236\u548c\u5206\u4eab\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f2b\u753b(\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u51fa\u552e\u5b83\u4eec)\u3002\u66f4\u591a\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "note_en": "This means you&#39;re free to copy and share these comics (but not to sell them).

The company is promising the new chips will deliver improved performance with less power consumption, and the switch also means Apple computers will support native iOS apps due to Apple\u2019s A-series mobile and tablet chips sharing 64-bit Arm architecture.\n The fact that Apple silicon-based computers are likely launching on Tuesday isn\u2019t exactly a surprise; Apple said at WWDC  in June it expected to ship the first Mac with an Apple-designed CPU by the end of the year. But naming the event after  Steve Jobs\u2019 iconic phrase indicates Apple thinks this will be a significant moment for the company \u2014 and hopefully these computers will be worth the wait.\n  There\u2019s always the chance Apple will discuss other products as well. The company\u2019s September and October events didn\u2019t focus on just one product line; the September event featured both the Apple Watch and iPad, while the October event focused on the iPhone and the new HomePod mini. Rumors, as always, indicate Apple is working hard on lots of other products that may or may not see the light of day.\n The event kicks off at 1PM on Tuesday, so we won\u2019t have to wait long to learn what Apple will be announcing. Here\u2019s a rundown of what you can look out for.\n  While Apple has only  publicly promised to ship one Apple silicon-powered Mac computer by the end of the year, the company apparently plans to introduce more than one, according  to  Bloomberg. Apple is reportedly ramping up production of a new 13-inch MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and will show \u201cat least\u201d the two 13-inch laptops on Tuesday. Yet if you were hoping for a big design change to accompany the new internal architecture in the laptops, that\u2019s not in the cards, according to  Bloomberg.\n The processors in the new laptops will be \u201cbased on\u201d the A14 chip found in the iPhone 12 lineup and the new iPad Air,  Bloomberg reported. To help developers get a jump on porting their apps to the new chips, Apple has been offering a  Mac mini Developer Transition Kit that\u2019s powered by the A12Z, a variant of the A12 with an 8-core GPU that\u2019s also found in the most recent iPad Pros released in March. Perhaps Apple will take a similar approach for the A14-based chip in the upcoming laptops.\n We found the A14 was quite capable in  our  reviews of those iOS devices, and presumably, Apple will show some impressive demos of the chip in the new laptops at the event to give us an idea of what its custom silicon will be capable of in computers, too. It was  hard to tell just how fast the new chips will be when Apple first discussed them at WWDC, but it seems likely the company will go into a lot more detail about the processors\u2019 performance on Tuesday.\n It also seems like a safe bet that Apple will talk more about Rosetta 2, which can automatically translate some existing Intel apps, and how developers can make their existing iOS and iPadOS apps run natively on Apple\u2019s silicon-based Macs.\n If you\u2019re hoping that Apple introduces a desktop Mac with Apple silicon on Tuesday, though, you might be out of luck, as  Bloomberg\u2019s report didn\u2019t indicate that a new desktop will be announced at the event. Apple apparently does have a number of other Apple silicon-based Macs in the pipeline, though, including a redesigned iMac and a new Mac Pro.\n  If this is a Mac event as expected, then it seems likely that Apple will also give a release date for  macOS Big Sur, the next major macOS update. Big Sur brings a huge visual overhaul to macOS, with things like new iOS-style icons for Apple apps and a translucent menu bar that blends into your wallpaper. There\u2019s a dedicated control center to help you manage settings like Wi-Fi, display brightness, and volume, all in one place. And it\u2019s not just visuals that got an overhaul \u2014 Big Sur has new system sounds, including the  return of the Mac\u2019s famous startup chime.\n Many Mac apps get updates as well. Safari in Big Sur has a customizable start screen, tab previews, and a privacy report feature that shows you what trackers the browser has blocked. Messages  finally gets message effects, as well as features you might have already used in iOS 14, such as pinned replies and in-line conversations. Maps has a number of new features, too, including cycling directions and EV routing.\n  Although we\u2019re expecting Tuesday\u2019s event to be primarily about the Macs, Apple could certainly unveil non-Mac products.\n Apple has long been rumored to be developing new high-end, over-ear headphones, so perhaps the company will finally unveil those on Tuesday. The headphones are rumored to have  swappable ear pads and headbands, noise cancellation, Siri controls, and built-in touch controls. The headphones have recently run into some development difficulties, though, according to an  October 26th  Bloomberg report.\n The headphones were apparently set to go into production \u201cweeks ago,\u201d but that milestone was pushed because the headband was too tight. Apple also reduced the size of the touch pads on the sides of the headphones, and the headphones may no longer have a replaceable headband, according to  Bloomberg.\n We\u2019ve also been hearing rumors about Apple-made Tile-like trackers for quite awhile \u2014 references for the product appeared in iOS 13 beta code  last June. The trackers, which  could be called AirTags, are rumored to be  small circular discs that could let you track things like a bag or your wallet via Apple\u2019s Find My app. It\u2019s expected that AirTags will have ultra-wideband technology to help with more precise tracking.\n Apple is also apparently working on a new Apple TV with a faster processor and an \u201cupgraded\u201d remote control that may not come out until next year,  according to  Bloomberg. Given that rumored release date, though, it doesn\u2019t seem likely that Apple will announce it on Tuesday. And since Apple announced new Apple Watches and a new iPad Air in September and new iPhones in October, we probably won\u2019t see new versions of those products on Tuesday, either.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 09:19:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u53d1\u5e03,\u82f9\u679c,\u8033\u9ea6", "title": "\u4ece\u82f9\u679c\u7684\u201c\u518d\u6765\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u201d\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u671f\u5f85\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1a\u9996\u6279\u82f9\u679c\u7845\u7247\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Mac\uff0cMacOS Big Sur\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u7684AirTags\uff0c\u8033\u9ea6\u8033\u673a", "title_en": "What to expect from Apple's \u201cOne More Thing\u201d event: first Apple Silicon powered Macs, a macOS Big Sur release date, and potentially AirTags, over-ear headphones", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21552294/apple-event-mac-arm-silicon-one-more-thing-what-to-expect-big-sur?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u53d1\u5e03", "\u82f9\u679c", "\u8033\u9ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1b055b0d8f34b2e58bb08ccb080b6c0e.jpg", "infoid": 1034176, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4efd\u8d64\u88f8\u88f8\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u53ea\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u7d22\u5c3c\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u201c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\u201d\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u521b\u610f\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u3002\nAirPeak\u4e5f\u5c06\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u6253\u7b97\u4e0e\u5927\u7586(DJI)\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u5de5\u4f5c\u8981\u505a\u3002\u5927\u7586\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6d88\u8d39\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u9996\u9009\u3002\n\u7d22\u5c3c\u79f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b3e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u662f\u5728\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u201d\u5185\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\uff0c\u5176\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u4ee5\u524d\u5f88\u96be\u505a\u5230\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f7f\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7d22\u5c3c\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\u76f8\u5f53\u591a\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002\n\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u5f00\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5176\u4ed6\u98de\u884c\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4ecd\u53ea\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u3002\n\u9664\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u540d\u5b57\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u51e0\u4e4e\u53ef\u4ee5\u80af\u5b9a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5b50\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u7d22\u5c3c\u65b0\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u603b\u548c\u3002\u9884\u8ba1\u4f1a\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u53ca\u65f6\u53d1\u5e03\u5230\u5b98\u65b9\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u3002", "note_en": "The barebones announcement says only that Sony has been inspired by the \u201crecent proliferation\u201d of drones and the changes they have caused in both the industrial and creative sectors.\n Airpeak will focus on multiple industries as well, though it has its work cut out for it if it intends to go up against DJI, which has become the first choice in the consumer UAV sector.\n  Sony describes the drone as being developed within \u201cthe field of AI robotics,\u201d which, along with the aim to enable drone use where it was previously difficult to do so, suggests Sony plans to integrate a fair amount of intelligence into the drones\u2019 systems.\n Small UAVs have gotten smarter and smarter, able now to avoid obstacles, recognize other flying objects, and navigate between buildings without any intervention from their human operators. But many of these capabilities are still essentially theoretical rather than widely deployed.\n Beyond the name, general flavor of the project, and a render of what is almost certainly a rotor, that is the sum total of what we know about Sony\u2019s new project.

"note_en": "Mikey Dickerson , Administrator of the   U.S. Digital Service , and   Jen Pahlka , former Deputy CTO of the United States and founder of   Code for America , gave a talk at the 2015 SXSW Interactive Festival on \u201cHow Government Fails and How You Can Fix It.\u201d\n Healthcare.gov had just launched, and if you remember, it wasn\u2019t going too great. I was minding my own business in California working for Google. Although I had volunteered for the Obama campaigns, I had no other connection to the Administration and no government experience at all.\n I was visiting some friends from the campaign in Chicago when through some complicated series of connections that I still don\u2019t understand, I heard that the White House was looking to organize some kind of assessment of the website, and was asked to call in to a phone conference where I would get more information. The phone call was at 8:30 Eastern, so 5:30AM for me, so I was not too happy but I did it anyway.\n On the phone was a guy named Todd Park. I had never met Todd; I looked him up on Wikipedia while on the phone. With a couple more phone calls, I was talked into flying to Washington, D.C. for a few days to evaluate the situation.\n  The government shutdown was over, and the failure of Healthcare.gov was the lead story on cable news all day every day. The original estimate from the Congressional Budget Office had been that 7 million people would enroll in this first enrollment period, but Todd said that given the circumstances if we could manage 4 million, that would be a home run.\n He said they needed an independent outside team to figure out how bad the problems were and if they could be fixed to save the site this year. Also that if it couldn\u2019t be fixed, then it would be a catastrophe for the policy, with the 2014 election coming and the unpopular law having failed to launch. Democrat support would probably fracture, the election would be a disaster, the President would be a lame duck two years early, and nobody would try again for a generation. But you know, we want your honest assessment.\n \u201cThe whole system had worked as normal and produced the expected result, which was a web site that was overpriced by hundreds of millions of dollars and did not work, at all.\u201d\n  We looked around and found some really surprising things. One was that there was no monitoring of the production system. For those of you that run large distributed systems, you will understand that this is as if you are driving a bus with the windshield covered. Second was that there were hundreds of people and dozens of companies involved, but nobody in charge. Third was that there was no particular urgency about the situation. As I would come to understand, nobody was acting like there was anything out of the ordinary because there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n The whole system had worked as normal and produced the expected result, which was a web site that was overpriced by hundreds of millions of dollars and did not work, at all.\n Since there were so many really basic problems, we ended up recommending that the site could probably be fixed to work well enough to enroll the 4 million people. Of course, we were then asked to stay to follow through and implement those recommendations. (This is called commitment escalation, and we will do it to you. This is the only time I will warn you.)\n  I submitted an invoice for the nine week period ending December 31, 2013, and the mean hours per day worked was 17.5. I was hallucinating and having other problems from not having slept enough for three months. This was the hardest thing I have ever done and I hope nothing ever comes close to it again.\n \u201cThings did not go back to normal for me; they only continued to get weirder.\u201d\n  When I went home, other people had taken over the day to day operations and helped finish the enrollment period, which went to March 31. But things did not go back to normal for me; they only continued to get weirder. There had already been media interest in the people from the \u201ctech surge,\u201d and in March the final enrollment number of over 8 million was announced, and three of us from the \u201ctech surge\u201d team were on the cover of   Time Magazine. In May I went back one more time for an event where we met the President.\n I tell you all this not to prove how amazing we were, but exactly the opposite.\n Nothing we did was technically difficult by any standard we are used to. There were simple problems with simple solutions. The solution to the lack of monitoring was to install monitoring. The solution to nobody being in charge was to make everybody come to the same room where we could coordinate. And so on. It was not a hard engineering problem, and any of you could have done it, and it was also more important and meaningful than anything I could have accomplished in a lifetime working at my old job.\n Beyond the 8 million people that got access to health care for the first time, which for many of them was a matter of life or death, I don\u2019t think we are ever going back to the time when people who actually need health insurance are not allowed to buy it.\n So I went back to my old job and tried to care about it. I was not successful. On one hand the company does not need me; there are thousands of other engineers that are as good or better. On the other hand, if I succeeded beyond anybody\u2019s wildest dreams the net effect is that some extra billions of dollars would go to one billionaire instead of a different billionaire. It was hard to see why I should bother, and still is.\n  People that had been working on government technology reform for years had received a huge boost from the Healthcare.gov meltdown. So pretty soon Todd Park was calling me again, asking me to come work for a group that has now become known as the  U.S. Digital Service. It took a few months to convince me, but in August I finally left Google forever and moved to Washington.\n \u201cI expected that the difficult problems would be recruiting 10 more engineers to make this questionable life decision, and getting agencies to accept outside help.\u201d\n The basic theory of the  U.S. Digital Service is to replicate the ingredients that were successful on turning around Healthcare.gov, for a few other high priority projects. With the money we basically had left over in an IT oversight fund, I expected to hire about 10 to 12 people and take on three projects, which I thought would be the Affordable Care Act, the VA, and immigration. I expected that the difficult problems would be recruiting 10 more engineers to make this questionable life decision, and getting agencies to accept outside help.\n   Where I was worried about recruiting 10 people, I actually got over a thousand applications. The demand from the agencies is also more than we could ever satisfy. We have met with 22 of them and identified around 60 projects that need attention.\n And possibly the most surprising thing was that Congress passed an omnibus spending bill in December, and it included the full $20M funding request to operate the  U.S. Digital Service. This will allow us to grow to about 40 people and take on 10 projects in 2015.\n  Right now, at least, in this moment, we have overwhelming demand for engineers like yourself in the federal government. And we have overwhelming supply of people that want to come help.\n For these reasons, we have proposed in the President\u2019s 2016 budget a total of $105 million to create copies of the  U.S. Digital Service team inside all of the 24 major agencies, for a total of around 500 people. The artificial barrier that has kept the technology industry and the public sector separated on different evolutionary paths is porous right now, and if enough people cross over, it can be destroyed.\n Some of you, not all of you, are working right now on another app for people to share pictures of food or a social network for dogs. I am here to tell you that your country has a better use for your talents.\n \u201cAll of these are design and information processing problems and all of these are matters of life or death to millions of citizens and all of them are things you can fix if you choose to.\u201d\n The Affordable Care Act, I just told you about. The Social Security Administration mails checks from a mainframe running COBOL, which might kind of be OK except that more than half of the workforce that maintains it is at or near retirement age. What happens then? The Department of Veterans Affairs has a serious backlog of disability claims. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service processes permanent resident applications and everything else on paper. If you lose your green card, it will take you 6\u20138 months to get a new one and in the meantime you will not be able to prove you have the right to be in the country or get a job.\n All of these are design and information processing problems and all of these are matters of life or death to millions of citizens and all of them are things you can fix if you choose to.\n   This is a market economy and you \u2014 and your talents \u2014 are the crucial capital. Whether you know it or not, you are making decisions about how we allocate resources. We can solve any of these problems but we have to choose to do it.\n The most sobering thing about my time in government is to really understand on an emotional level that this country belongs to you and me and it is exactly as good as we make it. Grownups are not going to fix it for us and billionaires are not going to fix it for us. We either do it ourselves, or nobody does.

"note_en": "Apple will hold another  special event tomorrow, and we expect to see the first Mac with Apple Silicon chips. While we don\u2019t know much about these Macs, Apple confirmed at WWDC 2020 that ARM Macs will be able to run any iOS app \u2014 however, things will not be as easy as you might think.\n  Since Apple Silicon Macs will have the same processors as iPhone and iPad, Apple will let users download and install iOS apps on these Macs even if the developer doesn\u2019t offer a specific version of the app for macOS.\n In theory, all the apps designed for iPhone and iPad will be available on the Mac App Store when accessed through an Apple Silicon Mac, but in reality, there will be multiple apps missing. Although by default all iOS apps are available on the Mac App Store for Apple Silicon, the company is allowing developers to opt their iOS apps out of the new unified store.\n 9to5Mac found out that some major iOS app developers have already chosen not to offer their apps on the Mac App Store to Apple Silicon Mac owners \u2014 at least for now. We were able to check this information through the App Store system that revealed to us which iOS apps will not work on the new Macs with Apple Silicon chip.\n If you were expecting to watch YouTube on your new Mac with a native app, you\u2019re out of luck. Google has chosen not to offer most of its apps on the Apple Silicon platform, and this also includes Google Maps, Google Drive, and Gmail apps. On the other hand, the Netflix app for iOS is still on track to be available on new Macs, as well as the HBO Max app.\n Facebook has also chosen not to include its iOS apps on the Mac App Store, such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the Facebook app itself. There are some other noteworthy apps that will be missing from the Mac App Store, including Snapchat, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+.\n We also checked some popular games like Candy Crush, Among Us, and Real Racing 3, but they won\u2019t be available on the App Store for Apple Silicon Macs either. However, Sky: Children of the Light, Subway Surfers, and Temple Run might be.\n Users will find the following message on the App Store for compatible iOS apps:  \u201cDesigned for iPad. Not verified for macOS.\u201d If the app is not compatible, the App Store will tell the user to download it on an iPhone or iPad.\n Keep in mind that this doesn\u2019t mean these mentioned apps will actually be available on Mac App Store with Apple Silicon once Apple launches the new Macs or even that the developers who opted out will never offer their apps for macOS. Some developers may have chosen to temporarily remove their apps from the Mac App Store until they ensure the apps work properly on the Apple Silicon Mac, while others haven\u2019t yet decided whether or not to remove their apps from the store.\n 9to5Mac will have full live coverage of Apple\u2019s November event, so be sure to tune in on Tuesday, November 10, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET for everything you need to know.\n  You\u2019re reading 9to5Mac \u2014 experts who break news about Apple and its surrounding ecosystem, day after day.

"note_en": "Editor\u2019s Note:  Concurrency is one of the hardest concepts for many developers to grasp, but it is an important concept to grasp in modern software development. In this excerpt from the first chapter of her book  Concurrency in Go , Katherine Cox-Buday discusses one of the most common issues with concurrent programming: race conditions.\n  Concurrent code is notoriously difficult to get right. It usually takes a few iterations to get it working as expected, and even then it\u2019s not uncommon for bugs to exist in code for years before some change in timing (heavier disk utilization, more users logged into the system, etc.) causes a previously undiscovered bug to rear its head. Indeed, for this very book, I\u2019ve gotten as many eyes as possible on the code to try and mitigate this.\n Fortunately  everyone runs into the same issues when working with concurrent code. Because of this, computer scientists have been able to label the common issues, which allows us to discuss how they arise, why, and how to solve them.\n  A race condition occurs when two or more operations must execute in the correct order, but the program has not been written so that this order is guaranteed to be maintained.\n Most of the time, this shows up in what\u2019s called a  data race, where one concurrent operation attempts to read a variable while at some undetermined time another concurrent operation is attempting to write to the same variable.\n  1  var data  int 2  go  func() { // In Go, you can use the go keyword to run a  // function concurrently. Doing so creates  // what\u2019s called a  goroutine.   3 data++ 4 }() 5  if data == 0 { 6 fmt.Printf(&#34;the value is %v.\\n&#34;, data) 7 }\n Here, lines 3 and 5 are both trying to access the variable data, but there is no guarantee what order this might happen in. There are three possible outcomes to running this code:\n \u201cthe value is 0\u201d is printed. In this case, lines 5 and 6 were executed before line 3.\n \u201cthe value is 1\u201d is printed. In this case, line 5 was executed before line 3, but line 3 was executed before line 6.\n As you can see, just a few lines of incorrect code can introduce tremendous variability into your program.\n Most of the time, data races are introduced because the developers are thinking about the problem sequentially. They assume that because a line of code falls before another that it will run first. They assume the goroutine above will be scheduled and execute before the  data variable is read in the  if statement.\n When writing concurrent code, you have to meticulously iterate through the possible scenarios. Unless you\u2019re utilizing some of the techniques we\u2019ll cover later in the book, you have no guarantees that your code will run in the order it\u2019s listed in the sourcecode. I sometimes find it helpful to imagine a large period of time passing between operations. Imagine an hour passes between the time when the goroutine is invoked, and when it is run. How would the rest of the program behave? What if it took an hour between the goroutine executing successfully and the program reaching the  if statement? Thinking in this manner helps me because to a computer, the scale may be different, but the relative time differentials are more or less the same.\n Indeed, some developers fall into the trap of sprinkling sleeps throughout their code exactly because it seems to solve their concurrency problems. Let\u2019s try that in the preceding program:\n 1  var data  int 2  go  func() { data++ }() 3 time.Sleep(1*time.Second)  // This is bad! 4  if data == 0 { 5 fmt.Printf(&#34;the value is %v.\\n&#34; data) 6 }\n Have we solved our data race? No. In fact, it\u2019s still possible for all three outcomes to arise from this program, just increasingly  unlikely. The longer we sleep in between invoking our goroutine and checking the value of data, the closer our program gets to achieving correctness \u2014 but this probability asymptotically approaches logical correctness; it will never be logically correct.\n In addition to this, we\u2019ve now introduced an inefficiency into our algorithm. We now have to sleep for one second to make it more likely we won\u2019t see our data race. If we utilized the correct tools, we might not have to wait at all, or the wait could be only a microsecond.\n The takeaway here is that you should always target logical correctness. Introducing sleeps into your code can be a handy way to debug concurrent programs, but they are not a solution.\n Race conditions are one of the most insidious types of concurrency bugs because they may not show up until years after the code has been placed into production. They are usually precipitated by a change in the environment the code is executing in, or an unprecedented occurrence. In these cases, the code seems to be behaving correctly, but in reality, there\u2019s just a very high chance that the operations will be executed in order. Sooner or later, the program will have an unintended consequence.\n  Join the O\u2019Reilly online learning platform.

You\u2019d set it up between your cable box and your TV, plug it into your network, and bam: you\u2019re streaming live TV,  from your TV, wherever you might be. You could even control it as if you were actually there, thanks to a spiderweb of IR transmitters you\u2019d wire up in your entertainment center to act as your extra-remote remote control.\n In the mid-2000s, it seemed like magic. In 2020, it\u2019s\u2026 not quite as necessary. As a result, the company behind the Slingbox has announced that all Slingbox products are now discontinued, and will become less and less functional leading up to a full shutdown two years from today.\n   Slingbox servers will be permanently taken offline 24 months after the discontinued announcement date (November 9, 2020), at which point ALL Slingbox devices and services will become inoperable.\n Until then, most Slingbox models will continue to work normally, but the number of supported devices for viewing will steadily decrease as versions of the SlingPlayer apps become outdated and/or lose compatibility.\n As for anyone who wants to keep using their Slingbox until the servers are shuttered? That\u2019s a bit trickier.\n The company says that (for now) they\u2019ll continue to offer the required SlingPlayer app for iPhones, iPads, older versions of macOS, Windows, and Amazon Fire TV and tablets \u2014 but don\u2019t expect any updates, and even those apps could vanish suddenly. The free Android app seems to still be available, whereas the paid version is gone, as are the Roku and Windows Phone (RIP) apps.\n Of course, the writing has been on the wall here for years now. Slingbox was acquired by EchoStar for $380 million in 2007; by 2017, they\u2019d stopped manufacturing new hardware and were mostly focusing on integrating the technology directly into Dish Network boxes. Hell, they  haven\u2019t even tweeted in nearly two years. If you\u2019ve still got a Slingbox setup that seems to be working, you\u2019ve got a little under two years (max) to figure out something else.", "posttime": "2020-11-10 07:22:10", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Just in time for Flash Memory Summit, Micron is announcing their fifth generation of 3D NAND flash memory, with a record-breaking 176 layers. The new 176L flash is their second generation developed since the dissolution of Micron&#39;s memory collaboration with Intel, after which Micron switched from a floating-gate memory cell design to a charge-trap cell. Micron&#39;s previous generation 3D NAND was a 128-layer design that served as a short-lived transitional node for them to work out any issues with the switch to charge trap flash. Micron&#39;s 128L flash has had minimal presence on the market, so their new 176L flash will in many cases serve as the successor to their 96L 3D NAND as well.\n  Micron is still withholding many technical details about their 176L NAND, with more information planned to be shared at the end of the month. But for now, we know their first 176L parts are 512Gbit TLC dies, built using string stacking of two 88-layer decks\u2014Micron would seem to now be in second place behind Samsung for how many layers of NAND flash memory cells they can fabricate at a time, and clearly in first place for the total number of layers on a die.\n    The switch to a replacement gate/charge trap cell design seems to have enabled a significant reduction in layer thickness: the 176L dies are 45\u00b5m thick, about the same total thickness as Micron&#39;s 64L floating-gate 3D NAND. A 16-die stacked package comes in at less than 1.5mm thick, suitable for most mobile and memory card use cases. As with previous generations of Micron 3D NAND, the chip&#39;s peripheral logic is mostly fabricated under the NAND memory cell stacks, a technology Micron calls &#34;CMOS under Array&#34; (CuA). This has repeatedly helped Micron deliver some of the smallest die sizes, and Micron estimates their 176L 512Gbit die is about 30% smaller than the best their competitors currently offer.\n    The 176L NAND supports an interface speed of 1600MT/s, up from 1200MT/s for their 96L and 128L flash. Read and write (program) latency are both improved by over 35% compared to their 96L NAND, or by over 25% compared to their 128L NAND.\u00a0 Micron cites an overall mixed workload improvement of about 15% for compared to their UFS 3.1 modules using 96L NAND.\n  Micron&#39;s 176L 3D NAND has already started volume production and is shipping in some Crucial-branded consumer SSD products. However, Micron hasn&#39;t specified which specific Crucial products are now using 176L NAND (or their 128L NAND, for that matter), so we expect that this is a fairly low-volume release for now. Still, over the next year we should 176L NAND production ramp up to higher volumes than their 128L process ever reached, and we can expect a wide range of products based on this 176L NAND to be released and replace most of what&#39;s using their 96L NAND.\n  POST A COMMENT      Maybe we\u2019ll finally get those 2TB SDXC cards or even a 4TB SDUC card. 4TB would mark about ~13 years since the 4GB SDHC card first hit the market.  Reply\n  What are the practical limits on layer count? Curious how much further it is likely to go...  Reply\n  We&#39;re pretty close to the limits of what can be done with a single stack of layers. Almost everyone is now making 3D NAND as two stacks of layers (string stacking), eg. this one is 88+88. That means a lot of manufacturing steps that needed to be done once for early 3D NAND now need to be done twice, plus there&#39;s an interface between stacks that needs to be properly aligned and connected. Every roadmap for several hundred layers calls for doing more string stacking of several decks instead of just two. That allows per-die capacity and density to continue increasing, but the manufacturing costs don&#39;t scale as dramatically as they did going from eg. 32 through 96 layer nodes.
