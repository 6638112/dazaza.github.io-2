Early in the development of new technologies, the first category tends to get more attention, but it\u2019s the second that ends up having more impact on the world.\n Doing old things better tends to get more attention early on because it\u2019s easier to imagine what to build. Early films were shot like plays \u2014 they were effectively plays with a better distribution model \u2014 until filmmakers realized that movies had their own visual grammar. The early electrical grid delivered light better than gas and candles. It took decades before we got an electricity \u201capp store\u201d \u2014 a rich ecosystem of appliances that connected to the grid. The early web was mostly digital adaptations of pre-internet things like letter writing and mail-order commerce. It wasn\u2019t until the 2000s that entrepreneurs started exploring \u201cinternet native\u201d ideas like social networking, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, crowdsourced knowledge bases, and so on.\n The most common mistake people make when evaluating new technologies is to focus too much on the \u201cdoing old things better\u201d category. For example, when evaluating the potential of blockchains, people sometimes focus on things like cheaper and faster global payments, which are important and necessary but only the beginning. What\u2019s even more exciting are the new things you simply couldn\u2019t create before, like internet services that are  owned and operated by their users instead of by companies. Another example is business productivity apps architected as web services. Early products like Salesforce were easier to access and cheaper to maintain than their on-premise counterparts. Modern productivity apps like Google Docs, Figma, and Slack focus on things you simply couldn\u2019t do before, like real-time collaboration and deep integrations with other apps.\n Entrepreneurs who create products in the \u201cbrand new things\u201d category usually spend many years deeply immersed in the underlying technology before they have their key insights. The products they create often  start out looking toy-like,  strange, unserious, expensive, and sometimes even dangerous. Over time, the products steadily improve and the world gradually embraces them.\n It can take decades for this process to play out. It\u2019s clear that we are early in the development of emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies, machine learning, and virtual reality. It is also possible we are still early in the development of more established technologies like mobile devices, cloud hosting, social networks, and perhaps even the internet itself. If so, new categories of native products built on top of these technologies will continue to be invented in the coming years.\n Views expressed in \u201ccontent\u201d (including posts, podcasts, videos) linked on this website or posted in social media and other platforms (collectively, \u201ccontent distribution outlets\u201d) are my own and are not the views of AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

known for leaking the latest Apple products on YouTube or via his new website Front Page Tech - has published the allegations on  his website.\n  The article - which isn&#39;t actually penned by Prosser, but rather Corina Garcia - confronts Apple with the accusation of spying on its own employees in order to prevent these leaks. Which doesn&#39;t sit well with a company that positions itself as a defender of privacy.\n    According to the Front Page Tech article, some employees now have to wear cameras on their bodies &#34;to ensure that its hardware trade secrets stay out of the hands of leakers like our very own, Jon Prosser.&#34; It is said that this is a camera similar to the Axon Body 2, which is used by the US police.\n  The manufacturer describes the Axon Body 2 the ideal video solution for emergency services worldwide. It offers HD recording, advanced audio and easy upload to Evidence.com.\n  Front Page Tech indicates that Apple has only implemented this recording technology with some of its teams, and only in the past few weeks: &#34;To clarify, specific Apple teams only. Not all Apple employees are being made to wear the sophisticated tech&#34;.\n  Apple has recently targeted Apple leakers such as Kang and concept artist Concept Creator Jermaine. Read:  Apple threatens leakers with legal action.\n  The irony is that of all people the leaker to whom Apple no longer wanted to pass on information was the first to bring information of these drastic measures to the public.\n  So far, this accusation has not been confirmed by any other source, which is why quite a lot of questions remain unanswered. If the accusation is correct, can the employees who are allegedly forced to wear these cameras also switch them off if necessary? Like when they go to the toilet? Does such a camera actually prevent leaks? After all, employees could also spread the leaks simply from home.\n    Despite these extreme moves, you can understand Apple&#39;s actions: It must be extremely frustrating if the latest products and ideas come to the public long before the official presentation at an Apple event. It is not surprising that people like Prosser are not exactly among Apple&#39;s favourite people. Most recently, for example, thanks to Prosser, rendered images circulated showing the design of the AirTags and the new iMacs before they launched, making the impact of their launch smaller.\n  However, we would argue that people want to read about rumours and leaks and they do read this stuff. Reporting the rumours creates lots of chatter about a new product - and a lot of interest in the products launch. Without this interest in a new product running up to the launch it may not get the attention that it would get otherwise.\n  The only acceptable concern, we believe, is that these secrets could get to Apple&#39;s competitors who might copy new features. This reminds us of the Apple vs Samsung case, which began in 2011 and eventually saw a US court order Samsung to pay $539m (\u00a3403m) in damages to Apple for copying features of the original iPhone.\n    For more information about all the Apple leakers read  Who Is The Best Apple Leaker? and  Which Apple Leakers Is Worth Following.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:59:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,apple,\u4f69\u6234,employees,\u82f9\u679c", "title": "Apple\u4f7f\u5458\u5de5\u4f69\u6234\u8f66\u8eab\u76f8\u673a\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u6cc4\u6f0f ", "title_en": "Apple Makes Employees Wear Body Cameras to Control Leaks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple-employees-wear-cameras-3806157/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u76f8\u673a", "apple", "\u4f69\u6234", "employees", "\u82f9\u679c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "22c5234eea20fc4caa13187851de03ad.jpg", "infoid": 1068503, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u51b2\u51fb\u8005\u8ba1\u5212\u514d\u8d39\u8d60\u9001\u5982\u4f55\u514d\u8d39\u5236\u4f5c\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u7684\u6307\u793a\u3002 ", "note_en": "These biohackers plan to give away their instructions for how to make insulin for free.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:59:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u51b2\u51fb,aim,\u514d\u8d39", "title": "\u751f\u7269\u51b2\u51fb\u8005\u7784\u51c6\u5927\u578b\u5236\u836f\u7684\u8840\u7f18\u83cc\u7d20\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20 ", "title_en": "Biohackers take aim at big pharma\u2019s stranglehold on insulin", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.freethink.com/shows/just-might-work/how-to-make-insulin", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51b2\u51fb", "aim", "\u514d\u8d39"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1cdb23c6ae6f962ae669af6b1e38af29.jpg", "infoid": 1068502, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "r\u5e38\u5e38\u5f88\u6df1\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5b83\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u9ed1\u767d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u80a4\u8272\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5c11\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5b83\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u634d\u536b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\uff08\u6697\u6591\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\uff09\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ef4\u751f\u7d20D\uff08\u6d45\u8272\u76ae\u80a4\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u76ca\u4f5c\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8d8a\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u7956\u5148\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u8d64\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ae\u80a4\u82cd\u767d\u7684\u82cd\u767d\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u3002\n  \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u7956\u5148\uff0c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u5927\u9646\u624d\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u4eca\u5929\u5927\u591a\u6570\u975e\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u90fd\u6d3b\u7740\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u5927\u7ea660\u4e07\u5e74\u524d\u6beb\u65e0\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u95ef\u5165\u7684\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7956\u5148\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4ed6\u975e\u6d32\u7956\u5148\u7684\u9ed1\u76ae\u80a4\u3002\u975e\u6d32\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u957f\u5927\u7684\u5730\u65b9 - \u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u9057\u4f20\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n \u521a\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u6d32\u9057\u4f20\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u8fdf\u5230\u603b\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5230\u597d\u3002\u4e09\u767e\u4e07\u975e\u6d32\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\uff083\uff09\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u9646\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4e3a\u8be5\u5730\u65b9\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\uff0c\u5317\u7f8e\u548c\u4e9a\u6d32\u90e8\u4f4d\u505a\u4e9b\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u5373\u76ee\u5f55\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4f4f\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u8ff7\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9610\u660eH.

In most parts of the world it is literally a matter of black and white. A person\u2019s skin colour, however, has little biological significance. It is merely a balance between defending the lower layers of the dermis from cancer-causing ultraviolet light (which favours dark skin) and promoting the beneficial role of ultraviolet in the synthesis of vitamin D (which favours light skin). The farther someone\u2019s ancestors lived from the equator, the paler their skin evolved to be.\n  Go back far enough, though, and everyone\u2019s ancestors lived in Africa, the continent where  Homo sapiens originated. Most non-Africans alive today trace the bulk of their ancestry to Africans who burst forth on an unprepared world about 60,000 years ago. Indeed, the oldest representative of the species yet found in Britain retained the dark skin of his African forebears. Africa is where humanity grew up\u2014and where the bulk of human genetic diversity is found to this day.\n Only now is a serious effort beginning to explore Africa\u2019s genetic richness. Better late than never. The  Three Million African Genomes (3 ) project, a continent-wide endeavour, proposes to do for the place what has already been done for Europe, North America and parts of Asia\u2014namely to catalogue and analyse the genetic diversity of those who live there. That will be scientifically fascinating, for it will help elucidate how  H. sapiens evolved. But it will be medically important, too. It may even help erode that black-and-white excuse for racism.\n  Genetic diversity brings with it diversity of genetic disease. Cystic fibrosis\u2014in any case rarer in Africa than in Europe\u2014is often caused there by a different mutation from the one involved in the European version, and is thus missed by tests developed in the West. A mutation responsible in Ghana for 40% of inherited deafness is unknown in South Africa. And so on. It also brings a diversity of genetic response to disease. Some of the molecular details of the immune system, for example, vary with geography. Understanding that variation in Africa will improve understanding of immunity to infection, helping Africans and non-Africans alike.\n  More genetic information will also cast light on evolution. Early  H. sapiens migrants from Africa encountered other species of human being on their travels. These were descendants of previous migrations out of Africa of archaic members of the genus. At least two of these other types of human, the Neanderthals and the Denisovans, interbred with the newcomers, and some of their genes are still found in modern Asians and Europeans, doing various jobs including protecting them from disease. Preliminary analysis suggests that those who remained behind in Africa similarly interbred with yet another species of human\u2014but one of which no fossil record remains.\n There is an irony in all this. Xenophobia has probably existed for as long as people have. But racist attitudes were reinforced in the 19th century by an enthusiasm for physical anthropology and eugenics. The former attempted to classify human beings on the basis of visible characteristics, such as skin colour, head shape and facial features, that are genetically inherited. If this had been a neutral analysis, it would have been unexceptional. But often it was not neutral. It not only classified, but ranked. White-skinned Europeans put themselves at the top\u2014and black-skinned Africans at the bottom. Add eugenics to that mix and the result was toxic.\n The 3  project will not, alone, overthrow the legacy of these misadventures and the prejudices they reinforced. The thinking that gave rise to them is still too deeply ingrained in too many minds for it to do that by itself\u2014even, probably, for it to come close. But to those whose minds are open, a group of 21st-century African scientists revealing that the true, glorious genetic diversity of human beings lies in their own continent more abundantly than in any other will be a superb rebuttal to the doctrines of those misguided Victorian European gentlemen.  \u25a0\n This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline

how  Instant uses the ISO-8601 calendar. Listed the properties of some classes.\n  Date, JavaScript\u2019s current date time API is  infamously difficult to use.  The ECMAScript proposal \u201cTemporal\u201d is a new and better date time API and currently at stage 3. It was created by  Philipp Dunkel,  Maggie Johnson-Pint,  Matt Johnson-Pint,  Brian Terlson,  Shane Carr,  Ujjwal Sharma,  Philip Chimento,  Jason Williams, and  Justin Grant.\n   However, it is not an exhaustive documentation: For many details, you will have to consult  the (excellent) documentation for Temporal.\n       The Temporal date time API is accessible via the global variable  Temporal. It is a pleasure to use:\n All objects are immutable. Changing them produces new values, similarly to how strings work in JavaScript.\n  There are several specialized classes for Temporal values (date time values with time zones, date time values without time zones, date values without time zones, etc.). That has several benefits:\n  The post starts with background knowledge. That will help you with the remainder of the post, but you should be fine without it.\n Next, there is an overview of all the classes of the Temporal API and how they fit together.\n    Apparent solar time (local apparent time): One of the earliest ways of measuring time was to base the current time on the position of the sun. For example, noon is when the sun is directly overhead.\n Mean solar time (local mean time): This time representation corrects the variations of apparent solar time so that each day of the year has the same length.\n Standard time and time zones: Standard time specifies how the clocks within a geographical region are to be synchronized. It was established in the 19th century to support weather forecasting and train travel. In the 20th century, standard time was defined globally and geographical regions became  time zones.\n Wall-clock time is the current time within a time zone (as shown by a clock on the wall). Wall-clock time is also called  local time.\n  UTC, Z, and GMT are ways of specifying time that are similar, but subtly different:\n UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the time standard that all times zones are based on. They are specified relative to it. That is, no country or territory has UTC as its local time zone.\n Z (Zulu Time Zone) is a military time zone that is often used in aviation and the military as another name for UTC+0.\n GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is a time zone used in some European and African countries. It is UTC plus zero hours and therefore has the same time as UTC.\n    Temporal\u2019s time zones are based on  the IANA Time Zone Database (short: tz database). IANA stands for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. In that database, each time zone has an identifier and rules defining offsets for UTC times. If a time zone has standard time and daylight saving time, the offsets change during a year:\n const standardTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Europe/Zurich&#39;,  :  1995,  :  11,  :  30,  :  3,  :  24,});assert.equal( standardTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-11-30T03:24:00+01:00[Europe/Zurich]&#39;);  // (A) const daylightSavingTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Europe/Zurich&#39;,  :  1995,  :  5,  :  30,  :  3,  :  24,});assert.equal( daylightSavingTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-05-30T03:24:00+02:00[Europe/Zurich]&#39;);  // (B)\n In standard time, the time offset for the  Europe/Zurich time zone is +1:00 (line A). In daylight saving time, the time offset is +2:00 (line B).\n  \u201cTime Zone Database\u201d on the IANA website is a list of time zone names.\n \u201cList of tz database time zones\u201d on Wikipedia is another list of time zone names.\n \u201cTime Difference\u201d (\u201cZeitverschiebung\u201d) lists time zones for cities etc. \u2013 for example, the time zone for San Francisco is  America/Los_Angeles.\n  The calendars supported by Temporal are based on the standard  Unicode Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) \u2013 among  others:\n  iso8601 is used by most western countries and gets extra support in Temporal, via methods such as  Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO() (which returns the current date and wall-clock time in the system time zone and ISO-8601 calendar).\n  The standards ISO-8601 and RFC 3339 specify how to represent dates in strings. Currently, they are missing functionality that is needed and  added by Temporal:\n       The following code shows what a full date time string looks like. In practice, many of these parts will often be missing:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Africa/Nairobi&#39;,  :  2019,  :  11,  :  30,  :  8,  :  55,  :  0,  :  123,  :  456,  :  789,});assert.equal( zdt.toString({ :  &#39;always&#39;,  :  &#39;nanosecond&#39;}),  &#39;2019-11-30T08:55:00.123456789+03:00[Africa/Nairobi][u-ca=iso8601]&#39;);\n     This section gives an overview of the classes of the Temporal API. They can all be accessed via the global variable  Temporal ( Temporal.Instant,  Temporal.ZonedDateTime, etc.).\n    Wall-clock time (also called  local time or  clock time) varies globally, depending on the time zone of a clock.\n Epoch time is one way of representing exact time: It\u2019s a number counting time units (such as nanoseconds) before or since  Unix epoch (midnight UTC on January 1, 1970).\n   On one hand, we can create instances via the constructor. It accepts the minimal amount of data needed to fully specify the date time value. For example, in the case of the two classes for exact time,  Instant and  ZonedDateTime, the time itself is specified via epoch nanoseconds.\n const epochNanoseconds =  6046761644163000000n; const timeZone =  &#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;;  // San Francisco const zdt1 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime(epochNanoseconds, timeZone);assert.equal( zdt1.toString(),  &#39;2161-08-12T09:00:44.163-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);\n On the other hand, we can create instances via the static factory method  .from(). It is overloaded: Most classes support three kinds of values for its parameter.\n First, if the parameter is an instance of the same class, then that instance is cloned:\n   const zdt3 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;,  :  2161,  :  8,  :  12,  :  9,  :  0,  :  44,  :  163,  :  0,  :  0,});assert.equal( zdt3.toString(),  &#39;2161-08-12T09:00:44.163-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);\n   Note that we didn\u2019t need to specify the offset in line A, but it is shown in line B.\n    refIsoDay: reference ISO day, used for disambiguation when using calendars other than the ISO-8601 calendar\n refIsoYear: reference ISO year, used for disambiguation when using calendars other than the ISO-8601 calendar\n Instant uses UTC and an ISO-8601 calendar internally (e.g. for  .toString()), but they are not stored in instances.\n    The object  Temporal.now has several factory methods for creating Temporal values representing the current time:\n      We can use  Temporal.now to access the current time zone of the system. This time zone can change \u2013 for example, when the system travels:\n        Class  Instant represents global exact time. Its time standard is UTC. It is mostly a container for nanoseconds since epoch. That is also reflected by it not having properties such as  .year and  .hour (which  ZonedDateTime and  PlainDateTime have).\n For some operations (such as  .toString()),  Instant internally uses an ISO-8601 calendar, but that calendar is not stored in instances.\n            Time computations where daylight saving time may play a role (\u201cone hour later\u201d)\n // Current time in Melbourne, Australia (in ISO-8601 calendar) const zonedDateTime = Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO(  &#39;Australia/Melbourne&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179753181+10:00[Australia/Melbourne]&#39;);\n        If a class doesn\u2019t have a time zone, Temporal calls it \u201cplain\u201d. There are three timezone-less classes:  PlainDateTime,  PlainDate, and  PlainTime. They are abstract representations of time.\n  Time computations when the time zone doesn\u2019t matter (\u201cThe first Wednesday of May 1998\u201d).\n const zonedDateTime = Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO(  &#39;Asia/Novosibirsk&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179+07:00[Asia/Novosibirsk]&#39;); // Get the wall-clock time as a string const plainDateTime = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime()assert.equal( plainDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179&#39;);\n                // Bastille Day const bastilleDay = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({ :  7,  :  14});assert.equal( bastilleDay.toString(),  &#39;07-14&#39;); // Bastille Day in 1989 in Paris const zonedDateTime = bastilleDay .toPlainDate({ :  1989}) .toZonedDateTime( &#39;Europe/Paris&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1989-07-14T00:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]&#39;);\n   All Temporal classes that contain full dates use calendars to help them with various computations. Most code will use the ISO-8601 calendar, but other calendar systems are supported, too.\n  const pd1 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24,  &#39;iso8601&#39;); const pd2 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24, { :  &#39;iso8601&#39;}); const pd3 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24,  new Temporal.Calendar( &#39;iso8601&#39;));\n  Instances of  TimeZone represent time zones. They support IANA time zones, UTC, and UTC offsets. For most use cases, IANA time zones are the best choice because they enable proper handling of daylight saving time.\n  const zdt1 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n,  &#39;America/Lima&#39;); const zdt2 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n, { :  &#39;America/Lima&#39;}); const zdt3 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n,  new Temporal.TimeZone( &#39;America/Lima&#39;));\n  A duration represents a length of time \u2013 for example, 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n              However,  .toString() doesn\u2019t let you hide minutes in this case \u2013 you have to convert the  ZonedDateTime to a  PlainDate if that is what you want:\n   All Temporal date time values have a  .toJSON() method and can therefore be stringified to JSON:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Asia/Singapore]&#39;); // Stringifying a zoned date time directly:assert.equal(  JSON.stringify(zdt),  &#39;&#34;2019-12-01T12:00:00+08:00[Asia/Singapore]&#34;&#39;); // Stringifying a zoned date time inside an object: const obj = { : zdt};assert.equal(  JSON.stringify(obj),  &#39;{&#34;startTime&#34;:&#34;2019-12-01T12:00:00+08:00[Asia/Singapore]&#34;}&#39;);\n If you want to parse JSON with date time values, you need to set up  a JSON reviver.\n  Temporal\u2019s support for converting date time values to human readable strings is similar to   Intl.DateTimeFormat\u2019s:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Europe/Berlin]&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString(),  &#39;12/1/2019, 12:00:00 PM GMT+1&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString( &#39;de-DE&#39;),  &#39;1.12.2019, 12:00:00 MEZ&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString( &#39;en-GB&#39;, {  :  &#39;long&#39;,  :  &#39;numeric&#39;,  :  &#39;long&#39;,  :  &#39;numeric&#39;, }),  &#39;Sunday, 1 December 2019&#39;);\n       On the other hand, one of the fields exposed by  Instant provides us with the epoch time in milliseconds \u2013 which we can use to create a date:\n    Most date time classes support a rich set of fields such as  .dayOfWeek,  .month, and  .calendar. The notable exception is  Instant, whose time zone and calendar is fixed and whose setup and state is based on epoch time.\n In all other date time classes, we can use the static factory function  .from() to configure instances:\n const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Africa/Lagos&#39;,  :  1995,  :  12,  :  7,  :  3,  :  24,  :  30,  :  0,  :  3,  :  500,});assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30.0000035+01:00[Africa/Lagos]&#39;);\n   If we want to change the fields, we need to create a new value via  .with():\n    const dates = [ Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2022-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;), Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2001-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;), Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2009-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;),];dates.sort(Temporal.ZonedDateTime.compare);assert.deepEqual( dates.map(  d =&gt; d.toString()), [  &#39;2001-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;,  &#39;2009-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;,  &#39;2022-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;, ]);\n   const instant = Temporal.Instant.from( &#39;1970-01-01T00:00:01Z&#39;); const zonedDateTime = instant.toZonedDateTimeISO( &#39;Europe/Madrid&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01+01:00[Europe/Madrid]&#39;); const plainDateTime1 = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime();assert.equal( plainDateTime1.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01&#39;); const timeZone = Temporal.TimeZone.from( &#39;Europe/Madrid&#39;); const plainDateTime2 = timeZone.getPlainDateTimeFor(instant);assert.equal( plainDateTime2.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01&#39;);\n  const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Europe/Minsk]&#39;); const instant = zonedDateTime.toInstant();assert.equal( instant.toString(),  &#39;2019-12-01T09:00:00Z&#39;); const plainDateTime = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime();assert.equal( plainDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00:00&#39;);\n  const plainDateTime = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from(  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30&#39;); const zonedDateTime = plainDateTime.toZonedDateTime( &#39;Europe/Berlin&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30+01:00[Europe/Berlin]&#39;); const instant = zonedDateTime.toInstant();assert.equal( instant.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T02:24:30Z&#39;);\n     const departure = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2017-05-08T12:55[Europe/Berlin]&#39;);  // Munich const arrival = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2017-05-08T17:10[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);  // Seattle const flightTime = departure.until(arrival);assert.equal( flightTime.toString(),  &#39;PT13H15M&#39;);\n    To compute Labor Day (first Monday in September) for a given year, we need to figure out how many days to add to September 1 in order to get to weekday 1 (Monday).\n const mod =  ( a, b) =&gt; ((a % b) + b) % b;  function  ( year) {  const firstOfSeptember = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year,  :  9,  :  1, });  // How many days until Monday?  const MONDAY =  1;  const daysToAdd = mod(MONDAY - firstOfSeptember.dayOfWeek,  7);  return firstOfSeptember.add({ : daysToAdd});}assert.equal( getLaborDay( 2021).toString(),  &#39;2021-09-06&#39;);assert.equal( getLaborDay( 2022).toString(),  &#39;2022-09-05&#39;);\n   Although this proposal&#39;s API is not expected to change, implementers of this proposal MUST NOT ship unflagged Temporal implementations until IETF standardizes timezone/calendar string serialization formats. See  #1450 for updates.\n The proposal links to a polyfill.

", "note_en": "Recognizing that forest ecosystems, like societies, have elements of intelligence would help us leave behind the old notion that they are inert and predictable.\n   Suzanne Simard is a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia. Her latest book is \u201cFinding the Mother Tree\u201d (May 2021). Simard\u2019s life and work were the primary inspiration for a central character in Richard Powers\u2019s 2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u201cThe Overstory.\u201d\n MOUNT ASSINIBOINE, British Columbia \u2014\u00a0November. Snow blanketed the Rocky Mountains. I was on a solo backcountry ski trip, pausing in the pristine cordillera of the Healy Pass. Subalpine firs were bent over in casts of snow and ice, and the whitebark pines were spread-eagled like bouquets of bones, dead from mountain pine beetle and blister rust caused by the stress of climate change.\n I was three months pregnant. In our year apart while my husband Don wrote his dissertation, perhaps because of our loneliness, there came a wordless dawning of the truth that I was 36 and he was 39, and the time for children had come. Skiing into Assiniboine was my celebration of this gift.\n The beetles were on a rampage in the couloir. Four years earlier, in 1992, the outbreak had started northwest of here, in Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park; winter temperatures had increased by a few degrees and the coldest months stopped dropping below -30 Celsius, allowing the beetle larvae to thrive in the thick phloem of the aging pines.\n Lodgepole pine had coevolved with the beetles in this landscape, naturally succumbing, after about a century, to create space for the next generation. As the trees declined, fuel accumulated as a matter of course, and wildfires were ignited by lightning or people. Flames released pine seeds from resinous cones and stimulated aspens to sprout from thousand-year-old root systems, their moist leaves reducing the flammability of the young forest. As fire fingered through the landscape, it petered out in these aspen-clad glades, leaving a mosaic of different-aged forests that was itself resistant to future fires.\n But in the late 1800s, European settlers disrupted this balance by burning the forest montage to the ground in search of gold, creating a vast blanket of new pine stands whose uniformity was later enhanced by fire suppression and herbicide spraying that ensured the aspens wouldn\u2019t interfere with profits. As these pine trees turned 100 and the climate warmed, the beetle populations exploded, and the landscape ran red like blood flowing through water.\n The air rushed cleanly into my lungs as I glided among the dead whitebark pines, intoxicated to be following tracks and carving new turns around rockfalls and tree wells. Don was taking the afternoon to build a cradle. Contentment had enveloped us both. But in the heart of the saddle between peaks, I stopped to check some tracks in the fresh snow and felt a familiar rush of fear. The paw prints were as large as saucers, claw marks an inch deep.\n  I skied away, across the pass. Soon, though, I was lost. When I circled back to the center, I shuddered to be back to my original tracks, already frozen in the drifting snow. And covered with fresh prints.\n  I instinctively kept skiing down the pass. Naked alpine larch, clustered in bowls below the peaks, their golden needles already fallen, were behind me. Down here, the subalpine firs were knotted together in small groves, their numbers increasing as I descended. Telemarking with 30 pounds on my back strained my legs. My baby, no bigger than an ounce of gold, didn\u2019t throw off my balance. I cinched up the hip buckle to stabilize myself on the icy, broken terrain and turned slowly, one link at a time.\n I made a large traverse to the east to evade a ravine, avoiding a steep section before heading back. It was hard to see because the trees were tightly spaced. Younger lodgepole pines. There must have been a fire a few decades back. Soon I was off course again and checked my compass. If I didn\u2019t stay oriented and get back to the main route, this could get dire.\n My fear built on some background frustration about my research. I had growing evidence that forests have intelligence \u2014 that they are perceptive and communicative \u2014 but I didn\u2019t feel ready to take on the establishment. The fellows would ignore me or, worse, laugh at my talk of the sentience of plants.\n No, I was pregnant and needed to stay quiet to protect my child, the most precious thing in my life. A recent CBC radio interview had drawn some interest from local naturalists and environmentalists and even a few like-minded foresters, but it was met with silence from the provincial capital. Without even so much as an email from the policy guys, I wondered whether giving interviews was worth it. Or talks at conferences, for that matter. I couldn\u2019t go public more than I already had; there was too much at stake now.\n I skied back about 300 feet and found old tracks from earlier skiers. The wolf prints crossed them three times. It looked like at least five animals.\n I skied farther. The lodgepole pine trees grew sparser, and their puffy crowns reached closer to the ground. There should be a special word for the type of mourning you know is to come. In a decade, almost 45 million acres of mature pine forest would be dead, representing about a third of the forested area of British Columbia. The beetles would continue to chew their way through whitebark, western white and ponderosa pines, through the U.S. from Oregon to Yellowstone, and would start infesting the jack-pine hybrids across the boreal forest of Canada, producing a total epidemic across North America in an area roughly the size of California. It would surpass any insect outbreak in recorded history and provide fuel for devastating wildfires down the road.\n I passed a grove of bare aspens. The prints were melting in steaming urine. Dark orange-yellow. I kept to the main route out of the narrow valley, adrenaline making my pack lighter. The wolves stayed in front, just out of sight, leaving only traces.\n Their tracks headed straight for the main northbound trail, and I suddenly calmed. The wolves were not pursuing me; they were leading me out of the valley. As the vista widened, my trail converged with one from the south. I turned onto it, while the wolf tracks veered abruptly north. A gust of wind blew over them as they disappeared into the trees.\n  I lit a candle in the snow for my brother and for his spirit in those wolves. The lodgepole pines were tall and strong, and their lofty crowns shadowed me while they steadfastly watched over some sub-alpine firs. I needed to linger here where canyon rock and crystallized tree crowns and packs of wolves had come together. The sun climbed over the granite peaks, and I tilted my face toward it. I pulled out a sandwich, ready to stay forever. I felt welcomed, whole. Pure and clean and untroubled.\n As I ate, I wondered why trees \u2014 these aspens and pines \u2014 would support a mycorrhizal fungus that provides carbon (or nitrogen) to a neighboring tree. Sharing with individuals of its own species, especially its own genetic family, seemed like an obvious benefit. Trees disperse most of their seeds \u2014 by gravity or wind or the odd bird or squirrel \u2014 in their small local area, meaning that many individuals in an immediate neighborhood are related.\n The pines clustered at the edge of this meadow were probably relatives of the same family, their genes diversified by pollen drifting in from distant fathers. These parent trees shared some of the genes of the trees around them, and passing along carbon to each other to increase the survival of their seedlings, their own offspring, would help ensure those genes got passed to future generations. A later study would show that the roots of at least half the pines in a stand are grafted together, and the larger trees subsidize the smaller ones with carbon. Blood runs thicker than water. This makes perfect sense from an individual-selection perspective. It\u2019s Darwinian.\n But my work was showing that some carbon also moved to unrelated individuals, ones of an entirely different species. From birch to fir and back again. I looked at the white aspen, its bark basking in the sun, and wondered if it shuffled carbon to the firs under its crown. The other way around too: firs to aspens.\n Mycorrhizal fungi are generalists \u2014 they colonize plant root tissue, sometimes even intracellularly. They might invest in many tree species to hedge their bets for survival, and the off chance that some carbon would move to a stranger was simply part of the cost of moving it to relatives.\n But this was not what my trees were showing. They were offering me evidence that the pattern of carbon movement was not just by chance, an unfortunate consequence of the moveable feast. No, my trees were demonstrating that they had a lot of skin in the game. Over and over, the experiments showed that carbon moved from a source tree to a sink tree \u2014 from a rich to a poor one \u2014 and that the trees had some control over where and how much carbon moved.\n \u201cWhy would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals?\u201d\n A squirrel chattered in the branch of a knotty juniper, waiting for me to toss it scraps of my sandwich. It kept an eye on the Clark\u2019s nutcracker at the top of a pine, probably with a whitebark pine seed in its beak. A raven \u2014 a species that also coveted those energy-rich seeds \u2014 gurgled a song.\n Whitebark pine depends on all these species and more, including grizzly bears, to scatter its heavy seeds. Why would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals, whose interest in the seeds was only as food? A few seeds needed to be left to germinate and grow into offspring to ensure the successful reproduction of the elders; why trust that enough would remain? If one of these seed dispersers disappeared, perhaps in a fire or during a particularly harsh winter, then others might deliver the goods. In the same vein, why would a tree pass carbon to a generalist networking fungus \u2014 a Suillus or Cortinarius \u2014 that could then pass the carbon to an unrelated tree? From the pine to the understory subalpine fir?\n I threw my crust toward the squirrel, and the raven and nutcracker swooped to jockey for the prize. Tail twitching, the squirrel launched off its stump. Just as the old whitebark pines were glad to feed their seeds to birds and squirrels, depending on more than one for dispersal, there must be a similar evolutionary advantage to a tree hosting many mycorrhizal fungal species making up the linking network, letting it benefit from a diverse suite as insurance in case one element got lost.\n Maybe even more important was the fungi\u2019s ability to reproduce rapidly. Their short life cycle would enable them to adapt to the rapidly changing environment \u2014 fire and wind and climate \u2014 much faster than the steadfast, long-lived trees could manage. The oldest Rocky Mountain juniper is about 1,500 years old and the oldest whitebark pine around 1,300, in Utah and Idaho, respectively. Meanwhile, the trees here would take decades to produce their first cones and seeds and then do so only sporadically thereafter, but their fungal network could spawn mushrooms and spores each time it rained, potentially enabling its genes to recombine several times a year.\n Maybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty. Instead of waiting for the next generation of trees to reproduce with more adaptive ways of coping with the soils warming and drying as the climate changes, the mycorrhizal fungi with which the trees are in symbiosis could evolve much faster to acquire increasingly tightly bound resources. Perhaps the Suillus and Boletus and Cortinarius fungi could respond more immediately to the warming winters that had spawned the mountain pine beetle outbreak and help the trees still gather nutrients and water to maintain a level of resistance.\n \u201cMaybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty.\u201d\n The raven won the battle for my sandwich crust and spiraled past the Clark\u2019s nutcracker in a cloud of feathers and squawks. Not only was the squirrel too slow, it had no hope of wresting anything from the beak of a bird. It would have to unearth whitebark seeds instead, after the birds buried them. Or it could feast on a mushroom left drying in the branches of a pine. It wouldn\u2019t live long with neighbors like the raven and nutcracker if it had to rely only on whitebark pine seeds they\u2019d overlooked. Likewise, the fungus could hedge its bets, hitching its spores on legs or feathers, or catching an updraft to colonize new hosts.\n If the fungus acquires more carbon from one tree than it needs for its own growth and survival, then it could supply the excess to the other networked trees in need and, in so doing, diversify its carbon portfolio \u2014 insurance in acquiring essential resources. The fungus could shuttle carbon produced by a rich aspen to a poor pine in the middle of the summer to ensure it had two different healthy hosts \u2014 sources of photosynthetic carbon \u2014 in case there was a calamity and one died. Like investing in stocks along with bonds in case the market crashed.\n The fungus might not care what species the hosts were, as long as at least one of its carbon sources remained viable. Investing in diverse plant communities is a lower-risk strategy than investing in just one species. The more stressful the environment, the more successful those fungi are at associating with multiple tree species.\n \u201cMaybe birch and fir are in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma where the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives.\u201d\n  Though my puzzling elated me, something still didn\u2019t quite fit together. As I shouldered my pack and turned to the fork that led south along Bryant Creek, I thought about the greater group of interacting species: the whole community of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. Individual selection might explain how the fluorescent Pseudomonads interacted with the mycorrhizal fungi of birch to reduce Armillaria root disease in Douglas fir. Could selection also operate at the group level?\n Do cooperative guilds of species \u2014 like guilds of people in societies \u2014 exist? Where multiple tree species are linked by a network for mutual aid, in the way it takes a village to raise a child, despite a risk that there might be cheaters in such guilds? This sharing would work if our behavior was ruled by steadfast tit for tat, like the two-way transfer between birch and fir and their principle of reciprocity, changing the direction of net transfer over the course of the summer. Quid pro quo.\n But what about longer-term shifts in trade? Such as when firs eventually grow taller than birches. Would the quid pro quo rule of engagement change, and how might this compare to our human lives when they become more complex and our relationships transform with age? If someone helps me with childcare, how do I repay her if she moves far away? I wondered why two tree species would continue to trade carbon over the long term, given the uncertainty of the future.\n Maybe birch and fir, and Armillaria ostoyae fungus and fluorescent Pseudomonads, are in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma where, in the long run, the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives. Studies show time and again that cooperation is commonly chosen in groups, even when betrayal of others could lead to a better individual reward. Fir can\u2019t survive without birch due to a high risk of infection from Armillaria , and birch can\u2019t survive in the long run without fir because too much nitrogen would accumulate in the soil, causing the soil to acidify and birch to decline.\n \u201cEcosystems are similar to human societies \u2014 they\u2019re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system.\u201d\n In this scenario, the little fluorescent Pseudomonad bacteria serve two functions: They produce compounds that inhibit the spread of Armillaria root disease among the trees, ensuring there is still a source of carbon energy for the community, and they transform nitrogen using the carbon exuded by the mycorrhizal network. Was this still in line with selection at the individual species level, or was it at the level of the group?\n Distracted, I practically skied straight into a couple of biologists tracking the radio-collared wolves that had been guiding me earlier. They knew the pack well; the leader was an old mother wolf.\n I asked why they were tracking the wolves. As the shadows of the peaks grew longer, the lead tracker, a lean, windburned woman with a dark ponytail, told me about the pressure to cull wolves in the park to alleviate the decline of caribou. She pushed her sunglasses back on her head as she spoke, radiating a fierce intelligence.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the clear-cutting,\u201d I responded, meeting her gaze. The sprouting willows and alders were attractive browse for moose, so their populations were increasing and attracting wolves. The problem was that the wolves also hunted mountain caribou, which were in precipitous decline due to habitat loss and interactions with people.\n She nodded in agreement as she shifted on her skis and checked that her avalanche beacon was on.\n \u201cYes, the snow gets so deep in the clear-cuts, the caribou can\u2019t outrun the wolves,\u201d she said, looking toward the trail where the mother wolf had gone. And there were more and more clear-cuts as the beetle-killed pines were being salvaged.\n \u201cGotta go or we\u2019ll lose them,\u201d her assistant said, squinting at a tracking device and tightening the chest strap on his pack. The researcher\u2019s eyes narrowed toward the pass ahead.\n \u201cWe can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony.\u201d\n \u201cSee ya,\u201d she said, and I said goodbye too, appreciating her unwavering pursuit. They evaporated into the pines as seamlessly as they had appeared, reminding me that a person could easily disappear out here without a trace. It was past noon. I had to keep moving or I\u2019d be skiing the last miles in the dark.\n The trail along Bryant Creek was fast and gently downhill, and as I raced past swaying pines, the sun at my back and the avalanche tracks falling behind me, I was grateful the wolf biologists had packed down the trail with their skis. I reached my car as the sky\u2019s pink and purple stripes faded to black across the tilted sheets of sedimentary crust.\n Ecosystems are similar to human societies \u2014 they\u2019re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system. And since our world\u2019s systems are composed of individual organisms, they have the capacity to change. We creatures adapt, our genes evolve, we can learn from experience. A system is ever-changing because its parts \u2014 the trees and fungi and people \u2014 are constantly responding to one another and to the environment. Our success in coevolution \u2014 our success as a productive society \u2014 is only as good as the strength of the bonds with other individuals and species. Out of the resulting adaptation and evolution emerge behaviors that help us survive, grow and thrive.\n We can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony. Or how our brains, composed of neurons, axons and neurotransmitters, produce thought and compassion. Or the way brothers and sisters join to overcome a trauma like illness or death \u2014 the whole greater than the sum of the parts.\n The cohesion of biodiversity in a forest, the musicians in an orchestra, the members of a family growing through conversation and feedback, through memories and learning from the past, even \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:57:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u68ee\u6797,intelligent,\u6811\u6728", "title": "\u806a\u660e\u7684\u68ee\u6797 ", "title_en": "The Intelligent Forest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.noemamag.com/the-intelligent-forest", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u68ee\u6797", "\u6811\u6728"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068498, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7528miki\u5efa\u7acb\u79c1\u4eba\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002 \u6258\u7ba1\u60a8\u81ea\u5df1\u6216\u4f7f\u7528Mimix\u4e91\u6258\u7ba1\u670d\u52a1\u3002 \u50cf\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u4e00\u6837\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002 ", "note_en": "Build a private wiki with Miki.

Here\u2019s the thinking.\n Context \u00b7 But first: This is part of this blog\u2019s  Investing theme, whose  Intro makes it clear that I have no investment expertise and nobody should take this as investment advice, because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just a bloggy disclosure of some of my own financial positions, which I owe readers anyhow.\n  While I\u2019m an admirer of the technology, I\u2019ve repeatedly criticized Bitcoin specifically and blockchain in general, on the grounds that I\u2019ve seen no practical real-world applications.\n   Beliefs \u00b7 I believe the following things about Bitcoin. This is not a scholarly article so I\u2019m not going to provide references, but I\u2019ve seen enough evidence that I\u2019m willing to bet my own money based on them.\n A high proportion of all Bitcoins are owned by insiders; miners and people close to the exchanges. Their cost basis is much lower than the current Bitcoin price, and that cost is in practice sunk.\n Bitcoin is not usable as a currency because the transaction costs and latency are both too high. (Yes, I know about the Lightning network.)\n A high proportion of Bitcoin trading is intermediated by Tethers (USDT). There are strong reasons to suspect that Tethers are a highly unstable stablecoin. The facts about whatever backs them up are mostly unknown. In practice they\u2019re quite difficult to convert to real money. There are repeated allegations that Tethers are created out of thin air to prop up the price of Bitcoin.\n The Bitcoin market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s easy to believe that much of the trading is seriously sketchy, whether that\u2019s based on ad-hoc Tether creation, wash trading, or other well-known pump/dump schemes. These practices have run rampant on every financial market in human history that hasn\u2019t regulated against them fiercely. Why should Bitcoin be any different?\n The net effect is that money flows in from, in effect, suckers and rubes, then into the pockets of the insiders. A bit goes back out to non-insiders but, as I know personally, converting Bitcoin into cash is a high-latency high-friction operation. Converting Tether to cash? Good luck with that.\n Bitcoin\u2019s Byzantine-generals solution, based on proof-of-waste, is unacceptable in the face of the oncoming climate crisis.\n To the extent that Bitcoin has an ideology, it\u2019s some sort of mutant greedhead libertarian claptrap. Most people on the scene can\u2019t spell \u201cideology\u201d and are there to make a quick speculative buck. Since Bitcoin has no practical uses, the buyer is a fool who is counting on eventually finding a greater fool.\n My best guess is that pretty soon the supply of greater fools runs out. At that point the insiders holding the bulk of Bitcoins will rationally be willing to unload for dramatically lower prices, which probably leads to a dramatic deflation. This could be provoked by a Tether collapse, or legal action from any one of a number of governments, or the public exposure of egregious insider sleaze. Or some surprise of the kind that history is full of, the kind that nobody was expecting.\n When will it happen? I dunno. I\u2019ll be astonished if we get through 2021 without an explosion.\n How to short Bitcoin? \u00b7 The classic short would be to borrow Bitcoins and sell them, in the expectation of being able to buy them back for much less when the time comes to return them. But I\u2019ve sold Bitcoin and I didn\u2019t like the experience. Also, if I\u2019m wrong, the downside is unlimited, which violates our  #BeCareful investing principle. So no.\n Some of the crypto exchanges offer options, including puts. But I personally have little to no faith in the integrity or durability of these organizations. Should Bitcoin take the kind of dive I expect, the chances of getting your Put exercised would be about zilch. So, no.\n  In Canada, there\u2019s the  Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.B on TSX), which actually trades on the mainstream market. Which I take to mean that a put option should exercise fine even during a meltdown because whoever wrote it would have had to establish their ability to cover margin. Nothing fancy about it, as I write this its assets are 21597.3588 Btc.\n Then there\u2019s this company called MicroStrategy ($MSTR) which has been around since 1989 and sells business-intelligence and analytics software. I have no idea if the software is any good.\n They became infamous in March 2000 upon revealing \u201caccounting problems\u201d. The share price collapsed, marking the start of the dot-com crash. The US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission sued their asses for fraud and eventually the company settled, paying big fines without admitting any guilt.\n 21 years later, the company still has the same CEO, Michael Saylor. His Twitter avatar now has Bitcoin-y laser eyeballs, as you can see in  the tweet below.\n  Between August 2020 and June 2021, MicroStrategy bought a lot of Bitcoin. There\u2019s a prominent Bitcoin-labeled pointer on the front page at microstrategy.com which leads to  hope.com \u2009\u2014\u2009Bitcoin is Hope. It\u2019s absurd.\n Recall the words \u201crube\u201d and \u201csucker\u201d that I used above? I think Micro\u00adStrategy is one of those, corporately. Maybe their share price can survive the Bitcoin bet going south? But I doubt it. So I bought puts.\n Finally, Coinbase. I see no reason to think they\u2019re dishonest or stupid, and I know people who\u2019ve used them for Bitcoin trading and came away happy. If you believe in the long-term existence of a lively Bitcoin marketplace, they\u2019re probably a good investment. But I don\u2019t. So, I picked up puts.\n Looking forward \u00b7 Puts are pretty cheap. If I\u2019m totally wrong and Bitcoin is still sailing along at the end of 2021, I\u2019ll be annoyed but not impoverished. If it crashes I\u2019ll be sad for the unfortunates who lost their stakes, and entirely unsympathetic to the insider community.\n       As a recent btc buyer I&#39;m one of the suckers but I didn&#39;t realise everything you say is true until too late. Hoping the value stays up until I can offload on another sucker! Good luck with the put.\n If you don&#39;t follow David Rosenthal&#39;s blog, you should do. (Another ex-Sun DE.) His analysis of cryptocurrency in a series of posts over the last couple of years has been devastating.  https://blog.dshr.org/\n Reasonable reasons. But, why this year?

After 90\u00a0years in a micro-pocket of midtown bordered by Times Square and Bryant Park,  The New Yorker was heading to new quarters, at the southern tip of Manhattan.\n My colleague Pamela Maffei McCarthy greeted me at her door and, with a sly smile, pressed on me four fat folders. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to look at these,\u201d she said.\n As deputy editor, Pam may have accumulated more files than anyone else in our offices, so I suspected that she was attempting a wily offloading maneuver, sticking me with a papery hillock of old expense reports. No backsies! But, after I took the files to my desk and started to sort through the delicate onionskin pages, I realized that this was treasure\u2014 hundreds of editing memos written by Harold Ross, who founded  The New Yorker, in 1925, and ran it for a generation. The memos were dated 1950 and 1951, his last two years alive.\n  Ross was suffering from lung cancer and other painful maladies in those final years, but his eccentric, unstoppable obsessiveness, his unembarrassed habit of questioning every matter of grammar, usage, and fact, no matter how niggling, seemed undiminished. Encountering \u201cBird of Passage,\u201d a short story by a pup writer named Roger Angell, Ross riddled the query pages with numbered points of contention, a spray of editorial buckshot. A few pellets:\n  Do people say  executive, i.e., use it in conversation. It\u2019s pretty much of a writer\u2019s word.\n It is my recollection that most hotels have uncarpeted marble or floors that look like marble.\n Reading John Cheever\u2019s short story \u201cClancy in the Tower of Babel,\u201d Ross responds, \u201cOne technical point in this piece bothers me. Cheever has Clancy, his elevator man Clancy, around the building early in the morning and late of the evening. . . \u00a0I think under union rules, which govern these things, elevator men gain the day shift by seniority.\u201d He senses that a reporting piece from Berlin by Joseph Wechsberg is overly sympathetic: \u201cI still think it is too soon for us to go pro-German.\u201d\n  And, as he considers an essay by Lionel Trilling, you can practically hear the sigh of a man who set out to create a \u201ccomic weekly\u201d surrendering to the demands of a graver sensibility: \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no other way of doing this, but it always bothers me when a reviewer writes as if he\u2019s talking the book over with someone who has already read it, and knows what\u2019s on p. 236.\u201d\n  In those days, Ross had to spend many days in the hospital. He was quick to disappointment and exasperation, and yet he had a successor in mind, an editor as seemingly recessive in manner as he had been aggressive and incandescent. William Shawn, a shy newspaperman from Chicago, worked in the early 1930s\u00a0for Ross as an \u201cidea man.\u201d Ben Yagoda writes in  About Town, an excellent history of the magazine, that on Shawn\u2019s first two days on the job he conceived ideas for ten Talk pieces, including the \u201cJac Mac Famous School of Acrobatics\u201d; pigeon farms on Manhattan rooftops; a rat exterminator on Riker\u2019s Island; and George Selkirk, the talented, if not quite immortal, outfielder whose destiny it was to replace Babe Ruth in right for the Yankees. Shawn made his mark as an editor by directing the magazine\u2019s coverage of the Second World War. Ross came to think of him as indispensable. As he wrote to Kay Boyle, in 1949, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything with Shawn away, for the future is in his head.\u201d When Ross died in December 1951, Raoul Fleischmann, the magazine\u2019s owner, appointed Shawn. He remained in the job for the next 35\u00a0years.\n In his attention to detail and his urge to clarity, Shawn resembled\u00a0Ross. Yagoda relates how Shawn sent a memo to Matthew Josephson telling him that his profile of William Knudsen, a leader of the automobile industry, was \u201ca stunning piece of historical reporting.\u201d Then he wrote that he was appending \u201ca few questions.\u201d There were 178.\n But Shawn, who took over the magazine in January 1952, was a distinctly different personality. Shawn assumed for himself far more authority than Ross, who was prepared to delegate a greater amount to his various deputies, or \u201cJesuses.\u201d Shawn was also quiet, subtle, secretive, elliptical, and, to some, quite strange. He was a variety of genius who enjoyed funny writing as well as serious fiction, supported completely the individual artists and writers on a profoundly variegated staff, and expressed his myriad curiosities about the world by sending writers out to explore its many corners. J.D. Salinger called him \u201cthe most unreasonably modest of born great artist-editors.\u201d Beneath the modesty, however, was a steely tactical will. Harold Brodkey suggested that Shawn combined the qualities of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and Saint Francis of Assisi.\n   Shawn was also working in radically different circumstances than Ross. In the early years of the magazine, Ross was often at odds with ownership and battling over questions of principle and money. As with most fledgling editorial enterprises, the central concern was existence itself. Would the thing survive?  The New Yorker almost closed its doors more than once. I have on my wall a rueful letter from Fleischmann informing a business-side colleague that he was shutting the magazine down. It is dated May 1925\u2014three months after the debut issue. There were many such moments of despair and rescue. But the magazine found its financial footing, and, by the early 1950s, it was in happy synch with the postwar consumer boom. Educated middle- and upper-middle-class readers seemed to want what  The New Yorker was providing, and advertisers identified the magazine as uniquely suited to reaching those freespending readers.\n With that kind of security, and with so many editorial columns to fill, Shawn could think expansively about the magazine. He could build on\u00a0the deepening ambitions of the 40s\u00a0with the plump resources of the 50s. If he wanted reporting from the newly independent country of Ghana, the big East-West summit in Geneva, or the Bandung Conference, in Indonesia, he did not consult the ledger books; he sent a writer. In fact, the sheer proliferation of advertising demanded that Shawn scramble in search of more and more editorial matter. This, he found, had an inevitable drag on quality. There is, in this world, after all, only\u00a0so much talent at a given time\u2014only so much good writing. At a certain point, he found it necessary to limit the pages in a weekly issue to 248\u2014as fat as a phone book in some towns. In his tenure as editor, Shawn made innumerable hires, tried out countless freelancers, and ran long, multipart series\u2014some forgettable, some central to the literary and journalistic history of mid-century America. His relationship to advertising was distinguished mainly by the ads he found too distasteful to accept. A manufacturer of bathroom fixtures once told me that his ads for bathtubs and sinks had been rejected, because, as Shawn told him, \u201cThey are in the bathroom, which means they are next to the, well, you know . . .\u201d\n Decorum was important to Shawn, even though the world was changing. Rachel MacKenzie, a fiction editor, rejected Philip Roth\u2019s 40,000-word novella \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d less because of its length\u2014the magazine had just run J. D. Salinger\u2019s 50,000-word \u201cZooey\u201d\u2014but, rather, because, as MacKenzie wrote, \u201ctaste would rule out here much of what is essential to the narrative.\u201d The magazine accepted Roth\u2019s \u201cDefender of the Faith\u201d but not his more frenetic story \u201cEli, the Fanatic.\u201d \u201cWe all agree that there are remarkable things in the story,\u201d MacKenzie wrote to Roth\u2019s agent, \u201cbut we feel that it keeps sliding off into caricature and farce and that in the end it falls between realism and didactic modern fable, the emotional thread breaking and the lesson taking over.\u201d\n  Shawn was also wary of the Beats, perhaps the most lasting school of literary outrage in the 50s. When the fiction editor Katharine White rejected the author of  On the Road, she wrote, \u201cWe read with a great deal of interest John Kerouac\u2019s \u2018Go, Go, Go,\u2019 and it makes us hope that he will have other short stories to send us. . . \u00a0We hope that Mr. Kerouac will try something for us that is not about this particular group of wild kids.\u201d Similarly, the magazine, which was alive to the work of young poets like James Merrill, Adrienne Rich, and Sylvia Plath, was not a home for \u201cHowl\u201d or \u201cKaddish.\u201d Jane Kramer would write a marvelous multipart profile of Allen Ginsberg, but not until the late 60s.\n  Critics like Seymour Krim worried that  The New Yorker, which had exhibited so much bite in its first few decades, was now getting complacent and reserved in middle age. But no magazine can be a completist omnibus of the cultural or political moment, and this one never aspired to be one. History will inevitably find it wanting in some way or another. A reader looking in the 50s\u00a0archives for a profile of Chuck Berry will be disappointed. The coverage of jazz did not prove worthy of the form\u00a0until Shawn gave Whitney Balliett a jazz column, in 1957, by which time rock and roll was under way. Shawn\u2019s magazine was much more in the groove of its time with other arts, as some of the pieces here make thrillingly evident: Lillian Ross\u2019s irresistible Hemingway profile, Winthrop Sargeant\u2019s profiles of Richard Avedon and Marianne Moore, Berton Rouech\u00e9\u2019s piece on Jackson Pollock, Truman Capote\u2019s barbed portrait of a youngish Marlon Brando, Thomas Whiteside\u2019s profile of Pat Weaver, the executive-maestro of NBC.\n One of the lasting triumphs of cultural reporting for the magazine in the 50s\u00a0was Lillian Ross\u2019s five-part series about John Huston, Hollywood, and the making of a mediocre adaptation of Stephen Crane\u2019s  The Red Badge of Courage. Ross had joined the magazine during the war, one of a small number of women who found a place there when so many men were in the service. Having obtained unfettered access to Huston, the cast, the set, and the relevant executives, Ross painted a dramatic, detailed, and wicked portrait of all the ambitions and compromises that go into even a failed and ephemeral production. Ross\u2019s prose is direct, and unembellished, but the simplicity is deceptive. The influence of the work was significant. Norman Mailer, when discussing  The Executioner\u2019s Song, credited Ross as a pioneer in nonfiction.\n  Political and foreign reporting had become a great deal more serious during the Second World War, and there was no going back to the wide-eyed, we-are-confused-little-men fripperies of the bygone world. Reading the best of it here, you get an uncanny sense of writers coming to grips with issues and maps that are with us today. A.J. Liebling in Gaza and Janet Flanner in Algeria confront the emerging Middle East; Joseph Wechsberg in Berlin and Emily Hahn in China draw the fault lines of the Cold War. Bernard Taper\u2019s travels with Thurgood Marshall, in his days with the NAACP, is an early look at the civil-rights movement. And Richard Rovere, a Communist who, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, had become an anti-Communist liberal, covered Washington as an outsider living in Rhinebeck, New York. His running portrayal of the malign phenomenon of Joseph McCarthy was some of the most impressive political coverage that the magazine had yet produced.\n Harold Ross liked to pose as anti-intellectual\u2014he famously declared himself unsure whether Moby Dick was \u201cthe man or the whale.\u201d Shawn was without any such ambivalence toward intellectual ambition. One of the first writers he hired was Dwight Macdonald, who had been an editor at  Partisan Review. Macdonald was capable of both outrageously witty criticism\u2014as when he dissects Mortimer Adler\u2019s Great Books set\u2014and vivid, sympathetic political reporting, as with his profile of the Catholic social activist Dorothy Day.\n  The postwar 50s\u00a0had a certain technological utopianism about them\u2014not unlike our current era\u2014and the magazine was notably alive to this. Shawn was wary of modern gadgetry (he would not ride in an elevator without an attendant), but that did not quash his curiosity. There are pieces here on the whizbangery of push-button phones, video-tape, home freezers, the \u201cperceptron simulator,\u201d data processing, and, with real depth, the dawning of the Computer Age.\n  Finally, Shawn had a sharp eye for that essential component of any institution that wishes to develop: new talent with new things to say. The 50s\u00a0saw the rise of one such talent in particular, John Updike, who, for the next\u00a055\u00a0years, was an unfailingly prolific and versatile contributor to  The New Yorker. His fine-grained prose was there from the start, and, with time, his sharp-eyed intelligence alighted on seemingly every surface, subject, and subtext. Updike was, out of the box, an American writer of the first rank. He was profoundly at home at  The New Yorker and, at the same time, able to expand the boundaries of its readers\u2019 tastes. He could seem tweedy and suburban\u2014a modern, golf-playing squire\u2014and yet, as a critic, he introduced to the magazine\u2019s readers an array of modernists and postmodernists, along with writing from countries far beyond the Anglo-American boundaries; as a writer of fiction, he was not a revolutionary, but his short stories make up a vast social, political, and erotic history of postwar America, or at least some precincts of it.\n One of the more persistent myths of the magazine came up in those Ross-era files\u2014the putative tyranny of its stylistic prejudices. Roald Dahl, whose story \u201cTaste\u201d is published here, wrote to one of Ross\u2019s editors that he was in a \u201chowling fury\u201d because of the outrageous and peremptory changes reflected in a set of proofs that had just arrived in the mail. \u201cYou have sprinkled commas about all over the pages as though you were putting raisins in a plum-pudding,\u201d Dahl wrote. \u201cI know what commas I want. I know what phrases I wish to use. It is my story. I wrote it.\u201d And yet, as any reader will see, even in the 50s, before the arrival of experimentalists like Donald Barthelme and Max Frisch, writers in possession of a real voice did not lose it, despite the magazine\u2019s at times persnickety ministrations. Nabokov, Welty, Flanner, Ross, Liebling,\u00a0Mitchell, Capote, Thurber, Updike\u2014they are utterly themselves, their preferences and hesitations as distinct as can be.\n Now we\u2019ve moved downtown to the end of Manhattan island and into the tallest skyscraper in the city. From our floor, there is an astonishing view of the harbor that used to be Joe Mitchell\u2019s beat. At a certain point, certainly by the 50s, Joe told editors and friends that the city was changing\u2014changing so profoundly that he no longer saw it as his own and, gradually, he wrote more about the past, about his interior New York, about the memories that carved through the present like initials gouged in old tabletops. This is often what happens. Young men and women arrive and it is their work to describe the world that is becoming. That\u2019s the way it is now.\n From the book  THE\u00a050S: THE STORY OF A DECADE\u00a0by  The\u00a0New\u00a0Yorker. Copyright \u00a9 2016 by  The\u00a0New Yorker.

"note_en": "Welcome to the Convivial Society , a newsletter about technology and society, broadly speaking. If you find the writing helpful, you can sign up if you haven\u2019t already, share it with others, or subscribe.\n   I\u2019m a Mets fan. Right at this moment, that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Despite having up to 17 players on the injured list earlier this season, they\u2019ve been in first place in their division for nearly two months. Over the past three decades, however, being a Mets fan has meant mostly disappointment and frustration, punctuated by rare moments of joy. Naturally, I\u2019m bequeathing this legacy of emotional turmoil to my daughters.\n But it\u2019s not only the first place standing that makes this a tolerable, even enjoyable baseball season. It is also the once-in-a-lifetime performance that pitcher Jacob deGrom has been putting on. If you attend at all to the world of American sports, you may know that deGrom has been one of the best pitchers in baseball the past few years. He won consecutive Cy Young awards in 2018 and 2019. This season he is having a historically good run. I\u2019ll spare you the statistics. If you peruse the  top search results for \u201cdeGrom\u201d on Twitter, and you\u2019ll get a sampling of his accomplishments thus far.   It\u2019s been a delight to watch him pitch. He combines remarkable physical skill and precision with uncanny mental focus and composure. He gets measurably better in higher pressure situations. On the mound, his lack of emotional expression lends him an almost robotic air. You get the point. The man is good, and his current stretch may very well be the best stretch by any pitcher ever. Oh, and he throws hard. Since the beginning of the pitch tracking era in 2008, deGrom has been the only starting pitcher to average 100 mph on his fastball for an entire game. He\u2019s done it twice this year. He has also set the record for the most 100 mph pitches in a game.\n Perhaps the most striking thing about deGrom\u2019s velocity is that it has improved year after year. In 2016, his average fastball came in at 93.9 mph. In 2020, it was at 98.7. Thus far in 2021, he\u2019s average 99.2 mph. This impressive improvement over time is especially notable given deGrom\u2019s age. He turned 33 on June 19th. So how has he done it? One answer is that he has achieved machine-like efficiency with the mechanics of his delivery.\n Here is a video produced by Tread Athletics, a baseball consulting firm focused on harnessing data to improve pitcher velocity. It\u2019s an analysis of Jacob deGrom\u2019s mechanics over the last few years during which his average velocity increased more than 5 mph.\n  The video presentation is about 50 minutes in length and relies on video archives of deGrom\u2019s pitching career. As the presenter makes clear, they have no special access to deGrom and the analysis is undertaken with a view to gleaning lessons for the firm\u2019s clientele. That said, it offers an interesting glimpse into the world of elite or would-be elite pitchers. Pretty much every aspect of their bodily motion is subject to measurement, analysis, and calibration. Consider, too, especially if you\u2019ve not kept up with baseball analytics, the sheer volume of data available to measure a pitcher\u2019s performance. Take a look, for example, at deGrom\u2019s page at  Baseball Savant or  FanGraphs. Turns out that when you can track and measure every pitch and every swing, you can generate an absurd amount of analytical categories.\n As I thought about deGrom\u2019s mechanical precision, it seemed that baseball analytics offered an interesting vantage point from which to consider the nature of data-driven optimization that now structures so much of contemporary society. For example, the analytics trajectory that emerges circa 2008 with the deployment of increasingly precise and comprehensive data gathering tools also mirrors broader social trends. We can now measure and analyze dimensions of personal and social life that we wouldn\u2019t even have thought to measure a decade or two ago. It was always theoretically possible for us to count our steps, but altogether impractical. Now we can have it done for us passively. Indeed, as most of us know all too well, all manner of information about us and our activities is now gathered passively, stored indefinitely, and put to useful, dubious, and dangerous ends. Aspiring pitchers may now be able to finely calibrate and optimize their bodily motions to increase their velocity, but it is another thing altogether for a corporation to similarly monitor and discipline the bodies of their employees for the sake of more efficient production.\n It will be helpful, I think, for us to consider data-driven optimization in light of what the mid-20th century French polymath Jacques Ellul called  la technique. Some of you will already be familiar with what Ellul meant by the term, but, if you\u2019re encountering it for the first time, a bit of exposition is warranted. It was an expansive concept, which Ellul used to capture what he considered the tyrannical dominance of the drive for efficiency in modern society. Here is a helpful  synopsis from James Fowler:\n Ellul\u2019s issue was not with technological machines but with a society necessarily caught up in efficient methodological techniques. Technology, then, is but an expression and by-product of the underlying reliance on technique, on the proceduralization whereby everything is organized and managed to function most efficiently, and directed toward the most expedient end of the highest productivity. Ellul\u2019s own comprehensive definition is found in the preface of\u00a0 The Technological Society: \u201cTechnique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity.\u201d\n And here\u2019s a bit more from Fowler\u2019s discussion of what technique had become in the 20th century according to Ellul:\n Technique became the defining force, the ultimate value, of a new social order in which efficiency was no longer an option but a necessity imposed on all human activity. Technique became universally totalitarian in modern society as rationalistic proceduralism imposed an artificial value system of measuring and organizing everything quantitatively rather than qualitatively.\n The tendency remains, and, as Ellul predicted, it has only intensified. The power of digital computation\u2014still nascent when Ellul published his best known work,  The Technological Society\u2014radically widened the scope of technique, understood as the drive toward efficiency in all realms of human experience. And, as it turns out, developments in the game of baseball illustrate the more general social patterns pretty well, and they may, in fact, present us with a few insights into  la technique realized in the culture of optimization.\n Baseball, of course, has always been a numbers game, at first characterized by traditional statistics based on analog records. The first box score, for example, is attributed to Henry Chadwick, who came up with it in 1858. The baseball scorebook (belwo) became the standard tool for recording at bats, hits, strikeouts, walks, runs, etc.\n  This simple tool supported the collection of a surprising amount of data. Most of this data told us what had happened in a game, and it required relatively straightforward calculations to yield useful information about player performance. A more sophisticated class of statistics was then made possible by computation. My sense, too, is that there was also a shift in what statistics could tell us about: from what has happened to what will happen, from documentation to prediction.\n Here, for instance, is an interesting  tidbit about Davey Johnson\u2019s career-long fascination with harnessing the power of computation:\n Before Bill James popularized sabermetrics, Davey Johnson used an IBM System/360 at team owner Jerold Hoffberger&#39;s brewery to write a FORTRAN baseball computer simulation while playing for the Baltimore Orioles in the early 1970s. He used his results in an unsuccessful attempt to promote to his manager Earl Weaver the idea that he should bat second in the lineup. He wrote IBM BASIC programs to help him manage the Tidewater Tides, and after becoming manager of the New York Mets in 1984, he arranged for a team employee to write a dBASE II application to compile and store advanced metrics on team statistics.\n Davey Johnson was a pioneer of a data-driven approach to the game enabled by modern computing that was later popularized by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A\u2019s in the late 90s and early 2000s. Beane\u2019s success in fielding a winning team on the cheap using advanced metrics was chronicled in Michael Lewis\u2019s  Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game (2003). Beane\u2019s success, of course, meant that other teams would take note and follow suite. What was once a distinctive and idiosyncratic approach to the game became the dominant strategy. The consequences of this homogenizing tendency will be the first thing for us to consider, and, back in 2018, Alan Jacobs  described the consequences in an essay lamenting the flattening of the game that followed the success of the sabermetric revolution.\n Jacobs begins the essay by recalling his fascination with the Baltimore Orioles of the early 70s led by manager Earl Weaver. Interestingly, this was the same team Davey Johnson played for when he was fiddling with FORTRAN simulations. Weaver\u2019s distinctive approach to the game focused on the most efficient way to score runs was soon validated by Bill James\u2019s statistical analysis in the late 70s and Billy Beane\u2019s success with the A\u2019s. But here a paradox emerges: Jacobs argues that \u201cstrangely enough, baseball was better when we knew less about the most effective way to play it.\u201d In Jacobs\u2019s view, when everyone knows the most efficient way to play the game, the game as a whole loses its color and variety.\n  Coaches used to place a lot of emphasis on teaching batters how to hit the ball to the opposite field, at least sometimes. But sabermetrics has shown that batters get more hits, and more extra-base hits, if they pull the ball. In turn, the increased dominance of pull-hitting has led defenses to employ shifts that place fielders in the most likely paths of balls hit by any given batter. And then batters have responded to these shifts by realizing that it doesn\u2019t matter where the fielders are if you hit the ball out of the park. So: more and more batters swinging for the fences, hitting more home runs than ever, and accepting historically high levels of strikeouts as just the inevitable collateral damage.\n And, as Jacobs goes on to emphasize, \u201ccoaches and players understand the percentages better than they ever have in the history of the game, and are acting accordingly. All of these changes I have traced are eminently rational.\u201d\n \u201cSo you can\u2019t blame anyone for the way the game has developed,\u201d Jacobs concludes. \u201cIt has become more rational, with a better command of the laws of probability, and stricter, more rigorous canons of efficiency.\u201d\n It\u2019s worth pausing to consider wherein the purported rationality lies. It is the logic of competition. Within the sporting world, of course, the point is to win, and to do so in a way that can be clearly determined quantitatively. There are no grounds for anyone to ask a manager or a player to pursue a strategy that will diminish their competitive edge. Most of life, however, is not a game with quantifiable outcomes, and probably shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. However, the triumph of technique in Ellul\u2019s sense encourages the competitive mode of experience. Indeed, quantification itself invites it. This dynamic can be put to beneficial use, and, in clearly delineated circumstances, is perfectly appropriate. But applied uncritically and indiscriminately or even nefariously (see e.g. social media metrics) it can introduce destructive tendencies and eclipse qualitative or otherwise unquantifiable values. Generally speaking, quantification and the logic of optimization which it encourages tend to transform our field of experience into  points of aggression, as the sociologist Hartmut Rosa has aptly put it. Data-driven optimization is, in this sense, a way of perceiving the world. And what may matter most about this is not necessarily what it allows us to see, but it keeps us from perceiving: in short, all that cannot be quantified or measured.\n On an earlier occasion, Jacobs\u2019s analysis also recalled a distinction drawn by one philosopher between what is correct and what is true. What is correct may fall short of truth because it is partial or inadequate, and may for that reason be, in fact, misleading. It seemed to me that we might, in similar fashion, draw a distinction between what is right and what is good. It was right for the Baltimore Orioles in the 70s and the A\u2019s in the early 2000\u2019s to optimize their team strategies and tactics as they did. Moreover, it is right (meaning rational and in keeping with the competitive nature of the sport) for all other teams to do so. It is not, however, good for baseball that they do so, or so Jacobs and others who take his view of things would argue.\n But is the game, taken as a whole, really worse off? Anecdotally, I encounter frequent complaints from diverse quarters about the homogenous character of the game. And it\u2019s worth noting that there are also perennial anxieties about the popularity of the game among younger fans unrelated to the fallout of an analytics intensive approach to the game. But there are, I\u2019m sure, many fans who are untroubled by any of this. So, is Jacobs right to say that baseball was better when we knew less about it? And here we are at the crux of the issue from another angle: how is the goodness of the game measured and accounted for? Or, more to the point,  can the goodness of the game be measured? If not, then in what would the goodness of the game consist? And, an equally interesting question, why might we assume or want it to be the case that good can be adequately quantified? My point in raising these questions, of course, is that we should ask them in relation to things other than baseball.\n As it turns out, Jacobs\u2019s analysis in the piece I\u2019ve been referencing reminded me of a paragraph he had  posted on his blog a few years prior from Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019s memoir,  Tristes Tropiques:\n In Martinique, I had visited rustic and neglected rum-distilleries where the equipment and the methods used had not changed since the eighteenth century. In Puerto Rico, on the other hand, in the factories of the company which enjoys a virtual monopoly over the whole of the sugar production, I was faced by a display of white enamel tanks and chromium piping. Yet the various kinds of Martinique rum, as I tasted them in front of ancient wooden vats thickly encrusted with waste matter, were mellow and scented, whereas those of Puerto Rico are coarse and harsh. We may suppose, then, that the subtlety of the Martinique rums is dependent on impurities the continuance of which is encouraged by the archaic method of production. To me, this contrast illustrates the paradox of civilization: its charms are due essentially to the various residues it carries along with it, although this does not absolve us of the obligation to purify the stream. By being doubly in the right, we are admitting our mistake. We are right to be rational and to try to increase our production and so keep manufacturing costs down. But we are also right to cherish those very imperfections we are endeavouring to eliminate. Social life consists in destroying that which gives it its savour.\n It\u2019s not altogether obvious to me that social life must consist in destroying that which gives it its savor. I suppose much depends on what exactly is entailed by \u201cpurifying the stream,\u201d as Levi-Strauss puts it. As Ellul saw it, technique colonized realms of life to which it did not properly belong. The key, then, is to recognize where and when it is appropriate to allow technique (or quantification or optimization) a place and where and when it would be good to circumscribe its scope. In order to do so we must have before us a clear sense of the good we seek. But, as Ellul warned, technique becomes a problem precisely when it becomes and end in itself. This may happen because we ourselves lose sight of the ends we were originally seeking or because the focus on technique itself gradually blinds us to those ends. It would seem that when a framework within which questions of the good can be meaningfully taken up is unavailable, then quantification rushes in to fill the axial vacuum. In his own fine  post on baseball and optimization a couple of years back, Rob Horning cited Melissa Gregg who observed that \u201cpersonal productivity is an epistemology without an ontology, a framework for knowing what to do in the absence of a guiding principle for doing it.\u201d\n So as more and more of our lives become subject to regimes of optimization, we should remember the limits of quantification and strive to see what we cannot measure. And because we may need a little help toward that end, I\u2019ll wrap us up by commending a children\u2019s book to you,  The Little Prince.\n \u201cGood morning,\u201d said the merchant.  This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need for anything to drink.  \u201cWhy are you selling those?\u201d asked the little prince.  \u201cBecause they save a tremendous amount of time,\u201d said the merchant. \u201cComputations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\u201d  \u201cAnything you like ...\u201d  \u201cAs for me,\u201d said the little prince to himself, \u201cif I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\u201d\n You should read the whole thing someday if you\u2019ve never done so.

FRANCISCO, June 22, 2021 \u2013 The Linux Foundation, the nonprofit organization enabling mass innovation through open source, today announced the Open Voice Network, an open source association dedicated to advancing open standards that support the adoption of AI-enabled voice assistance systems. Founding members include Target, Schwarz Gruppe, Wegmans Food Markets, Microsoft, Veritone, and Deutsche Telekom.\n Organizations are beginning to develop, design and manage their own voice assistant systems that are independent of today\u2019s general-purpose voice platforms. This transition is being driven by the desire to manage the entirety of the user experience \u2013 from the sound of the voice, the sonic branding and the content \u2013 to integrating voice assistance into multiple business processes and brand environments from the call center, to the branch office and the store. Perhaps most importantly, organizations know they must protect the consumer and the proprietary data that flows through voice. The Open Voice Network will support this evolution by delivering standards and usage guidelines for voice assistant systems that are trustworthy, inclusive and open.\n \u201cAt Target, we\u2019re continuously exploring and embracing new technologies that can help provide joyful, easy and convenient experiences for our guests. We look forward to working with the Open Voice Network community to create global standards and share best practices that will enable businesses to accelerate innovation in this space and better serve consumers,\u201d  said Joel Crabb, Vice President, Architecture, Target Corporation. \u201cThe Linux Foundation, with its role in advancing open source for all, is the perfect home for this initiative.\u201d\n Voice is expected to be a primary digital interface going forward and will result in a hybrid ecosystem of general-purpose platforms and independent voice assistants that demand interoperability between conversational agents of different platforms and voice assistants. Open Voice Network is dedicated to supporting this transformation with industry guidance on the voice-specific protection of user privacy and data security.\n \u201cVoice is expected to be a primary interface to the digital world, connecting users to billions of sites, smart environments and AI bots. It is already increasingly being used beyond smart speakers to include applications in automobiles, smartphones and home electronics devices of all types. Key to enabling enterprise adoption of these capabilities and consumer comfort and familiarity is the implementation of open standards,\u201d said  Mike Dolan, senior vice president and general manager of Projects at the Linux Foundation. \u201cThe potential impact of voice on industries including commerce, transportation, healthcare and entertainment is staggering and we\u2019re excited to bring it under the open governance model of the Linux foundation to grow the community and pave a way forward.\u201d\n \u201cTo speak is human, and voice is rapidly becoming the primary interaction modality between users and their devices and services at home and work. The more devices and services can interact openly and safely with one another, the more value we unlock for consumers and businesses across a wide spectrum of use cases, such as Conversational AI for customer service and commerce,\u201d  said Ali Dalloul, General Manager, Microsoft Azure AI, Strategy &amp; Commercialization.\n Much as open standards in the earliest days of the Internet brought a uniform way to exchange information and connect with any site anywhere, the Open Voice Network will bring the same standardized ease of development and use to voice assistant systems and conversational agents, leading to huge growth and value for businesses and consumers alike.\u00a0 Voice assistance depends upon technologies like Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Advanced Dialog Management (ADM) and Machine Learning (ML).\u00a0 The Open Voice Network will initially be focused on the following areas:\n \u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Standards development: research and recommendations toward the global standards that will enable user choice, inclusivity, and trust.\n \u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Industry value and awareness: identification and sharing of conversational AI best practices that are both horizontal and specific to vertical industries, serving as  the source of insight and value for voice assistance.\n \u25cf\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Advocacy: working with and through existing industry associations on relevant regulatory and legislative issues, including those of data privacy.\n \u201cVoice is transforming the relationships between brands and consumers,\u201d  said Rolf Schumann, Chief Digital Officer, Schwarz Gruppe. \u201cVoice is changing the way we are interacting with our digital devices. For instance, when shopping through our smart home appliances. However, voice includes more information than a fingerprint and can entail data about the emotional state or mental health of a user. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to put data protection standards in place to protect the user\u2019s privacy. This is the only way we will contribute to the future of voice.\u201d\n \u201cSelf-regulation of synthetic voice content creation and use, to protect the voice owner as well as establishing trust with the consumer is foundational,\u201d  said Ryan Steelberg, president and cofounder of Veritone. \u201cHaving an open network through Open Voice Network for education and global standards is the only way to keep pace with the rate of innovation and demand for influencer marketing. Veritone\u2019s MARVEL.ai, a Voice as a Service solution, is proud to partner with Open Voice Network on building the best practices to protect the voice brands we work with across sports, media and entertainment.\u201d\n Membership to the Open Voice Network includes a commitment of resources in support of the its research, awareness and advocacy activities and active participation in the its symposia and workshops. The Linux Foundation open governance model will allow for community-wide contributions that will accelerate conversational AI standards rollout and adoption.\n   Founded in 2000, the Linux Foundation is supported by more than 1,000 members and is the world\u2019s leading home for collaboration on open source software, open standards, open data, and open hardware. Linux Foundation\u2019s projects are critical to the world\u2019s infrastructure including Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, and more.\u00a0 The Linux Foundation\u2019s methodology focuses on leveraging best practices and addressing the needs of contributors, users and solution providers to create sustainable models for open collaboration.

", "note_en": "A protein found in robins\u2019 eyes has all the hallmarks of a magnetoreceptor and could help birds navigate using the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields, according to a study published today (June 23) in   Nature. The research, an intensive in vitro analysis of robin cryptochrome 4 (Cry4), revealed that the protein is magnetically sensitive and fulfills several predictions of one of the leading quantum-based theories for how avian magnetoreception might work.\n The authors of the study argue that their findings support Cry4 as the likely receptor for birds\u2019 still largely mysterious magnetic sense. But some other researchers who spoke to  The Scientist say that while the results are extremely useful for understanding cryptochromes, a family of proteins often studied in circadian rhythms, the paper omits some scientific context for its findings and doesn\u2019t necessarily support Cry4 as the elusive magnetoreceptor.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s a very important step to show that this cryptochrome 4 actually can perceive light and then become magnetically sensitive,\u201d says Rachel Muheim, a zoologist and magnetoreception researcher at Lund University in Sweden who was not involved in this work. She says that in her view Cry4 has already emerged in the wider literature as the most likely candidate in avian navigation, but \u201cthere are a number of experiments that can\u2019t be explained\u201d by the mechanism the new study focuses on and that aren\u2019t addressed in the paper, she adds. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unanswered questions.\u201d\n  Many animals use the Earth\u2019s magnetic fields to help them navigate, but scientists have long debated the biological mechanisms underpinning this sixth sense, with repeated accusations of  irreproducible findings and sometimes heated debates between different research groups.\n The cryptochrome theory of magnetoreception is based on quantum mechanics. Cryptochromes are light-sensitive flavoproteins found in the retinas of birds and several other groups of animals, and they\u2019re known to form a pair of radicals\u2014molecules with unpaired electrons\u2014when exposed to light. These electrons have correlated spins, and theoretical and in vitro work indicate that their states can be influenced by magnetic fields, leading to the hypothesis that cryptochrome proteins could provide the basis for animal magnetoreception.\n  At least four cryptochromes (Cry1a, Cry1b, Cry2, and Cry4) have been found in birds\u2019 eyes to date. While some groups have focused their attention on Cry1a, University of Oxford chemist Peter Hore, a coauthor on the new study, tells  The Scientist that he and his colleagues at Oxford and at the University of Oldenburg in Germany view Cry4 as the more likely candidate. Unlike some of the other avian cryptochromes, Hore says, Cry4 binds to a particular molecule needed to help it absorb light and undergo the sort of photochemistry necessary to sense magnetic fields.\n   \u201cAlso, the other cryptochromes in birds show a 24-hour rhythm in their expression, consistent with their involvement in circadian regulation, whereas the Cry4 doesn\u2019t\u2014but it does show a seasonal variation, which the others don\u2019t,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat could be consistent with the need to migrate in spring and autumn.\u201d\n To explore the idea further, the team isolated Cry4 from European robins ( Erithacus rubecula) that migrate at night when skies are dim, though not completely dark, and studied the protein in vitro using various techniques, including computer simulations and several types of spectroscopy that can measure how magnetic fields affect protein photochemistry. The researchers also created mutant versions of the protein to figure out the role of individual amino acids in Cry4\u2019s sensitivity to magnetic fields.\n They showed that Cry4 generates radical pairs in a light-dependent reaction by having electrons hop along a string of tryptophan amino acids, and that these pairs are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. What\u2019s more, compared to robin Cry4, the same cryptochrome isolated from chickens and pigeons\u2014two nonmigratory birds\u2014were a lot less sensitive to magnetic fields, suggesting that robin Cry4 might be particularly specialized for magnetoreception, the authors write in their paper.\n  David Keays of Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich who was not involved in the work says that the findings do seem to support Cry4\u2019s role in magnetoreception, and adds that the study is consistent with his own group\u2019s  research on the protein\u2019s sensing of magnetic fields. He notes that the magnetic fields used in the study were stronger than those generated by the Earth. \u201cThe authors see a clear magnetic effect when applying 10-30mT fields to CRY4 in test tubes,\u201d he adds in an email. \u201c[W]hether the same applies to Earth strength fields (50uT) in a migrating bird is an open question.\u201d\n Alex Jones, a specialist in photochemistry and magnetic field effects at the UK\u2019s National Physical Laboratory who was not involved in the study, says that the data and the authors\u2019 interpretation of the results as they relate to the protein\u2019s behavior are \u201cvery solid.\u201d Regarding the strength of the magnetic fields used, he adds that \u201cthe radical pair mechanism predicts effects at both weaker and stronger fields, and starting from exposure to stronger fields makes sense from an experimental point of view.\u201d\n  Margaret Ahmad, a photobiologist at Sorbonne Universit\u00e9 in Paris who helped  discover cryptochromes in the early 1990s while working on  Arabidopsis\u00a0plants and was not involved in the current work, says that while the researchers \u201cdid a tremendous job\u201d of providing valuable data on Cry4, she finds their conclusions about avian navigation unsupported and contrary to existing data from experiments in animal behavior.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not scientifically admissible to relate [this Cry4 mechanism] to magnetosensing in view of the behavioral evidence that contradicts any role\u201d for it in avian magnetoreception, says Ahmad, who has previously debated with Hore\u2019s group in  the literature about the  functions of other  cryptochrome proteins in plants.\n One of the points of contention is the fact that the particular radical pair mechanism described in the new paper is known not to work under green light. Yet Muheim and others have reported from behavioral experiments that robins and other birds are in fact capable of orienting just fine under green light, although there is an ongoing discussion in the field about whether these findings could partly be due to the light conditions birds were exposed to before being tested.\n Hore says that it\u2019s unclear how Cry4 fits into this literature at the moment. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to make of that,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe the photochemistry is more complicated than we think\u2014it could certainly be different in vivo.\u201d\n Ahmad also points to research by veteran magnetoreception researchers Roswitha Wiltschko and Wolfgang Wiltschko, who carried out orientation experiments using flickering lights and changing magnetic fields. The pair concluded that robins\u2019 magnetosensor worked even in complete darkness. This typically isn\u2019t the sort of condition that robins would navigate under, but the findings led the researchers to propose that it\u2019s a different, light-independent radical pair reaction in cryptochrome that\u2019s important for magnetoreception.\n My personal sense is that we\u2019re a little beyond just looking at one end of this, at just the physical chemistry, or just the birds.\n These points weren\u2019t discussed in the paper, Ahmad notes. \u201cWhy would you ignore this [data in your paper]? You have to fit your model into the existing behavioral data,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in the field at all, I would get the idea that \u2018Ah! The bird magnetoreceptor, we\u2019ve got it!\u2019\u201d\n The Wiltschkos, who are based at Goethe University Frankfurt and have collaborated with Ahmad and Hore on various occasions, have argued that Cry4\u2019s position in the eye\u2014associated with oil droplets that block the types of light needed to activate the protein\u2014also make Cry4 an unlikely candidate. In an email sent to  The Scientist, Roswitha Wiltschko highlights many of the same points as Ahmad, and notes that she favors Cry1a, \u201cwhich is found in [photoreceptors that] contain clear oil droplet that let all wavelengths pass,\u201d as the likely magnetoreceptor in birds.\n She also adds that \u201cthe avian magnetic compass is not at all restricted to migratory birds. [In] particular homing pigeons and chickens have been demonstrated to use a magnetic compass; hence we would not expect them to be poorer equipped.\u201d\n The University of Oldenburg\u2019s Henrik Mouritsen, a coauthor on the new study, says that his group has tried to replicate a number of different studies of magnetoreception by the Wiltschkos and other groups without success. \u201cIf we cannot replicate certain claims, we cannot really refer to those things as facts, because we cannot see that\u2014and we have also published that we cannot see that.\u201d\n He agrees that the team\u2019s current study doesn\u2019t provide conclusive proof that Cry4 is the magnetoreceptor in robins, but adds that in combination with the rest of the literature (excluding papers his group has concluded are irreproducible), \u201cin our view, the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to Cry4 being the hottest candidate.\u201d\n He emphasizes that the protein\u2019s behavior in vitro matches up very well with theoretical predictions about magnetoreception. \u201cI would say that it is astounding if what we measure in this molecule is just a coincidence,\u201d he adds. \u201c[I] think that the claim that what we have measured is unlikely to have anything to do with magnetic sensing in birds is . . . unwarranted.\u201d\n  Thorsten Ritz, a physicist at the University of California, Irvine, who helped develop the original cryptochrome radical pair model of avian magnetoreception more than 20 years ago and was one of the reviewers on the new paper, which was submitted in mid-2019, tells  The Scientist\u00a0that while detailed descriptions of the proteins that are potentially involved are extremely important, \u201cmy personal sense is that we\u2019re a little beyond just looking at one end of this, at just the physical chemistry, or just the birds\u2014that\u2019s how we started 50 years ago in this field.\u201d Researchers should be working on developing new experimental systems that allow them to study everything from sensing a magnetic field through to some kind of phenotypic effect, he adds.\n Hore says that although it\u2019s challenging to do in vivo experiments with purported magnetoreceptors, it might be possible to inhibit Cry4 function in birds\u2019 eyes and study the importance of the protein\u2019s magnetosensitivity in vivo. He adds that the team is now working with mutant cryptochrome proteins to understand what makes robin Cry4 particularly sensitive to magnetic fields compared to chicken or pigeon cryptochrome.\n They\u2019re also interested in the role of a tyrosine amino acid that sits at the end of the tryptophan chain. \u201cI think that could be quite important for the mechanism of sensing and signaling,\u201d says Hore. \u201cI\u2019d like to find a way to make the in vitro experiments mimic the situation in vivo more closely to see if we can get evidence for the involvement of that tyrosine.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:54:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "robins,cry4", "title": "\u690d\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5728robins\u7684\u773c\u775b\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u78c1\u4f53\u7684\u6240\u6709\u6807\u5fd7 ", "title_en": "Protein found in robins\u2019 eyes has all the hallmarks of a magnetoreceptor", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/new-study-fuels-debate-about-source-of-birds-magnetic-sense-68917", "via": "", "real_tags": ["robins", "cry4"]}]
