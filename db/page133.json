"note_en": "Last Thursday the large new Russian space station module, Nauka, finally docked with the International Space Station after several technical issues en route to the orbiting laboratory. However, the problems did not end there. About three hours after linking to the station, Nauka began firing its propulsion thrusters,  throwing the space station off kilter.\n This led NASA Mission Control in Houston to initiate &#34;loss of attitude control&#34; procedures on board the station, a contingency astronauts and flight controllers train for. Then, in concert with flight controllers in Moscow, the teams commanded the station to fire its thrusters on the Russian segment of the space station, as well as a Progress supply vehicle attached to the laboratory. These combined actions prevented the station from tumbling too violently until Nauka exhausted its primary fuel supply.\n  Following this near miss, NASA hastily called a news conference and brought out key figures before the media, including human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders and the leader of the International Space Station program, Joel Montalbano. Both said NASA and the Russian space corporation, Roscosmos, had the situation well in hand and downplayed the overall risk to the station and the astronauts on board.\n However, they deferred many questions on the technical issues to Roscosmos, which has offered mixed messages. A senior official in Roscosmos, former cosmonaut\u00a0Vladimir Solovyov,  said in an official statement, &#34;Due to\u00a0a\u00a0short-term software failure, a\u00a0direct command was mistakenly implemented to\u00a0turn on\u00a0the module&#39;s engines for withdrawal, which led to\u00a0some modification of\u00a0the orientation of\u00a0the complex as\u00a0a\u00a0whole.&#34;\n This makes the problem sound like a software error. But later, the head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, acknowledged that someone on the ground could have made a mistake. &#34;Everything was going well, but there was a human factor,&#34; he told a Russian publication,  as reported by Reuters. &#34;There was some euphoria (after the successful docking), everybody got relaxed.&#34;\n    Now that the immediate danger has passed, the most pressing concerns are that this happened at all and what it may mean for ongoing Russian participation in the International Space Station program. For NASA, the primary goal is to maintain a human presence in low Earth orbit, and this means flying the station for the remainder of the 2020s.\n  Given the likelihood that Nauka&#39;s errant thruster firing involved human error, that would be at least the third major problem in less than three years resulting from shoddy work. In October 2018, the launch of Russian cosmonaut Aleksey Ovchinin and NASA astronaut Nick Hague was aborted after a Soyuz booster failure, and the crew had to make an emergency return to Earth. A subsequent investigation  found that the side-mounted booster had been improperly mated to the core stage of the Soyuz rocket.\n  At around the same time, Russia announced that there was a small hole in a different Soyuz vehicle, already attached to the International Space Station.\u00a0\u201cWe are able to narrow down the cause to a technological mistake of a technician,&#34;  Rogozin said of the problem.\n These technical errors have occurred as Roscosmos has had difficulty paying its engineers and technicians a living wage. And now the country&#39;s space budget faces further pressure as NASA no longer needs to buy Soyuz seats for its astronauts to ride to the International Space Station\u2014thanks to SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon vehicle and, hopefully soon, Boeing&#39;s Starliner.\n Despite all of this, NASA has remained publicly supportive of Russia and its space program. And it has to be relieved that, regardless of its\u00a0myriad troubles in getting to the space station, Nauka is now there and functional. This is important because it  likely cements Russian participation in the space station for the remainder of this decade.\n    There is no guarantee of that. In recent months Russian officials have begun saying that Roscosmos&#39; existing hardware on orbit, much of which is more than two decades old, is aging beyond repair. The Russians\u00a0 have also suggested\u00a0they may pull out of the program in 2025 and build a brand-new station. Indeed, just on Saturday, two days after Nauka&#39;s troublesome docking, Roscosmos issued a statement saying it was  continuing a study of a new station project in low Earth orbit called the Russian Orbital Service Station. This seems very likely to be posturing, as Russia has neither the budget nor likely the ability to rapidly build a new space station.\n The question for NASA becomes, then, how long it is willing to rely on a partner that is clearly having technical issues with its workforce, is always asking for more money, and making noises about wanting to exit the space station partnership that has existed for about three decades now.\n NASA&#39;s stated intent is to maintain a presence in low Earth orbit. By 2028 or shortly after, it hopes to have commercial space stations operating there. But until that time, the International Space Station is NASA&#39;s only game in town. Should the Russians become even less reliable, the U space agency has options, but those will take time to implement.\n NASA could pay a company like Axiom to accelerate development of its commercial module that will dock to the station, which could take over the propulsion tasks of the Russian Service Module now attached to the station. Or it could even give a company like SpaceX a contract to dock its Starship vehicle at the space station to maintain its altitude.\n For now, it does not appear as though the NASA-Roscosmos relationship is at the breaking point, but, like the aging space station, it is showing signs of wear, tear, and cracking. Roscosmos could apply some much-needed mortar by being clear with NASA about what exactly happened with Nauka\u00a0and committing to the future of the partnership.", "posttime": "2021-08-02 21:11:49",

realize it. In fact, it\u2019s that early faith in companies that partner David Tisch believes has been key to BoxGroup\u2019s success.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re starting a company and you\u2019re going to raise money, that first yes is the hardest. And it\u2019s that\u2019s the one that  gives you the confidence, the excitement \u2013 to know that there\u2019s somebody out there that\u2019s going to believe in this and give you money for it,\u201d Partner David Tisch told TechCrunch. \u201cWe really do try to pride ourselves on being that first yes on a regular basis. So the earlier we meet companies, the better.\u201d\n  Today, BoxGroup is announcing it has beefed up its war chest so that it can be that \u201cfirst yes\u201d to more companies with the closure of two new funds  totaling $255 million of capital. BoxGroup Five is the firm\u2019s fifth early stage fund, and is aimed at investing in emerging tech companies at the pre-seed and seed stages. BoxGroup Strive is its second opportunity fund that will back companies in their subsequent follow-on rounds. Each fund amounts to $127.5 million.\n Over the years, BoxGroup has  made over 300 investments including having invested in the earliest rounds of Ro, Plaid, Airtable, Workrise, Scopely, Bowery Farms, Ramp, Titan,  Warby Parker, Classpass, Guideline and Glossier. It has had a number of impressive exits in Flatiron Health, PillPack, Matterport, Oscar, Mirror, Bark, Bread and Trello.\n  Besides being the first firm to write Plaid a check, BoxGroup was also the first investor in PillPack, which ended up   selling to Amazon  for just under $1 billion in 2018.\n BoxGroup Five \u2013 the firm\u2019s early-stage fund \u2013 will  invest in about 40 to 50 new companies a year with investments ranging from $250,000 to $1 million.\n \u201cWe want to be the second or third biggest check in a round,\u201d Tisch said.\n  The opportunity fund occasionally makes later-stage investments in new companies, but mostly just continues to support companies it invested in at an earlier stage. For example, BoxGroup first invested in  id.me in 2010.\n \u201cThe company is  sort of an 11-year overnight success that we\u2019ve been backing for over a decade now,\u201d Tisch said. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of us just continuing to support companies through their life cycle.\u201d\n BoxGroup also pre-seeded digital healthcare startup Ro, but also funded every round it\u2019s raised since, including its most recent  $500 million funding at a $5 billion valuation.\n Tisch describes the BoxGroup six-person team as \u201cgeneralists\u201d in terms of the spaces it invests in, with a portfolio consisting of startups in the consumer, enterprise, fintech, healthcare, marketplace, synthetic biology and climate sectors.\n Interestingly,  BoxGroup\u2019s last fund closures \u2013 which totaled $165 million \u2013 marked the first time the firm had accepted outside capital in nine years. Prior to that point, it had been funded with only personal capital. Its LPs are a mixed group of endowments, foundations and family offices.\n For BoxGroup, building authentic relationships with founders is at the root of what the firm does, says  Partner Nimi Katragadda. That includes taking bets on founders, sometimes more than once, even if one of their companies didn\u2019t work out. It means backing just ideas in some cases, and people.\n \u201cThis cannot be transactional, it has to be personal,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to go on a journey with someone for a decade as they build their business\u2026. We\u2019re comfortable with what early means, including a lot of assumptions, more vision t han traction, and raw product.\u201d\n Partner Adam Rothenberg agrees, saying: \u201cOur goal is to be the friend in the room. We believe in honesty, tough love, and transparency in building relationships with founders. We focus on the \u201chow\u201d more than the \u201cwhat\u201d \u2014 how a founder thinks, how they will build product, and how they think about attracting talent.\u201d\n With offices in San Francisco and New York, the firm will likely be growing in the near future as BoxGroup is looking to add on some \u201cfirst-line investors,\u201d Tisch said.\n Recently,  Greg Rosen was named a partner at the firm. Rosen originally joined BoxGroup in 2015, where he spent three years before leaving to join Benchmark. He re-joined BoxGroup in early 2020 and joins the firm\u2019s three other partners: Tisch, Rothenberg and Katragadda.\n While the world of venture is crazy hot right now, Tisch said the firm keeps itself grounded with a wisdom that can only be gained with experience and in time.\n \u201cThere is seemingly infinite capital waiting to be deployed,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout calling the cycle, we know that over time markets go up and down\u2026No matter where we are in a given cycle, smart and determined minds will come together to build important technology companies. Our job is to make sure we are meeting those founders and choosing wisely about which ones to partner with for 10+ year journeys.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-08-02 21:10:50", "source_domain":

companies have raised $12.3bn in 2021 according to Dealroom, but the market is still wide-open for a great deal more funding for B2B fintech startups.\n So it\u2019s little surprise that B2B fintech-focused  Element Ventures, has announced a $130 million fund to double-down on this new FinTech enterprise trend.\n  Founded by financial services veterans Steve Gibson and Michael McFadgen, and joined by Spencer Lake (HSBC\u2019s former Vice Chairman of Global Banking and Markets) Element is backed by finance-oriented LPs and some 30 founders and executives from the sector.\n Element says it will focus on what it calls a \u201chigh conviction investment strategy,\u201d which will mean investing in only around 15 companies a year, but, it says, providing a \u201chigh level of support\u201d to its portfolio.\n So far it has backed B2B fintech firms across the UK and Europe including Hepster (total raised $10M), the embedded insurance platform out of Germany  which I recently reported on; Billhop (total raised $6.7M), the B2B payment network out of Sweden; Coincover (total raised $11.6M), a cryptocurrency recovery service out of the UK; and Minna (total raised $25M), the subscription management platform out of Sweden.\n  Speaking to me over a call McFadgen, Partner at Element Ventures, said: \u201cSteven and I have been investing in B2B FinTech together for quite a long time. In 2018 we had the opportunity to start element and Spencer came on boar in 2019. So Element as an independent venture firm is really a continuation of a strategy we\u2019ve been involved in for a long time.\u201d\n Gibson added: \u201cWe are quite convinced by the European movement and the breakthrough these Fintech and insure tech firms in Europe are having. Insurance has been a desert for innovation and that is changing. And you can see that we\u2019re sort of trying to build a network around companies that have those breakthrough moments and provide not just capital but all the other things we think are part of the story. Building the company from A to C and D is the area that we try and roll our sleeves up and help these firms.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-08-02 21:10:34", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ventures", "title": "Element Ventures \u6295\u8d44 1.3 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u500d\u5173\u6ce8\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d8b\u52bf", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tElement Ventures pulls in $130M to double-down on the FinTech enterprise trend\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/element-ventures-pulls-in-130m-to-double-down-on-the-fintech-enterprise-trend/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ventures"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c3a946a44957c943c869eece6e8e0587.jpg", "infoid": 1071160, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Yes \u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u517c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98 Julie Bornstein \u5e2e\u52a9\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u548c\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u54c1\u724c\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u884c\u4e1a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u4e1a\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd8\u62c5\u4efb\u8fc7 Stitch Fix \u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u8fd0\u8425\u5b98\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u6570\u5b57\u4f18\u5148\u65f6\u5c1a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u6848\u4f8b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cThe Yes \u662f\u5979\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u6d89\u8db3\u521b\u4e1a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0e Julie \u8c08\u8bba\u5979\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7684\u6240\u6709\u7ecf\u5386\u3002\u5728\u672c\u5468\u7684 Found \u8282\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6bcf\u5468\u91c7\u8bbf\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ece Julie \u90a3\u91cc\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5979\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a The Yes \u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5979\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u65f6\u5c1a\u54c1\u724c\u5982\u4f55\u9500\u552e\u5176\u5546\u54c1\u548c\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u957f\u671f\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u9500\u552e\u6e20\u9053\u3002\u6731\u8389\u8fd8\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48 The Yes \u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5979\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u8d70\u51fa\u53bb\u5e76\u5f97\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u559c\u6b22\u4e0e\u6731\u8389\u804a\u5929\u7684\u65f6\u5149\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u4f60\u559c\u6b22\u542c\u8fd9\u4e00\u96c6\u7684\u65f6\u5149\u3002\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba2\u9605 Found in Apple Podcasts\u3001Spotify\u3001Google Podcasts \u6216\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u3002\u8bf7\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u7559\u4e0b\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7 Twitter \u6216\u53d1\u9001\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u81f3 found@techcrunch.com \u5411\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7ed9\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u8bed\u97f3\u90ae\u4ef6\uff08510\uff09936-1618\u3002\u8bf7\u4e0b\u5468\u518d\u6b21\u52a0\u5165\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4f4d\u7279\u8272\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002", "note_en": "The Yes founder and CEO Julie Bornstein helped some of the world\u2019s biggest and best-loved brands develop industry leading e-commerce operations, and also served as COO at Stitch Fix, arguable one of the top success stories of digital-first fashion. The Yes is her first foray into entrepreneurship, however, and we got the chance to talk to Julie all about her experience as a founder.\n On this week\u2019s episode of Found, our weekly interview podcast, we hear from Julie all about how she identified the gap The Yes was created to address, and how she changed some of the longtime fundamentals about how fashion brands sell their wares and work with customer sales channels. Julie also tells us about why The Yes knew it needed a larger-than-average seed to accomplish its goals, and how she went out and got it.\n  We loved our time chatting with Julie, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode.

A.\n   Mariano Mayer, former national secretary for entrepreneurs and SMEs in Argentina and founder of Marea Venture Partners;\n Sacha Spitz, co-founder and partner of Yavu Ventures and former director at the Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s incubation program;\n The group has already invested in startups in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, including Aleph (B2B SaaS for e-commerce), Apperto (social commerce), Choiz (healthtech), Exactly (DeFi), Elevva (e-commerce brands), Inipay (fintech), Leef (sustainability), Wibson (e-privacy) and Yerbo (wellness).\n Mayer told TechCrunch that he sees a great moment happening in Latin America around global venture capital firms \u2014 like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and  SoftBank \u2014making bets in the region, especially targeting later-stage investments. There are home-grown venture capital firms doing well, too, citing  Kazek\u2019s $1 billion funds.\n  \u201cHowever, we see a gap in investments in seed and road to Series A,\u201d he added. \u201cWe aim to help entrepreneurs in those stages. Newtopia started with conversations during the pandemic, and now we see a big momentum for transformation of traditional sectors and the talent to make businesses out of these opportunities.\u201d\n Newtopia is offering both investment and a hands-on mentorship model to guide startups through the initial stages so they can grow regionally or globally. The fund has already amassed a community of more than 70 founders to invest, advise and be venture partners to the portfolio companies.\n The Newtopia 10-Week Program works with companies to find product-market fit, achieve initial goals and set a foundation for further growth. The firm opened the call for applicants and will select 10 startups to receive a spot in the program and $100,000 each.\n By taking a lead in early-stage investing, it will feed the rest of the venture capital firms that are doing later-stage investing, Mayer said.\n He sees investments growing in Latin America every year, estimating there was a record $4 billion spread across the region, turning some companies into unicorns, including Jutard\u2019s Mural, which  raised $50 million in July. That has more than validated that there will be more money in coming years, Mayer added.\n Jutard said the fund\u2019s founders were all investing or mentoring companies on their own, but the new funding will enable them to structure that assistance to help hundreds of startups rather than a handful.\n \u201cEarly-stage companies go through an emotional rollercoaster where they feel alone, encounter times when it is hard to sell their product or recruit, so we are focused on building a community of support,\u201d Jutard added.", "posttime": "2021-08-02 21:09:44", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6295\u8d44,closes", "title": "Newtopia \u5b8c\u6210\u9996\u7b14 5000 \u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u57fa\u91d1\u6295\u8d44\u62c9\u4e01\u7f8e\u6d32\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tNewtopia closes first fund of $50M to invest in LatAm startups\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/newtopia-closes-first-fund-of-50m-to-invest-in-latam-startups/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6295\u8d44", "closes"]}]
