The rare but devastating infection can destroy the eyes and spread to the brain.\n Cases now top 31,000, rising from an estimate of dozens to a few hundred cases just last month. Media reports have tallied  over 2,100 deaths, but federal health authorities have not released an official death count.\n Past medical reviews have estimated that the fungal infection\u2014mucormycosis\u2014has an overall fatality rate of around 50 percent. However, mortality rates vary by patients\u2019 underlying condition and what part of the body the mucormycetes fungi invade. Infection can take hold in the gastrointestinal tract, skin breaks, lungs, and the blood.\n In India, the fungi appear to be mainly taking root in the nose and sinuses, where they can spread to facial bones, eyes, and even the brain. Once an infection is established, it can quickly become aggressive and lead to tissue death. If it spreads to the eye, many patients end up permanently losing vision and, in some cases, need to have their eye entirely removed to keep the infection from spreading.\n    Mucormycetes are a ubiquitous group of molds, and they typically only strike immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes. The soil-lurking molds love acidic conditions, making patients with  diabetic ketoacidosis\u2014a complication in which the blood becomes acidic\u2014particularly vulnerable.\n Medical experts hypothesize that the current surge of mucormycosis in India is down to a confluence of factors related to the COVID-19 wave. Many of the cases are occurring in people who are recovering or have recently recovered from COVID-19. The combination of poor hygiene amid the health crisis, the country\u2019s large number of people with diabetes\u2014particularly uncontrolled diabetes\u2014and  an over-reliance on glucocorticoid steroids appear to be playing a role in the fungal epidemic. Steroid use can help treat COVID-19, but it can also tamp down immune responses and make people vulnerable to opportunistic infections, such as mucormycosis.\n An expert in fungal infections referred to the situation as \u201c triple whammy,\u201d as Ars reported previously.\n In recent days, media reports out of India have noted  children having their eyes surgically removed because of fungal infections, local governments  declaring epidemics, and  black-market sales of treatments for mucormycosis.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:06:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "A couple of organizations have popped up over the years to make the leap easier. For instance,  Patriot Boot Camp, which  I profiled back in 2018, works in the earliest days of the startup journey to help veteran founders learn the key skills of building a company and fundraising. Yet, there still remains a lack of networking and funding that particularly targeted this group of entrepreneurs.\n That\u2019s the opportunity that Emily McMahan and Sherman Williams, the two managing partners of  Academy Investor Network, saw when looking at their peers at the five U.S. service academies. The firm is targeting a final first fund of $50 million, and today announced the close of its anchor investor, insurance and financial services provider USAA, which will invest $2.5 million. Prior to USAA, the fund\u2019s first investor was  Scout Ventures, which focuses on frontier tech and  where McMahan is a venture partner.\n  McMahan graduated from West Point in 2001 right as the War on Terror began. I \u201cwent really straight into the action post 9/11,\u201d she said. From there, she pivoted into a startup targeting the federal market, before founding Capitol Post, which taught entrepreneurial skills to veterans and their spouses and also had a co-working space in northern Virginia  before folding into Bunker Labs in 2019.\n \u201cMy career has always been focused around community, working with entrepreneurs, and really kind of harnessing the energy of the veteran entrepreneur community,\u201d she said. She is based in DC, and also sits on the board of Patriot Boot Camp.\n  Meanwhile, Williams hails from the Naval Academy, graduating in 2003 before going on four deployments in the midst of the war in Iraq, which started just weeks before his graduation. He ultimately ended up at Chicago\u2019s Booth School, where he studied finance and pivoted his career into investment banking focused on M&amp;A. \u201cI knew I needed to learn a lot,\u201d he said. I \u201cstarted investing and advising startups while as a banker, and then made made the flip to work with Emily to start AIN Ventures.\u201d He\u2019s based in New York City.\n The firm\u2019s first foray into venture was building an investment syndicate composed of alums of the five service academies, which was launched in June 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve got astronauts, we\u2019ve got Navy SEALs,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cWe really think that we\u2019re very well positioned as a group, because we\u2019ve all lived it on active duty, and now we continue to see it and continue to serve.\u201d The syndicate has invested in a handful of deals since launching, including into  Polco, an online community engagement platform for local governments, and online identity service  ID.Me.\n \u201cThis is also where a lot of our service academy grads are excited to have a seat at that table and help these companies scale, connect, hire, all of those things,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cSo we\u2019re really excited to be on par with some of these other institutions \u2014 the Harvards, the Stanfords \u2014 who also have these types of syndicates.\u201c\n Williams said the goal with the syndicate was to work out the investment processes for the firm before turning toward a more traditional VC fund model. They kicked off fundraising in January.\n The new fund has a two-track thesis of investing in veterans across industries while also selecting startups building \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies that are useful to the private sector and governments. \u201cCivic technology, disaster tech \u2014 think FEMA \u2014 defense tech, obviously the military, intelligence agencies, and space tech. Things in and around climate that will affect constituents and governments,\u201d Williams said as examples where he sees the firm investing. \u201cWe want the company, when it achieves maturity, to achieve the majority of the revenue outside the government.\u201d\n The firm centers its investing around the stage right after product-market fit, although since the veterans pipeline can be a real gauntlet, Williams said the firm will selectively invest at the pre-seed stage there.\n The firm is also seeking to diversify the ranks of both venture capitalists and founders. McMahan said, \u201cI\u2019m a female, Sherman\u2019s an African American, you know, even in the military, we\u2019re sort of a unique team, and so we think we are also able to reach out to a much broader audience of underrepresented minorities, women, and groups, and we feel like we\u2019re pretty attractive in terms of that as a team.\u201c\n USAA\u2019s anchor investment is perhaps not surprising given the financial services company\u2019s focus on active service members and veterans.

But pulling off remote work in the Aloha state takes more than a plane ticket and a laptop.\n  The pandemic devastated the state\u2019s economy. According to the Hawaii Tourism Authority, visitor arrivals fell 97.6% between August 2019 and August the following year. Employment in the state\u2019s leisure and hospitality sector, which accounts for nearly one in five jobs, fell 53% between February and August 2020, according to the Pew Center.\n  Thanks in part to state initiatives\u2014including pre-arrival coronavirus testing for visitors and marketing campaigns wooing remote workers\u2014tourism is on the rebound. In April, visitors reached nearly 500,000, compared with roughly 4,500 in April 2020.\n  One program, called  Movers and Shakas (named after the friendly Y-shaped hand gesture with extended thumb and pinkie that means \u201chang loose\u201d), was launched in December with local business leaders. It offers free airfare to remote workers who commit to staying at least a month and participate in volunteer activities. The program\u2019s 50 spots attracted 90,000 applications. Applications for the second round will open this month.\n  As it is elsewhere, reliable Wi-Fi is the litmus test for many. Some areas of the Hawaiian islands, especially rural regions, lack robust broadband or cellular infrastructure. Tomasz Janczuk, a 45-year-old based in the Seattle area who owns and operates a software-development firm, chose the three Big Island hotels that he and his family lived in for a month based on Wi-Fi strength.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

ready for one more player as Facebook has entered the scene. Announced today, Facebook has launched its own podcasting service to compete against the other major players. It was only a matter of time before Facebook took notice of how popular podcasting has become and decided to jump in.\n In addition to podcasting, Facebook will also offer members access to a live audio service called \u201c Live Audio Rooms.\u201d Facebook originally announced these services back in  April 2021.\n   According to Facebook, anyone who\u2019s a member of Facebook can easily create a podcast in moments. However, the podcast service is only being rolled out to a select few currently. It will be made available to everyone else later during Summer 2021.\n The Live Audio Room is similar to that of  Clubhouse and  Twitter Spaces. I currently have the updated Facebook app on Android, and the Live Audio Room option was available to test. In the room, I had the ability to invite anyone to an audio-only session, or I could switch it to live video whenever I wanted. Or I could provide a link to my room, allowing anyone to join. So far I\u2019ve tested this with a handful of issues and outside of some of those people not liking Facebook, it worked without a hitch.\n You can schedule when you want the Live Audio Room session to start. These sessions can hold up to 50 speakers and unlimited listeners. You can also collect donations, which will show up during the Live Audio Room session. This will be handle when people are trying to raise donations for worthwhile events.\u00a0With Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces already out there, it will be interesting to see if people will end up utilizing Facebook\u2019s tools.\n  While this all sounds positive, there\u2019s also a downside to this: they may retain live audio after it is no longer available or deleted. This is to enforce its policies, which will be done both by human moderators and machine learning. I can understand this, especially if this is to help to solve crimes or other nasty things. At the same time, this is the sort of stuff that got Facebook into hot water, over and over. At the same time, I\u2019m not going to point the finger solely at Facebook as I\u2019m sure Twitter and Clubhouse, to name a few, have similar policies.\n  The podcasting and Live Audio Rooms are only available via  Apple iOS and  Google Android, at least for now.\n So there you have it, another option for both your podcasting and audio room gathers.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:58:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "facebook,\u64ad\u5ba2,\u63a8\u51fa,launches", "title": "Facebook\u63a8\u51fa\u64ad\u5ba2\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u97f3\u9891\u5ba4\u670d\u52a1 ", "title_en": "Facebook Launches Podcast and Live Audio Room Services", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theouterhaven.net/2021/06/facebook-launches-podcast-and-live-audio-room-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u64ad\u5ba2", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launches"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067220, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Git\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u4ee4\u4eba\u5bb3\u6015\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u72af\u9519\u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u5b81\u613f\u5220\u9664\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u514b\u9686\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u719f\u7ec3\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u3002\n \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u8be5\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6613\u4e8e\u201c\u4e22\u5931\u201d\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\n \u55ef\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u53bb\u4f60\u7684\u6570\u636e - \u800c\u662f\u6062\u590d\u5b83\u592a\u96be\u4e86\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60a8\u8981\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u5492\u8bed\u6765\u64a4\u6d88\u5b83\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u5728\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u6015\u72af\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u529f\u6548\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u63d0\u4f9bgit\u64a4\u6d88\uff0c\u90e8\u5206git-bancless of\u5de5\u5177\u5957\u4ef6\u3002\u636e\u6211\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eGit\u7684\u6700\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u64a4\u6d88\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u64a4\u6d88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cGit\u64a4\u6d88\u53ef\u4ee5\u64a4\u6d88\uff0c\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0eGit Rhallog\u64a4\u6d88\u3002\n \u6211\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7269\u54c1\u672b\u5c3e\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u6211\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u89e3\u51b3\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u65b0\u624bGit\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u81ea\u7531\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\n     Git\u64a4\u6d88\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230Git\uff1a\u53c2\u8003\u4ea4\u6613\u94a9\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u94a9\u5b50\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5206\u652f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f55\u5236\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u524d\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4ea4\u56fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5f15\u7528\u53ca\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u5230\u5176\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u6216\u5220\u9664\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u64a4\u6d88\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \n\u6211\u6700\u521d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86Git-Brancless\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u590d\u5236\u67d0\u79cdMercurial\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9bGit\u64a4\u6d88\u529f\u80fd\u3002 \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Git is a version control system with robust underlying principles, and yet, novice users are terrified of it. When they make a mistake, many would rather delete and re-clone the repository than try to fix it. Even proficient users can find wading through the reflog tedious.\n Why? How is it so easy to \u201close\u201d your data in a system that\u2019s supposed to never lose your data?\n Well, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s too easy to lose your data \u2014 but rather, that it\u2019s too difficult to recover it. For each operation you want to recover from, there\u2019s a different \u201cmagic\u201d incantation to undo it. All the data is still there in principle, but it\u2019s not accessible to many in practice.\n Here\u2019s my theory: novice and intermediate users would significantly improve their understanding and efficacy with Git if they weren\u2019t afraid of making mistakes.\n  To address this problem, I offer  git undo,  part of the git-branchless suite of tools. To my knowledge, this is the most capable undo tool currently available for Git. For example, it can undo bad merges and rebases with ease, and there are even some rare operations that  git undo can undo  which can\u2019t be undone with  git reflog.\n I\u2019ve presented demos below, and briefly discussed the implementation at the end of the article. My hope is that by making it easier to fix mistakes, novice Git users will be able to experiment more freely and learn more effectively.\n     git undo is made possible by a recent addition to Git: the  reference-transaction hook. This hook triggers whenever a change is made to a reference, such as a branch. By recording all reference moves, we can rebuild the state of the commit graph at any previous point in time. Then we accomplish the undo operation by restoring all references to their previous positions in time (possibly creating or deleting references in the process).\n I originally built  git-branchless in order to replicate a certain Mercurial workflow, but the data structures turn out to be flexible enough to give us a  git undo feature nearly for free.
