On another occasion, Dyba, making conversation with a possible hire, mentioned that she had a fondness for toffee — and the next day, toffee, beautifully wrapped, appeared in her office. Back then, the people she was hiring were hungry, they were eager. There were flowers. Carefully crafted thank-you notes. Those were things a recruiter might not expect but might occasionally enjoy. A recruiter felt wanted.</p><p>当时，人们非常渴望给她写简历，以至于有一次，一位年轻女子在LinkedIn上查看了迪巴的照片，然后在她位于麦迪逊大道的办公室外等着在她上班的路上拦截她。还有一次，迪巴在与一位可能的员工交谈时提到，她喜欢太妃糖——第二天，包装精美的太妃糖出现在她的办公室。当时，她雇佣的人都很饿，他们很渴望。那里有花。精心制作的感谢信。这些都是招聘人员可能没有预料到的，但偶尔也会喜欢的事情。一位招聘人员觉得自己很受欢迎。</p><p> But Dyba eventually struck out to work for herself, and then the world changed. A virus flourished, and office buildings emptied, with their tenants uploading their systems to the ether; the cloud filled and then it filled some more, and with that massive digital shift, Dyba found herself, a person who majored in psychology, who could be intimidated briefly by the “merge calls” function on her iPhone, working in a field so hot that it is sucking more and more people like her into its ever-expanding vortex: technology recruiting.</p><p>但迪巴最终开始为自己工作，然后世界发生了变化。病毒肆虐，办公楼空置，租户将系统上传到以太；随着这一巨大的数字转变，迪巴发现自己，一个主修心理学的人，可能会被iPhone上的“合并通话”功能短暂吓倒，她在一个如此热门的领域工作，以至于越来越多像她这样的人被吸引进不断扩大的漩涡：技术招聘。</p><p>  Recruiters working in technology these days do not receive candy, flowers or thank-yous. The recruiter is lucky if she can get someone on the phone — if she receives so much as an email in response. Technology workers need court no one: Along with microchips, toilet paper and Covid tests, tech workers will be recalled as one of the great, pressing shortages of this pandemic. Estimates of the unemployment rates for tech workers are about 1.7 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent in the general economy; for those with expertise in cybersecurity, it’s more like 0.2 percent. Tech employees today tire of the attention from recruiters, the friendly hellos on LinkedIn, the cold calls (which Dyba does not make). “They think we’re like used-car salesmen,” Dyba said of her quarry. To be a recruiter in tech is to be an in-demand commodity for those companies doing the hiring but to feel like something of a nuisance — like an essential gear that emits a loud, irritating noise.</p><p>如今，从事科技行业的招聘人员不会收到糖果、鲜花或感谢信。招聘人员很幸运，如果她能在电话里找到某人——如果她收到如此多的回复电子邮件。科技工作者不需要讨好任何人：除了微芯片、卫生纸和新冠病毒检测，科技工作者将被召回，成为这场大流行最严重、最紧迫的短缺之一。据估计，科技工作者的失业率约为1.7%，而一般经济的失业率约为4%；对于那些拥有网络安全专业知识的人来说，这个比例更接近0.2%。如今，科技员工厌倦了招聘人员的关注、LinkedIn上友好的问候、冷淡的电话（Dyba不打）。“他们认为我们就像二手车推销员，”迪巴谈到她的猎物时说。作为一名科技行业的招聘人员，对那些从事招聘工作的公司来说，是一种很受欢迎的商品，但却让人觉得自己有点讨厌——就像一个发出刺耳噪音的必备装备。</p><p>  In late January, Dyba, working on contract with a tech company on the West Coast, sent out a mass blast on LinkedIn, tailored to reach data analysts, which is to say free of the kind of friendly, conversational fillips she might otherwise include (“Your LinkedIn profile looks amazing” and “I hope this finds you well!”). Data analysts — really, they just want the data. “Hi [name],” Dyba wrote in the message. “We’re looking for a talented Data Analyst to analyze huge data sets, build predictive models, and help us drive growth. I thought you could be a great fit.” The job she posted listed its selling points — the business had 400 percent growth a year, the backing of a legendary venture capitalist, no limit to personal vacation days, full coverage of employee health-care premiums and the option to work remote or locally.</p><p>1月下旬，与西海岸一家科技公司签订合同的迪巴在LinkedIn上发布了一次大规模的爆炸，专门针对数据分析师，也就是说，她可能会提供一些友好、对话的信息（“你的LinkedIn档案看起来很棒”和“我希望你一切顺利！”）。数据分析师——真的，他们只是想要数据。“你好[姓名]，”迪巴在短信中写道。“我们正在寻找一位有才华的数据分析师来分析庞大的数据集，建立预测模型，并帮助我们推动增长。我认为你可能是一个非常合适的人选。”她发布的这份工作列出了它的卖点——该业务每年有400%的增长，有一位传奇的风险投资家的支持，个人假期不受限制，员工医疗保险的全面覆盖，以及远程或本地工作的选择。</p><p> Dyba estimates that she sent the listing to about 75 prospective hires and received back maybe five responses, three of which were either a brief “no thanks” or the simple declination of her InMail message. A declination — that’s LinkedIn language for “Please, stop throwing all these jobs at me with employer-paid health-insurance premiums and unlimited vacation time.”</p><p>Dyba估计，她将名单发送给了大约75名潜在员工，并收到了可能五封回复，其中三封要么是简短的“不感谢”，要么是她的InMail信息的简单偏离。一种衰退——这是LinkedIn的语言，意思是“请不要把这些工作都丢给我，雇主支付的医疗保险费和无限的假期。”</p><p> Recruiters are in such demand that they, too, are scarce, which means their fees have never been higher. In-house tech-recruiter salaries are up about 30 percent, estimates Daniel Wert, who works at a boutique executive-search firm in the design community. Organizations looking for help in cloud and cybersecurity positions have increased fees they are offering to recruiting services to as high as 45 percent of the first year’s salary, says Ryan Sutton, a district president in charge of technology recruiting for the staffing firm Robert Half. Dyba says she has more work than she has had since she started freelance-recruiting in 2018.</p><p>招聘人员的需求如此之大，以至于他们也非常稀缺，这意味着他们的费用从未如此之高。丹尼尔·韦特（Daniel Wert）在设计界一家精品高管猎头公司工作，他估计，公司内部技术招聘人员的工资上涨了约30%。人力资源公司Robert Half负责技术招聘的地区总裁瑞安·萨顿（Ryan Sutton）表示，在云计算和网络安全领域寻求帮助的组织已经将提供招聘服务的费用提高到了第一年工资的45%。迪巴说，自2018年开始招收自由职业者以来，她有更多的工作要做。</p><p> Dyba’s challenges — most tech recruiters’ challenges — go beyond simply finding humans. As the people talking to potential hires, recruiters have a big-picture view of just how quickly the market is currently moving, something they need to translate to hiring managers without giving the impression they’re doing a hard sell. Dyba recently wrote to an executive who was hesitating to make an offer on a hire who was slipping away, texting a kind of recruiter haiku:</p><p>Dyba的挑战——大多数科技招聘人员的挑战——不仅仅是寻找人类。当人们与潜在的招聘人员交谈时，招聘人员对市场目前的发展速度有一个整体的看法，他们需要向招聘经理传达这一点，而不会给人留下他们正在进行硬推销的印象。迪巴最近写信给一位高管，这位高管对一位即将离职的员工的出价犹豫不决，他发短信给一位招聘人员俳句：</p><p>  Recruiters are often in the position of breaking the bad news that a desired candidate has flat-out rejected an offer, often to executives used to having the upper hand in the market or to founders convinced their business is more innovative than Apple and with better snacks than Facebook.</p><p>招聘人员往往会爆出一个坏消息，即一位理想的应聘者已经断然拒绝了一份工作，通常是对那些习惯于在市场上占上风的高管，或是对那些相信自己的业务比苹果更具创新性、比脸书有更好零食的创始人。</p><p>  Jana Rich, founder and chief executive of Rich Talent Group, a firm that primarily recruits executives to companies in the tech and consumer industries, says that even at the highest levels of hiring, she has never seen a market like this in 30 years. It falls on her, sometimes, to have what she calls “the truth talk” with a chief executive or board member: to break the news that qualified candidates have multiple — or sometimes preferable — opportunities. Now, she gently explains, an employer might have to think about taking a leap of faith on someone very talented but slightly less experienced. It doesn’t always go well. Following a recent truth talk, she said, the company put the search on pause, making it clear that “basically, ‘We, the company, don’t necessarily believe you,’” she said. “Like, ‘We think we can do better.’”</p><p>Rich Talent Group是一家主要为科技和消费行业的公司招聘高管的公司，其创始人兼首席执行官贾娜·里奇（Jana Rich）表示，即使是在最高级别的招聘中，她30年来从未见过这样的市场。有时，她需要与首席执行官或董事会成员进行她所说的“真相对话”：告诉他们，合格的候选人有多个——有时更好——的机会。现在，她温和地解释说，雇主可能不得不考虑对一个非常有才华但经验稍逊的人进行一次信心的飞跃。事情并不总是顺利的。她说，在最近的一次真相谈话之后，该公司暂停了搜索，明确表示“基本上，‘我们公司不一定相信你’，”她说。“比如，‘我们认为我们可以做得更好。’”</p><p>  ‘I don’t stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat.’</p><p>“在我有屁股坐在座位上之前，我不会停止面试。”</p><p> Pent-up demand after those early pandemic months when no one was hiring is part of the problem, Rich says. And a general feeling of pandemic malaise can help explain the shortage of potential hires — every so often, she reaches out to someone with a top-level job, only to hear, as she put it, “I don’t know if I have the energy in the tank.”</p><p>里奇说，在大流行初期的几个月里，没有人在招聘，压抑的需求是问题的一部分。普遍的大流行不适感有助于解释潜在员工短缺的原因——有时，她会联系一个有着顶级工作的人，但正如她所说，“我不知道我是否有足够的精力。”</p><p> Highly skilled tech workers, for the most part, are not leaving the workplace — the money right now is simply too good (salaries have risen in some cities by as much as 10 percent). They are, however, leaving the workspace, in droves, to work remotely, which is another aspect of the new world of work that recruiters need to communicate to founders and chief executives, some of whom are intent on getting the office back to what it once was.</p><p>在大多数情况下，高技能的技术工人并没有离开工作场所——现在的工资实在太高了（一些城市的工资上涨了10%）。然而，他们正成群结队地离开工作区，远程工作，这是招聘人员需要与创始人和首席执行官沟通的新工作领域的另一个方面，其中一些人打算让办公室回到从前的样子。</p><p> “If you are not going to offer remote work, if you’re not going to offer at least hybrid, we can’t help you,” Sutton says he tells clients trying to hire software designers. Tatiana Becker, the founder of NIAH Recruiting, was called in to help another recruiter from a different firm, who had already contacted every local potential candidate to fill a chief-of-staff position at an online retailer that hoped to have its employees in the office full time. After Becker told her colleague that the employer was going to have to drop one of the three requirements to fill the position — ideally, the one that called for regular on-site work in New York — the client wrote her a snippy email making it clear that Becker’s help was no longer wanted: “Unfortunately the recommendation you made to drop one or two of our requirements,” the client wrote, “was frankly completely inappropriate.”</p><p>萨顿说：“如果你不打算提供远程工作，如果你至少不打算提供混合动力，我们帮不了你。”他告诉试图雇佣软件设计师的客户。NIAH招聘公司的创始人塔蒂亚娜·贝克尔（Tatiana Becker）被请来帮助另一家公司的招聘人员，该公司已经联系了当地每一位潜在候选人，以填补一家在线零售商的办公室主任职位，该零售商希望让员工全职在办公室工作。贝克尔告诉同事，雇主必须放弃三项要求中的一项才能填补这个职位——理想情况下，其中一个要求在纽约定期进行现场工作——客户给她写了一封冷嘲热讽的电子邮件，明确表示不再需要贝克尔的帮助：“不幸的是，你提出的取消一两项我们要求的建议，”客户写道，“坦白说是完全不合适的。”</p><p> When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company’s insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she’d found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. “I had to kind of say, ‘Listen, it’s costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,’” she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive; slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote. The market rather than Dyba changed the company’s workplace culture — a market of empowered technology workers who could pick and choose their employers, who could take or leave any job they wanted and were forcing a shift.</p><p>在一个不被称为技术中心的城市与一名雇主共事时，迪巴觉得她必须在公司对现场工人的坚持下小心地削减开支；其中一个职位空缺了六个月。迪巴开始向招聘经理展示她找到的人的资历，但忽略了一个关键细节。如果雇主感兴趣，那么直到那时，她才透露人才来自佛罗里达或波士顿。她说：“我不得不说，‘听着，我们现在要想保住这份工作，比你给别人送一台笔记本电脑，并以不同的方式指导你的领导团队如何进行远程管理，要花更多的钱，’”。她认为招聘经理向首席执行官提出了这个问题；慢慢地，一个有决策权的人出现了，迪巴开始填补空缺。当大流行消退，当地工人回到办公室时，该办公室15%至20%的劳动力将处于偏远状态。市场而非Dyba改变了该公司的工作场所文化——一个由赋权的技术工人组成的市场，他们可以选择雇主，可以接受或离开任何他们想要的工作，并迫使他们做出改变。</p><p> Dyba hit a low back in October, when after working for months to land a signed offer for a qualified candidate for one company, she then lost that hire when the candidate’s current employer swooped in with a generous, last-minute retention bonus. She had a signed offer! That had never happened to her before. Now she counts on nothing: “I don’t stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat — like I am aggressively still looking for candidates even after we have a signed offer.”</p><p>去年10月，迪巴遭遇了低谷，在为一家公司的一名合格候选人工作数月后，她失去了这份工作，当时该候选人的现任雇主突然提供了一笔慷慨的、最后一刻的留任奖金。她有一个签名的提议！这在她身上从未发生过。现在她什么都不指望了：“在我有机会之前，我不会停止面试——就好像在我们签了合同之后，我还在积极地寻找候选人一样。”</p><p>  Workplaces also keep shifting unpredictably in ways that wreak havoc on the hiring process. A business doesn’t have a vaccine requirement, then it does. Employees are told they can work remotely and then the employer starts floating the idea that everyone will need to come back. Between constantly changing conditions and the number of counteroffers that job candidates receive, Sutton says, around four in five of the deals his recruiters try to seal end up requiring last-minute finessing on some major point; that happened only about 30 percent of the time before the pandemic, he estimates.</p><p>工作场所也在以不可预测的方式不断变化，对招聘过程造成严重破坏。一个企业没有疫苗需求，那么它就有了。员工被告知他们可以远程工作，然后雇主开始提出每个人都需要回来的想法。萨顿说，在不断变化的条件和求职者收到的还盘数量之间，他的招聘人员试图达成的交易中，约有五分之四最终需要在最后一刻对一些重要问题进行微调；他估计，在大流行之前，这种情况只发生了大约30%。</p><p> By late January, Dyba had been trying for several months, with mounting frustration, to find someone for a senior position for a high-growth start-up whose executive team insisted that the position be filled by someone willing to work at least part time on-site in New York. The calculation, when chief executives still make it, has become an interesting leap of faith. It reflects a belief that having a team on the ground, regularly working together, sharing the air and locking eyes across a conference table, will yield greater success than handpicking the most talented, experienced team a recruiter could possibly source from all 50 states and having them forge some new kind of work environment from their respective remote locales.</p><p>到1月底，Dyba已经在几个月的时间里，怀着越来越大的挫败感，试图为一家高速发展的初创公司找到一名高级职位的人选，该公司的执行团队坚持要求该职位由愿意至少在纽约兼职的人来填补。当首席执行官们仍能做到这一点时，这种计算已经成为一种有趣的信念飞跃。它反映了一种信念，即有一个团队在地面上，定期一起工作，共享空气，在会议桌上目不转睛地盯着对方，将比手工挑选最有才华的人取得更大的成功，经验丰富的团队一名招聘人员可能会从所有50个州招聘，并让他们从各自的偏远地区打造某种新的工作环境。</p><p> All day long, Dyba sent out feelers, and all day she got back messages on LinkedIn, variations on the same thing: “Is there any chance that this position could be 100 percent remote?” one woman asked. “If not, I would not be interested in hearing more about the role.” Dyba visited the start-up’s New York office, which was, predictably, filled with great light and had Kombucha on tap. It was vast, the lease signed during the pandemic. It was also basically empty. Dyba had to wonder in what numbers even current employees would eventually return to on-site work.</p><p>一整天，迪巴都在发出触角，一整天她都在LinkedIn上收到了同样的信息：“这个职位有可能是100%远程的吗？”一位女士问道。“如果不是，我就不想听到更多关于这个角色的信息。”迪巴参观了这家初创公司在纽约的办公室，不出所料，那里光线充足，康普茶随时可用。它很大，租约是在大流行期间签订的。它基本上也是空的。迪巴不得不想知道，即使是现在的员工，最终会有多少人回到现场工作。</p><p> At least that other client, the tech employer on the West Coast seeking a data analyst, was willing to let whoever filled that position work entirely remotely. In late January, around 5:30 p.m., Dyba got on a screening call with a potential candidate. By then, she had reached the stage of day when her hair was up in a messy bun held with a pen. She was working in her bedroom, in green thermal pants and a Henley — it was not a big Zoom day — and her ancient Corgi was snoozing by her side. The day had been nonstop, and she hadn’t paused to drink any water, which she was now compensating for by chugging from a bottle while the candidate spoke.</p><p>至少，另一位客户，西海岸的一位技术雇主，正在寻找一名数据分析师，愿意让填补该职位的人完全远程工作。1月底，大约下午5:30，迪巴接到了一个潜在候选人的筛选电话。到那时，她已经到了一天的阶段，她的头发被一支笔扎成了一个凌乱的发髻。她在卧室里工作，穿着绿色保暖裤和亨利（Henley）——这不是一个大变焦的日子——她那古老的柯基犬在她身边打盹。这一天一直没有停下来，她没有停下来喝水，现在她在候选人讲话时从瓶子里咕噜咕噜咕噜地喝着水来弥补。</p><p> “If you wouldn’t mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you’ve been doing,” she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because — unlike so many tech recruits — he didn’t start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was. He spoke about his background but also seemed to have researched the business itself. The nature of work has changed so much that sometimes, she knows, the recruits don’t care: Their top priority is remote work; and if they are going to be doing data analytics at home, a basic disconnect from the larger business can easily set in. (Another recruiter said that when she sends out mass blasts, she often gets back emails that say only three words: “Rate? Remote? Client?”)</p><p>她说：“如果你不介意跟我谈谈你的背景，我很想多听听你和你一直在做什么。”。电话另一端的那个年轻人很可爱，彬彬有礼，拥有商业分析理学硕士学位。迪巴立刻被迷住了，这仅仅是因为——与许多科技新兵不同——他没有在开始谈话的前六分钟内询问报酬是多少。他谈到了自己的背景，但似乎也研究了业务本身。工作的性质已经发生了巨大的变化，她知道，有时候新兵并不在乎：他们的首要任务是远程工作；如果他们打算在家里进行数据分析，那么与大型企业的基本脱节就很容易发生。（另一位招聘人员说，当她发出大规模爆炸时，她经常收到只写三个字的电子邮件：“速率？远程？客户？”）</p><p> Dyba recognized that there were details on the young man’s résumé that the employer might consider less than reassuring — like the fact that his last job had the word “intern” in it. “My fear is that they’ll say he doesn’t have the experience,” she said of the tech firm. But still, he impressed her with his obvious intelligence, his sophisticated response to a question about machine learning. She would fight for him and suggest, “If you’re willing to take a chance and help someone start his career, I think it would be a great move.” Maybe they would listen, she thought. Maybe.</p><p>迪巴认识到，年轻人的简历中有一些细节，雇主可能会觉得不放心，就像他上一份工作中有“实习生”这个词。“我担心的是，他们会说他没有经验，”她谈到这家科技公司时说。不过，他显然很聪明，对一个关于机器学习的问题做出了老练的回答，给她留下了深刻的印象。她会为他奋斗，并建议：“如果你愿意抓住机会帮助某人开始职业生涯，我认为这将是一个伟大的举动。”也许他们会听，她想。大概</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/companies/">#companies</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
