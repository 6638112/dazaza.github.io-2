Philately is the study of postage stamps, and it’s a tragically underappreciated field of study. A stamp can give you a perfect snapshot of the past on a single square inch of paper. Carlson finds his stamps where every person with an obscure hobby does: eBay. One day he found this really odd looking stamp. “it’s a very cumbersome looking red bird in the middle […] with a yellow background,” describes Carlson.</p><p>当埃里克卡尔森退休时，他潜入了一个古老的爱好......集体。集邮是邮票的研究，它是一个悲惨的被低估的研究领域。邮票可以在单平方英寸的纸上给你一个完美的过去的快照。卡尔森找到了他的邮票，其中每个人都有一个模糊的爱好，做了：eBay。有一天，他发现这个非常奇怪的邮票。 “在中间有一个非常笨重的红鸟，用黄色背景，描述卡尔森。</p><p>  Because stamps are usually issued by countries or postal authorities, they have clean, printed lines and tidy, professionally made images, but not this one. This stamp was kind of rough looking. The lettering was hand-drawn and the bird in the center was beautiful, but also a bit inelegant. He also didn’t recognize the letters across the top. G-B-L-A. “At first I thought it was an acronym for some nation that had escaped my attention,” recounts Carlson. But the GBLA wasn’t a nation, or a postal authority, or any type of government body. It stood for The Great Bitter Lake Association. He had stumbled upon the remnants of a forgotten bit of world history, about a stranded convoy that built a community at the center of a war.</p><p>  因为邮票通常由国家或邮政当局发布，所以他们有清洁，印刷的线条和整洁，专业制作的图像，但不是这个。这个邮票有点粗糙。刻字被手绘，中心的鸟是美丽的，但也有点居住。他也没有识别顶部的字母。 G-B-L-A。 “起初我以为是一些逃脱了我注意的国家是一件首字母缩写，”叙述卡尔森叙述。但GBLA不是一个国家，或邮政权力或任何类型的政府机构。它适合大苦湖协会。他偶然发现了一个遗忘的世界历史的残余，关于一个搁浅的车队，在战争的中心建立了一个社区。</p><p>  When Peter Flack was 16 years old, he started a long career in the Merchant Navy working on commercial cargo ships. In the mid-1960s Flack was assigned on trade routes that took him from the UK to Asia, traveling mainly through the  Suez Canal. The Suez Canal is one of the busiest and most important shipping routes in the world. It runs vertically between Egypt and the rest of the Middle East, connecting the Mediterranian to the Red Sea. Before the canal opened, fleets traveling from Asian countries to Europe had to sail an extra 4,300 miles all the way around the Cape of Good Hope.</p><p>  当Peter Flack为16岁时，他在商业货船工作的商人海军上开始了长期职业生涯。在20世纪60年代中期，Flack被分配在贸易路线上，从英国带到亚洲，主要通过Suez Canal旅行。 Suez Canal是世界上最繁忙，最重要的航线之一。它在埃及和中东其他地区之间垂直运行，将地中海连接到红海。在运河开放之前，从亚洲国家到欧洲的舰队不得不在良好的希望之中一直乘坐4,300英里。</p><p>  But while Flack’s ship was busy delivering commercial goods from Singapore to the UK,  tensions were escalating all around the canal. There had been border disputes and skirmishes for decades between Israel and its neighboring countries: Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. But on June 5th, 1967, things reached a breaking point. And the  Six-Day War began. Unfortunately for Peter Flack, he and his ship, the Agapenor, were on their way home via the Suez Canal, which was at the heart of the conflict.</p><p>  但是，虽然Flach的船忙于将新加坡送到英国的商业用品，但紧张局势在运河周围升级。以色列及其邻国之间几十年的边界纠纷和小冲突：埃及，约旦和叙利亚。但是，1967年6月5日，事情达到了突破点。六天的战争开始了。不幸的是，对于彼得·弗拉克，他和他的船只是劫持者，乘坐苏伊士运河在回家的路上，这是在冲突的核心。</p><p>  It was common for ships from different countries to pass through in a convoy together because it was easier to control traffic that way. The Agapenor was one of 14 cargo ships and two tankers grouped together. Not long into the journey, the convoy entered a section of the Suez called the Great Bitter Lake, a 100-square-mile body of salt water in the canal. Normally, a ship like the Agapenor would anchor in the Great Bitter Lake for a few hours while the flow of traffic was directed. This time, however, the ship wouldn’t be staying a few hours— it would be stuck there for years.</p><p>  对于不同国家的船只共同传递在车队中，因为它更容易控制交通方式。棘手是14艘货船之一，两艘船只组合在一起。不久的旅程，车队进入了苏伊士的一部分，称为大苦湖，在运河中是一个100平方英里的盐水。通常情况下，像棘手的船舶将在伟大的苦湖中锚定几个小时，而交通流量是针对的。然而，这一次，这艘船不会留下几个小时 - 多年来会卡住。</p><p>  It was early in the morning, and Flack had just taken up his post on the bridge of the ship when he received some unsettling news from his captain. Israel had just declared war on what was then known as the United Arab Republic, and they were traveling through a potential conflict zone. It wasn’t long before Flack saw warplanes cutting through the quiet morning fast and low from the east, directly over their heads.</p><p>  这是早上的早期，当他收到船长的一些令人不安的消息时，弗拉米刚刚在船的桥上接受了他的帖子。以色列刚刚宣布对被称为阿拉伯共和国的战争，他们正在通过潜在的冲突区域旅行。在弗拉基看到战机上，直接在他们的头上，它不久。</p><p>  Around 200 Israeli fighter pilots used the low position of the rising sun, and the convoy of ships, to mask a surprise blitz on Egypt. The planes were heading westward over the Suez Canal and straight for an Egyptian airbase near the convoy’s position. Flack and the rest of the crew suddenly had front row seats to the first wave of the Six-Day War. The convoy of ships watched from their anchored positions as Israeli jets unleashed gunfire and missiles on grounded Egyptian planes.</p><p>  大约200名以色列战斗机飞行员使用了冉冉升起的太阳的低位置，以及船舶的车队，以掩盖埃及的惊喜闪电。飞机在苏伊士运河上向西，并直接在靠近车队的位置附近的埃及空中级。弗拉米尔和剩下的船员突然有前排座位到六天战争的第一波。船舶的车队从他们的锚定职位看，因为以色列喷气机释放出埃及飞机上的枪声和导弹。 </p><p>  Amazingly, no one in the convoy was hurt, but the Egyptian air force had been pretty much destroyed. Normally the Suez Canal runs entirely through Egyptian territory with the Sinai Peninsula on its east. After the attack, however, Israel pushed Egyptian forces completely out of the Sinai Peninsula. This turned the Suez Canal into a vertical ceasefire line that placed Egyptian forces on the west side of the Great Bitter Lake, and Israeli forces on the east. The convoy was sandwiched between two warring armies.</p><p>令人惊讶的是，车队中没有人受伤，但埃及的空军几乎被摧毁了。通常，苏伊士运河完全通过埃及领土与东部的西奈半岛。然而，袭击后，以色列将埃及军队完全推出西奈半岛。这将Suez Canal转变为垂直停火线，将埃及力量放在大苦湖的西侧，以色列部队在东方。该车队在两个交战军队之间夹在一起。</p><p> Cath Senker is the author of   Stranded in the Six-Day War, and she says that the convoy was ordered over the radio to anchor where they were and wait for further instructions. The convoy was made up of commercial ships and had no choice but to comply with Egyptian authorities. A ceasefire was reached in less than a week, but the diplomatic conflict dragged on. Egypt ordered a complete standstill of the Suez Canal. “It was a defensive mechanism,” explains Senker, “Firstly they did not want Israel to have access to the canal […] and that way nobody could use it and no hostile power could get in there.”</p><p> Cath Senker是在六天战争中搁浅的作者，她说，该车队在收音机上订购，以锚定他们等待进一步指示。车队由商业船舶组成，别无选择，只能遵守埃及当局。在不到一周的时间内达到停火，但外交冲突拖累。埃及订购了Suez Canal的完整停滞。 “这是一种防守机制，”参赛者解释说：“首先，他们不希望以色列可以进入运河[...]，那不可能使用它，没有敌对的力量可以进入那里。”</p><p>  Even if the 14 trapped ships wanted to leave against orders, they physically couldn’t. The Egyptian government figured the best way to prevent Israel from using the canal was to block it entirely, so a few days after the conflict started, they dumped debris, scuttled old ships, and threw in landmines to make the canal impassable. The ships were completely trapped.</p><p>  即使14艘被困的船只想要留下订单，他们也不能留下。埃及政府讨论了防止以色列从使用运河的最佳方式是完全阻止它，所以冲突开始后几天，他们倾倒了碎片，被摧毁的旧船，并扔在地雷上，使运河不可通过。船只被完全被困。</p><p>  The convoy of 14 ships came from 8 different nations: the UK, West Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, France, Bulgaria, and the United States. In the beginning, the crews weren’t told anything because there was a complete lockdown on information reaching the ships.  Despite the lack of communication, the shipping companies were working in the background to get their crews home, while the United Nations tried to work out a deal to reopen the canal. Months dragged on, and the boats still hadn’t been released. They were stranded for so long, the convoy earned the nickname the  Yellow Fleet because the sandstorms in the region stained the hulls of the ships.</p><p>  14艘船的车队来自8个不同的国家：英国，西德，波兰，捷克斯洛伐克，瑞典，法国，保加利亚和美国。一开始，船员没有被告知任何内容，因为有一个完整的锁定信息，信息到达船只。尽管缺乏沟通，但船公司正在在背景中工作以获得他们的船员回家，而联合国试图努力重新打开运河。拖累了几个月，船只仍未发布。他们被搁浅了这么久，车队赢得了黄色舰队的绰号，因为该地区的沙尘暴染了船只。</p><p> Flack handled the idle time well. He remembers they would play darts, swim, sing songs, and play cards to pass the time. A lot of men had a tough time handling the situation though. “There were others who didn’t accept it—biting at the bit. But I thought well this is our lot.” After three months a compromise was finally reached. There was no way Egypt would reopen the Suez Canal, but the people trapped on-board were released. Peter Flack and the rest of the stranded crew finally went home.</p><p> 皮克处理空闲时间。他记得他们会玩飞镖，游泳，唱歌和玩卡来通过时间。很多男人都有艰难的时间处理情况。 “还有其他人没有接受它咬人。但我认为这是我们的很多。“三个月后，终于达到了妥协。埃及没有办法重新打开苏伊士运河，但困境的人民被释放。彼得弗拉克和搁浅的船员的其余部分终于回家了。</p><p>   But the shipping companies didn’t want to completely abandon their vessels in the Suez Canal. It was possible the canal would open back up soon. Not to mention these were expensive ships, packed with valuable cargo. “The logical thing to do was to keep people there to protect the valuable cargo and the investment that they’d made in the ships,” says Senker. Every shipping company decided to recruit new crew members to keep the ships in working condition with the understanding they would set sail the moment the passage was finally cleared.</p><p>   但船舶公司不想在苏伊士运河中完全放弃船只。运河可能会很快打开。更不用说这些都是昂贵的船只，包装有价值的货物。 “逻辑要做的就是让人们在那里保护宝贵的货物和他们在船上制造的投资，”Senker说。每家航运公司决定招募新的机组人员，以保持工作条件的船舶，了解段落终于清除的那一刻。</p><p>  George Wharton was one of the members of that first relief crew. Wharton  says the work was like being on any other ship. There was a lot of cleaning, running the engines, and checking the cargo to make sure it kept fresh in the hot climate. But since they were in the middle of a lake, in the middle of a desert, in the middle of a war zone, Wharton says it was hard to get supplies. “We started to run out of stores. You weren’t going hungry or anything but here you were limited to the variety if you like,” says Wharton. But the crews realized that among the fourteen ships, they actually had plenty.</p><p>  乔治沃顿是第一次救济船员的成员之一。沃顿说这项工作就像在任何其他船上。有很多清洁，运行发动机，并检查货物，以确保它在炎热的气候中保持新鲜感。但由于他们在一个湖中间，在沙漠中间，在战争区中间，沃顿说很难得到供应。 “我们开始用完了商店。如果您愿意，您不会饿，除了这里，您只需在这里才能限于各种各样。“沃顿说。但是，船员意识到，在十四艘船中，他们实际上有很多。 </p><p> Soon, they started hanging out a lot, and because they were a bunch of young sailors, they started partying a lot. Some of the captains became worried that with the amount of idle time on the ships, people would start to get bored and acting badly. “There was of a lot of drinking, and […] hanging out, and sleeping and they were thinking it would be good to get together and organize some social activities,” explains Senker. The captains figured a little structure would curb the worst behavior of their sailors, so in October of 1967, five months after the start of the Six-Day War, they founded the Great Bitter Lake Association.</p><p>很快，他们开始闲逛很多，因为他们是一群年轻的水手，他们开始派对很多。一些船长担心担心船上的空闲时间，人们会开始感到无聊和表现得很糟糕。 “有很多饮酒，闲逛，睡觉，他们认为聚集在一起并组织一些社交活动是很好的，”Senker解释道。船长弄清楚一点结构会遏制他们的水手最严重的行为，所以在1967年10月，六天战争开始五个月后，他们创立了大苦湖协会。</p><p>  The Great Bitter Lake Association was a way to regulate the unofficial marketplace that had sprung up between the ships, and bring some order to their makeshift community. It was also a social committee. Membership in the GBLA included events hosted each week by a different vessel. Ships modified their lifeboats into sailboats and took turns hosting regattas. One ship built a functional soccer pitch on its deck and held tournaments. The Polish ship had a doctor and became the de facto medical center. The Swedish ship had a gym.</p><p>  大苦湖协会是一种规范船舶之间涌现的非官方市场的一种方式，并为其临时社区带来一些订单。它也是一个社会委员会。 GBLA的会员资格包括其他船只每周托管的活动。船舶将他们的救生艇修改为帆船，然后轮流托管序曲。一艘船舶在其甲板上建立了一个功能足球场，并举办了锦标赛。波兰船有一名医生，成为事实上的医疗中心。瑞典船有一个健身房。</p><p> But even though the Great Bitter Lake Association was originally formed to curb drinking, a lot of alcohol was still consumed in the Great Bitter Lake. One ship captain estimated that perhaps 1.5 million empty beer bottles may have been dumped into the lake, writing, “One wonders what future archaeologists in a few thousand years’ time will think of this.”</p><p> 但即使伟大的苦湖协会最初形成饮酒，仍然在大苦湖中消耗了很多酒。一艘船长估计，也许150万空啤酒瓶可能被倾倒到湖中，写作，“一个奇迹将在几千年的时间里想到这一点。”</p><p>  The association was about providing a sense of stability in an incredibly unstable place. They weren’t just individuals on a ship, but members of a society. They were actually given a specially designed tie and a badge. The badge itself was in the shape of a shield, with a large anchor across the center. At the top were the letters GBLA and at the bottom was the number 14 for the 14 ships in the lake. Running diagonally behind the anchor was a thin blue strip to represent the Suez Canal.</p><p>  该协会是关于在一个令人难以置信的不稳定位置提供稳定性的感觉。他们不仅仅是船上的个人，而是一个社会的成员。他们实际上是专门设计的领带和徽章。徽章本身是盾牌的形状，围绕中心的大锚。顶部是字母GBLA和底部是湖中14艘船的14号。沿着锚在锚上沿着薄的蓝色条带表示苏伊士运河。</p><p>   Towards the end of Wharton’s stint on the lake, the crews came together to celebrate their first big holiday as a group. Wharton fondly remembers, “The Polish seamen made this huge Christmas tree and mounted it on a raft and anchored it in the middle of all the ships. And on Christmas night all the boats were invited over to the tree. And we all tied off around the tree, and we had a carol service. One of the boats actually had an organ in it, you know a piano organ. And so we had music and some carols.”</p><p>   在沃顿在湖面的结束时，船员聚集在一起，庆祝他们作为一个团体的第一个大假期。沃顿温和的人记得，“波兰海员制作了这棵巨大的圣诞树，并将它安装在木筏上并在所有船舶中间锚定。在圣诞节，所有的船都邀请到树上。我们都束缚在树上，我们有一个卡罗尔服务。其中一个船实际上有一个器官，你知道钢琴器官。所以我们有音乐和一些颂歌。“</p><p>  Wharton happily returned home after the holidays to his wife and brand new daughter. He figured his time on the lake was a once in a lifetime experience, but to his surprise, a year later, the UN still hadn’t figured out a solution. The ships were still in the canal. And he was given a chance to go back. When he got back to the lake Wharton realized that not only was the association was still going, it was getting more creative. Between the brotherhood, the sports, and the official badges, the Great Bitter Lake Association started feeling like something bigger than just a club, but more like its own nation. “Therefore as a little nation they should have their own postage stamps,” says Senker.</p><p>  沃顿在假期到他的妻子和全新的女儿之后愉快地回到家。他在湖上识上了他的时间是一生的一生经历，但是在他的惊喜之后，一年后，联合国仍然没有想出解决方案。船只仍在运河。他有机会回去。当他回到沃顿湖的时候意识到不仅是协会仍然存在的时候，它就会得到更多的创造力。在兄弟会，运动和官方徽章之间，大苦湖协会开始感觉比俱乐部更大，但更像是自己的国家。 “因此，他们应该有自己的邮票，”Senker说。</p><p> Technically these stamps were  Cinderella stamps, which means they had no postal value and were made mostly for their own amusement, but some actually made it through as official postage. Each stamp was hand-drawn or painted using whatever materials they could find— for example, crayons, coffee, potato skins—and then copies were printed and distributed to all of the members of the GBLA to use.</p><p> 从技术上讲，这些邮票是灰姑娘邮票，这意味着它们没有邮政价值，主要是为了自己的娱乐，但有些实际上是作为官方邮资。每张邮票都是手绘或涂上他们可以找到的材料 - 例如，蜡笔，咖啡，马铃薯皮 - 然后打印并分发到GBLA的所有成员使用。 </p><p>  The stamps featured common motifs like birds to represent the seafarers’ longing for freedom. There were ships and anchors. The artwork on each stamp acted like a tiny time capsule of their experiences. They documented Christmases, anniversaries, soccer tournaments, even a Great Bitter Lake Olympics they held in honor of the 1968 Mexico City games.</p><p>邮票特征在于鸟类，以鸟类代表海员渴望自由。有船和锚。每个邮票上的艺术品就像他们经历的小时间胶囊一样。他们记录了圣诞节，周年纪念日，足球比赛，甚至是纪念1968年墨西哥城游戏的大苦湖奥运会。</p><p>  A deal was finally brokered in 1974 to reopen the Suez Canal, but by this point, the heyday of the GBLA was over. The American vessel, the African Glen, was hit by a stray missile during the 1973 Yom Kippur War and sank but thankfully, no one was killed. Throughout this whole time, the shipping companies kept sending skeleton crews out to look after the ships, which were slowly decaying. By 1974, most of them were no longer seaworthy.</p><p>  1974年，一笔交易终于经过重新打开苏伊士运河，但到目前为止，GBLA的鼎盛时期结束了。在1973年的Kippur战争期间，美国船只是非洲格伦，在1973年的一场比较战争期间受到了一场流浪的导弹，而且谢天谢地，没有人被杀。在整个时间内，船公司一直送骷髅船员，以照顾船舶，这慢慢腐烂。到1974年，大多数人不再是海上的。</p><p>  It took a full year to remove the 100 bridge sections, 20 trucks, 8 tanks, 100 vessels and 750,000 explosive devices thrown into the waters of the Suez. But in 1975, eight years after the start of the Six-Day War, the ships said their final goodbyes to the Great Bitter Lake. They even commemorated the moment with one last set of farewell stamps.</p><p>  删除了100座桥接部分，20辆卡车，8个罐，100艘船只和750,000个爆炸装置抛入苏伊士水域的爆炸装置。但是在1975年，六天战争开始后八年，船只表示，他们的最终再见到大苦湖。他们甚至纪念最后一套告别邮票的那一刻。</p><p>  Most of the ships in the Great Bitter Lake needed to be towed out of the canal. Only the  two West German vessels were capable of leaving under their own steam, and for the Germans, their patience paid off. They had been carrying raw materials like wool, steel, lead, and ore sand for making sandpaper, and these goods had actually increased in value. “It proved to be a thousand percent more profitable than it had originally been,” says Senker. Both ships had an epic welcome back in Hamburg. Around 30,000 cheering spectators came out to see them dock at their home port. “They did actually make a world record,” says Senker, “The two German ships were the Münsterland and the Nordwind, and it was the Munsterland that made the world record as the longest sea shipping voyage in history which was eight years, three months, and five days.</p><p>  大部分船只在大苦湖中需要拖出运河。只有两艘西德国船只能够在自己的蒸汽下留下，而德国人，他们的耐心才能偿还。他们一直携带羊毛，钢铁，铅和矿石的原材料，用于制作砂纸，这些商品实际上增加了价值。 “这被证明比最初是盈利更有利可图，”Senker说。两艘船舶在汉堡有一个史诗般的欢迎。大约30,000名欢呼的观众出来，看到他们在他们的家庭港口码头。 “他们确实创造了一个世界纪录，”塞克斯说：“这两艘德国船是米尔斯特兰和北欧，这是Munsterland，使世界纪录成为历史上最长的海运航行，八年，三个月，三个月和五天。</p><p>  From 1967 to 1975, over 3,000 men (and one woman actually) served on the Great Bitter Lake. In 2017 a fifty-year reunion was held in Liverpool, and members in Germany and Slovakia still meet up annually. It remains a quiet tradition fifty plus years later. The GBLA is mostly a footnote in the complicated history of the Six-Day War. But there are little pieces here and there that remind the rest of the world that this makeshift nation once existed. You can find them in a well-designed badge, a custom necktie, or in a stamp that you stumble across on eBay.</p><p>  从1967年到1975年，超过3,000名男子（和一个女人实际上）在伟大的苦湖上供应。 2017年，在利物浦举行了五十年的团聚，德国和斯洛伐克的成员每年都在举行。它仍然是一个安静的传统五十多年后。 GBLA主要是六天战争复杂历史的脚注。但这里有很少的作品，那里有这提醒世界其他地区，这是一个曾经存在的这个临时国家。您可以在精心设计的徽章，自定义领带中找到它们，或者在eBay上偶然的邮票。</p><p> From the Panama Canal coda: below is the flag of Panama proposed by Philippe Bunau-Varilla and the current flag which was designed by the first family of Panama.</p><p> 来自巴拿马运河CODA：以下是巴拿马国旗由Philippe Bunau-Varilla提出，目前由巴拿马家族设计的目前的国旗。</p><p>  By submitting this form, you acknowledge that you have read the  Terms of Use and  Privacy Policy, that you understand them, and that you agree to be bound by them.
