The news industry was rapidly contracting, eliminating countless journalism jobs. The social media giants seemed unstoppable, leaving fewer and fewer scraps for media businesses. Freelance budgets were being obliterated.</p><p>当我们在2017年中期开始重置时，作家的未来是可怕的。新闻行业正在迅速收缩，消除无数的新闻工作。社交媒体巨头似乎是不可阻挡的，留下较少，更少的媒体业务碎片。自由预算被抹杀。</p><p> None of the many attempts to reverse the damage had succeeded. Spotify for newspapers? Celebrity-driven crowdfunding campaigns? Journalism on the blockchain? Billions of dollars of venture capital proved powerless in the face of what seemed like inevitable doom – and every misstep of the way, writers were hurt.</p><p> 逆转损害的许多尝试都没有成功。 Spotify报纸？名人驱动的众筹竞选活动？在区块链上的新闻？数十亿美元的风险投资在面对似乎是不可避免的厄运 - 而且每一个缺点的方式都证明了无能为力的人，作家受到伤害。</p><p> Journalism itself was as strong as it had ever been, with more great writers serving more eager readers than at any time in history. You could publish a story and in a matter of minutes have a million readers. Getting paid was the hard part. The internet had changed the scope of possibility for journalism, but it had also broken its business model.</p><p> 新闻业本身就像曾经一样强大，更多的伟大作家比历史上的任何时候都有更加渴望的读者。你可以发布一个故事，并在几分钟内有一百万读者。获得报酬是努力部分。互联网改变了新闻的可能性，但它也破坏了它的商业模式。</p><p> From day one, we felt it was important for Substack to have a simple, transparent business model that worked. That might sound like an obvious thing to want, but it was atypical for tech startups, which had been inculcated with the previous generation of Silicon Valley wisdom that aggregating an audience was the primary concern and a business model could come later. That approach, propped up by a venture capital model designed to accommodate a multitude of failures, had given false hope to writers many times over, convincing them that an exciting future was waiting to be unlocked by just the right combination of zeroes and ones, only to ultimately leave them grasping at pixels.</p><p> 从第一天开始，我们觉得重置有一个工作的简单透明的商业模式很重要。这可能听起来像是一个很明显的东西，但它对于技术初创公司而言，它被融合在前一代硅谷智慧，这些智慧智慧聚集了观众是主要关注点，并且商业模式可以稍后来。这种方法，由旨在适应多种失败的风险投资模型，已经给予了虚假的希望，因为许多次，让他们说服他们令人兴奋的未来等待被零的合适组合解锁，只有最终将它们放在像素上。</p><p> As a Silicon Valley startup, we were hyper-aware of the skepticism that might come our way. We needed to show that the Substack model was trustworthy and reliable. We did this in part by making our success dependent on writers’ success: Substack is free for anyone to use, and we make money only when they do, by taking a 10 percent cut of subscription revenue. Writers retain total independence, with complete ownership of their mailing lists, intellectual property, and content.</p><p> 作为硅谷启动，我们是超意识到可能是我们的方式的怀疑论。我们需要表明家用模型是值得信赖和可靠的。我们通过依赖作家的成功取得成功：家庭使用的是免费的，我们只赚到10％的订阅收入时，我们只赚钱。作家保留完全独立性，完全拥有他们的邮件列表，知识产权和内容。</p><p> After seeing a string of early successes with the first publishers on the platform, we became increasingly excited by the realization that writers could go solo, do important work, and thrive from being paid by their happy readers. We felt like we had discovered a little secret and wanted to spread the good word as fast as possible. By the time we raised money from venture capitalists, we did so in the knowledge that we could use it not to keep afloat while we searched for viability, but to fuel the growth of something that was already working.</p><p> 在看到平台上的第一个出版商的一系列早期取得成功之后，我们越来越兴奋的是，作家可以独自，做重要的工作，并从他们幸福的读者支付来茁壮成长。我们觉得我们发现了一点秘密，并希望尽可能快地传播好词。当我们从风险投资家中提高了资金时，我们本来所知，我们可以使用它不会在我们寻找可行性的时候保持漂浮，而是为了燃料已经工作的东西的增长。</p><p> We started experimenting with advances, paying a small number of writers sums ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 to cover them for a few months as they got established on Substack. They paid back the money over time through a revenue-sharing agreement. We also introduced a fellowship program, where, over two cohorts, we offered writers coaching, business advice, and more cash advances.</p><p> 我们开始试验进步，支付少数作家总和，从10,000美元到30,000美元，以覆盖它们在成立时期的几个月内。他们通过收入分享协议随着时间的推移偿还金钱。我们还介绍了一项奖学金计划，在两位队列中，我们提供了作家教练，商业咨询和更多现金进展。 </p><p> The advances worked well. They helped writers start high-quality and profitable publications beloved by their readers. And they gave us confidence that we could invest even more deeply in writers in a way that would help both them and us.</p><p>进步良好。他们帮助作家开始由读者心爱的高质量和有利可图的出版物。他们确信我们的信心我们可以以一种帮助他们和我们的方式更深入地投资作家。</p><p> But the advances also had limitations. On a per-deal basis, we could never really do better than break-even. A Substack advance was effectively an interest-free loan that would never be paid back if a publication failed. At the same time, while the writer would have a good cash cushion for the first few months, they had to get through the payback period before their revenue really started flowing. So we came up with a new structure that allowed us to absorb more risk on the writer’s behalf, ensuring they’d get paid for a year of work no matter how their publication performed. We came to call this program Substack Pro.</p><p> 但是进步也有局限性。在每次交易的基础上，我们永远不会比休息更好。如果出版物失败，则重置升级有效地是从未偿还的无息贷款。与此同时，虽然作家对最初的几个月有一个很好的现金垫子，但在他们的收入真正开始流动之前，他们必须通过投资回收期。因此，我们提出了一种新的结构，使我们能够代表作家吸收更多风险，确保他们在一年的工作中获得报酬，无论他们的出版方式如何进行。我们来打电话给这个程序重置专业版。</p><p> With Substack Pro, we pay a writer an upfront sum to cover their first year on the platform. The idea is that the payment can be more attractive to a writer than a salary, so they don’t have to stay in a job (or take one) that’s less interesting to them than being independent. In return for that financial security, a Pro writer agrees to let Substack keep 85% of the subscription revenue in that first year. After that year, the deal flips, so that the writer no longer gets a minimum guarantee but from then on keeps 90% of the subscription revenue – which, if we’ve made our bet well, will be a larger overall dollar amount. We like this structure because, while some who get these deals are already well off, it gives financially constrained writers the ability to start building a sustainable enterprise. We take most of the risk for them. In return, their work contributes to the quality of the Substack ecosystem and they become long-term customers.</p><p> 使用Supplack Pro，我们支付一个作家提前款项，以覆盖他们在平台上的第一年。这个想法是，支付对作家比工资更具吸引力，所以他们不必留在工作（或拿一个）对他们不仅仅是独立的工作。作为该财务安全的回报，专业人员同意放置第一年的85％的订阅收入。在那年之后，交易翻转，让作者不再获得最低保证，但从那时，就可以保留90％的订阅收入 - 如果我们已经赚了很好的赌注，那么将较大的总额更大。我们喜欢这种结构，因为有些人获得这些交易已经很好，但它给予财务限制作家，可以开始建立可持续企业的能力。我们为他们带来大部分风险。作为回报，他们的作品有助于封锁生态系统的质量，他们成为长期客户。</p><p> It’s also important that the economics of these deals work out for Substack. We don’t have to make money on every one, but we certainly shoot for that. If the program were financially unsustainable, doing these deals would do more harm than good, since not only would it compromise writers’ careers but we’d also be burning their trust.</p><p> 这些交易的经济学也很重要，旨在为食物而锻炼身体。我们不必在每个人上赚钱，但我们肯定会为此拍摄。如果该计划在经济上是不可持续的，那么这些交易会做得更好的弊大于，因为它不仅会妥协作者的职业，但我们也会燃烧他们的信任。</p><p> We see these deals as business decisions, not editorial ones. We don’t commission or edit stories. We don’t hire writers, or manage them. The writers, not Substack, are the owners. No-one writes  for Substack – they write for their own publications. We cannot contact their readers without explicit permission, and we make no attempt to influence their content, other than requiring that they adhere to the  content guidelines that apply to all writers on Substack (read  our stance on content moderation for more). The only thing we ask for in return is a commitment to a minimum publishing frequency so we know they’re giving it an honest shot.</p><p> 我们将这些交易视为业务决策，而不是编辑。我们不调试或编辑故事。我们不会雇用作家，或管理它们。作家，而不是家喻户晓的是所有者。没有人写的东西 - 他们为自己的出版物写作。未经明确许可，我们无法联系他们的读者，除了要求他们坚持适用于家庭作家的内容指导方针，我们不会试图影响他们的内容（更多地阅读我们的内容适度的姿势）。我们唯一要求返回的是对最低出版频率的承诺，所以我们知道他们会给它一个诚实的拍摄。</p><p> Today, our Pro deals result from a combination of writers coming to us, writers referring their friends, us identifying writers already on Substack with growth potential, and proactive outreach. While we are starting with a focus on well established writers who feel like “good bets,” this program is very much in its infancy. We will also continue to build on our  fellowships,  mentorship programs,  educational resources, and  grants to help writers at all different stages in their careers.</p><p> 今天，我们的Pro优惠来自给我们的作家组合，作家指代他们的朋友，美国识别已经在具有增长潜力的奴役和主动外展的作家。虽然我们开始专注于所建立的作家，但是这项计划在其婴儿期间非常重要。我们还将继续基于我们的奖学金，指导计划，教育资源，并赠送在其职业生涯中所有不同阶段的作家。</p><p> When considering a Pro deal, the main thing we take into account is the writer’s likelihood of success with the Substack model. We look at the writer’s audience size, how engaged their following is on social media, and the respect they engender among their readers and peers. As an indicator of a publication’s market opportunity, we look at what they cover and assess how well that subject is covered elsewhere. We consider their track record and look for evidence of an ability to publish multiple pieces a week for an extended period of time. We do not approach this process from the perspective of a publisher, looking to gather a particular type of content under our brand, but with the eye of an investor, looking to stimulate a new generation of profitable media businesses. We want to help writers flourish.</p><p> 考虑到Pro交易时，我们考虑到的主要事情是作者的成功可能性与家喻户组件。我们看看作家的观众尺寸，如何参与他们的以下社交媒体，以及他们在读者和同龄人之间接触的尊重。作为出版物的市场机会的指标，我们看看他们所涵盖的内容并评估别处覆盖的程度。我们考虑他们的轨道记录，并寻找能够在延长一段时间内每周发布多个件的能力。我们不会从出版商的角度来接近这个过程，希望在我们的品牌下收集特定类型的内容，但随着投资者的眼睛，希望刺激新一代盈利媒体业务。我们希望帮助作家蓬勃发展。 </p><p> With Substack Pro, as with the platform in general, we aim to host a broad array of voices because we believe a diversity of thought is essential to healthy discourse. Inevitably, a small subset of writers we have done deals with are controversial in some quarters, attracting praise and scorn in equal measure. While these deals may invite sharp criticism – even denunciation – from those writers’ opponents, we think it would be a mistake to shy away from making these calls. No writer who says anything important is universally loved; and in fact, sometimes those who engender the fiercest opposition are the ones most deserving of support. This is why the free press is important. A hero can be thought a villain, and a villain a hero. History makes this clear, even if the conditions of the present show only fog.</p><p>随着普通的平台，我们的目标是举办广泛的声音，因为我们相信思想的多样性对健康话语至关重要。不可避免地，我们在某些季度进行了争议的一小部分作家，在某些季度争议，相同的评价和蔑视。虽然这些交易可能会邀请急剧批评 - 甚至来自那些作家的对手，我们认为害羞地远离拨打这些电话是错误的。没有说什么是重要的东西是普遍喜爱的;事实上，有时那些参加最激烈的反对派的人是最值得支持的人。这就是为什么自由压力很重要。一个英雄可以被认为是一个恶棍，而一个恶棍是一个英雄。历史明确了，即使现在的条件仅显示雾。</p><p> Other writers, seeing the success of their contemporaries, have come to Substack on their own, taking no money from us. For many writers, that’s the smarter financial decision, since the guaranteed payments we are willing to offer are often dwarfed by the amount of money they can make if they just stick with the standard terms, keeping 90% of the subscription revenue for themselves. This is  by far the largest group and it includes many of the biggest names on the platform. (We don’t disclose the names of the writers with whom we’ve done deals because it is their private information and up to them whether or not they want it publicly known.)</p><p> 其他作家，看到他们同时代人的成功，已经自行重食，从我们这里没有钱。对于许多作家来说，这是智慧的财务决定，因为我们愿意提供的保证付款往往被他们可以使他们只能与标准术语保持在标准术语，保留90％的订阅收入。这是迄今为止最大的集团，它包括平台上的许多最大名称。 （我们没有透露我们完成交易的作家的名称，因为它是他们的私人信息，并不是他们是否希望公开知名。）</p><p> We haven’t said anything about Substack Pro in public until now because we have been in a “figuring it out” phase, seeing what resonates with writers and how the deals perform over time. We’re still only a few months into this, but we are now confident it’s working. A good number of writers who have accepted Pro deals are well on track to make multiples of what they earned from their previous salaries. Their success has helped bring other writers to Substack, and many of their readers go on to discover and support other people on the platform.</p><p> 我们在公共场合中没有说过任何关于职业的东西，因为我们一直处于“弄清楚”阶段，看到与作家的共鸣以及交易如何随着时间的推移而产生的。我们仍然只有几个月的时间，但我们现在有信心它的工作。有很多人接受Pro交易的作家都很好地追踪他们从以前的工资中获得的倍数。他们的成功有助于将其他作家带到家里，而他们的许多读者继续发现并支持平台上的其他人。</p><p> We expect Substack’s competition to grow and other platforms will no doubt incentivize writers in similar ways. That’s a  good thing. Our goal is to build a media ecosystem that provides a genuine alternative to the attention economy and puts writers and readers in charge. If the work we are doing today results in writers getting the autonomy and pay they deserve, even if it comes from other places, then we will consider that a big win.</p><p> 我们预计家庭竞争会增长，其他平台无疑将以类似的方式激励作家。这是好事。我们的目标是建立一个媒体生态系统，为注意力提供了真正的替代品，并将作者和读者置于负责人。如果我们今天正在做的工作会导致作家获得自主权并支付他们应得的，即使它来自其他地方，那么我们也会考虑一个巨大的胜利。</p><p> But of course, we think we can do much better than that and intend to invest accordingly. We believe that this movement towards subscriptions and writer autonomy represents an economic reordering for media on a scale not seen since the invention of the penny paper 200 years ago. It has long been clear that writers hold immense  cultural value because they influence how almost everyone on the planet thinks, but we’re increasingly convinced that they also represent tremendous  economic value. We are betting our company on the idea that writers have been the victims of a massive market failure. Three years ago, you’d have been crazy to believe that one of the next great internet businesses could be built by supporting writers. But now, to us at least, it seems obvious.</p><p> 但当然，我们认为我们可以比这更好，并打算相应投资。我们认为，这种对订阅和作家自主权的运动代表了媒体的经济重新排序，以自200年前的一分钱本发明的发明。很长一直很清楚，作家持有巨大的文化价值，因为它们影响了这个星球上的几乎每个人的想法，但我们越来越深信他们也代表了巨大的经济价值。我们博览我们公司对作家成为巨大市场失败的受害者的想法。三年前，您已经疯了相信下一个伟大的互联网业务中的一个可以通过支持作家来构建。但现在，至少对我们来说，这似乎是显而易见的。</p><p> We are going to accelerate and expand the Substack Pro program to make that future happen faster. All of those problems from 2017 are still with us. The media ecosystem is in crisis. We can’t afford to sit around and wait.</p><p> 我们将加速并扩展Supetpl Pro程序，以使未来更快地发生。 2017年的所有问题仍然与我们同在。媒体生态系统在危机中。我们不能坐在等待。</p><p>  This is the fourth installment of my occasional column. Previous posts were about the  return of blogging,  subverting the attention economy, and  how traditional media can adapt to a new era.</p><p>  这是我偶尔列的第四部分。以前的帖子是关于博客的回报，颠覆注意力经济，以及传统媒体如何适应新时代。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">https://blog.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/作家/">#作家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/substack/">#substack</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
