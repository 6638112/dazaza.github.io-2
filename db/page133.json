impressive $414 million in 2020, making it the third-largest U.K. city for tech investment. The city also has the most fintech startups per head in the U.K. outside London, according to  Whitecap\u2019s 2019-2020 Ecosystem Report.\n Efforts by the city\u2019s private and public sectors to modernize the city have helped it rank among the  top smart cities in the U.K., attracting a bevy of tech entrepreneurs. Its proximity to London has meant that it is a good alternative for founders looking for a more affordable stay while letting them tap the capital\u2019s financial resources. The University of Bristol also has the largest robotics department in Europe.\n   Use discount code  HARBOURSIDE to  save 25% off an annual or two-year Extra Crunch membership. This offer is only available to readers in the U.K. and Europe, and expires on August 31, 2021.\n  Bristol is also home to an important startup accelerator,  SETsquared. A collaborative effort by the five universities of Bath, Bristol, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey, the accelerator has supported over 4,000 entrepreneurs and helped their startups raise a total of \u00a31.8 billion. Other startup support players include the new  Science Creates VC fund, set up by entrepreneur  Harry Destecroix,\u00a0and  TechSPARK  Engine Shed.\n Key emerging startups from Bristol include Graphcore, Open Bionics, Ultraleap, Immersive Labs and Five AI.\n To get a better idea of the state of the tech ecosystem and the investor outlook for this city, we surveyed founders, leaders and executives involved in nurturing Bristol\u2019s startup ecosystem.\n The survey revealed that the city has a robust renewable, zero-carbon and fintech startup landscape. Robotics, VR, bio, quantum, digital and deep tech are also areas showing promise. As for the investing scene, although Bristol has a healthy angel network, the city lacks institutional VC, but with London only a drive or train ride away, this has not proved a significant problem.\n     Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Bristol is strong in renewable and zero-carbon innovation, fintech and robotics. It\u2019s weak in industry 4.0.\n Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol? Graphcore, LettUs Grow, Open Bionics, Ultraleap and YellowDog.\n What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? A lot of focus on fintech, I think.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? Bristol is a great middle ground between a large dynamic city (plus it\u2019s not far from London) and access to nice countryside area. With remote working we can expect it will attract new residents in the next few years.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? Aimee Skinner, Abigail Frear and Stuart Harrison.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? Second major city in U.K. innovation.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Bristol is strong in media/animation, edtech, social impact, health and science. I\u2019m most excited by edtech and the possibility to reach and positively impact millions of students via online learning. It\u2019s weaker in hardware and fintech.\n  What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? There are several very active tech investment networks coming from several angles, e.g., university-led, groups of private angels and tech incubators. The great thing is they all collaborate and share resources, ideas and expertise in initiatives such as The Engine Shed and Silicon Gorge.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? More people are moving in, as Bristol has a great urban lifestyle with easy access to the countryside and Southwest/Wales holiday spots, and an international airport 20 minutes from the center.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? Jerry Barnes at Bristol PE Club; Abby Frear at TechSPARK; Briony Phillips at Rocketmakers; Jack Jordan-Connelly at SETsquared.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? It\u2019s developing rapidly with lots of support, so it will be bigger, attracting more investment and definitely more on the international scene five years from now.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Our tech ecosystem is strong in the aerospace and defense sector. We are excited by the scope and scale of digital transformation opportunities with AI available in this sector. The main weakness in this sector is the slow pace of transformation, especially now due to the pandemic.\n  What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? Compared to the U.K. tech sector average, Bristol has a  very low proportion of established companies (4% versus 8%), a higher proportion of seed stage companies (42% versus 37%), and a higher death rate (21% versus 17%). It\u2019s a particularly young ecosystem.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? It is possible that people moving out of London will come into Bristol due to the transport links, strong ecosystem and beautiful nature of the city.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Bristol turns out to be San Francisco of Europe!\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What does it lack? Bristol is strong in the medtech, veterinary, industrial sectors.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? Others have moved in.\n  Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? We will see massive growth in five years.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Our sector is weak in entrepreneurial ambition among researchers, and so suffers from low rates of deep tech spinout activity from leading universities. We are most excited by the step change in activity we have seen in the past two years and culture shift towards innovation.\n  What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? Medium strength in shallow tech; currently weak in deep tech.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? People are moving in.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? Spin Up Science, Science Creates and Science Angel Syndicate.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? Very strong in deep tech with an invested local community of entrepreneurs, incubators and investors.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Bristol is strong in wireless (5G, 60 GHz, etc.), semiconductors (especially processors, AI/ML and parallel architectures), robotics and other hard tech/deep tech.\n  What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? It\u2019s limited. There are some angels, but few locally focused funds.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? Much the same: People choose to live in Bristol/Bath for quality of life. Much of the work is already external \u2014 commuting to London.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? Nigel Toon, Simon Knowles, Stan Boland, David May and Nick Sturge.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? Much stronger, with more processor and hardware activity.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Bristol has a strong robotics, aerospace and renewables scene. I\u2019m most excited to see how the legacy in aerospace in Bristol will translate to future industry-defining companies. The ecosystem is weak on the investor side, though London VCs are less than a two-hour train journey away.\n  With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? I believe Bristol will become more attractive.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? Tom Carter at Ultraleap, and Joel Gibbard at Open Bionics.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? Getting closer to London and Cambridge.\n  Which sectors is Bristol\u2019s tech ecosystem strong in? What are you most excited by? What does it lack? Bristol has a strong biotech, quantum, digital, science-based/deep tech ecosystem. I\u2019m excited by this eclectic city with exciting people that think differently.\n Which are the most interesting startups in Bristol? Any QTEC, SETsquared, or UnitDX members and alumni.\n What are the tech investors like in Bristol? What\u2019s their focus? Very early/nascent, mostly angels.\n With the shift to remote working, do you think people will stay in Bristol or will they move out? Will others move in? Probably move in! Beautiful green spaces around, lots of interesting, independent shops. And (just about) commutable from London.\n Who are the key startup people in the city (e.g., investors, founders, lawyers, designers)? The incubators \u2014 QTEC, QTIC, SETsquared and UnitDX; Bristol Private Equity Club; Harry Destecroix.\n Where do you think the city\u2019s tech scene will be in five years? Buzzing. More great startups and VCs moving in.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 15:17:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6df1\u5ea6,leaders,\u6280\u672f", "title": "8\u4e2a\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\uff0c\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5f3a\u8c03\u91d1\u878d\u6c14\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e03\u91cc\u65af\u6258\u5c14\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u9886\u57df ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t8 founders, leaders highlight fintech and deep tech as Bristol\u2019s top sectors\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/8-founders-leaders-highlight-fintech-and-deep-tech-as-bristols-top-sectors/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6df1\u5ea6", "leaders", "\u6280\u672f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cee1f3a3eb558739b3986835f4ad6078.jpg", "infoid": 1068397, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6c89\u79ef\u7269\u7684\u5178\u578b\u4f8b\u5b50\u7531\u5927Auk\u7684\u8089\u5934\uff08\u9885\u9aa8\u548c\u5599\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u94f0\u63a5\u5f0f\u725b\u690e\u9aa8\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u9676\u5668\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5176\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u9676\u5668\uff0c\u6c89\u79ef\u5728Cnip\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5ba4\u5899\u58c1\u540e\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u5218\u6613\u65af\uff08\u82cf\u683c\u5170\uff09\uff0c\u5728BC\u7b2c\u4e09\u4e16\u7eaa\uff08ARMIT Referenc ARMIT2006\uff1a198\uff06AMP\uff09\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u201c\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u5b58\u6b3e\u201d\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7b51\u53ca\u5176\u5c45\u6c11\u7684\u5949\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u3002 Webley\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Deliberately deposited (or cached) objects are ubiquitous in the archaeological record, yet they are often classified under different categories, such as hoards, structured deposits, grave goods and cenotaph burials, and interpreted according to different criteria. Drawing on contemporary attitudes to death, dying and bereavement, and using later prehistoric Britain as a case study, this article brings the analysis of these objects together within a single interpretive framework, which asserts that much of this material represents the \u2018problematic stuff\u2019 left behind by the dead. This approach forces us to reconsider the traditional boundaries drawn between different aspects of the archaeological record and demonstrates the value that emotion has in our interpretations of past societies.\n    Copyright \u00a9 The Author(s), 2021. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Antiquity Publications Ltd.\n  Various labels are assigned to the deliberately deposited objects recognised in the archaeological record, including hoards, structured deposits and grave goods. Hoards, often comprising metal objects, are usually defined on the basis of their isolated contexts and the perceived quality or quantity of their contents (e.g. Bradley  et al.   Reference Bradley, Haselgrove, Linden and Webley2013: 209). They are traditionally given over to finds specialists. In contrast, grave goods accompanying the dead, inhumed or cremated, lie within the realm of funerary archaeology. Finally, \u2018structured deposition\u2019 is a catch-all term given to objects cached in other contexts, often found on settlement sites, for example, in pits, ditches and buildings (cf. Hill   Reference Hill1995). Although these categories of objects are interpreted as the residue of ritual activity, the nature of such ritual behaviour is understood to be distinct in each case. The high material value of hoards leads to the interpretation of their deposition either for safe keeping or, more often, as propitiatory offerings (Bradley   Reference Bradley and Fagan1996: 305). Meanwhile, our tendency to focus on the human body relegates grave goods to the role of  accompanying the dead, either for use in the afterlife or as dedications by mourners (e.g. Parker Pearson   Reference Parker Pearson1999: 7). Structured deposits\u2014by nature a generic category\u2014have been interpreted in more varied and less specific ways (for an overview, see Garrow   Reference Garrow2012). The addition of descriptive terms to highlight differences in composition and depositional context\u2014for example, deliberate, formal, placed, ritual, selected, special, token (Brudenell &amp; Cooper   Reference Brudenell and Cooper2008: 15\u201316)\u2014adds yet more categories.\n The classification of assemblages described above, based on non-mutually exclusive characteristics, has created unhelpful divisions that hinder our understanding. Structured deposits that include disarticulated human bone, but which are found in settlements, for example, fall outside the focus of mainstream funerary archaeology, while groups of \u2018bodiless objects\u2019 within cemeteries\u2014that is, those objects which appear never to have accompanied the deposition of a body\u2014are frequently categorised as \u2018cenotaphs\u2019 (e.g. Nilsson Stutz &amp; Tarlow   Reference Nilsson Stutz, Tarlow, Tarlow and Nilsson Stutz2013: 6) in recognition of their probable mortuary associations. Such distinctions have served to elevate the presence of the physical remains of the human body over other types of material, and have thus limited the scope of our interpretations (Brudenell &amp; Cooper   Reference Brudenell and Cooper2008: 25\u201329). With this in mind, I discuss these various assemblage classes under the umbrella term \u2018cached object\u2019 (see Archaeological Institute of America  2020).\n Using later prehistoric Britain as a case study, I use contemporary theories of death, dying and bereavement to suggest that cached objects frequently represent the careful deposition of \u2018problematic stuff\u2019 left behind by the dead. This recognition is not intended to identify new types of deposit, nor necessarily to replace existing interpretations, but rather to unite previously divided materials under a common interpretive lens. The objective is to demonstrate that \u2018emotional value\u2019 is a legitimate consideration in our understanding of \u2018cached\u2019 objects in the archaeological record.\n In contrast to the monumental ritual landscapes of the preceding periods, the archaeological record of later prehistoric Britain, from around 1800 BC, is predominantly \u2018domestic\u2019 in character (Br\u00fcck   Reference Br\u00fcck1995: 245). With rare regional exceptions (e.g. the Arras Culture in East Yorkshire and the Aylesford-Swarling Culture in south-east England; Stead   Reference Stead1991; Fitzpatrick   Reference Fitzpatrick2007), visible normative burial rites and dedicated funerary monuments are rare (see Harding   Reference Harding2016). There are few formal cemeteries from this period and human remains are elusive. If recovered at all, bones are usually isolated and frequently deposited in settlement contexts (Br\u00fcck   Reference Br\u00fcck1995; Armit   Reference Armit, Bradbury and Scarre2017). Indeed, it seems likely that most of the dead were excarnated\u2014defleshed and disarticulated by natural or artificial means (Carr &amp; Kn\u00fcsel   Reference Carr, Kn\u00fcsel, Gwilt and Haselgrove1997)\u2014rather than interred in graves. At this time settlements became the focus of ritual activity, and the artefacts we find on such sites probably represent selective deposition, rather than the product of casual loss and discard (e.g. Hill   Reference Hill1995; Bradley   Reference Bradley2005: 33 &amp; 208\u2013209).\n This selectivity is indicated by the unusual distributions of artefacts on later prehistoric settlements in Britain, and the frequent occurrence of \u2018structured deposits\u2019: a catch-all term for caches of objects and animal bones (and occasionally human remains; Br\u00fcck   Reference Br\u00fcck1995; Armit   Reference Armit, Bradbury and Scarre2017) that were carefully selected and deposited in specific places (e.g. in ditch terminals, roundhouse entrance postholes, pits) at specific times. The term was originally coined in reference to an apparent patterning in the deposition of objects (such as pottery, bone and flint) at Neolithic ritual monuments (Richards &amp; Thomas   Reference Richards, Thomas, Bradley and Gardiner1984), but has since been adopted more widely to describe a variety of cached objects on domestic sites (e.g. Hill   Reference Hill1995).\n A typical example of a structured deposit is represented by the fleshed head (cranium and beak) of a great auk, along with articulated cattle vertebrae and a complete pottery vessel (possibly with its contents), deposited behind the wall of a wheelhouse at Cnip, on Lewis (Scotland), during its construction in the third century BC (Armit   Reference Armit2006: 198 &amp; 220\u201321). In this instance, this \u2018foundation deposit\u2019 presumably served a propitiatory role in the dedication of the new building and its inhabitants. Webley&#39;s (  Reference Webley2007) study of Late Bronze Age roundhouses in southern England demonstrates that similar deposits were made to signify the end of a building&#39;s life. Roundhouse floors appear to have been meticulously swept clean of domestic debris, providing further evidence that certain objects were deliberately left behind. At the Late Iron Age settlement at Broxmouth in south-east Scotland, for example, dished floor profiles and the undercutting of inner wall-faces attest to the erosion caused by frequent sweeping-out (B\u00fcster &amp; Armit   Reference B\u00fcster, Armit, Armit and McKenzie2013;  Figure 1)\u2014a process that appears to have prompted the subsequent laying of paved floor surfaces.\n  Unfortunately, the labelling of such evidence as structured deposits, which in turn is used as a proxy for ritual behaviour, is often where the interpretive process ends, and brings us no closer to understanding the motives behind the deposition of this material. Considering these assemblages within a broader spectrum of \u2018cached objects\u2019 and recognising our own emotional attachment to \u2018things\u2019 (e.g. Bell &amp; Spikins   Reference Bell and Spikins2018) may, however, help us to move forward.\n \u2018Continuing bonds\u2019 theory was developed by modern bereavement studies (e.g. Klass  et al.   Reference Klass, Silverman and Nickman1996; Walter   Reference Walter1996; Stroebe  et al.   Reference Stroebe, Abakoumkin, Stroebe and Schut2012), growing out of a dissatisfaction with common perceptions of the nature of grief. Traditional approaches emphasised the need for detachment from the deceased (Freud trans.   Reference Freud, Strachey and Strachey1957), or asserted that the grieving process progressed through a unilinear series of stages towards the restoration of a pre-bereavement status quo (Kubler-Ross   Reference Kubler-Ross1969; Bowlby   Reference Bowlby1973,   Reference Bowlby1980; Worden   Reference Worden1991). Grief, however, is far more complex than a linear trajectory of \u2018recovery\u2019, and (consciously or unconsciously) individuals often form \u2018continuing bonds\u2019 with the dead\u2014new types of relationships that endure to a greater or lesser extent throughout their lives (Shuchter &amp; Zisook   Reference Shuchter, Zisook, Stroebe, Stroebe and Hansson1993: 34; for the application of continuing bonds theory in an archaeological context, see Croucher   Reference Croucher2017).\n A recent study exploring the applicability of archaeology in discussions of death, dying and bereavement with healthcare professionals (B\u00fcster  et al.   Reference B\u00fcster, Croucher, Dayes, Green and Faull2018; Croucher  et al.   Reference Croucher, B\u00fcster, Dayes, Green, Raynsford, Boyes and Faull2020) reveals that objects are central to the maintenance of continuing bonds:\n my mum died very suddenly when I was 25 [\u2026] and just before she died, she&#39;d bought a big tub of Horlicks [a malted-milk drink powder] which she gave to me for some reason, because she bought two on offer or something, and I could not throw this away. It was in the cupboard for five years! And it was solid. But because she&#39;d bought it, it became like an artefact [\u2026] I did throw it away in the end, I suppose it was a symbol of my getting through the grief (participant 20, in B\u00fcster  et al.   Reference B\u00fcster, Croucher, Dayes, Green and Faull2018: 269).\n The jar of Horlicks\u2014a mass-produced and inexpensive item, acquired by the deceased only days before their death as part of a routine shopping trip\u2014was transformed through the act (and timing) of \u2018gift-giving\u2019 into an emotionally charged \u2018artefact\u2019: the material embodiment of the last physical interaction between two living individuals. The bereaved participant explained that, although they did not like Horlicks (and perhaps it would have felt inappropriate to consume it in any case), they could not casually dispose of this \u2018artefact\u2019. This was no longer  just a jar of Horlicks: it had been transformed into something deeply problematic.\n The same sentiments are echoed in the words of J. Brammer (  Reference Brammer2017), writing about the difficult task of clearing out her late mother&#39;s house:\n So, when is a doily not a doily? When it goes from being one of my mother&#39;s kitsch furniture accessories when she was alive, into a sacred reminder of her homeliness now that she&#39;s gone [\u2026] The significance of the doilies and anything she had touched, grew overnight [\u2026] I decided to honour her by framing and hanging them so her story could be woven into the walls of my home.\n Here we see previously old-fashioned and \u2018unnecessary\u2019 ephemera taking on new meanings and becoming problematic, not because of their material or aesthetic value, but because of their mnemonic power. If we accept the possibility for emotional attachment to even the most mundane objects, then, as Brudenell and Cooper (  Reference Brudenell and Cooper2008: 24) point out, \u201c any attempt to define rigid criteria for identifying \u2018special\u2019 deposits may ultimately miss the point\u201d.\n There are many examples in the archaeological record of attempts to maintain continuing bonds with the dead, not least in the erection of large funerary monuments that served as mnemonic devices for the living. Equally visible, particularly as structured deposits, but perhaps as yet unrecognised, is the disposal of the problematic stuff that bound the living and the dead together: material that was too entwined with the social identity of the dead to be reused by the living, yet too symbolically charged for casual discard as part of normal processes of waste management.\n The material value of certain artefacts has long been recognised, as signified, for example, through cultural preferences for particular raw materials, the time and skill involved in the manufacture of certain objects, or their rare and exotic nature. It is this form of value that is often prioritised in our understanding and categorisation of hoards. Increasingly, however, materiality (e.g. Meskell   Reference Meskell2005) and biographical (e.g. Gosden &amp; Marshall   Reference Gosden and Marshall1999; Joy   Reference Joy2009) approaches to the study of artefacts have also championed the symbolic value that certain objects may have possessed as material manifestations of distant lands, the product of technological transformations or their embodiment of other (intangible) properties. Interpretations of this nature often influence our understandings of grave goods. But recognition of problematic stuff as a legitimate and powerful response to even the most mundane objects, such as the aforementioned jar of Horlicks, dictates that we include another important value category in our discussion and interpretation: emotion ( Figure 2). It is through this lens that we might better understand the ritual behaviours that led to the caching of objects in the archaeological record. It is, of course, not necessarily the case that any object chosen for or warranting deposition in a controlled and structured way embodies a single value category. Indeed, once such artefacts are brought together, the resulting assemblages will themselves take on new meanings. But it is important to recognise the raw emotional power that everyday objects can acquire at certain times and places.\n In the few areas of Iron Age Britain where a normative visible burial rite exists, bodies are often associated with artefacts (grave goods). The inhumations and chariot burials of the Arras Culture of East Yorkshire, for example, contain some of the most spectacular objects known from this period, including brooches featuring enamel and coral inlay, and elaborate necklaces of glass and amber (Giles   Reference Giles2012). Many of these items presumably belonged to the deceased, or were sufficiently entwined with their social identity to necessitate removal from circulation upon their death.\n Yet, it is not just those items worn on the body that can assume problematic status. We must also consider other categories of artefact ( Figure 3). Objects also become problematic through their association  with the dead body, via, for example, their use in post-mortem care and mortuary rites. This category of object may well be represented by the toilet instruments (e.g. tweezers, nail cleaners and ear scoops) found in graves at Mill Hill (Deal), King Harry Lane (St Albans) and Biddenham Loop (near Bedford) in southern England, and at Arras and Wetwang Slack in East Yorkshire (Harding   Reference Harding2016: 179\u201380), as well as in later prehistoric graves on the Continent (Fontijn   Reference Fontijn2002: 200\u2013201). Notably, these objects have also been recovered from structured deposits in regions in which formal graves are absent: the nail-cleaner built into the wall of \u2018Hut II\u2019 at Hownam Rings in the Scottish Borders (Piggott   Reference Piggott1948: 211) represents one such example. Then come the items owned by the deceased: objects such as those represented in the modern-day quotations presented above. Analogies for these different categories of object have precedence elsewhere. In the medieval Christian church, for example, relics could comprise the physical remains of a saint&#39;s body (\u2018first class\u2019), objects owned or used by a saint (\u2018second class\u2019), or objects that had touched a first- or second-class relic (\u2018third-class\u2019) (Jestice   Reference Jestice and Jestice2004: 887).\n  We could also add an additional tier of problematic stuff: the artefacts associated with the past lives of those still living, such as previous social states transcended through certain rites of passage, or objects that represent \u201cthe paraphernalia of a specific kind of personhood\u201d (Fontijn   Reference Fontijn2002: 217). In a modern context, this might manifest itself in the reluctance of parents, for example, to dispose of the infant clothes of grown-up children, with one social media user lamenting that \u201cI have a bag for charity and a bag called \u2018I&#39;m not ready to let go yet\u2019\u201d. Other examples might include the retention by adults of teenage clothes that no longer fit or are no longer fashionable, or of cassette tapes that can no longer be played. While such phenomena will be difficult to recognise in the archaeological record, they might be glimpsed, for example, in the inclusion of worn-out objects or miniatures in (adult) graves. Miniature items are often interpreted as \u2018votives\u2019 (e.g. Green   Reference Green1987). Using a different interpretive lens, however, there is no reason to discount the possibility that such objects might represent a cherished childhood toy, such as the diminutive sword in its wooden scabbard found in the grave of two adults at the Roman cemetery of Cranmer House, Canterbury (Bennett   Reference Bennett, Frere, Bennett, Rady and Stow1987: 66). Problematic stuff might also be evidenced by the inclusion of adult-sized objects in children&#39;s graves; that is, objects\u2014such as the three copper rings interred with a child at Barrow Hills in Oxfordshire (Br\u00fcck   Reference Br\u00fcck2004: 314)\u2014that were destined for individuals who did not live long enough to wear them.\n In any region or period with mortuary traditions that involved the digging of graves, the disposal of problematic stuff would potentially have been fairly straightforward, as it could have accompanied the deposition of the body (or its remnants). But what happened to these objects when there was no grave in which to deposit them? What happened to problematic stuff in the communities of later prehistoric Britain, for example, whose predominant mode of disposal of the dead involved the complete dispersal of the body through excarnation? Human remains are themselves sometimes incorporated into structured deposits. The femur interred with a weaving comb and copper alloy fibula in a pit at Maiden Castle, Dorset (Sharples   Reference Sharples2010: 239), provides just one example. These bones surely represent \u2018token\u2019 remnants of the deceased, collected from the scattered remains of bodies that had been defleshed and disarticulated through excarnation, as McKinley (  Reference McKinley, Tarlow and Stutz2013: 154) similarly argues for cremation graves of this period. With this in mind, it is perhaps unsurprising that a downturn in the construction of barrows, and the associated interment of bodies and grave goods, across much of Europe after 1500 BC coincides with an increase in the deposition of weapon hoards, which are frequently associated with isolated human bones and placed in watery contexts (Fitzpatrick   Reference Fitzpatrick, Cunliffe and Miles1984; Bradley   Reference Bradley and Fagan1996: 306; Barrett &amp; Needham   Reference Barrett, Needham, Barrett and Kinnes1988).

The system timestamp can not be used, because  wall clocks are not monotonic and clock values from two different servers should not be compared.\n The system timestamp, which represents the time of the day, is measured by a clock machinery generally built with an crystal oscillator. The known problem with this mechanism is that it can drift away from the actual time of the day, based on how fast or slow the crystals oscillate. To fix this, computers typically have a service like  NTP which synchronizes computer clocks with well known time sources on the internet. Because of this, two consecutive readings of the system time on a given server can have time going backwards.\n As there is no upper bound on clock drift across servers, it is impossible to compare timestamps on two different servers\n MVCCStore mvccStore; LamportClock clock; public Server(MVCCStore mvccStore) { this.clock = new LamportClock(1); this.mvccStore = mvccStore; }\n Whenever a server carries out any write operation, it should advance the Lamport Clock, using the `tick()` method\n   This way, the server can be sure that the write is sequenced after the request and after any other action the server has carried out since the request was initiated by the client. The server returns the timestamp that was used for writing the value to the client. The requesting client then uses this timestamp to issue any further writes to other set of servers. This way, the causal chain of requests is maintained.\n  Consider an example of a simple key value store with multiple server nodes. There are two servers, Blue and Green. Each server is responsible for storing a specific set of keys. This is a typical scenario when data is partitioned across a set of servers. Values are stored as  Versioned Value with the Lamport Timestamp as a version number.\n   The receiving server compares and updates its own timestamp and uses it to write a versioned key value.   public int write(String key, String value, int requestTimestamp) { //update own clock to reflect causality  int writeAtTimestamp = clock.tick(requestTimestamp); mvccStore.put(new VersionedKey(key, writeAtTimestamp), value); return writeAtTimestamp; }\n The timestamp used for writing the value is returned to the client. The client keeps track of the maximum timestamp, by updating its own timestamp. It uses this timestamp to issue any further writes.\n  LamportClock clock = new LamportClock(1); public void write() { int server1WrittenAt = server1.write(&#34;name&#34;, &#34;Alice&#34;, clock.getLatestTime()); clock.updateTo(server1WrittenAt); int server2WrittenAt = server2.write(&#34;title&#34;, &#34;Microservices&#34;, clock.getLatestTime()); clock.updateTo(server2WrittenAt); assertTrue(server2WrittenAt &gt; server1WrittenAt); }\n    The same technique works even when the client is communicating with a leader with  Leader and Followers groups, with each group responsible for specific keys. The client sends requests to the leader of the group as detailed above. The Lamport Clock instance is maintained by the leader of the group, and is updated exactly the same way as discussed in the previous section.\n The values stored by Lamport Clock are only  partially ordered. If two clients store values in two separate servers, the timestamp values cannot be used to order the values across servers. In the following example, the title stored by Bob on server Green is at timestamp 2.

", "note_en": "Every fan of Christopher Nolan knows that any good magic trick contains three acts. The first act is the pledge, where the magician does something ordinary. Then comes the turn, where the ordinary becomes extraordinary. The third act is the prestige, returning the extraordinary to the ordinary.\n In order to avoid taxation using Buy, Borrow, Die, an American must first have enough money to invest in appreciating assets.  Broadly invested assets often provide at least 3% growth every year after inflation, which means that $2 Million invested provides an annual passive income of about $60,000, the median American household salary. $10 Million invested provides approximately an annual passive income of $300,000, which is well into the 90th percentile of earners.  This is gained through no effort of the investor. If the taxpayer sells these gains as she receives them, then she will pay capital gains taxes. (already a lower rate than the normal income rates)\n By using this strategy, our Patriotic American Citizens don\u2019t even need to pay the lower capital gains taxes. Instead, they can peacefully protest the American government\u2019s oppressive taxation regime, leaving the expense of roads and hospitals and public education to their less-propertied counterparts, instead spending their wealth on hard-earned vacations and yachts.\n  The first act of this magic trick is very simple. Our Patriotic American Citizen takes their hard-inherited wealth and buys appreciating assets. $10,000,000 inherited will usually provide at least $600,000 in gains, approximately $300,000 of which will be saved so that the fund grows with inflation, leaving $300,000 of income (which grows with inflation, because the other $300,000 is saved). But that is not sold; the first step is  buy, not  sell.\n  The second act is also very simple. Our Patriotic American Citizen now wants to spend her $300,000 in income from above, which logically would mean selling the gains and paying 15% capital gains taxes on their income.\n The Patriotic American Citizen here turns the ordinary ( spending $300,000 in capital gains) into the extraordinary by withdrawing $300,000 in debt. By doing so, she has avoided paying taxes this year on her capital gains, because they have not been sold and are therefore unrealized, and she has avoided paying taxes on the debt because debt is not taxed.  She has paid no taxes this year, despite spending the $300,000 in appreciation of her assets.\n This part of the trick is repeated every year, until it is time for the final act.\n  Our Patriotic American Citizen has allowed her unrealized gains to accumulated over the course of her life. This should mean that they are all taxed when they are finally sold, but therein lies the final sleight of hand; they are never sold. Instead, the Patriotic American Citizen dies, still owning the assets.\n At this point, the extraordinary again becomes the ordinary. The appreciated assets are now at a stepped-up basis, washing away the unrealized gains. They are then sold, without any built-in taxes, so the estate pays  no taxes on the total amount, including not only the initial investment but also the appreciation of the asset. The estate then uses the appreciation of the assets to pay off the debt. The principal remains.\n The result, therefore, is a life without taxes. The principal investment provides, through appreciation, additional wealth, which the Patriotic American Citizen then matches in debt.

The group was named \u201cDenisovans\u201d in its honor. Now, an extensive analysis of DNA in the cave\u2019s soils reveals it also hosted modern humans\u2014who arrived early enough that they may have once lived there alongside Denisovans and Neanderthals.\n The new study \u201cgives [researchers] unprecedented insight into the past,\u201d says Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a molecular paleoecologist at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved with the work. \u201cIt literally shows what [before] they have only been able hypothesize.\u201d\n Humans\u2014including Neanderthals and Denisovans\u2014are known to have occupied Denisova Cave for at least 300,000 years. Among the eight human fossils unearthed there are the pinkie, three bones from Neanderthals, and even one from a child  with one Neanderthal and one Denisovan parent. The cave also contains sophisticated stone tools and jewelry at higher, later levels. But no modern human fossils have been found there. Those artifacts,  extensive studies of DNA from these bones, and even  one early study of DNA from soils have cemented the cave\u2019s importance for piecing together human evolution.\n But eight fossils are not much to go on, so Elena Zavala, a graduate student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and colleagues teamed up with Russian researchers to see what kind of DNA was present in the soils of the three-chamber cave (see video, below).\n Researchers have been studying DNA isolated from soils for more than 40 years, including  sequencing DNA from permafrost, but only in the past 4 years has anyone  found DNA from extinct humans in ancient soils.\n Working with another team of experts who had previously  dated the layers of the cave, the researchers dug out 728 soil samples. After 2 years of analysis, in which they isolated and sequenced the samples, the researchers found human DNA in 175 of them. That makes the study \u201cthe largest and most systematic of its kind,\u201d says Katerina Douka, an archaeological scientist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History who was not involved in the work.\n    The data reveal\u00a0 a complex history of human and animal habitation, with different groups moving in and out of the cave over time, Zavala and her colleagues report today in\u00a0 Nature. Their work confirms that Denisovans were the cave\u2019s first human inhabitants, about 300,000 years ago. They disappeared 130,000 years ago, only to be followed by a different group of Denisovans, who likely made many of the stone tools, some 30,000 years later. Neanderthals appeared on the scene about 170,000 years ago, with different groups using the cave at various points in time, some overlapping with the Denisovans.\n The last to arrive were modern humans, who showed up about 45,000 years ago. The soil layer that corresponds with that period contained DNA from all three human groups, the researchers report. \u201cThe time periods [of each layer] are quite large, so we can\u2019t concretely say if they overlapped or not,\u201d Zavala says. But, Douka adds, \u201cI cannot think of another site where three human species lived through time.\u201d\n Given the jewelry and sophisticated artifacts in later layers, some researchers had\u00a0 suspected moderns\u00a0had been there. But no one knew they had arrived as early as 45,000 years ago\u2014and overlapped with both of our archaic cousins. \u201cIt suggests a more complicated interplay between archaic and modern humans,\u201d says Ron Pinhasi, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of Vienna who was not involved with the work.\n The soil samples also yielded DNA from many species of animals. About 170,000 years ago, the climate went from warmer to colder, and Neanderthals moved in, so did different species of hyenas and bears.\n It\u2019s the combination of genomic data from both the fossils and the soil samples that really makes the new work stand out, Pinhasi says. \u201cIt\u2019s a superpromising direction [for future work].\u201d Douka agrees, and says the new study should help ancient soil DNA become \u201ca mainstream archaeological tool.\u201d She is already amazed at the progress that it, combined with other studies, has made possible. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget that as recently as in 2010 we had\u00a0absolutely no evidence that Denisovans existed, and that these various hominins ever met, let alone that they interbred\u00a0repeatedly\u00a0and co-existed for millennia,\u201d she wrote in an email.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 15:09:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6d1e\u7a74,cave,\u4eba\u7c7b", "title": "\u897f\u4f2f\u5229\u4e9a\u6d1e\u7a74\u4e3b\u6301\u4e86Neanderthals\uff0cDenisovans\u548c\u73b0\u4ee3\u4eba\u7c7b ", "title_en": "Siberian cave hosted Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/ancient-siberian-cave-hosted-neanderthals-denisovans-and-modern-humans-possibly-same", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6d1e\u7a74", "cave", "\u4eba\u7c7b"]}]
