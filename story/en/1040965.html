Delamar was a bearded Canadian Japanophile in his early forties; Johnson a network engineer from San Diego. Through an unusual financial arrangement, they represented a four-person group that had recently come to own a controlling stake in the company, and they had a plan to turn BitTorrent into, as Delamar was fond of saying publicly, “the next Netflix.” BitTorrent had already tried to be the next Netflix, starting long before Netflix had become the next Netflix. The company was founded in 2004 by Bram Cohen, inventor of the open-source protocol that lent the startup its name, and Ashwin Navin. BitTorrent — the protocol — was a genius way to transmit large amounts of information over the net by breaking it into small chunks, sending it through a peer-to-peer network, and reassembling it. BitTorrent — the company — got started on the assumption that Cohen was brilliant. He’d invented one of the web’s most fundamental tools, and surely there was a business to be made from it.</p><p>去年四月，一对表兄Bob Delamar和Jeremy Johnson成为BitTorrent的联合首席执行官。德拉玛（Delamar）40岁出头，是一个留着胡须的加拿大亲日本人。 Johnson是来自圣地亚哥的网络工程师。通过不寻常的财务安排，他们代表了一个由四人组成的团体，该团体最近才拥有该公司的控股权，并且他们计划将BitTorrent转变成Delamar喜欢公开表示的“下一个Netflix”。 BitTorrent早在Netflix成为下一个Netflix之前就已经开始尝试成为下一个Netflix。该公司由开放源代码协议的发明者Bram Cohen和Ashwin Navin于2004年成立。协议BitTorrent是一种天才的方法，它通过将信息分成小块，通过对等网络发送并重新组装，从而在网络上传输大量信息。该公司BitTorrent是在假设Cohen出色的前提下开始的。他发明了网络上最基本的工具之一，因此肯定会有一项业务。</p><p>  But from the start, BitTorrent had a branding problem — pirates used it to share movies illegally, making it the Napster of entertainment. Because the protocol was open-source, BitTorrent (the company) couldn’t stop the pirates. For 12 years, BitTorrent’s investors, executives and founders attempted to figure out many money-making strategies, including both enterprise software and entertainment businesses, while convincing us all that, sure, people might use the BitTorrent protocol to conduct illegal activity, but BitTorrent was just a tool — a  really great tool you can use for  really great things!</p><p>  但是从一开始，BitTorrent就遇到了品牌问题-盗版者将其非法用于共享电影，这使其成为娱乐活动的Napster。由于该协议是开源的，因此BitTorrent（该公司）无法阻止海盗。在过去的12年中，BitTorrent的投资者，高管和创始人试图找出许多赚钱策略，包括企业软件和娱乐业务，同时使我们确信，人们可能会使用BitTorrent协议进行非法活动，但BitTorrent却是只是一个工具-一个非常伟大的工具，可以用于真正伟大的事情！</p><p>  They’re right: 170 million people used the protocol every month, according to the company’s website. Facebook and Twitter use it to distribute updates to their servers. Florida State University has used it to distribute large scientific datasets to its researchers. Blizzard Entertainment has used BitTorrent to let players download World of Warcraft. The company’s site boasts that the protocol moves as much as 40 percent of the world’s Internet traffic each day.</p><p>  没错：根据该公司的网站，每月有1.7亿人使用该协议。 Facebook和Twitter使用它向服务器分发更新。佛罗里达州立大学已使用它向研究人员分发大型科学数据集。暴雪娱乐公司已经使用BitTorrent来让玩家下载《魔兽世界》。该公司的网站声称该协议每天可移动多达40％的互联网流量。</p><p>  But transforming this technology into any kind of business has proved elusive. By last spring, BitTorrent had already endeavored to become a media company, twice. There was BitTorrent Entertainment Network, launched in 2007, which was a storefront for movies and music that made no money and shut down a year later. And then there was the BitTorrent Bundle, launched in 2013, which was a competitor to iTunes and Amazon that let artists distribute their work directly to fans at a fraction the cost. In 2014, the company even announced plans to produce its own original series, a scifi show called Children of the Machine. But by early the next year, BitTorrent had given up on this strategy, too.</p><p>  但是，事实证明将这项技术转化为任何业务都非常困难。到去年春天，BitTorrent已经两次努力成为一家媒体公司。有一家于2007年推出的BitTorrent娱乐网络，该网络存储着电影和音乐，没有收入，一年后就关闭了。然后是2013年推出的BitTorrent捆绑包，它是iTunes和亚马逊的竞争对手，让艺术家直接将其作品分发给粉丝，而费用却很少。 2014年，该公司甚至宣布了计划制作自己的原创系列的节目，这是一个名为“机器之子”的科幻节目。但是到明年年初，BitTorrent也放弃了这一策略。</p><p> Some startups are born lucky. By the chance of their timing, their technology, or the individuals who helm them, they experience Facebook-size success. Others fail quickly. There is luck in this, too — in an immediate, concise conclusion. Far more startups, having raised funding on the merits of an idea and a team, plod along for years or even decades, constantly casting about for the idea or customer or partnership that will transform them. Their investors are patient, and then exhausted, and then checked out, and then impatient. Their executives change, and then change again. The founders leave, or they hang on in hopes the company they conceived will somehow eventually prove itself. They are zombie startups.</p><p> 一些初创公司是天生的幸运。通过他们的时机，技术或掌舵人的机会，他们会体验到Facebook规模的成功。其他人很快就会失败。这也有运气，即刻即刻得出结论。越来越多的初创公司因构思和团队的优点而筹集了资金，经过数年甚至数十年的努力，不断地寻求将其转变的构思，客户或合作伙伴。他们的投资者是耐心的，然后精疲力尽，然后退房，然后不耐烦。他们的高管先换，然后再换。创始人离职，或者他们继续希望他们所设想的公司最终能够证明自己。他们是僵尸创业公司。</p><p>  Such is the case with BitTorrent. It has remained a technology in search of a business for a dozen years. Then last year, Delamar and Johnson arrived with plans to save it once and for all. Instead, they squandered millions on failed schemes, putting the company on course for collapse.</p><p>  BitTorrent就是这种情况。十几年来，它一直是一种寻找业务的技术。去年，德拉玛（Delamar）和约翰逊（Johnson）提出了一劳永逸地保存它的计划。取而代之的是，他们在失败的计划上浪费了数百万美元，使该公司濒临倒闭。</p><p>  I stumbled across this story while reporting Backchannel’s weekly  Follow-up Friday piece, in which we step out of the knee-jerk news cycle to follow up on announcements and news events from previous years. I reached out to discover what had happened to Children of the Machine,  the original series for which BitTorrent received accolades for announcing two years ago. When the company didn’t respond, I began asking others.</p><p>  在报道Backchannel每周的每周后续跟踪报道时，我偶然发现了这个故事，在该报道中，我们走出了弯腰的新闻周期，以跟进往年的公告和新闻事件。我伸出手去发现《机器之子》发生了什么变化，这是BitTorrent两年前宣布获得该奖项的最初系列。当公司没有回应时，我开始问其他人。 </p><p>  BitTorrent doesn’t want to talk about what happened last year. It made no executive available to answer questions. I pieced together the following narrative by speaking with current and former employees, investors and artists. Consider it a morality tale for discordant investors and entrepreneurs. It’s the story of the most recent dramatic and strange chapter in the life of one venture-backed company that has failed to succeed, but also hasn’t failed.</p><p>BitTorrent不想谈论去年发生的事情。它没有高管回答问题。通过与现任和前任雇员，投资者和艺术家交谈，我整理了以下叙述。对于不和谐的投资者和企业家来说，这是一个道德故事。这是一家由风险投资支持的公司生命中最近发生的戏剧性和奇怪的一章的故事，该故事没有成功，但也没有失败。</p><p> As a child on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, Bram Cohen was smart, introverted, and strange. “I knew I was weird,”  Cohen once told  FORTUNE, explaining that he got frustrated trying to interact with other people. “I can really remember lots of stories in my life — things that it’s really obvious to me now what was going on, but I didn’t realize it back then because I didn’t understand people very well.” He graduated from Stuyvesant High School. But for all of his ability to focus, his grades were dismal. He attended the University of Buffalo, dropping out after two years.</p><p> 布拉姆·科恩（Bram Cohen）小时候在曼哈顿上西区（Manhattan West Side）上，聪明，内向和陌生。 “我知道我很奇怪，”科恩曾对《财富》杂志说，他解释说，他在尝试与他人互动时感到沮丧。 “我真的能记住我生活中的许多故事，这些事情现在对我来说真的很明显，但是那时我并没有意识到，因为我不太了解别人。”他毕业于Stuyvesant高中。但是，尽管他有全神贯注的能力，他的成绩却令人沮丧。他上了布法罗大学，两年后退学。</p><p> Cohen has Asperger’s Syndrome, a condition about which he has always been very public. He disclosed his condition to an early investor, for example, during one of their earliest fundraising meetings. “It’s one of the first things he tells most people,” the investor told Bloomberg BusinessWeek in a 2008 profile. As a result, he’s not a handshaker. He doesn’t like wearing shoes. He’s not one for making small-talk.</p><p> 科恩患有阿斯伯格综合症（Asperger's Syndrome），他一直很公开地谈论这种情况。例如，他在最早的一次筹款会议中向一位早期投资者透露了自己的状况。这位投资者在2008年的个人资料中告诉彭博商业周刊：“这是他告诉大多数人的第一件事。”因此，他不是握手者。他不喜欢穿鞋。他不是一个闲聊的人。</p><p> In his mid 20s, having worked a string of dot-com jobs, Cohen spent the better part of nine months hunched over a Dell keyboard at his dining room table, consumed by a puzzle he could only solve by writing code and more code. He lived off his savings, and later credit cards. He felt certain he could figure out how to solve a puzzle that had stumped programmers since the start of the web — how to transfer massive files. The result, of course, was the open-source protocol BitTorrent.</p><p> 20年代中期，科恩（Cohen）从事了一系列的互联网工作，花了九个月的大部分时间在餐桌旁的戴尔键盘上，他只能通过编写代码和编写更多代码来解决这个难题。他以自己的积蓄和以后的信用卡为生。他确信自己可以弄清楚如何解决自网络开始以来困扰程序员的难题-如何传输海量文件。结果，当然是开源协议BitTorrent。</p><p> In 2004, Cohen partnered with his younger brother, Ross Cohen, and Ashwin Navin, an alum of Goldman Sachs and Yahoo, to attempt to create a business around the protocol. They raised $8.75 million from Doll Capital Management (DCM). An early business plan was to establish a marketplace, like eBay, for creators to sell bandwidth-intensive content to consumers. They’d make money off it either through advertising or by charging these sellers a fee. The venture firm Accel led the company’s next round, in December 2006.</p><p> 2004年，科恩（Cohen）与他的弟弟罗斯·科恩（Ross Cohen）和高盛（Goldman Sachs）和雅虎（Yahoo）的校友阿什温·纳文（Ashwin Navin）合作，试图围绕该协议开展业务。他们从Doll Capital Management（DCM）筹集了875万美元。早期的商业计划是建立一个市场，例如eBay，以供创作者将带宽密集型内容出售给消费者。他们可以通过广告或向这些卖家收取费用来赚钱。风险投资公司Accel于2006年12月领导了公司的下一轮融资。</p><p> From the start, the company had personnel issues. Early on, Cohen’s brother, who had been in charge of the engineers, left. In 2007, Cohen ceded the CEO role to a short-lived outsider, moving into the newly created role of Chief Scientist (a title he has kept). In 2008, Eric Klinker, who was then chief technology officer, became BitTorrent’s CEO. Klinker possessed a rare combination of traits — he had the people skills to run the company, and he was sharp enough technically to win Cohen’s respect. (This was a particularly high bar.)</p><p> 从一开始，公司就遇到了人事问题。早期，负责工程师的科恩（Cohen）兄弟离开了。 2007年，科恩（Cohen）将CEO职位让给了一个-花一现的局外人，转而担任新成立的首席科学家职位（他一直保持这一头衔）。 2008年，时任首席技术官的Eric Klinker成为BitTorrent的首席执行官。克林克（Klinker）具有罕见的特质组合-他具有管理公司的人际交往能力，并且他在技术上非常敏锐，足以赢得科恩的尊重。 （这是一个特别高的标准。）</p><p> The original business idea didn’t take off, and for years the company cast about for promising alternatives. In 2008, having taken a third round of financing, the company admitted the business wasn’t “gaining significant traction” and agreed to recapitalize. It  returned the $17 million to investors and instead raised just $7 million — from the same investors — at a significantly reduced valuation. It was a sign the company was in trouble. Navin  left. And still, the company tried to make a go of it.</p><p> 最初的商业构想没有兴起，多年来，该公司一直在寻找有前途的替代方案。在2008年进行了第三轮融资后，该公司承认该业务并没有“获得很大的吸引力”，因此同意进行资本重组。它把1700万美元退还给了投资者，取而代之的是仅从同一位投资者那里筹集了700万美元，但估值大大降低了。这是公司陷入困境的迹象。纳文走了。而且，该公司仍在努力。 </p><p>  So went the life of BitTorrent. The company was headquartered in a gray office complex in San Francisco’s SOMA district. The executives tried strategies, hired people, experienced failures, and laid people off at regular intervals. A TechCrunch post from 2010 begins, “ Hmm, BitTorrent…that’s still around?”</p><p>BitTorrent的生活也是如此。该公司总部位于旧金山SOMA区的灰色办公大楼。高管们尝试策略，雇用人员，经历失败，并定期裁员。从2010年开始在TechCrunch上发布的帖子是：“嗯，BitTorrent ...还在吗？”</p><p>  The latest chapter of BitTorrent’s saga begins in earnest in 2015. By then, many of the company’s executives and directors were exhausted. They still couldn’t agree on a path forward for the company. Some people believed it should double down on its technical business, building products people loved. They’d developed a product called Sync, for example, which was a decentralized version of Dropbox. Others wanted it to be an entertainment company, striking deals to send content to those people. With no focus, the company had reached an impasse. Earlier that year, BitTorrent had laid off nearly a third of its 150 employees. That’s when Accel’s Ping Li decided he wanted out. He’d been invested in BitTorrent since 2006, when he led a $20 million round of financing. Back then, he’d been excited about the company’s potential. But after a decade in which it had failed to hatch a venture-size business, he couldn’t see a path forward. Says Li, “We couldn’t get excited by any of the plans after ten years. We thought the best way to support them is to let them do what they do.” Also, BitTorrent was among the last outstanding investments in the Accel fund that had had an early stake in Facebook and Dropbox, among others — possibly the best performing venture fund of all times — and the firm was looking to wrap it up.</p><p>  BitTorrent传奇故事的最新篇章始于2015年。那时，该公司的许多高管和董事已筋疲力尽。他们仍然不同意公司的发展方向。有人认为，它应该加倍努力发展自己喜欢的产品，从而发展其技术业务。例如，他们开发了一种名为Sync的产品，它是Dropbox的去中心化版本。其他人则希望它成为一家娱乐公司，达成交易以将内容发送给这些人。没有专心，公司陷入僵局。那年早些时候，BitTorrent裁掉了其150名员工中的近三分之一。那是Accel的Ping Li决定要退出的时候。从2006年开始领投2000万美元融资以来，他就一直投资于BitTorrent。那时，他对公司的潜力感到兴奋。但是，在经历了十年的失败之后，他看不到前进的道路。李说：“十年后，我们对任何计划都感到兴奋。我们认为，支持他们的最佳方法就是让他们做自己所做的事情。”此外，BitTorrent是Accel基金的最后一笔杰出投资之一，该基金曾在Facebook和Dropbox拥有早期股份，还有其他股票（可能是有史以来表现最好的风险基金），并且该公司正在寻求对其进行总结。</p><p> That’s when a group of investors offered to step in. They were familiar with BitTorrent because one of them, Jeremy Johnson, had been friendly with Klinker; the pair had worked together starting back in the late 1990s at the internet service provider Excite@Home, and had gone on to work on an Accel-backed routing startup together. By fall, the investors had obtained Accel’s stake in BitTorrent.</p><p> 那是一群投资者提出介入的时候。他们熟悉BitTorrent，因为其中一个人杰里米·约翰逊（Jeremy Johnson）对Klinker很友好。两人从1990年代后期开始在互联网服务提供商Excite @ Home一起工作，然后一起在Accel支持的路由初创公司中工作。到了秋天，投资者已经获得了Accel在BitTorrent的股份。</p><p>  By venture norms, this was an unusual transaction. Here’s how it worked: Johnson and his cousin, Robert Delamar, teamed with two others to start an investment company called DJS Acquisitions. They had no money to offer up front, but they volunteered a $10 million promissory note in exchange for Accel’s stake in BitTorrent as well as DAG’s remaining stake in the company. (DAG was a minority shareholder, having first invested also in 2008.) The plan was that DJS would repay the note in a year.</p><p>  按照风险准则，这是不寻常的交易。运作方式如下：约翰逊和他的堂兄罗伯特·德拉玛（Robert Delamar）与另外两个人合作，成立了一家名为DJS Acquisitions的投资公司。他们没有钱要提前提供，但他们自愿提供了1000万美元的期票，以换取Accel在BitTorrent中的股份以及DAG在公司中的剩余股份。 （DAG是少数股东，在2008年也进行了首次投资。）计划是DJS将在一年内偿还该票据。</p><p> It’s uncommon for an investment firm to exchange its shares for a promissory note. Why did this make sense for Accel and for BitTorrent? Well, for one, the DJS team articulated a plan for transforming BitTorrent into an entertainment company. Sure, it hadn’t worked before, but they showed up with new blood and new enthusiasm. Beyond that, it wasn’t clear Accel had other options. While some insiders said that Cohen had tried to buy parts of the company back himself, Accel’s Li didn’t feel there were other reasonable options on the table.</p><p> 投资公司将其股票换成期票的情况很少见。为什么这对Accel和BitTorrent有意义？好吧，DJS团队制定了一项将BitTorrent转变为娱乐公司的计划。当然，它以前没有用过，但是他们出现了新的血液和新的热情。除此之外，尚不清楚Accel是否还有其他选择。一些内部人士说，科恩曾试图自己回购公司的部分股份，但Accel的Li并不觉得桌上还有其他合理的选择。</p><p> Regardless, the resulting transaction gave the DJS team, which had not actually invested any capital yet, a good deal of power in the company. DJS inherited two of the company’s five occupied board seats, replacing Ping and the partner from DAG with Johnson and Delamar. It owned more than 50 percent of the company’s preferred shares, according to four people with direct knowledge of the company’s corporate structure. In other words, DJS was in control.</p><p> 无论如何，最终的交易使DJS团队（实际上尚未投入任何资金）给公司带来了很大的权力。 DJS继承了公司五个董事会席位中的两个席位，并用Johnson和Delamar取代了Ping和DAG的合伙人。据四名直接了解该公司公司结构的人士称，它拥有该公司50％以上的优先股。换句话说，DJS处于控制之中。</p><p> The four members of the DJS team had eclectic backgrounds. Two had come up in engineering: Johnson and Raj Vaswani, cofounder of Silver Spring Networks. The other two are in business together at a Vancouver-based startup called Pacific Future Energy. Its goal is to build an oil refinery in British Columbia. Delamar, a lawyer by training, was chief executive of this endeavor and is now a senior advisor, and Samer Salameh is executive chairman. Within a few months of their arrival, Klinker resigned as CEO. The board appointed Delamar and Johnson as co-CEOs, and they were free to pursue their strategy of turning BitTorrent into a Hollywood behemoth. By June, BitTorrent had divorced its media and enterprise businesses, spinning its Sync product into a standalone company called Resilio. Klinker runs it. Today, Resilio offers freemium software for companies.</p><p> DJS团队的四名成员具有折衷的背景。工程领域出现了两个：Silver Spring Networks的联合创始人Johnson和Raj Vaswani。另外两家在一家位于温哥华的初创公司Pacific Future Energy共同经营。它的目标是在不列颠哥伦比亚省建设一个炼油厂。 Delamar是一名受过培训的律师，曾担任这项工作的首席执行官，现在是高级顾问，而Samer Salameh是执行主席。在他们到达的几个月内，克林克辞去了首席执行官的职务。董事会任命德拉玛（Delamar）和约翰逊（Johnson）为联合首席执行官，他们可以自由选择将BitTorrent变成好莱坞巨兽的战略。到六月，BitTorrent已经与媒体和企业业务离婚，将其Sync产品合并为一家名为Resilio的独立公司。 Klinker运行它。今天，Resilio为公司提供免费增值软件。 </p><p>  Meanwhile, Johnson and Delamar moved quickly to realize what they believed to be BitTorrent’s media opportunity. Delamar made plans to open an office in Los Angeles, and began commuting between LA and Vancouver, where he lived in a two-bedroom rental in the Shangri-La Hotel building. Meanwhile, Johnson opened an engineering office near his San Diego home. (Neither of them made it regularly to the company’s San Francisco headquarters, in a gray office complex just South of Market Street.)</p><p>同时，Johnson和Delamar迅速采取行动，意识到他们认为BitTorrent的媒体机会。德拉玛制定了在洛杉矶开设办事处的计划，并开始在洛杉矶和温哥华之间上下班，在那里他住在香格里拉酒店大楼的两居室租金中。同时，约翰逊在圣地亚哥的家附近开设了一个工程办公室。 （他们俩都没有定期去公司位于旧金山市场街南面的灰色办公大楼的总部。）</p><p> They went on a hiring tear, boosting headcount by 26 percent between January and June, with most of the new hires in marketing and sales. They also brought in some of their own people as senior executives, a few of whom remained employed at Pacific Future Energy at the same time. Salameh, who is currently CEO and executive chairman of PFE, was paid a consulting fee by BitTorrent that totaled $154,000. Delamar, who remains a senior advisor to PFE, also hired Jeremy Friesen, who is PFE’s chief investment officer, as executive vice president of corporate development; Friesen worked for both companies simultaneously.</p><p> 他们一直在招聘，在1月到6月之间将员工人数增加了26％，大部分新员工都从事市场营销和销售。他们还引进了一些自己的高级管理人员，其中一些人同时仍在太平洋未来能源公司工作。 Salameh目前是PFE的首席执行官兼执行董事长，BitTorrent支付了总计154,000美元的咨询费。 Delamar仍然是PFE的高级顾问，还聘请了PFE的首席投资官Jeremy Friesen担任公司发展执行副总裁。弗里森同时为两家公司工作。</p><p>  The pair moved quickly — at great expense — to spread the word in Hollywood and beyond that BitTorrent was a smart option for distributing movies and music, one that allowed artists to be in control of their distribution and had the potential to reach large audiences. They hired Missy Laney, who had managed Sundance Institute’s Artist Services Program, to help woo filmmakers. They relaunched their platform intended to let artists distribute their work directly to fans, calling it BitTorrent Now. They hired the son of a former CNN anchor to start an online news outlet. They launched the Discovery Fund, promising up to $100,000 in grants to 25 aspiring artists. They even paid  a female motocross big truck driver, reportedly a friend of Johnson’s, $50,000 to plaster the company logo across the side of her truck.</p><p>  两人迅速行动-付出了巨大的代价-在好莱坞声名远播，除此之外，BitTorrent是发行电影和音乐的明智选择，它使艺术家可以控制发行并有可能吸引大量观众。他们聘请了管理圣丹斯音乐学院的艺术家服务计划的Missy Laney，来帮助吸引制片人。他们重新启动了旨在让艺术家将其作品直接分发给粉丝的平台，并将其称为BitTorrent Now。他们聘请了前CNN主播的儿子来开设在线新闻媒体。他们发起了探索基金，承诺向25位有抱负的艺术家提供高达100,000美元的赠款。他们甚至付给一位女的越野摩托车大卡车司机，据说是约翰逊的一个朋友，花了50,000美元，将公司徽标贴在卡车的侧面。</p><p> Even as BitTorrent’s ad revenue was apparently declining, Delamar spent much of his time trying to convince Hollywood producers that BitTorrent could deliver massive audiences and profits for their creative work. In an August email to X-Men producer Tom DeSanto that he shared with the entire company, Delamar suggested a plan to generate a billion dollars for DeSanto’s next project by releasing it via BitTorrent, writing, “Our goal is to do something that has never been done before here with you.” In an email, DeSanto told me the talks didn’t go anywhere, writing: “Bob was very excited by my ideas but I have no plans right now to partner with bit torrent.”</p><p> 尽管BitTorrent的广告收入明显下降，但Delamar仍花费大量时间试图说服好莱坞制片人，BitTorrent可以为他们的创意作品带来大量观众和利润。在八月份给X战警制作人汤姆·德桑托（Tom DeSanto）的电子邮件中，他与整个公司分享了这一消息，德拉玛提出了一项计划，通过BitTorrent发布该计划，为德桑托的下一个项目筹集十亿美元，他写道：“我们的目标是做从未做过的事情在这里之前已经完成了。”迪桑托在一封电子邮件中告诉我，谈判没有进行，写道：“鲍勃对我的想法感到非常兴奋，但我现在没有计划与比特流合作。”</p><p> By the end of the summer, it had become clear the strategy wasn’t working. The pair blew through more than a third of the company’s existing cash reserve, while revenues declined. BitTorrent had, for several years, maintained cash reserves of $33 million, give or take a few hundred thousand, according to financial documents shared with the board. By last July, the company had $14.9 million in cash, and forecasted ending the year with just more than $8 million in cash. The company had spent $10.1 million in the first six months of the year.</p><p> 到夏天结束时，该策略已失效。两人用尽了公司现有现金储备的三分之一，而收入却下降了。根据与董事会共享的财务文件，BitTorrent几年来一直保持着3,300万美元的现金储备，收受数十万美元。到去年7月，该公司拥有现金1490万美元，并预测到年底将有超过800万美元现金。该公司在今年前六个月的支出为1,010万美元。</p><p> Amid all of these efforts Cohen had little sway — and little interaction with the rest of people at the company he had created to make something of his invention. His equity had been so diluted that he had little voice; the professional investors controlled 70 percent of BitTorrent. And within the company itself, Cohen had no direct reports. For the last few years, he has poured his energy into BitTorrent Live, a technically complex piece of software that allows people to broadcast live directly to viewers. Quietly, over the summer, after several years of development, the company released the app in beta.</p><p> 在所有这些努力中，科恩几乎没有影响力，也没有与他为创造自己的发明而创建的公司中的其他人进行互动。他的财产被摊薄了，几乎没有声音。专业投资者控制了BitTorrent的70％。在公司内部，Cohen没有直接报告。在过去的几年中，他将精力投入了BitTorrent Live，这是一种技术复杂的软件，可让人们直接向观众直播。在经过数年的开发之后，该公司悄悄地在整个夏天发布了Beta版的应用程序。</p><p>  In October 2016, a year after DJS struck its deal with Accel, the promissory note came due. DJS reportedly was unable to pay. DCM’s David Chao, the remaining venture investor, reportedly stepped in to pay the note, assuming control of their shares — and affording three board seats to DCM. BitTorrent fired its newly impotent co-CEOs. Today, the company’s chief financial officer, Dipak Joshi, is interim CEO. Both Delamar and Johnson have left the company. BitTorrent has shuttered its LA production studio and San Diego office, and laid off a larger number of its staffers. The Discovery Fund that announced grants to artists in August has finally sent an email to all applicants saying the program has been suspended. (“ Sorry, Discovery fund has been scrapped out.”)</p><p>  在DJS与Accel达成交易的一年后的2016年10月，期票到期。据报道，DJS无法付款。据报道，DCM的余下的风险投资人David Chao接手了这笔票据，并控制了他们的股份，并为DCM提供了三个董事会席位。 BitTorrent解雇了新近无能为力的联合首席执行官。今天，该公司的首席财务官Dipak Joshi是临时首席执行官。德拉玛（Delamar）和约翰逊（Johnson）都已离开公司。 BitTorrent已关闭其洛杉矶生产工作室和圣地亚哥办事处，并裁员了更多员工。发现基金于八月宣布向艺术家提供资助，该基金终于向所有申请者发送了一封电子邮件，称该计划已被暂停。 （“抱歉，发现基金已报废。”） </p><p> It’s unclear what’s ahead for the company. I did, however, finally track down the creator of Children of the Machine,  Marco Weber, who told me he has finished writing the series and is currently shopping it in a more traditional manner. Anxious fans may one day get to see it after all, though likely not on BitTorrent.</p><p>目前尚不清楚该公司的发展方向。但是，我的确找到了《机器的孩子》的创建者Marco Weber，他告诉我他已经完成了该系列的编写，目前正在以一种更传统的方式进行购物。焦虑的粉丝终有一天可能会看到它，尽管可能不在BitTorrent上看到。</p><p> Nearly everyone to whom I spoke had a different perspective on what had gone wrong at the startup. Infighting. Profligate spending. Strategic mistakes. But to a person, every last one agreed on one thing: the technology that Cohen invented was brilliant. Said one person, “It’s a testament to Bram’s genius that no one has yet built a better trap for moving this big data over bad networks.”</p><p> 我与之交谈的几乎每个人对于创业公司出了什么问题都有不同的看法。内f。大量消费。战略性错误。但是对于一个人来说，最后一个人都同意一件事：科恩发明的技术非常出色。一位知情人士说：“这证明了布拉姆（Bram）的天才，没有人能为在坏网络上移动大数据建立更好的陷阱。”</p><p> Perhaps the lesson here is that sometimes technologies are not products. And they’re not companies. They’re just damn good technologies. Vint Cerf did not land a Google-size fortune for having helped invent the TCP/IP protocols that power the Internet (though he did get the  U.S. National Medal of Technology). What’s more, to be successful, a startup requires both a great idea for a product or service, and a great idea for how to make money off of it. One without the other will fail.</p><p> 也许这里的教训是，有时技术不是产品。他们不是公司。他们只是该死的好技术。 Vint Cerf因帮助发明了为互联网提供动力的TCP / IP协议而获得了Google般的财富（尽管他确实获得了美国国家技术勋章）。此外，要想成功，创业公司既需要对产品或服务的好主意，也需要如何从中获利的好主意。一个没有另一个将失败。</p><p>  Then again, like so many other zombie startups littering Silicon Valley, BitTorrent is not dead yet. Just before the holidays, Cohen’s BitTorrent Live app debuted in the app store.</p><p>  再说一次，就像许多其他的僵尸公司在硅谷乱扔垃圾一样，BitTorrent尚未死。假期即将来临之前，科恩的BitTorrent Live应用在应用商店中首次亮相。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/the-inside-story-of-bittorrents-bizarre-collapse/">https://www.wired.com/2017/01/the-inside-story-of-bittorrents-bizarre-collapse/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/bizarre/">#bizarre</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
