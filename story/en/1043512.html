The idea of rocketing from New York to Los Angeles in an ostensible attempt to protest national speed limits feels so dated that  even  Car and Driver isn&#39;t hyped on it anymore. Today, rocketing across the country in a  high-horsepower German sled stuffed with fuel cells in search of YouTube glory is certainly an achievement, but it&#39;s also quite a liability, especially when you&#39;re averaging speeds in the triple-digits and topping out within a school zone&#39;s reach of 200 mph. This is especially true since the COVID-19 pandemic began and incredibly low times were being set as people  took advantage of empty roads.</p><p>  炮弹逃跑-可能是非正式的记录-从未像从前那样被看过。从表面上试图从纽约飞抵洛杉矶以抗议国家限速的想法已经过时，以至于甚至连汽车和驾驶员都不再大肆宣传。如今，乘坐装满燃料电池的高马力德国雪橇在全国范围内飞跃寻找YouTube的荣耀无疑是一项成就，但这也是一个很大的责任，尤其是当您将三倍速度的平均速度位数字并在200英里/小时的学区范围内达到最高水平。尤其如此，因为COVID-19大流行开始了，人们利用空旷的道路使人们陷入了难以置信的低潮。</p><p> Despite that, I&#39;m here to tell you the story of a team that&#39;s broken a different kind of Cannonball Run record: the electric vehicle record. And if this story were just about a Tesla breaking the record currently held by another Tesla, we probably wouldn&#39;t have run it. But it&#39;s more than that. This is the first time that a non-Tesla EV has beaten the king of Supercharging in a transcontinental trek across the U.S.</p><p> 尽管如此，我还是在这里向您介绍一个团队的故事，该团队打破了另一种Cannonball Run记录：电动车记录。如果这个故事只是关于一个特斯拉打破了另一个特斯拉目前的记录，我们可能就不会运行它。但是，不仅如此。这是非特斯拉（Tesla）电动汽车首次在全美跨洲旅行中击败超级充电之王。</p><p>   In the early morning hours on New Year&#39;s Eve, with a full battery and two bright-eyed co-drivers, automotive journalist Kyle Conner from   InsideEVs readied a Porsche Taycan 4S—and a press test car Taycan, at that—in front of the Red Ball Parking Garage in New York City. The Taycan was equipped with the smallest and lightest possible wheels to maximize efficiency for the cross-country road trip, and plush with amenities like massaging seats, active suspension management, and an ultra-quiet cabin—everything that would make the drive properly comfortable.</p><p>   在除夕的清晨，InsideEVs的汽车记者凯尔·康纳（Kyle Conner）带着充足的电池和两名明亮的副驾驶员，在那准备了保时捷Taycan 4S和媒体测试车Taycan。在纽约市的红球停车场。 Taycan配备了尽可能最小和最轻的车轮，以最大限度地提高越野旅行的效​​率，并为长毛绒配备了按摩座椅，主动悬架管理和超静音机舱等便利设施，所有这些都使驱动器正常舒适。</p><p> &#34;I had the vehicle loaned to me for various EV tests that I do,&#34; Conner told me, explaining that Porsche had originally loaned them the Taycan to perform some real-world range testing. &#34;This was an idea that came up after the loan was set up. While it is pretty crazy to do it in a press car, we could have borrowed a car from a friend—[Porsche] just had a better spec for us to use.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我将汽车借给了我进行的各种EV测试，＆＃34;康纳（Conner）告诉我，他解释说，保时捷最初是借给他们Taycan进行一些真实世界范围的测试的。 ＆＃34;这个想法是在贷款成立后产生的。虽然在新闻车上做这件事非常疯狂，但我们可以向朋友借来一辆车-[Porsche]有了更好的规格供我们使用。＆＃34;</p><p> After all, the crew calculated that they would, at best, make the run in around 42 hours and change—and that&#39;s a lot of time for three dudes to spend cramped in the cabin of a car together. That left less than three hours to beat  Conner&#39;s existing record of 45 hours and 16 minutes set in a Tesla Model 3 Long Range that he set in 2019 with then-co-driver Matthew Davis.</p><p> 毕竟，乘务员计算得出，他们充其量只能在42小时左右内完成跑步并进行更改-这是三个家伙花很多时间在一起挤在车厢里的时间。剩下不到三个小时的时间就打破了康纳现有的45小时16分钟的纪录，这是他在2019年与当时的副驾驶马修·戴维斯（Matthew Davis）共同创造的特斯拉Model 3 Long Range。</p><p> But with his two trusty wheelmen, Drew Peterson and Tijmen Schreur, at his side, Conner thought the team had the ability to make the drive—but what he didn&#39;t have was the confidence that they would be able to do it in record time simply due to the available charging options.</p><p> 但是，康纳（Conner）在他两个值得信赖的方向盘驾驶员Drew Peterson和Tijmen Schreur的陪伴下，认为车队有能力制造赛车，但是他没有的信心是他们能够做到这一点。仅仅由于可用的充电选项就可以记录时间。 </p><p>  Allow me to explain. You&#39;re likely familiar with Tesla&#39;s fast-charging stations across the United States called  Superchargers. It&#39;s probably the most robust charging network, at the moment. These stations use proprietary connectors that don&#39;t really adhere to more universal  standards like the CCS or J1772, meaning cars like the Taycan won&#39;t be able to make use of them like a Tesla would. I won&#39;t go too in-depth about the shortfalls of the U.S. charging infrastructure here, but I&#39;d  invite you to read a great piece that  The Drive contributor John Voelcker wrote just last month which included that very topic.</p><p>请允许我解释一下。您可能熟悉特斯拉在美国境内称为Superchargers的快速充电站。目前，它可能是功能最强大的充电网络。这些站点使用专有的连接器，它们实际上并没有遵守CCS或J1772等更通用的标准，这意味着Taycan之类的汽车将无法像特斯拉那样使用它们。在这里，我不会对美国充电基础设施的不足进行深入探讨，但是我邀请您阅读《云端硬盘》撰稿人约翰·沃克尔（John Voelcker）上个月写的一篇很棒的文章，其中包括这个主题。</p><p> Long story short, the lack of consistent, working, and up-to-date public charging options makes a Tesla extremely attractive for road tripping. Something like a Taycan? Not so much. Combined that with the EPA claiming that the  Taycan&#39;s range is nearly half what the Model 3 Long Range can achieve, and you don&#39;t exactly have a recipe for success.</p><p> 长话短说，缺乏一致的，可行的和最新的公共充电选项，使得特斯拉对于公路出行极为有吸引力。像泰肯人吗？没那么多。再加上EPA声称Taycan的射程几乎是Model 3 Long Range可以达到的射程的一半，而您并没有成功的秘诀。</p><p>   Typically, Conner doesn&#39;t plan out his routes when testing electric cars for efficiency, let alone on runs across the country. But this time was different. He&#39;d be taking the Porsche from coast-to-coast using whatever public chargers were available. So he began using tools like Chargeway,  A Better Route Planner,  Plugshare, and the  Electrify America site in order to plan out his journey.</p><p>   通常，康纳（Conner）在测试电动汽车的效率时不会计划自己的路线，更不用说在全国范围内的行驶了。但是这次不一样。他将使用任何可用的公共充电器将保时捷从海岸带到海岸。因此，他开始使用Chargeway，A Better Route Planner，Plugshare和Electrify America网站之类的工具来计划行程。</p><p> As he began his career as an amateur cartographer, he noticed that many of the chargers on the way could only provide between 50 and 100 kilowatts of electricity, meaning that they would take quite some time to charge versus an average  Tesla Supercharger. It was at that point the team elected to use Electrify America&#39;s stations for the drive.</p><p> 当他以业余制图师的职业生涯开始时，他注意到途中的许多充电器只能提供50至100千瓦的电量，这意味着与普通的Tesla Supercharger相比，它们需要花费一些时间才能充电。当时，该团队选择使用Electrify America的站点进行驱动。</p><p> &#34;The supercharger network is near seamless, and I use it almost on a daily basis,&#34; Conner told me, noting that he owns a Tesla. &#34;We hoped that the CCS EA network would be up to snuff to handle our drive, and while we did have issues, it got us to LA quicker than the Tesla Supercharger Network did even considering the Tesla run (I also held that record) was in a much more efficient car in the middle of summer.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;增压器网络几乎是无缝的，我几乎每天都在使用它，＆＃34;康纳告诉我，他拥有一辆特斯拉。 ＆＃34;我们希望CCS EA网络能够轻松应对我们的行驶，尽管确实有问题，但即使考虑到Tesla的运行，它也能比Tesla Supercharger Network更快地将我们带到洛杉矶（我也认为记录）是在夏天中旬驾驶一辆效率更高的汽车。</p><p> Once Conner and company had their route planned out, it was time to hit the road.</p><p> 一旦Conner和公司计划好路线，就该出发了。</p><p>  I know what you&#39;re wondering—if the Taycan had an in-car navigation system that could plan our charging stops, why not just use that? After all,  Electrify America was founded by Volkswagen following its Dieselgate debacle, and since Porsche is a Volkswagen Group company,  surely the two products play nicely together.</p><p>  我知道您在想什么，如果Taycan拥有可以计划我们充电站的车载导航系统，为什么不使用它呢？毕竟，在Dieselgate惨败之后，Electrify America由大众汽车创立。由于保时捷是大众汽车集团旗下的一家公司，因此这两种产品无疑可以完美地结合在一起。 </p><p> You&#39;re right to assume this. But this was the first of several Taycan-related snags that almost cost the team the record.</p><p>您认为这是正确的。但这是与Taycan相关的几次障碍中的第一个，几乎使车队付出了创纪录的代价。</p><p> Just before the team set out, the Taycan&#39;s navigation system lost track of where they were. For some reason, the car just assumed that they were in Ohio no matter what state they were actually in. The Taycan was taken to the dealer in an attempt to fix the flaw before the run, but the service team was unable to solve the problem the day before they set out. Conner would have to make do.</p><p> 在团队出发之前，Taycan的导航系统就无法追踪他们的位置。出于某种原因，无论他们处于何种状态，汽车都只是假定他们在俄亥俄州。Taycan被带到经销商处试图修复缺陷，但服务团队无法解决问题。他们出发的前一天。康纳将不得不做。</p><p> In case 2020 had you living in a Groundhog Day-style loop, let me remind you that it&#39;s winter here in the northeast. A mild one, sure but it&#39;s still quite cold, and if you happen to drive anything battery-powered, it quickly becomes apparent how much the cold affects your overall range and charging speeds. Fortunately, Porsche has a feature that preconditions the battery to charge quickly when plugged in.</p><p> 如果2020年您生活在“土拨鼠日”风格的循环中，让我提醒您，这是东北的冬天。一定要温和，但是仍然很冷，如果您碰巧用电池供电，那么很快就会意识到冷对您的整个续航里程和充电速度有多大影响。幸运的是，保时捷具有一项功能，可以在插入电源时对电池进行快速充电。</p><p> But there&#39;s just one problem: the same software glitch responsible for the navigation issues also meant that the Porsche wouldn&#39;t know when it was being routed to a charger. That meant no preconditioning unless Conner selected one of the chargers in the area near Columbus, Ohio where the Taycan thought it was.</p><p> 但是只有一个问题：负责导航问题的相同软件故障也意味着，保时捷不知道何时将其路由到充电器。除非Conner在俄亥俄州哥伦布市附近的Taycan认为是的地方选择了其中一种充电器，否则就无需进行预处理。</p><p> Fortunately, there&#39;s also a manual option to accomplish the same feat—the accelerator pedal. Giving the car a ripe awakening when on the way to a charging station means that the battery was warm and ready to receive the sweet, sweet electrons that it needed to continue along its path.</p><p> 幸运的是，还有一个手动选项可实现相同的壮举-油门踏板。在前往充电站的途中给汽车一个成熟的苏醒，意味着电池很温暖，可以接收继续行驶所需的甜美的电子。</p><p>   Another problem was the charger. The CCS standard operates in accordance with the  Open System Interconnection conceptual model—that is, a set of standards that break out the way communication is established, maintained, and ended between the vehicle and the charger. It&#39;s the same theory that is used to visualize how traffic from your computer talks to other devices on your home network. The software responsible for handling the charging makes the connection during the &#34;Presentation&#34; level of this model, where it establishes a &#34;handshake&#34; between the two devices using a common protocol. This process in its entirety takes around 45 seconds.</p><p>   另一个问题是充电器。 CCS标准根据开放系统互连概念模型进行操作，也就是说，这套标准打破了车辆与充电器之间建立，维护和终止通信的方式。它是用于可视化计算机流量与家庭网络中其他设备的通讯方式的相同理论。负责处理收费的软件会在“演示文稿”期间进行连接。级别的模型，在其中建立＆＃34;握手＆＃34;在两个设备之间使用通用协议。整个过程大约需要45秒。</p><p> Conner tells us that the Porsche was doing something wrong during this process and would instantly tell the Electrify America charger that the car wanted as much power as it possibly could throw at it. So, naturally, the charger did just that and attempted to send its maximum 350-kW to the car, of which the Taycan could only accept 270-kW. This lead to some anomalies while charging, the team reported.</p><p> 康纳（Conner）告诉我们，保时捷在此过程中做错了事，并立即告诉美国电气化充电器（Electrify America），该车需要尽可能多的动力。因此，充电器自然就这样做了，并试图将最大350千瓦的功率发送给汽车，而Taycan只能接受270千瓦的功率。该团队报告说，这导致充电时出现一些异常。 </p><p> Fortunately, Conner tells us that he had the engineers at both Porsche and Electrify America on speed dial for this run. Despite it being New Year&#39;s Eve, he was able to work with the teams to ensure that the car was operating to its potential (despite the bugs) and the chargers he was visiting were both working and reliable.</p><p>幸运的是，康纳（Conner）告诉我们，他的保时捷和Electrify America的工程师都为此进行了快速拨号。尽管已经是除夕夜，他仍然能够与车队合作，以确保汽车能够发挥其潜力（尽管存在漏洞），并且他所拜访的充电器都可以正常工作并且可靠。</p><p> &#34;Our engineers were able to monitor the charging sessions in real-time to ensure our 150 and 350-kilowatt chargers were performing optimally for the Porsche Taycan 4S on this record run,&#34; Electrify America said in a statement to  The Drive. &#34;We plan to connect with the record-run drive team and hear their detailed feedback so that we can continue to improve our charging services for the general public.”</p><p> ＆＃34;我们的工程师能够实时监控充电过程，以确保我们的150和350千瓦充电器在此记录运行中对于保时捷Taycan 4S表现最佳。 《美国电气化》在致辞中说。 ＆＃34;我们计划与唱片公司的驱动团队保持联系，并听取他们的详细反馈，以便我们可以继续改善为大众提供的充电服务。”</p><p>   Despite the setbacks and software problems, the Taycan proved to be a massively capable road-tripping machine. Its interior was near-silent, provided a fantastic ride quality, and even had massaging seats—the epitome of a German luxury sedan meant to break records like this.</p><p>   尽管遇到了挫折和软件问题，Taycan仍然被证明是一台功能强大的断路机。它的内部几乎是无声的，提供了出色的乘坐质量，甚至还设有按摩座椅，这是德国豪华轿车的缩影，意在打破这样的记录。</p><p> Now, it wasn&#39;t like Kyle and the team had to put the pedal to the metal in order to make this run in record time. Remember that EVs are more efficient at  lower speeds. In fact, the average speed of the run was right around 64 MPH, though that accounts for charging time as well, so it may have been a little bit higher.</p><p> 现在，它不像凯尔（Kyle），车队不得不踩下踏板，以便在创纪录的时间内完成比赛。请记住，电动车在低速行驶时效率更高。实际上，平均运行速度约为64 MPH，尽管这也占了充电时间，所以它可能要高一些。</p><p> That&#39;s not to say that they didn&#39;t push the car either. Kyle told me that his team did use speed to their advantage, but not necessarily aimed at getting from A-to-B faster. It was also used to precondition the battery when approaching a charging station since the software problems with the car prevented it from automatically taking place. At their height, they hit around 160 MPH, which is incredibly close to the  Taycan&#39;s top speed. Conner, understandably, declined to specify where that happened.</p><p> 这并不是说他们也没有开车。凯尔（Kyle）告诉我，他的团队确实利用速度发挥了自己的优势，但不一定旨在更快地从A到B。它也可以在接近充电站时对电池进行预处理，因为汽车的软件问题阻止了它的自动发生。在最高时，它们达到了约160 MPH，这非常接近Taycan的最高速度。可以理解，康纳拒绝透露发生的地点。</p><p> To mitigate downtime and ensure fatigue, drivers were able to swap out from the front seat to the rear for a quick little nap. They&#39;d crouch over a pillow, close their eyes, and wake up as refreshed as you could with for a car nap. Conner told us that he once fell asleep in the passenger seat during a long stint, but we&#39;re going to assume that the massaging seats had a hand in that one.</p><p> 为了减少停机时间并确保疲劳，驾驶员能够从前排座椅换到后排，以快速打个na。他们蹲在枕头上，闭上眼睛，醒来时可以尽可能地小睡。康纳（Conner）告诉我们，他曾经在很长一段时间内在乘客座位上入睡，但是我们将假设按摩座位在那个座位上有帮助。</p><p> The trio stayed in their bubble of safety for nearly the entirety of the cross-country sprint, a refreshing thought during the current pandemic. And should they need to go near anyone while charging or taking a quick rest stop, they were sure to take the typical COVID-19 precautions, including wearing masks.</p><p> 这三人在整个越野冲刺中几乎停留在安全泡沫中，这是当前大流行期间令人耳目一新的想法。并且如果他们需要在充电或快速休息时靠近任何人，请确保他们采取典型的COVID-19预防措施，包括戴口罩。 </p><p> The electric Porsche crossed the threshold at the Portofino Hotel &amp; Marina sometime in the evening on New Years Day—just 44 hours, 25 minutes, and 59 seconds after the group set out, shattering the existing record held by the Tesla.</p><p>电动保时捷在柏涛菲诺酒店（Portofino Hotel＆amp; amp;）跨过门槛。在元旦那天晚上的某个时候，Marina出发了-小组出发后仅44小时25分59秒，打破了特斯拉保持的现有记录。</p><p>   &#34;Though Porsche Cars North America does not condone, promote, or acknowledge any sort of activity that would violate the rules of the road, we were pleased to see how well the Taycan and the charging infrastructure did during Kyle’s test,&#34; a Porsche spokesperson said in an email to  The Drive. &#34;It demonstrated the proliferation of EA’s ever-developing nationwide charging infrastructure as well as the over-the-road capability of the Taycan. Though it carries the soul of a sports car, the Taycan is just as comfortable driving over long distances.&#34;</p><p>   ＆＃34;尽管北美保时捷汽车公司不容忍，促进或承认任何可能违反道路规则的活动，但我们很高兴看到Taycan和充电基础设施在Kyle的测试中做得如何，＆＃ 34;保时捷发言人在给The Drive的电子邮件中说。 ＆＃34;它显示了EA不断发展的全国性充电基础设施的泛滥以及Taycan的越野能力。尽管Taycan承载了跑车的灵魂，但它在长距离行驶时也一样舒适。＆＃34;</p><p> When I first heard of Conner&#39;s record-breaking attempt, I thought for sure it was going to be in another Tesla. I was amazed that he had actually done the run in a Taycan—not because it is any less of a car, but because the Supercharging network is marketed as an essential part of owning a Tesla vehicle. It&#39;s like buying a Mac because &#34; it just works.&#34;</p><p> 当我第一次听说Conner打破纪录的尝试时，我以为肯定会在另一辆特斯拉中。让我感到惊讶的是，他实际上是在Taycan上进行跑步的-并不是因为它少了一辆车，而是因为超级充电网络被推销为拥有Tesla车辆的重要组成部分。就像购买Mac一样，因为它就可以了。＆＃34;</p><p> In fact, it was one of the reasons I almost bought a Model 3 last year and has consistently been one of the biggest reasons Tesla owners I&#39;ve spoken with pulled the trigger on their own cars.</p><p> 实际上，这是我去年几乎购买Model 3的原因之一，一直以来都是我与特斯拉车主交谈的最大理由之一。</p><p> On the other hand, it&#39;s not all that surprising. In fact, I  predicted this very event would happen using a Taycan back in August, specifically through the use of Electrify America chargers. To see it actually take shape and a Porsche beat out a Tesla using public charging is pretty incredible.</p><p> 另一方面，这并不令人惊讶。实际上，我预测八月份使用Taycan会发生这种情况，特别是通过使用Electrify America充电器。看到它真正成形，保时捷通过公共充电击败特斯拉，真是不可思议。</p><p>   This is just the start for ambitious cross-country EV trips. Public charging networks as a whole, despite various quirks and a profound lack of marketing, certainly seems like it has improved since inception. After all, if a Porsche Taycan can travel from coast to coast without running out of charge, it feels like it&#39;s headed in the right direction for the growing number of EVs hitting the streets. Charging infrastructure and new EVs on the road will always pose a  hotdog-and-bun scenario, but amid a critical time where EVs are becoming increasingly popular and more available from legacy automakers, a test like this inspires confidence.</p><p>   这只是雄心勃勃的越野EV旅行的开始。整个公共收费网络，尽管有各种古怪之处，而且市场营销严重不足，但自成立以来似乎似乎已经有所改善。毕竟，如果保时捷Taycan可以在不耗电的情况下从一个海岸到另一个海岸行驶，那么随着越来越多的电动汽车上街，感觉就像朝着正确的方向前进。在道路上给基础设施充电和新电动汽车充电总是会遇到麻烦，但在关键时刻，电动汽车变得越来越受欢迎，而传统汽车制造商也越来越多地购买电动汽车，这样的测试激发了人们的信心。</p><p> The day will likely come when a cross-country trip in an EV is nothing to boast about, and maybe sooner than you think. Until then, records are meant to be broken. Don&#39;t expect this crew to be the last to make this attempt.</p><p> 电动汽车越野旅行无可厚非，也许比您想象的要早。在此之前，记录将被破坏。不要期望这个工作人员会成为最后一次尝试的人。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/38578/a-porsche-taycan-just-beat-tesla-for-the-fastest-ev-cannonball-run-record">https://www.thedrive.com/news/38578/a-porsche-taycan-just-beat-tesla-for-the-fastest-ev-cannonball-run-record</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/特斯拉/">#特斯拉</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/炮弹/">#炮弹</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/taycan/">#taycan</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
