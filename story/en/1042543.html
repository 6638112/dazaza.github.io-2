When I would talk to someone about an idea, I found myself not understanding a word they were saying.’</p><p>罗杰·彭罗斯爵士（Roger Penrose）上学时就意识到自己的思维方式异常。 “我想，也许当我上大学时，我会找到像我一样思考的人，”在一场有趣的谈话开始之初，一直持续到下午，他告诉我。 ‘但是根本不是那样。当我和某人谈一个想法时，我发现自己听不懂他们在说什么。’</p><p> Just after we spoke, in early December, Penrose received the Nobel Prize in Physics, so perhaps it’s no surprise that he should think a little differently. But, as he explained it to me, his mind is unusually visual. Penrose’s father Lionel was an artist as well as a psychiatrist and mathematician, and a great influence on Roger. Father and son used to go for long walks together in search of things to draw. ‘I liked to do realistic pictures, but sometimes I would branch out and do more surrealistic things. I would fill my notebooks with all sorts of distorted pictures and interlocking faces and goodness knows what,’ says Penrose. But this meant trouble in exams. ‘If you’re doing algebra, you just write down the answer. But for geometric or visual work, you have to translate it into words. That takes time. Often the visual people literally don’t finish the papers. The result is that algebraic people do better in exams, so you find more of them at universities.’ On the upside, the tendency to work through mathematics with the aid of a mental image has contributed to some of his most important breakthroughs, including his Nobel-winning work on black holes.</p><p> 就在我们发言之后，即12月初，彭罗斯（Penrose）获得了诺贝尔物理学奖，所以也许他会有所不同就不足为奇了。但是，正如他向我解释的那样，他的头脑异常直观。彭罗斯（Penrose）的父亲莱昂内尔（Lionel）既是艺术家，还是精神病学家和数学家，对罗杰（Roger）产生了重大影响。父亲和儿子过去常常一起散步以寻找绘画的东西。 ‘我喜欢拍摄逼真的图片，但有时我会分支并做更多超现实的事情。彭罗斯说：“我会在笔记本上摆满各种扭曲的图片和环环相扣的东西，天哪知道什么。”但这意味着考试很麻烦。 ‘如果您正在做代数，您只需写下答案。但是对于几何或视觉作品，您必须将其翻译成文字。这需要时间。通常，有视觉见识的人实际上不会完成论文。结果是，代数人的考试成绩更好，因此在大学中可以找到更多的人。”好的方面是，借助心理形象进行数学研究的趋势促成了他的一些最重要的突破，包括黑洞方面的诺贝尔奖得主。</p><p> The term ‘black hole’ refers to a massive object that warps space-time to the extent that nothing, not even light, can escape. At its centre is a point called a singularity, where the density is infinite and physics itself breaks down. The existence of singularities and black holes had originally been derived from Einstein’s theory of general relativity, but in the 1960s many physicists still dismissed the idea. Penrose ultimately showed that singularities are inevitable, with the implication that black holes are common in the universe.</p><p> “黑洞”一词指的是一个巨大的物体，它使时空扭曲到一定程度，甚至没有光可以逃逸。它的中心是一个叫做奇点的点，密度是无限的，物理学本身就崩溃了。奇异性和黑洞的存在最初源自爱因斯坦的广义相对论，但是在1960年代，许多物理学家仍然不赞成这个想法。彭罗斯最终证明了奇点是不可避免的，这暗示着黑洞在宇宙中很普遍。</p><p> ‘Some of the ideas came from a walk in the woods, where I imagined myself in a black hole, as we now call it, collapsing,’ said Penrose. ‘I was thinking about when the density gets big and wondering under what criterion it got too big. And I realised that it couldn’t be a local criterion. It must be something non-local.’ Penrose’s insight was that, to understand black holes, he had to consider the large-scale connections of space-time, rather than relying on information near the observer.</p><p> 彭罗斯说：“有些想法来自在树林里散步，我想象自己陷入了一个黑洞，现在我们崩溃了。” ‘我正在考虑密度何时变大，并想知道在什么条件下密度变大。我意识到这不能成为当地标准。彭罗斯的见解是，要理解黑洞，他必须考虑时空的大规模联系，而不是依赖观察者附近的信息。</p><p> ‘An even more important moment came when I was talking to a colleague while walking to my office. We came to a side street and as we crossed it our conversation stopped. Then we got to the other side and we started talking again.’ When he reached his office, Penrose felt in high spirits, but he couldn’t work out why. ‘I felt great about something. I tried to work through everything that had happened to me during the day. What did I have for breakfast? No, it wasn’t that. What was it? Then it came to me.’</p><p> ‘更重要的时刻来到了，当我走路去办公室时与同事交谈时。我们来到一条小巷，过马路时我们的谈话停止了。然后我们到了另一边，我们又开始交谈。’当他到达办公室时，彭罗斯（Penrose）情绪高昂，但他不知道为什么。 ‘我对某件事感觉很好。我试图解决白天发生的所有事情。我早餐吃了什么？不，不是那样的。它以前如何？然后它来到了我。’</p><p>  Penrose remembered that he had been speaking with his colleague about ‘trapped surfaces’, on which all light rays converge. Using trapped surfaces, he was able to show that hidden behind every black hole must lie a singularity. The brilliance of Penrose’s argument was that you don’t need to know much about the details of the problem to get the conclusion of a singularity, just the existence of a trapped surface.</p><p>  彭罗斯（Penrose）记得他曾与他的同事谈论过“被困表面”，所有光线都在该表面会聚。通过使用陷获的表面，他能够证明隐藏在每个黑洞后面的必须是一个奇异点。彭罗斯（Penrose）论点的精妙之处在于，您无需对问题的细节了解太多即可得出奇异性的结论，而只需存在被困表面即可。</p><p> With characteristic modesty, however, Penrose suggests that the committee in Stockholm may have jumped the gun. ‘I never proved black holes could be there, generically. What I proved was that singularities had to be there.’</p><p> 然而，彭罗斯本着谦虚的态度建议，斯德哥尔摩委员会可能已经开枪了。 ‘一般来说，我从来没有证明黑洞可能在那里。我证明了必须存在奇点。’ </p><p> Cosmology is just one of Penrose’s interests. He has also thought deeply about consciousness and artificial intelligence. There’s a lot of hype about AI flying around these days, including the recent report that scientists at DeepMind have used it to ‘solve’ protein folding. Yet for decades, Penrose has been consistent in his scepticism about the grand claims made for AI’s potential.</p><p>宇宙学只是Penrose的兴趣之一。他还对意识和人工智能进行了深思。这些天来，关于AI的热潮大肆宣传，包括最近的报道，DeepMind的科学家已经使用它来“解决”蛋白质折叠。然而几十年来，彭罗斯一直对AI的巨大主张持怀疑态度。</p><p> He mentions  The Imitation Game, the movie about Alan Turing’s wartime code-breaking at Bletchley Park. The film’s name refers to a test of artificial intelligence developed by Turing. A computer and a person are concealed behind a screen and a third party offers written questions to each in an attempt to judge from their answers which one of them is human. Penrose took this test twice, and says the computer was hopeless. ‘The first time I sort of gave up, because the computer really had no conception of what I was trying to say. The second time, I said, “I believe we’ve met before”. Complete blank.’</p><p> 他提到《模仿游戏》，这部电影讲述了艾伦·图灵在布莱奇利公园的战时密码破解问题。电影的名称是指由图灵开发的一项人工智能测试。一台计算机和一个人被藏在屏幕后面，而第三方则向每个人提供书面问题，试图从他们的回答中判断出哪个是人类。彭罗斯（Penrose）两次接受了这项测试，并说这台计算机毫无希望。 ‘我第一次放弃了，因为计算机真的不了解我要说的话。我第二次说：“我相信我们以前见过”。填写空白。’</p><p> Nevertheless, others are not so sure that humans will continue to have the upper hand. In 2015, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and others signed the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, calling for research into the potentially catastrophic consequences of the so-called technological singularity. This refers to the moment when machines will achieve artificial general intelligence. According to  Terminator 2: Judgment Day, this was going to happen on 29 August 1997, when Skynet — an artificial neural network capable of rapid learning — would become self-aware.</p><p> 然而，其他人并不确定人是否会继续占据上风。 2015年，斯蒂芬·霍金（Stephen Hawking），埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）等人签署了《人工智能公开信》，呼吁研究所谓的技术奇异性可能带来的灾难性后果。这是指机器将实现人工智能的时刻。根据《终结者2：审判日》的说法，这将发生在1997年8月29日，当时天网（一种能够快速学习的人工神经网络）将变得自我意识。</p><p> Penrose doubts it will ever happen. ‘In any case, I think we’ve already passed the singular moments most experts were predicting, right? They keep pushing it to later!’ His big concern about AI isn’t Judgment Day, but rather ‘that people will believe machines actually understand things’. He gives examples of symmetrical chess configurations in which humans consistently outperform computers by abstracting to a higher level in which a proof of a draw becomes clear. This abstraction to different levels is key to scientific research. The inability of machines to abstract in this way doesn’t bode well for the prospect of their surprising us with original insights.</p><p> 彭罗斯怀疑它是否会发生。 ‘无论如何，我认为我们已经度过了大多数专家预测的时刻，对吗？他们一直将它推向更高的位置！’他对AI的最大关注不是“审判日”，而是“人们会相信机器真正理解了事物”。他举例说明了对称的象棋配置，在这种配置中，人类通过抽象化到更高的级别（使抽奖的证明变得清晰），始终胜过计算机。这种不同层次的抽象是科学研究的关键。机器无法以这种方式进行抽象，对于以原始见解给我们带来惊喜的前景而言，并不是好兆头。</p><p> Penrose’s book  Shadows of the Mind — a grand tour of computation, consciousness, algorithms, quantum theory and the brain — is, for me, still the most thrilling introduction to AI and its limits. It isn’t only the clarity of Penrose’s explanations that makes it compelling. There’s a restless curiosity running throughout the book which I believe is essential to creativity.</p><p> 彭罗斯（Penrose）的著作《心灵的阴影》（Shadows of Mind）对计算，意识，算法，量子理论和大脑进行了一次巡回演出，对我而言，这仍然是对AI及其极限的最激动人心的介绍。吸引人的不仅是彭罗斯的解释清楚。我相信整本书都充满着不安的好奇心，这对创造力至关重要。</p><p> One of the paradoxes of research is that, time and again, the most far-reaching discoveries are made not by focusing on the practical problems of the day but by following your curiosity. Put another way, when your work, and what you do to avoid it, become the same thing, that’s when the breakthroughs come. Penrose tells a story that illustrates this perfectly. ‘Someone had invited me to give a talk at London South Bank University and I was really overdue with my reply. Instead of replying, all I could do was stare at the university logo on the letterhead: a pentagon with five pentagons around it.’ What bothered Penrose was that there were gaps between the external pentagons. Unlike hexagons, pentagons don’t fit together seamlessly.</p><p> 研究的悖论之一是，一次又一次地，最深远的发现不是通过关注当今的实际问题，而是通过好奇心而做出的。换句话说，当您的工作以及为避免工作要做的事情成为同一件事时，那就是突破。彭罗斯（Penrose）讲的一个故事很好地说明了这一点。 ‘有人邀请我在伦敦南岸大学发表演讲，我的答复真的过期了。我没有做任何回信，只是盯着信笺上的大学徽标：一个五边形，周围有五个五边形。’Penrose感到困扰的是，外部五边形之间存在间隙。与六边形不同，五边形不能无缝地组合在一起。</p><p> He began wondering what new shapes would be required so he could fill in the gaps, and then extend the pattern without new gaps arising. It seemed it wasn’t possible with just one new shape. After a while, he had worked out a way to solve the puzzle using six new shapes. But Penrose wasn’t satisfied with six.</p><p> 他开始怀疑需要什么新形状，以便可以填补空白，然后扩展图案而不会出现新的空白。似乎只有一种新形状是不可能的。过了一会儿，他找到了一种使用六个新形状来解决难题的方法。但是彭罗斯对六个都不满意。 </p><p> ‘I thought, I wonder if I can do better? So I got it down to four tiles. And I was really proud of that. Then I fiddled around and I got it down to two. But my reaction was disappointment. It was just too damn easy. I felt it couldn’t be new.’</p><p>‘我想，我想知道是否可以做得更好？所以我把它降到了四个瓷砖。我为此感到非常自豪。然后我摆弄，我把它减少到两个。但是我的反应令人失望。真是太容易了。我觉得这不是新事物。’</p><p> But it turned out the result of his labours, known as ‘Penrose tiling’,  was new. It also has a mathematical and aesthetic beauty that interconnect in intricate ways, with deep links to the structure of quasicrystals and the theory of computation. Penrose tiling decorates the floor of the entrance hall at the London Institute for Mathematical Sciences where I work.</p><p> 但是事实证明，他的劳动成果被称为“彭罗斯（Penrose）平铺”，这是新的。它还具有数学和美学上的美，它们以复杂的方式相互联系，与准晶体的结构和计算理论有着深厚的联系。彭罗斯（Penrose）瓷砖装饰着我工作的伦敦数学科学研究所门厅的地板。</p><p> The easiest way to catch a glimpse of the way Penrose’s mind works is to look at his collaboration with the Dutch artist M.C. Escher. Back in the 1950s, Penrose happened to attend an Escher exhibition in Amsterdam, where he was ‘totally stunned’ by the visual paradoxes he saw. He was especially struck by an image called ‘Relativity’, which showed a staircase with gravity going in three directions and people going upstairs yet at right angles to each other.</p><p> 彭罗斯的思维方式最简单的方法就是看他与荷兰艺术家M.C.的合作。埃舍尔早在1950年代，彭罗斯（Penrose）碰巧参加了在阿姆斯特丹举行的埃舍尔（Escher）展览，在那里他被所看到的视觉悖论“彻底惊呆了”。他特别被一张名为“相对论”的图像所震惊，该图像显示了一个楼梯，重力在三个方向上移动，人们在楼上却彼此成直角。</p><p> But being Roger Penrose, he felt there was more that could be done with the idea. ‘I tried to draw rivers and bridges and things going this way and that in an impossible way. Then I simplified it down to this thing called the tribar, which is these three rods at right angles to each other, making a triangular configuration.’</p><p> 但是作为罗杰·彭罗斯（Roger Penrose），他觉得这个想法还有很多可以做的事情。 ‘我试图绘制河流和桥梁，以及以这种不可能的方式绘制事物。然后，我将其简化为一个叫做Tribar的东西，它是这三个杆彼此成直角，形成三角形构造。’</p><p>  Penrose collaborated with his father on teasing out manifestations of the paradox and between them they came up with the idea of an eternal staircase, and drew a version of it, known as the Penrose stairs. After publishing their concept, they sent a copy of the paper to Escher who, in turn, used the Penrose stairs as the inspiration for one of his best-known works, which he called ‘Ascending and Descending’. Penrose is currently working on a book inspired by Escher’s paradoxes — just one of three books in progress, it turns out.</p><p>  彭罗斯（Penrose）与他的父亲合作研究了这种悖论的表现，在他们之间，他们提出了一个永恒楼梯的想法，并绘制了一个永恒的楼梯，称为彭罗斯楼梯。在发表想法之后，他们将论文的副本发送给埃舍尔（Escher），埃舍尔又利用彭罗斯楼梯作为他最著名的作品之一的灵感，他称之为“升序和降序”。彭罗斯目前正在研究一本受埃舍尔悖论启发的书，事实证明，这只是三本正在进行中的书之一。</p><p>  The running theme in my interview with Penrose is his artistry, which is at the heart of his broad and deep insights into physics. I put it to him that one of the great mysteries of physics is that the laws describing the universe have such inherent beauty. So much so, in fact, that this same beauty is often used as a guide to discerning which laws are true. Penrose largely agrees, but distinguishes between different types of beauty. ‘There is a beauty in mathematics, which is different from the beauty in physics. They’re not quite the same.’ Einstein, he tells me, was incomparably gifted when it came to the beauty in physics, but less so at teasing out the mathematical beauty contained within his equations.</p><p>  在接受彭罗斯（Penrose）采访时，跑步的主题是他的艺术性，这是他对物理学具有广泛而深刻的见解的核心。我对他说，物理学的一大奥秘是描述宇宙的定律具有如此内在的美。实际上，如此之多，以至于同一美常常被用作辨别哪些法律是正确的指南。彭罗斯（Penrose）大致同意，但是区分了不同类型的美。 ‘数学上的美与物理学上的美不同。它们并不完全相同。’爱因斯坦告诉我，在谈到物理学之美时，他是无与伦比的天赋，但在调解他的方程式中包含的数学之美方面却并非如此。</p><p> The original plan was that I would speak to Penrose for an hour. After two and a half hours, the sun has gone down and we’re still talking. As we draw to a close, I ask him something that often occupies my mind: do the wonders of physics and the beauty of its laws inspire belief in something that is beyond science? I’m not quite asking him if he believes in God, but nearly.</p><p> 最初的计划是我要和彭罗斯谈一个小时。两个半小时后，太阳下山了，我们还在聊天。当我们接近尾声时，我问他一个我经常想到的事情：物理学的奇观及其法则的美会激发人们对超出科学的事物的信念吗？我不是在问他是否相信上帝，而是差不多。 </p><p> Sir Roger Penrose responds as gamely as he has to every other question I’ve put to him. ‘There is a sense in which I would say I’m an agnostic. I certainly don’t believe in Christianity. Maybe Jesus did a lot of the things described in the Bible, but certainly not all of them. But that doesn’t mean I’m an atheist. Do I believe in something outside science? Well, it’s a bit hard to know. What is science? Where are its boundaries? Is there something going on in consciousness, which is outside of science? Well, I like not to think that. It is certainly outside the science we have now. But it’s something we can explore scientifically. Whether we will have an understanding of what’s going on, which is deep enough to solve the mystery of what it is to be, I don’t know.’</p><p>罗杰·彭罗斯爵士（Sir Roger Penrose）对我提出的其他所有问题都像他一样博弈。 ‘从某种意义上说，我是个不可知论者。 我当然不相信基督教。 也许耶稣做了很多圣经中描述的事情，但是当然不是全部。 但这并不意味着我是无神论者。 我相信科学以外的东西吗？ 好吧，这有点很难知道。 什么是科学？ 它的边界在哪里？ 科学之外还有意识中正在发生的事情吗？ 好吧，我不想那样想。 当然，这超出了我们现在的科学范围。 但这是我们可以科学探索的东西。 我是否知道我们是否会对正在发生的事情有足够的了解，以至于足以解决它的奥秘。’ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/a-singular-mind-roger-penrose-on-his-nobel-prize">https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/a-singular-mind-roger-penrose-on-his-nobel-prize</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/诺贝尔/">#诺贝尔</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/罗杰/">#罗杰</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mind/">#mind</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/penrose/">#penrose</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
