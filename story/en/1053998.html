He extorted them for their nude pictures and videos, and threatened to kill and rape them. He also sent graphic and specific threats to carry out mass shootings and bombings at the girls&#39; schools if they didn&#39;t send him sexually explicit photos and videos.</p><p>多年来，加州男子使用聊天应用程序，电子邮件和Facebook系统地骚扰和恐吓年轻女孩。他为他们的裸体图片和视频林下了他们，并威胁要杀死并强奸他们。他还派出了图形和特定威胁，以在女孩们开展大规模枪击和爆炸事件;如果他们没有送他性别明确的照片和视频，则学校。</p><p>  Buster Hernandez, who was known as “Brian Kil” online, was such a persistent threat and was so adept at hiding his real identity that Facebook took the unprecedented step of helping the FBI hack him to gather evidence that led to his arrest and conviction, Motherboard has learned. Facebook worked with a third-party company to develop the exploit and did not directly hand the exploit to the FBI; it is unclear whether the FBI even knew that Facebook was involved in developing the exploit. According to sources within the company, this is the first and only time Facebook has ever helped law enforcement hack a target.</p><p>  被称为“Brian律师”在线的Busnter Hernandez是如此持久的威胁，并且如此善于隐藏他的真实身份，即Facebook采取了前所未有的一步，帮助他能够收集他的逮捕和定罪来收集他的证据，主板已经了解到了。 Facebook与第三方公司合作开发漏洞利用，并没有直接向FBI施加利用;目前尚不清楚联邦调查局是否甚至知道Facebook正在参与开发利用。根据公司内部的来源，这是Facebook的第一个也是唯一的时间，曾经帮助过执法的执法。</p><p>  This previously unreported case of collaboration between a Silicon Valley tech giant and the FBI highlights the technical capabilities of Facebook, a third-party hacking firm it worked with, and law enforcement, and raises difficult ethical questions about when—if ever—it is appropriate for private companies to assist in the hacking of their users. The FBI and Facebook used a so-called zero-day exploit in the privacy-focused operating system Tails, which automatically routes all of a user&#39;s internet traffic through the Tor anonymity network, to unmask Hernandez&#39;s real IP address, which ultimately led to his arrest.</p><p>  这前的硅谷科技巨头和联邦调查局之间的先前未报告的合作案例突出了Facebook的技术能力，这是它与之合作的第三方黑客公司，并对何​​时 - 如果有关何时 - 这是恰当的言论问题为私营公司协助他们的用户。 FBI和Facebook在隐私的操作系统尾部中使用了所谓的零点漏洞，它通过TOR匿名网络自动路由所有用户＆＃39;互联网流量，以取消匿名网络，以取消遮盖Hernandez＆＃39; s真实的ip地址最终导致了他的逮捕。</p><p>  A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to Motherboard that it worked with &#34;security experts&#34; to help the FBI hack Hernandez.</p><p>  Facebook发言人证实了它与它与＃34合作的主板;安全专家＆＃34;帮助FBI Hack Hernandez。</p><p>  “The only acceptable outcome to us was Buster Hernandez facing accountability for his abuse of young girls,” a Facebook spokesperson said. “This was a unique case, because he was using such sophisticated methods to hide his identity, that we took the extraordinary steps of working with security experts to help the FBI bring him to justice.”</p><p>  Facebook发言人说：“我们唯一可接受的结果是违反了他虐待了虐待的责任的威胁性。” “这是一个独特的案例，因为他正在利用这种复杂的方法来隐藏他的身份，我们采取了与安全专家合作的非凡步骤来帮助联邦调查局带来司法。”</p><p>   Former employees at Facebook who are familiar with the situation told Motherboard that Hernandez&#39;s actions were so extreme that the company believed it had been backed into a corner and had to act.</p><p>   熟悉这种情况的Facebook上的前雇员告诉主板，即Hernandez＆＃39;该公司认为它已被支持进入一个角落并不得不采取行动。</p><p>  “In this case, there was absolutely no risk to users other than this one person for which there was much more than probable cause. We never would have made a change that affected anybody else, like an encryption backdoor,” said a former Facebook employee with knowledge of the case. “Since there were no other privacy risks, and the human impact was so large, I don’t feel like we had another choice.”</p><p>  “在这种情况下，除了这个人以外的用户以外绝对没有风险超过可能的原因。我们从来没有改变过其他人一样的变化，就像加密后门一样，“一位以前的Facebook员工了解情况。 “由于没有其他隐私风险，人类的影响太大了，我不想觉得我们有另一种选择。” </p><p>  According to several current and former Facebook employees that Motherboard spoke to, however, the decision was much more controversial within the company. Motherboard granted several sources in this story anonymity to allow them to discuss sensitive events protected by non-disclosure agreements.</p><p>根据当前和以前的Facebook员工，主板谈到该决定在公司内更具争议性。主板在本故事中授予了几个来源匿名，以允许他们讨论受不披露协议保护的敏感事件。</p><p>  The crimes  Buster Hernandez committed were heinous. The FBI&#39;s indictment is a nauseating read. He messaged underage girls on Facebook and said something like “Hi, I have to ask you something. Kinda important. How many guys have you sent dirty pics to cause I have some of you?,” according to court records.</p><p>  罪行威胁犯罪的罪行是令人发生的。 FBI＆＃39;套装是一种令人惊叹的阅读。他在Facebook上发消了未成年女孩，并说了像“嗨，我要问你一些东西。有点重要。你有多少人送了肮脏的照片，因为我有一些你有些？，“根据法庭记录。</p><p>  When a victim responded, he would then demand that she send sexually explicit videos and photos of herself, otherwise he would send the nude photos he already had to her friends and family (in reality, he didn’t have any nude photos). Then, and in some cases over the course of months or years, he would continue to terrorize his victims by threatening to make the photos and videos public. He would send victims long and graphic rape threats. He sent specific threats to attack and kill victims’ families, as well as shoot up or bomb their schools if they didn’t continue to send sexually explicit images and videos. In some cases, he told victims that if they killed themselves, he would post their nude photos on memorial pages for them.</p><p>  当受害者回应时，他会要求她派遣她自己的性明确的视频和照片，否则他会发送他已经不得不给朋友和家人的裸体照片（实际上，他没有任何裸体照片）。然后，在某些情况下，在几个月或几年内，他将继续恐吓他的受害者，以威胁要制作照片和视频。他会派遣受害者长期和图形强奸威胁。他向攻击和杀死受害者家庭的特定威胁，如果他们没有继续发送性明确的图像和视频，则射击或炸毁他们的学校。在某些情况下，他告诉受害者，如果他们杀死自己，他会在纪念页面上发布他们的裸照。</p><p>  He told victims he “wants to be the worst cyberterrorist who ever lived.”</p><p>  他告诉受害者他“想成为有史以来最糟糕的网际线虫主义者。”</p><p>  “I want to leave a trail of death and fire [at your high school],” he wrote in 2015. “I will simply WALK RIGHT IN UNDETECTED TOMORROW … I will slaughter your entire class and save you for last. I will lean over you as you scream and cry and beg for mercy before I slit your fucking throat from ear to ear.”</p><p>  “我想留下一条死亡和火灾[在你的高中]，”他在2015年写道。“我明天只会在未被发现的内容......我会屠杀你的整个班级并救你。在我尖叫并乞求怜悯之前，我会倾向于你，然后在我将他妈的喉咙耳朵到耳朵。“</p><p> Do you work or did you use to work at Facebook? Do you work for the FBI or develop hacking tools for law enforcement? We’d love to hear from you. You can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, OTR chat at lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de, or email    lorenzofb@vice.com</p><p> 你工作还是在Facebook上工作了？您是否为FBI工作或开发用于执法的黑客工具？我们很乐意听取您的意见。您可以安全地联系Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai在+1 917 257 1382，在lorenzofb@jabber.ccc.de或电子邮件rorenzofb@vice.com</p><p>  All along, he would claim he couldn’t be caught by the police: “You thought the police would find me by now, but they didn’t. they have no clue. The police are useless,” he wrote. “Everyone please pray for the FBI, they are never solving this case lmao … I’m above the law and always will be.”</p><p>  一路走来，他将声称他不能被警察抓住：“你以为警察现在会发现我，但他们没有。他们没有线索。警察没用，“他写道。 “每个人都请为联邦调查局祈祷，他们从不解决这种情况lmao ......我高于法律，永远是。” </p><p>  Hernandez used  the secure operating system Tails, which runs the anonymizing software Tor and is designed to encrypt and push all of a user&#39;s traffic through the network by default, hiding their real IP address from websites or services they use. Using this tool, he contacted and harassed dozens of victims on Facebook for years until 2017, according to  court documents. The operating system is also widely used by journalists, activists, and dissidents who are under threat of being surveilled by police and governments. A spokesperson for Tails says it is “used daily by more than 30,000 activists, journalists, domestic-violence survivors, and privacy-concerned citizens.”</p><p>Hernandez使用了安全的操作系统尾部，该尾部运行匿名软件TOR，旨在通过网络加密和推送所有用户的流量，并将其使用的网站或服务中的真实IP地址隐藏起来。根据法院文件的说法，他在Facebook上联系并骚扰了几十个受害者，截至2017年。经营制度也被记者，活动分子和受到警察和政府触摸威胁的持有人的广泛应用。尾巴的发言人表示，它是“每天使用超过30,000名活动家，记者，家庭暴力幸存者和隐私有关公民”。</p><p>  Hernandez was so notorious within Facebook that employees considered him the worst criminal to ever use the platform, two former employees told Motherboard. According to these sources, Facebook assigned a dedicated employee to track him for around two years and developed a new machine learning system designed to detect users creating new accounts and reaching out to kids in an attempt to exploit them. That system was able to detect Hernandez and tie different pseudonymous accounts and their respective victims to him, two former Facebook employees said.</p><p>  Hernandez在Facebook中如此臭名彩色，员工认为他是使用该平台的最严重的罪犯，两个前员工告诉主板。根据这些来源，Facebook指定了一个专门的员工来跟踪他大约两年，并开发了一款新的机器学习系统，旨在检测用户创建新帐户并向孩子们伸出手段，试图利用它们。该系统能够检测Hernandez并将不同的假名账户及其各自的受害者与他联系起来，这是两位以前的员工说。</p><p>  Several FBI field offices were involved in the hunt, and the FBI made a first attempt to hack and deanonymize him, but failed, as the hacking tool they used was not tailored for Tails. Hernandez noticed the attempted hack and taunted the FBI about it, according to the two former employees.</p><p>  几个联邦调查局野外办事处涉及狩猎，联邦调查局首次尝试破解和判决他，但失败，因为他们使用的喧嚣工具没有针对尾巴量身定制。据两位前雇员称，埃尔南德斯注意到了尝试的黑客并嘲笑了FBI。</p><p>   Facebook’s security team, then headed by  Alex Stamos, realized they had to do more, and concluded that the FBI needed their help to unmask Brian Kil. Facebook hired a cybersecurity consulting firm to develop a hacking tool, which cost six figures. Our sources described the tool as  a zero-day exploit, which refers to a vulnerability in software that is unknown to the software developers. The firm worked with a Facebook engineer and wrote a program that would attach an exploit taking advantage of a flaw in Tails’ video player to reveal the real IP address of the person viewing the video. Finally, Facebook gave it to an intermediary who handed the tool to the feds, according to three current and former employees who have knowledge of the events.</p><p>   Facebook的安全团队，然后由Alex Stamos领导，意识到他们必须做更多，并得出结论，联邦调查局需要对揭露Brian克拉莲的帮助。 Facebook聘请了一个网络安全咨询公司开发了一个令人黑客工具，其中六个数字。我们的来源将该工具描述为零天漏电，这是指软件开发人员未知的软件中的漏洞。该公司与Facebook工程师合作，并编写了一个程序，该程序将在尾部的视频播放器中利用漏洞来揭示漏洞，以揭示观看视频的人的真实IP地址。最后，Facebook将其送到一个将工具交给美联储的中间人，根据有关事件的三个​​当前和前雇员。</p><p>  Facebook told Motherboard that it does not specialize in developing hacking exploits and did not want to set the expectation with law enforcement that this is something it would do regularly. Facebook says that it identified the approach that would be used but did not develop the specific exploit, and only pursued the hacking option after exhausting all other options.</p><p>  Facebook告诉主板，它不专注于开发黑客攻击，并不希望与执法设定期望，这是它会定期做的事情。 Facebook表示，它确定了将使用的方法，但未制定特定的利用，并且只在耗尽所有其他选择后才能追求黑客选项。</p><p>  The FBI then got a warrant and the help of a victim who sent  a booby-trapped video to Hernandez, as Motherboard previously reported. In February of this year, the man  pleaded guilty to 41 charges, including production of child pornography, coercion and enticement of a minor, and threats to kill, kidnap and injure. He is now awaiting sentencing, and will likely spend years in prison.</p><p>  然后，FBI获得了一个保证，并作为先前报告的主板向Hernandez发送了笨拙的视频的受害者的帮助。今年2月，该人恳求有罪，包括生育儿童色情，胁迫和诱惑未成年人，威胁杀害，绑架和伤害。他现在正在等待判决，可能会在监狱里度过几年。</p><p>  An FBI spokesperson declined to comment for this story, saying that it’s an “ongoing matter,” and referred Motherboard to the U.S. Attorney&#39;s Office for the Southern District of Indiana, which prosecuted Hernandez.</p><p>  FBI发言人拒绝发表评论这个故事，称这是一个“持续的事情”，并向美国司法委员会举行的美国司法委员会委员会的主板。 </p><p>  The United States Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Indiana declined to comment.</p><p>美国院长在印第安纳州南部的办事处拒绝发表评论。</p><p>  Facebook routinely investigates suspected criminals on its platform, from run-of-the-mill cybercriminals, to stalkers, extortionists, and people engaging in child exploitation. Several teams at Menlo Park and other company offices collect user reports and proactively hunt these criminals. These teams are composed of security specialists, some of whom used to work in the government, including the FBI and the New York Police Department, according to employees’ LinkedIn profiles.</p><p>  Facebook经常调查其平台上的涉嫌罪犯，从磨坊网络犯罪分子，追踪者，勒索者和从事儿童剥削的人。 Menlo Park和其他公司办事处的几个团队收集用户报告并主动追捕这些罪犯。这些团队由安全专家组成，其中一些人曾在员工LinkedIn档案的情况下在包括联邦调查局和纽约警察局在内的政府工作。</p><p>  These employees are so proud of this work that they used to have a meeting room where they’d hang pictures of people who ended up being arrested, as well as newspaper clippings of cases they investigated, according to current and former Facebook employees.</p><p>  这些员工对这项工作感到自豪，他们曾经有过一个会议室，他们挂起了最终被捕的人的照片，以及他们调查的案件的报纸剪报，根据当前的Facebook员工。</p><p>  According to all the sources Motherboard spoke to, however, this was the first and only time Facebook got directly involved and helped the FBI go after a suspected criminal in this way, developing a tool specifically to de-anonymize targets. For some current and former Facebook employees who did not know of the case, as well as people with knowledge of it, that was a controversial decision.</p><p>  根据所有来源主板发表谈到，这是Facebook直接涉及的第一个也是唯一的时间，并帮助FBI以这种方式追踪疑似刑事，专门开发一个工具，专门用于取消匿名目标。对于一些不了解这种情况的当前和前者的Facebook员工，以及知识的人，这是一个有争议的决定。</p><p>  “The precedent of a private company buying a zero-day to go after a criminal,” said a source who had knowledge of the investigation and development of the exploit. “That entire concept is fucked up […] it’s sketchy as hell.”</p><p>  “一家私营公司的先例购买零点以后追踪罪犯，”一个掌握了剥削和发展的来源。 “整个概念是搞砸了[...]这是粗略的。”</p><p>  Another source said that “everything we did was perfectly legal, but we’re not law enforcement.”</p><p>  另一个来源说，“我们所做的一切都完全合法，但我们不是执法。”</p><p>  “I would be surprised if faced with the same set of circumstances it would happen again,” he added.</p><p>  “如果面对相同的情况，我会感到惊讶，它会再次发生，”他补充道。 </p><p>  A former Facebook employee who has knowledge of the investigation, however, saw partnering with the cybersecurity firm and paying for the development of an exploit as justified, given that they were going after a serial harasser of children.</p><p>然而，一位前的Facebook员工已经了解了调查，并与网络安全公司合作并支付了剥削的开发方式，因为他们正在追随儿童连续骚扰者。</p><p>  “I think they totally did the right thing here. They put a lot of effort into child safety,” said the former employee, who asked to remain anonymous as he was not authorized to speak about the case. “It&#39;s hard to think of another company spending the amount of time and resources to try to limit damage caused by one evil guy.”</p><p>  “我认为他们完全在这里做了正确的事情。他们对儿童安全进行了很大的努力，“前雇员说，他要求持久地宣称他没有被授权谈论案件。 “它难以想到另一家公司花费时间和资源来试图限制一个邪恶的家伙造成的伤害。”</p><p>   That the hack occurred on Tails, not Facebook, adds a particularly thorny ethical layer to the hack. While this particular hack was intended to be used against a specific, heinous criminal, handing zero-day exploits to law enforcement comes with the risk that it will be used in other, less serious cases. The security of these products can&#39;t be compromised for some without compromising all, and so zero-day hacking tools are often  closely-held secrets and sold for high sums. If they got into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous.</p><p>   当尾巴时，黑客发生在尾巴上，而不是Facebook，为黑客添加了一个特别棘手的道德层。虽然这种特殊的黑客旨在用于针对特定的，令人发指的罪犯，但归咎于执法的零日漏洞，这是它将在其他，不太严重的情况下使用的风险。这些产品的安全性可以＆＃39; t妥协，没有损害所有人，因此零日的黑客工具通常是密切关注的秘密并为高额销售。如果他们进入错误的手，它可能是灾难性的。</p><p>  A spokesperson for Tails said in an email that the project’s developers “didn&#39;t know about the story of Hernandez until now and we are not aware of which vulnerability was used to deanonymize him.” The spokesperson called this &#34;new and possibly sensitive information,&#34; and said that the exploit was never explained to the Tails development team. Many security researchers—including those who work at big companies like Google—go through a process called &#34;coordinated disclosure&#34; in which the researchers will inform companies that they&#39;ve found a vulnerability in their software, and will give them time to fix it before releasing the details to the public.</p><p>  尾巴的发言人在一封电子邮件中说，项目的开发人员“没有关于Hernandez的故事，直到现在，我们并不知道习惯了哪些漏洞习惯了他。”发言人称这个＆＃34;新的和可能敏感的信息，＆＃34;并说漏洞从未向尾部开发团队解释。许多安全研究人员 - 包括那些在谷歌等大公司工作的人，通过一个名为＆＃34;协调披露＆＃34;研究人员将通知公司，他们在他们的软件中发现了一种漏洞，并将在释放到公众的详细信息之前，将时间修复它。</p><p>  In this case, however, that wasn&#39;t done because the FBI intended to leverage the vulnerability against an actual target.</p><p>  然而，在这种情况下，没有完成，因为FBI旨在利用对实际目标的脆弱性。</p><p>  For years, top law enforcement officials and prominent lawmakers have rung the alarm about the so-called “ going dark” problem, a scenario where criminals and terrorists take advantage of strong encryption to escape arrest and prosecution. With the rise of default encryption, law enforcement and governments are more commonly hacking their targets to obtain their communications and data.</p><p>  多年来，顶级执法官员和杰出的立法者已经突破了关于所谓的“黯淡”问题的警报，这是一个犯罪分子和恐怖主义者利用强加密来逃避逮捕和起诉的情景。随着违约加密的兴起，执法部门和政府更常见的是，他们的目标是获得他们的通信和数据。</p><p>  A factor that convinced Facebook’s security team that this was appropriate, sources said, was that there was an upcoming release of Tails where the vulnerable code had been removed. Effectively, this put an expiration date on the exploit, according to two sources with knowledge of the tool.</p><p>  消息人士称，这是一个相信Facebook的安全团队的一个因素，这是易受攻击代码已被删除的即将发布的尾巴。有效地，根据具有该工具的两个来源，这将在漏洞利用上进行到期日期。 </p><p>  As far as the Facebook team knew, Tails developers were not aware of the flaw, despite removing the affected code. One of the former Facebook employees who worked on this project said the plan was to eventually report the zero-day flaw to Tails, but they realized there was no need to because the code was naturally patched out.</p><p>就Facebook团队知道，尽管删除受影响的代码，尾部开发人员并不了解缺陷。在这个项目上工作的前者Facebook员工之一表示，该计划最终将零天缺陷报告到尾部，但他们意识到没有必要因为代码自然地修补。</p><p>  Amie Stepanovich, the executive director of the Silicon Flatirons Center at the University of Colorado Law School, said that it’s important to remember that whoever these hacking tools are used against, they leverage vulnerabilities in software that may be used against innocent people.</p><p>  科罗拉多州法学院硅Flatirons中心执行主任Amie Stephovich表示，重要的是要记住，无论这些黑客工具是否用于反对，他们都利用可能用于无辜人民的软件中的漏洞。</p><p>  “A vulnerability can be used against anyone. Tails may be used by criminals, but it’s also a tool for activists, journalists, or government officials, as well as other people to protect against bad actors,” Stepanovich, a well-known privacy and security expert, told Motherboard. “This is why it’s important to have transparent processes on the discovery and response to vulnerabilities, including a default preference for reporting them to an appropriate person, organization, or company.”</p><p>  “可以针对任何人使用漏洞。犯罪分子可以使用尾巴，但它也是活动家，记者或政府官员的工具，以及其他人来保护糟糕的行动者，“斯蒂芬维奇是一个着名的隐私和安全专家告诉主板。 “这就是为什么在发现和对漏洞的发现和响应中具有透明流程的重要性，包括向适当的人，组织或公司报告它们的默认首选。”</p><p>  According to Senator Ron Wyden, who is  a close watcher of law enforcement use of hacking, this case raises questions on how the FBI handled the hacking tool purchased by Facebook.</p><p>  据参议员罗恩·威登（Ron Wyden）是一位密切的执法使用黑客攻击的观察者，这种情况提出了关于FBI如何处理Facebook购买的黑客工具的问题。</p><p>  “Did the FBI re-use it in other cases? Did it share the vulnerability with other agencies?
