Non-programmers can easily learn the block-oriented syntax with less than 20 keywords and only 20 operators.\n    The LoLa runtime protects the host application from misbehaving user code by slicing code execution in controllable chunks.   Even endless loops will eventually return to the host! Out-of-memory problems will be catched by the use of host-controlled allocators.\n    while( true) {  var input = WaitForKey();  if(input ==  &#34; &#34;) { Print( &#34;Space was pressed!&#34;); }}\n  LoLa code is designed to suspend at any time and return control back to the host. In this example,  WaitForKey will immediately return control to the host, eating no CPU time until the host decides that the script should continue.   Most other scripting languages don&#39;t allow that behaviour, enforcing multithreading or other workarounds.\n    The LoLa runtime is designed to be saved to disk at any point not executing any code. This means that you can let your script execute for 1000 instructions, save the runtime state to disk and resume execution a week later on another computer, not having any problems with script resumption. This is especially useful for games which often want to embed the state of their scripts into the save files.\n  05 04 00 00 00 01 00 00 |........| 00 00 00 00 f0 3f 01 00 |.....?..| 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 04 |......@.| 05 00 00 00 48 65 6c 6c |....Hell| 6f 01 1f 85 eb 51 b8 1e |o....Q..| 09 40  |.@|", "posttime": "2021-06-25 22:57:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "programming,\u7f16\u7a0b,\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00,\u811a\u672c", "title": "\u841d\u62c9\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00 ", "title_en": "The Lola Programming Language", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lola.random-projects.net/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f16\u7a0b", "\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00", "\u811a\u672c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c94cb44bac0b155cad9e923137017c79.png", "infoid": 1068250, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5730\u5ba3\u5e03AWS Bugbust\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3aJava\u548cPython\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5168\u7403\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u96c6\u4f53\u4fee\u590d100\u4e07\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6d88\u9664\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aCodeguRu\u8282\u7701\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e74\u5ea6AWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8d62\u5f97\u5956\u54c1\u548c\u8363\u8000\u3002\u8ba9\u81ed\u866b\u6253\u5f00\uff01\n    AWS Bugbust\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8f6c\u6362Bug Bashes\uff0cFoster Team Building\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u53cb\u597d\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u67e5\u627e\u548c\u6d88\u706d\u9519\u8bef\uff0cAWS Bugbust\u5229\u7528ML\u4f9b\u7535\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5de5\u5177 -  Amazon Codegure Reviewer\u548cAmazon Codegure Profiler  - \u81ea\u52a8\u626b\u63cf\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u6742\u8349\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u8d4c\u535a\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n  \u53ea\u9700\u70b9\u51fb\u51e0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728AWS\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u8bbe\u7f6e\u79c1\u4ebaAWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u865a\u62df\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08\u6216\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u79c1\u4eba\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728AWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u9020\u6210100\u4e07\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u840c\u82bd\u5458\u5728\u6500\u767b\u6392\u884c\u699c\u65f6\u8d5a\u53d6\u5fbd\u7ae0\u548c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u524d10\u540d\u7206\u53d1\u8005\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed9AWS Re\u7684\u8d39\u7528\uff1a\u53d1\u660e2021.\u52a0\u5165\u4f7f\u547d\u4eca\u5929\u6d88\u9664100\u4e07\u866b\u3002\n  AWS Bugbust\u4eca\u5929\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\uff08N.

Your mileage may vary ;)\n I&#39;ve been trying out  HEY (the e-mail service from the team at Basecamp) for almost a year now and I quite liked it. I loved the  Screener feature, which lets me decide who I want to receive e-mails from and who I want to block from emailing me again, forever. I also found  Imbox (used for real person-to-person talk),  The Feed (used for newsletter and related stuff), and  Paper Trail (used for receipts and confirmations) concepts pretty useful.\n Even though the way HEY organizes my email is pretty comfortable for my needs, I&#39;m not fully satisfied with the experience. I don&#39;t really like the fact that I can&#39;t use my personal domains ( francocorrea.com and  francocorrea.com.uy) with the personal plan, but I&#39;d have to pay an extra 20 USD a year for the feature. Also, apart from the provided groups (Imbox, The Feed, and Paper Trail), it is not flexible on any subgroups that I may want to have, for example, one group for the hundreds of emails that Github sends every day on pull requests, issues, and related topics.\n  I&#39;ve decided that while HEY was not the optimal experience for me, I liked the idea of paying for e-mail instead of letting my personal data pay for it. I researched several different services that could provide a good enough service for a reasonable price and ended up settling on  Fastmail.com. I&#39;m not going to try to sell the service to you in this post, but the reasons I chose it were because of their  fair pricing,  multi-domain support,  extreme flexibility, and customizability.\n  Once I decided to move, the first thing I had to do was exporting my emails from HEY and importing them on Fastmail, this is pretty easy and you can do it by going to  Account Setup &gt; Export your data.\n    After getting that file on my computer I proceeded to sign up for Fastmail and set up my domains, they have a nice onboarding where they guide you on the details about setting up your DNS the right way.\n If you are planning on using Fastmail, you can use  this link to get 10% off your first year after the 30-day free trial. I am not affiliated with them, but if you try and end up liking the service, you and I benefit from that :)\n  Fastmail does not have a built-in tool to import a  .mbox file, so you&#39;re going to need to use an external tool like  Thunderbird. They have a  small guide to tell you how it should be done.\n  When I was using HEY, I had a forwarding rule setup in Gmail and Zoho (where I was hosting my custom domains email service) making every new email to be forwarded to my HEY address. This worked fine but I could not respond from either my Gmail or custom domains, every response from me would be from my HEY address.\n Now, with Fastmail, I set up my domains so no forwarding from Zoho would be required (I also deleted my Zoho accounts). I still need to forward my Gmail messages to my Fastmail account, and this can be easily done by just changing where the emails were being forwarded to. Fastmail also lets you set up Gmail as an  additional identity, which means they will use Gmail&#39;s SMTP server to send messages such as responses to emails received from your Gmail account.\n On the HEY side, after terminating my account, they are generous enough to let me keep my address and allow forwarding all future emails to my new account. This can be set up by going to  Account Setup &gt; Forwarding &amp; SMTP Setup.\n After all the settings were applied, my routing schema would look like something similar to this:\n   As I mentioned at the beginning of the post, the HEY way of organizing my email was something I really appreciated. So I figured I would replicate that experience as much as possible using the flexibility that the new service provides.\n  Let&#39;s start with the  Groups, these would serve as a way for me to tell Fastmail which class of contact I have so anytime a new email arrives it would use a  Rule to categorize that message into a specific  Folder. I created two groups,  &#34;The Feed&#34; and  &#34;Paper Trail&#34;, what are these for? you guessed it, to put emails in the  &#34;The Feed&#34; and  &#34;Paper Trail&#34; folders, which I also created.\n Why no  &#34;Imbox&#34; group? I&#39;ve decided to use the  VIPs flag on contacts to route their emails directly to the Imbox, which is another folder we&#39;ll need to create. And lastly, let&#39;s create a folder named  &#34;To Screen&#34;, which will serve as a temporal inbound message parking.\n Now that we have our two groups and three folders created, let&#39;s create the Filters &amp; Rules to let the magic happen.\n First, we need the most important rule, let&#39;s send any message from someone who is not on our contact list to the  &#34;To Screen&#34; folder.\n  Make sure to click on &#34;Show advanced preferences&#34; and select &#34;Hide if empty&#34; to make sure the &#34;To Screen&#34; folder does not show when you have nothing to screen!\n  Then, we need to route anyone who is on our contact list and is marked as a VIP to the &#34;Imbox&#34; folder and make Fastmail send us a notification. There is a rule for that\u2122\n  We also need to honor our contact groups by routing everyone from the &#34;The Feed&#34; group to the &#34;The Feed&#34; folder, right?\n     Even though the pricing was not the main reason to make the switch, I can say that I am saving approx 75 USD a year by using this workflow, and I am getting a much more flexible system in exchange.\n I totally get this workflow is not for anyone, but I had fun setting it up and think others will have as well.\n This is the tip of the iceberg on how we can customize Fastmail and I will myself be exploring more ways of adapting it to my workflow. For instance, I&#39;ve created a subfolder inside Paper Trail where I route all my Github emails and make the server delete the ones older than 60 days (this is similar to the HEY &#34;Recycling Center&#34; feature).\n Let me know what you think by sending me an email at blog@francocorrea.com, I promise your message won&#39;t be lost in the mail \ud83d\ude09", "posttime": "2021-06-25

refuse to fight. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s safe to say that they would rather switch than fight. \u2014Public Enemy (sampled from Thomas Todd),  Fight the Power\n  Early in my tenure as product manager for the web servers at Netscape, we faced a terrible crisis. We just got our hands on Microsoft\u2019s new web server, Internet Information Server (IIS), and benchmarked against our product. Microsoft\u2019s IIS had every feature that we had, was five times faster and we knew that they were going to give it away for free. This might not sound so bad, but we had just gone public three months earlier with a story to Wall Street that said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Microsoft giving away the browser because we will make money selling servers.\u201d Oh snap.\n I immediately went to work trying to move the playing field and pivot the server product line to something that we could sell for money. The late, great Mike Homer and I worked furiously on a set of partnerships and acquisitions that would broaden the product line and surround the web server with enough functionality that we would be able survive the attack.\n As I excitedly reviewed the plan with my engineering counterpart, Bill Turpin, he looked at me as though I was a little kid who had much to learn. Bill was a long-time veteran of battling Microsoft from his time at Borland and understood what I was trying to do, but remained unconvinced. He said: \u201cBen, those silver bullets that you and Mike are looking for are fine and good, but our web server is five times slower. There is no silver bullet that\u2019s going to fix that. No, we are going to have to use a lot of lead bullets.\u201d Oh snap.\n As a result of Bill\u2019s words, we focused our engineering team on fixing the performance issues while working the other things in the background. We eventually beat Microsoft\u2019s performance and grew the server line to become a $400M business and we would never have done it without those lead bullets.\n I carried that lesson with me for many years. Six years later, when I was CEO of Opsware, our toughest competitor Bladelogic started to consistently beat us in large deals. We were a public company and the losses were all too visible. To make matters worse, we needed to win those deals in order to beat the Wall Street projections, so the company felt tremendous pressure. Many of the smartest people in my company came to me with ideas for avoiding the battle:\n \u201cLet\u2019s build a light-weight version of the product and go down market.\u201d\n   The issue with their ideas was that we weren\u2019t facing a market problem. The customers were buying; they just weren\u2019t buying our product. This was not a time to pivot. So I said the same thing to every one of them: \u201cThere are no silver bullets for this, only lead bullets.\u201d They did not want to hear that, but it made things clear: we had to build a better product. There was no other way out. No window, no hole, no escape hatch, no backdoor. We had to go through the front door and deal with the big, ugly guy blocking it. Lead bullets.\n After nine months of hard work on an extremely rugged product cycle, we regained our product lead and eventually built a company that was worth $1.6B. Without the lead bullets, I suspect we would have ended at about 1/10 th\u00a0that value.\n There may be nothing scarier in business than facing an existential threat. So scary that many in the organization will do anything to avoid it. They will look for any alternative, any way out, any excuse not to live or die in a single battle. I see this often in start up pitches. The conversations go something like this:\n Entrepreneur:\u00a0\u201cWe have the best product in the market by far. All the customers love it and prefer it to competitor X.\u201d  Me: \u201cWhy does competitor X have five times your revenue?\u201d  Entrepreneur: \u201cWe are using partners and OEMs, because we can\u2019t build a direct channel like competitor X.\u201d  Me: \u201cWhy not? If you have the better product, why not knuckle up and go to war?\u201d  Entrepreneur: \u201cUmmm.\u201d  Me: \u201cStop looking for the silver bullet.\u201d\n There comes a time in every company\u2019s life where it must fight for its life. If you find yourself running when you should be fighting, you need to ask yourself: \u201cIf our company isn\u2019t good enough to win, then do we need to exist at all?\u201d\n    The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

If he fires her because her skin is brown, we call that racism and there is legal recourse. If he fires her because her skin is female, we call that sexism and there is legal recourse. If he fires her because her skin is pockmarked and he finds her unattractive, well, we don\u2019t talk about that much and, in most places in America, there is no legal recourse.\n  This is puzzling. We live in a society that abhors discrimination on the basis of many traits. And yet one of the major forms of discrimination is lookism, prejudice against the unattractive. And this gets almost no attention and sparks little outrage. Why?\n  Studies show that most people consider an \u201cattractive\u201d face to have clean, symmetrical features. We find it  easier to recognize and categorize these prototypical faces than we do irregular and \u201cunattractive\u201d ones. So we find it easier \u2014 from a brain processing perspective \u2014 to look at attractive people.\n Attractive people thus start off with a slight physical advantage. But then people project all sorts of widely unrelated stereotypes onto them. In survey after survey, beautiful people are described as trustworthy, competent, friendly, likable and intelligent, while ugly people get the opposite labels. This is a version of the halo effect.\n Not all the time, but often, the attractive get the first-class treatment.  Research suggests they are more likely to be offered job interviews, more likely to be hired when interviewed and more likely to be promoted than less attractive individuals. They are more likely to  receive loans and more likely to receive lower interest rates on those loans.\n The discriminatory effects of lookism are pervasive. Attractive economists are more likely to  study at high-ranked graduate programs and their papers are cited more often than papers from their less attractive peers. One study found that when unattractive criminals committed a moderate misdemeanor, their fines were about  four times as large as those of attractive criminals.\n Daniel Hamermesh, a leading scholar in this field, observed that an American worker who is among the bottom one-seventh in looks earns about  10 to 15 percent less a year than one in the top third. An unattractive person misses out on nearly a quarter-million dollars in earnings over a lifetime.\n The overall effect of these biases is vast. One 2004 study  found that more people report being discriminated against because of their looks than because of their ethnicity.\n In a study published in the current issue of the American Journal of Sociology, Ellis P. Monk Jr., Michael H. Esposito and Hedwig Lee report that the earnings gap between people perceived as attractive and unattractive  rivals or exceeds the earnings gap between white and Black adults. They find the attractiveness curve is especially punishing for Black women. Those who meet the socially dominant criteria for beauty see an earnings boost; those who don\u2019t earn on average just 63 cents to the dollar of those who do.\n Why are we so blas\u00e9 about this kind of discrimination? Maybe people think lookism is baked into human nature and there\u2019s not much they can do about it. Maybe it\u2019s because there\u2019s no National Association of Ugly People lobbying for change. The economist Tyler Cowen notices that it\u2019s often the educated coastal class that most strictly enforces norms about thinness and dress. Maybe we don\u2019t like policing the bigotry we\u2019re most guilty of?\n My general answer is that it\u2019s very hard to buck the core values of your culture, even when you know it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n Over the past few decades, social media, the meritocracy and celebrity culture have fused to form a modern culture that is almost pagan in its values. That is, it places tremendous emphasis on competitive display, personal achievement and the idea that physical beauty is an external sign of moral beauty and overall worth.\n Pagan culture holds up a certain ideal hero \u2014 those who are genetically endowed in the realms of athleticism, intelligence and beauty. This culture looks at obesity as a moral weakness and a sign that you\u2019re in a lower social class.\n Our pagan culture places great emphasis on the sports arena, the university and the social media screen, where beauty, strength and I.Q. can be most impressively displayed.\n This ethos underlies many athletic shoe and gym ads, which hold up heroes in whom physical endowments and moral goodness are one. It\u2019s the paganism of the C.E.O. who likes to be flanked by a team of hot staffers. (\u201cI must be a winner because I\u2019m surrounded by the beautiful.\u201d) It\u2019s the fashion magazine in which articles about social justice are interspersed with photo spreads of the impossibly beautiful. (\u201cWe believe in social equality, as long as you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d) It\u2019s the lookist one-upmanship of TikTok.\n A society that celebrates beauty this obsessively is going to be a social context in which the less beautiful will be slighted. The only solution is to shift the norms and practices. One positive example comes, oddly, from Victoria\u2019s Secret, which  replaced its \u201cAngels\u201d with seven women of more diverse body types. When Victoria\u2019s Secret is on the cutting edge of the fight against lookism, the rest of us have some catching up to do.\n  The Times is committed to publishing   a diversity of letters  to the editor.
