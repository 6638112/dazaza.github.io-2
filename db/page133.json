Now they are racing to find it, so they can save it\n    W eighing 80-100kg and sporting long straight horns, white spots on its face and large facial scent glands, the saola does not sound like an animal that would be hard to spot. But it was not until  1992 that this elusive creature was discovered, becoming the first large mammal new to science in more than 50 years.\n Nicknamed the \u201cAsian unicorn\u201d, the saola continues to be elusive. They have never been seen by a biologist in the wild and have been camera-trapped only  a handful of times. There are reports of villagers trying to keep them in captivity but they have died after a few weeks, probably due to the wrong diet.\n  It was during a survey of wildlife in the remote V\u0169 Quang nature reserve, a 212 square mile forested area of north central  Vietnam, in 1992, that biologist Do Tuoc came across two skulls and a pair of trophy horns belonging to an unknown animal.\n Twenty more specimens, including a complete skin, were subsequently collected and, in 1993, laboratory tests revealed the animal to be not only a new species, but an entirely new genus in the bovid family, which includes cattle, sheep, goats and antelopes.\n Initially named Vu Quang Ox, the animal was later called saola ( Pseudoryx  nghetinhensis) \u2013 meaning \u201cspindle horns\u201d, the arms or posts (sao) of a spinning wheel (la) according to Lao-speaking ethnic groups in  Laos and neighbouring Vietnam.\n  The discovery was hailed as one of the most spectacular zoological discoveries of the 20th century but  less than 30 years later the saola population is believed to have declined massively due to commercial wildlife poaching, which  has exploded in Vietnam since 1994. Even though the saola is not directly targeted by poachers, intensive commercial snaring that supplies animals for use in traditional Asian medicine or as bushmeat serves as the primary threat.\n  Despite efforts to improve patrolling of nature reserves in the Annamite mountains, a major mountain range extending about 680 miles through Laos, Vietnam and into north-east Cambodia, poaching has been intensifying. \u201cThousands of people use snares, so there are millions of them in the forest, which means populations of large mammals and some birds have no way to escape and are collapsing throughout the Annamites,\u201d says Minh Nguyen, a PhD student at Colorado State University, who studies the impact of snares on critically endangered large-antlered muntjac.\n In 2001, the saola population was estimated to number 70 to 700 in Laos and several hundred in Vietnam. More recently, experts have put the number at  fewer than 100 \u2013 a decline that led to the species being listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list in 2006, the highest risk category that a species can have before extinction in the wild. The animal was  last camera-trapped in 2013 in the Saola Nature Reserve in central Vietnam. Since then, villagers continue to report its presence in areas in and around Pu Mat national park in Vietnam and in Bolikhamxay province in Laos.\n We stand at a moment of conservation history. We know how to find and save this magnificent animal. We just need the world to come together\n In 2006, William Robichaud and Simon Hedges, a biologist and specialist on wildlife conservation and countering the illegal wildlife trade in Asia and Africa, co-founded the  Saola Working Group (SWG) with the aim of finding the last saolas in the wild for a captive breeding programme, in order to reintroduce the species back into the wild in future, in a natural habitat that is free from threats.\n The SWG connects conservation organisations in Laos and Vietnam to raise awareness, collect information from local people, and search for saola. But the animals continue to elude the team. Between 2017 and 2019, the SWG carried out an intensive search using 300 camera traps in an 11 square mile area of the Khoun Xe Nongma national protected area in Laos. Not one of the million photographs captured saola.\n According to the IUCN,  only about 30% of potential Saola habitat has had any form of wildlife survey and potentially as little as 2% has been searched intensively for the species. Technologies limit the capabilities \u2013 camera traps are not good at detecting individual animals that are spread across a large area, especially in the damp, dense forest of the saola range. In August this year, the IUCN Species Survival Commission called for more investment in the search for the saola. \u201cIt is clear that search efforts must be significantly ramped up in scale and intensity if we are to save this species from extinction,\u201d said Nerissa Chao, Director of the IUCN SSC Asian Species Action Partnership\n  One organisation,  the Saola Foundation, is raising money for a new initiative that would train dogs to detect saola signs such as dung. Any samples would then be studied onsite using rapid saola-specific DNA field test kits being developed in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society\u2019s Molecular Laboratory in New York. Should the kits return a positive result within an hour, expert wildlife trackers will start searching for saola in the forest.\n If successful, captured saolas will be taken to a captive breeding centre being developed by the SWG and the Vietnamese government at B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 national park in central Vietnam.\n \u201cWe stand at a moment of conservation history,\u201d says Robichaud, who is president of the Saola Foundation. \u201cWe know how to find and save this magnificent animal, which has been on planet Earth for perhaps 8m years. We just need the world to come together and support the effort. It won\u2019t cost much, and the reward, for saola, for the Annamite mountains, and for ourselves, will be huge.\u201d\n Find more  age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters  Phoebe Weston and  Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:25:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,\u6293\u4f4f,step,\u9677\u9631", "title": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u201c\u4e9a\u6d32\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u201d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u7a00\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u7269\u4e4b\u4e00", "title_en": "Scientists Step Up Hunt For 'Asian Unicorn,' One of World's Rarest Animals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/07/scientists-step-up-hunt-for-asian-unicorn-one-of-worlds-rarest-animals-aoe", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "\u6293\u4f4f", "step", "\u9677\u9631"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d79de91228e184b2b1c662f798e5387.jpg", "infoid": 1072534, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u572812\u670821\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u8df3\u5230\u4e3b\u8981\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aNFT\u9879\u76ee\u5c06\u53d7\u5bb3\u8005\u964d\u81f3\u540c\u6837\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5c31\u50cf\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u4e00\u6837\uff0cNFT\u7cfb\u5217\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u6570\u7ef4\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u804a\u5929\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u793e\u533a\u4e00\u8d77\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u9879\u76ee\u90fd\u5373\u5c06\u5411\u5176\u793e\u533a\u6210\u5458\u5206\u53d1\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724cAirDrop\u768421\u4e16\u7eaa\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7684NFT\u666e\u96f7\u65af\u7684\u7334\u5b50\u738b\u56fd - \u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u65e9\u671f\u652f\u6301\u8005\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u5206\u53d1 - \u51e0\u5929\u540e\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u603b\u662f\u52aa\u529b\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653b\u51fb\u66f4\u96be\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6295\u8d44\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u201d\n\u8461\u8404\u7f51\u7edc\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u9662\u957f\u5e15\u5e15\u65af\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u521d\u59cb\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u9996\u5148\u88ab\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Webhooks\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u771f\u6b63\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u5728\u9a84\u50b2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u201dPappas\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "Skip to main content                                                                                                                On Tuesday, December 21st, two NFT projects fell victim to the same attack. Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop \u2014 essentially a free distribution to early supporters \u2014 a few days later.\n Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official \u201cannouncements\u201d channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance \u2014 but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.\n In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first  from Monkey Kingdom and  then from Fractal, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers  got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was  reported to be $1.3 million.\n the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers\n Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens \u2014 specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It\u2019s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers \u2014 and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.\n In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be \u201ccalled\u201d (or, in a closer approximation, \u201ctexted\u201d) to connect to an application on the other end.\n By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake \u201cannouncement\u201d had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags \u2014 but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled.\n \u201cwe are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users\u201d\n Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the  official documentation describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it\u2019s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there\u2019s no way to switch off all of them at once if you\u2019ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren\u2019t paying attention to their integrations.\n A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy  resource center.\n \u201cDiscord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,\u201d said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. \u201cWhile there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.\u201d\n \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism\u201d\n The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana.\n By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a  phishing attack that involves getting the target banned, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.\n Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to  The Verge that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation.\u201d\n In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym \u201cMonkey King\u201d) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.\n NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours \u2014 or sometimes minutes \u2014 so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.\n  In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers.  A Chainalysis examination of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.\n There\u2019s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there\u2019ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins \u2014 but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.\n The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead.

The spread is impressive, impacting Honda and Acura models as old as 2004 and as new as 2012. Here\u2019s what might be happening.\n  If you scroll through a   Honda or   Acura   forum right now, chances are you\u2019re going to run into a bunch of confused owners. When they hopped into their cars on January 1 they found the clocks on their navigation systems frozen at a certain time. And the calendar date? 2002, or 20 years ago.\n The issue is widespread, hitting a huge number of cars in Acura\u2019s and Honda\u2019s   lineup with navigation systems. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, as owners in Canada and even as far as the United Kingdom have all reported similar issues.\n      As a number of Honda and Acura owners have noted on these forums, their clocks read correctly until what appeared to have been the first time update of 2022. Then, their navigation systems turned into time machines, leaving them behind as they went back to 2002.\n    American Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems. We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.\n  Owners have also reached out and received different responses. American Honda provided the CR-V Owners Club   forum this response:\n We have escalated the NAVI Clock Issue to our Engineering Team and they have informed us that you will experience issue from Jan 2022 thru August 2022 and then it will auto-correct. Please be assured that we will continue to monitor this and will advise you if a fix is available before that time.\n   We have just received some more information regarding this and were advised that the Honda technical department are currently working on this. Once there is a fix for this issue Honda authorized dealers will be made aware of it and will be able to assist with this at that point. A service bulletin will be issued to our dealers from Honda UK on how to fix this. As such it would be best to check with your local Honda authorized dealer for any updates as they would have the latest information for this and will be able to assist once the fix is released. They can also contact the Honda technical department for additional assistance with this if necessary. You can see the nearest Honda authorized dealers and their contact details by using the link below.\n  If you have experience coding or troubleshooting software, the possible cause of this time warp probably popped into your head early on.\n Drive Accord   forum user Jacalar went into the navigation system\u2019s diagnostic menu on Sunday and discovered that the GPS date was set to May 19, 2002, or exactly 1024 weeks in the past.\n  Global Positioning Systems measure time from an epoch, or a specific starting point used to calculate time. The date is broadcasted including a number representing the week, coded in 10 binary digits. These digits count from 0 to 1023 then roll over on week 1024. GPS weeks first started on January 6, 1980 before first zeroing out on midnight August 21, 1999. It happened again April 6, 2019. The next happens in 2038.\n   If software isn\u2019t coded to account for the rollover, weird stuff can happen, like a calendar going back exactly 1024 weeks. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure without being able to look at Honda\u2019s programming, but these navigation systems might be programmed so that the start of their week counter is a date 19.6 years in the past, but not in-line with GPS epoch.\n Owners should be able to turn off the automatic update function and set the date and time manually, but they\u2019re finding that the functionality doesn\u2019t work right now. Likewise, the clock resets back to the incorrect time every time the car is started.\n  This isn\u2019t the first time that Honda and Acura owners have experienced this issue.   On August 16, 2017, Hondas and Acuras with navigation systems from model years 1999 through 2004 had their clocks reset to 0:00 and their calendars roll back to January 1, 1998. It then happened  again   on January 1, 2021 to many owners. In all cases, the time lost adds up to 1024 weeks.\n Honda didn\u2019t explain the cause back then, but the solution then was to send out update disks to fix the errors. There is no fix for the current issue. Honda says it\u2019s investigating and if it does not find a fix, the clocks should correct themselves sometime in August.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:23:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u65f6\u949f,clocks,\u672c\u7530", "title": "\u672c\u7530\u65f6\u949f\u8fc7\u53bb\u56f0\u6270\u4e8620\u5e74\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d", "title_en": "Honda Clocks Are Stuck 20 Years In The Past And There Isn't A Fix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u949f", "clocks", "\u672c\u7530"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c52c30a9cee9f47cc5dee3cb7d9009aa.jpg", "infoid": 1072531, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eba\u4eec\u53cd\u590d\u72af\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u9762\u3002\n[quote]\u6211\u52aa\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6211\u60f3\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002[/ quote]", "note_en": "One big mistake people repeatedly make is focusing on proving themselves right, instead of focusing on achieving the best outcome.

The subject of books, articles, plays, and even an opera, Batavia was wrecked on a chain of small islands off the coast of Western Australia.\n Of Batavia\u2019s 341 crew and passengers, 40 drowned trying to get off the ship, while all others made it to the uninhabited islands nearby. The captain, senior officers, two women, and one child left in one of the ship\u2019s boats to get help. But further tragedy followed.\n A group of men on the islands who had gathered around the acting commander deliberately drowned, strangled, cut the throats, or brutally hacked to death 125 children, women, and men. When the rescue party returned months later, they managed to overpower this death squad and bring the remaining survivors to safety. Together with its many victims and the murderers, Batavia\u2019s wreckage was left in the Houtman Abrolhos archipelago.\n The Dutch ship was 45.3 meters long and 600 metric tons in size. It sank on its maiden voyage to Southeast Asia. The shipwreck was found in the 1960s off Morning Reef and was excavated in the 1970s.\n  The surviving stern section, now in Fremantle\u2019s Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum, is the only portion of any early 17th-century Dutch East India ship raised from the seabed and preserved.\n Previously, historians could only guess where the timber for such ships came from, when it was felled, or how it was used, as archival records of Dutch timber trade before 1650 are rare or lost.\n But in\u00a0 new research, we studied the tree rings of the Batavia shipwreck timbers. We have found that the oak for the hull was sourced from two separate forests (in northern Germany and the Baltic region), with wood for the framing elements coming predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony. The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled (in 1625 or later) and was still green when the shipbuilders cut and bent the planks into shape.\n Knowing more about these timbers helps us understand the Dutch success in world trade, including how they managed to build such large ocean-going vessels and so many of them.\n   Batavia\u2019s remains provide a rare archaeological resource for tree-ring examination because exact dates of its construction and sinking are known.\n Construction began sometime in the spring of 1626, and the ship set sail from Texel (the Netherlands) to the East Indies (known today as Indonesia) in October 1628. It struck a reef on June 4, 1629. As Batavia had never undergone repairs or maintenance work, we know every piece of timber belongs to the original structure.\n When Batavia was built, the Dutch were the foremost shipbuilders in Europe. By 1640, for example, around 1,000 seagoing ships were being constructed in the Netherlands each year, mostly for export markets.\n The Dutch lacked domestic timber resources to supply the bustling shipbuilding industry and yet would have needed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of oak trees to build Batavia.\n Where did all this timber come from? The Dutch East India Company archives provide no detailed information on where its shipyards bought timber at the time of Batavia\u2019s construction. While the company kept detailed records from the mid-17th century onward, hardly any of those from the early 1600s have survived.\n Fortunately, tree rings can provide answers to those questions. Trees in temperate climate zones form a growth ring each year, just under the bark. This sequence of growth rings produced over years and decades acts like an environmental bar code, a growth pattern that is particular to the place where they grew and died.\n  This growth pattern is very similar for trees of the same species growing in the same area.\n By measuring the ring widths from many trees, a reference tree-ring chronology can be built. Then, we can cross match the growth pattern of a specific timber to such reference chronologies, establishing when the tree was felled and where it had grown. This field of study is  known as dendrochronology.\n The many Batavia timbers we sampled had only heartwood, or interior rings, demonstrating that Dutch shipbuilders discarded the sapwood (outer rings). Sapwood is softer and contains substances that make it more vulnerable to insect infestation and decay.\n Furthermore, the outermost heartwood ring of the Batavia hull planks that we sampled dates to 1616. When accounting for the missing sapwood (nine rings for Baltic oak), this means the trees were felled in 1625 or later.\n The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled. All this demonstrates that Batavia\u2019s builders were skilled craftspersons, intimately familiar with the properties of the wood they used.\n  The oak timber used in Batavia\u2019s hull planks came from two forests. Trees from near L\u00fcbeck in northern Germany were used above the ship\u2019s waterline, while timber from the Baltic region of Northeastern Europe was applied exclusively below the waterline.\n This Baltic timber was prized by artists like\u00a0 Rembrandt, who used it for panels on which to paint. Trees from this region had beautifully straight trunks with very fine growth rings, making the wood easy to work and stable.\n Obviously, company shipbuilders valued these same properties when building ships strong enough to endure several return voyages to Southeast Asia. They avoided using trees with knots in the hull and preferred wood from which they could fashion long and strong planks.\n  In contrast, we found that the timber for Batavia\u2019s framing elements came predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony (northwest Germany). Frames utilized the strong properties of these oaks\u2019 curved wood fibers. As it was sourced closer to home, this timber may have been cheaper and easier to acquire.\n Our study was only possible because Batavia\u2019s hull was raised in its entirety. Waterlogged wood is mushy, so extracting samples from the timbers while still under water is always challenging. It also would have required cutting out large sections of the ship to access all the different elements.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:17:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6212\u6307,tree,\u6728\u6750", "title": "\u6c89\u8239\u7684\u6811\u6212\u6307\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "What a Shipwreck\u2019s Tree Rings Reveal", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.sapiens.org/archaeology/shipwreck-tree-rings/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6212\u6307", "tree", "\u6728\u6750"]}]
