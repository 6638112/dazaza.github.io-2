This launch was all set to take off back at the beginning of October, but was scrubbed in the final seconds. Today\u2019s launch window spans 15 minutes, and opens at 6:24 PM EST (3:24 PM PST), with a backup opportunity tomorrow, Friday November 6 at 6:20 PM EST (3:20 PM PST).\n The launch today will use a  Falcon   9 first-stage that hasn\u2019t flown previously, and SpaceX will be attempting to recover it with a landing on its drone ship \u2018Of Course I Still Love You\u2019 in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of the terms of its agreement with the U.S. Space Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC, which was previously housed under the Air Force),  SpaceX   has had to use new boosters for all missions that fall under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) umbrella, including this one.\n  That changed in September of this year, when SpaceX and the SMC agreed that Elon Musk\u2019s launch company could use re-flown booster stages \u2013 which is what SpaceX does for just about every other launch it flies these days. Given SpaceX\u2019s track record with refurbished first stages, it makes sense that SMC would change their position on use of the recovered rockets.\n SpaceX already launched one  GPS   III spacecraft for the Space Force this year \u2013 the third such satellite in the constellation, which was delivered to orbit in June.\n  The launch webcast will begin above at around 15 minutes prior to the opening of the launch window, so at around 6:09 PM EST (3:09 PM PST).", "posttime": "2020-11-05 22:07:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "A fascinating example of this is SaaS marketplace  Juggle. Originally designed as a marketplace to allow executive-level women to re-enter the world of work in a flexible manner after having a family, it later expanded into a wider market for anyone wanting to work flexibly and for employers who need that kind of workforce. But now, with the world of work totally upended by the pandemic, \u2018flexibility\u2019 is literally now the name of the game.\n It\u2019s now disclosed its funding of $2.1 million from investors in the UK and the US. Investors include a number of the UK\u2019s leading angels, and also includes  Oxford Capital,  Social Capital, and  7percent Ventures.\u00a0The other investors are: Andrew Gault (who backed Oculus), Andreas Mihalovits (a serial investor), Andrew J Scott, (who backed Magic Pony), Charlie Kemper (backed Casper), Charlie Songhurst, Curtis Chambers (early Uber employee), Pip Wilson (entrepreneur and investor), Rajiv Kapoor (East coast investor).\n  With many businesses moving to flexible working arrangements, whether that means remote work, part-time, or shared roles, Juggle connects them with professionals that aren\u2019t the typical \u20189-to-5\u2019 type people.\n Flexibility at work can cover the time someone works, the location, or the pattern, such as a job share. Under the UK Employment Act of 1996, there is a statutory right for any eligible employee to request flexible working, for any reason, if they have been with the company for at least 26 weeks.\u00a0So Juggle is pushing at an already open door. A 2019 report from Aviva found that one-fifth of UK employees won\u2019t ask for flexibility because they are convinced it will be refused, and 35 percent aren\u2019t comfortable asking their employer for more flexibility. But more than a fifth of workers have changed companies or departments to find greater flexibility, and almost half would consider switching if the new role was more accommodating to their work/life needs. So having a platform they can go to means Juggle is likely to pick up plenty of these professionals who don\u2019t want to work in any other manner.\n Professionals sign up for the service, and recruitment tools allow them to schedule and keep track of job applications, and coaching and support are available. Juggle also provides \u2018smart matching\u2019 and the necessary paperwork to allow for these flexible roles. Businesses using Juggle to find the right candidate are vetted in advance to ensure that they embrace flexibility, so both employers and employees know what they are getting.\n Founded by former headhunter  Romanie Thomas, a core mission for Juggle, she said, is to see women in 50 percent of business leadership roles by 2027. Since launching in 2017, Thomas said 62 percent of all placements made by Juggle have been female.\n  Thomas said: \u201cAs a successful former headhunter I was placing senior executives, and I saw exceptional employees leaving work to have a baby and struggling to get back in. Firms passed on perfect candidates because they were uncomfortable with bespoke arrangements\u2026 Employees aren\u2019t asking for anything revolutionary, just to be able to work in a way that\u2019s most efficient and productive for them. Flexibility enables people to maximize their energy and skills, and that\u2019s a huge benefit for employers once they realize it.\u201d\n Juggle has gathered a wide set of companies that are using its B2B platform, and clients now include Reallife Tech, Hopster, Hubble, and White-Hat.\n Andrew Gault, Founding Partner at 7percent Ventures commented: \u201cThe current pandemic will have a lasting effect on the way we work. We were already on the brink of a serious shift, and Juggle was ahead of the curve. Now as more employers and workers look at flexible working arrangements, Juggle is perfectly poised to help match businesses with the right talent and provide its extensive knowledge to make a success of flexible work. Data shows that more flexibility is good for everyone, and could have a monumental impact on the gender gap, as more exceptionally talented women can be placed into senior roles.\u201d\n Speaking to TechCrunch, Thomas added: \u201cThe whole company was born out of my personal frustration and lack of women in business leadership, which I saw firsthand as a headhunter. Companies seemed to have a revolving door of men. But flexible working is critical to achieving gender parity. With Juggle, the segment we\u2019re talking about is non-technical which is generally untapped by tech platforms. There\u2019s an opportunity for a product to create this experience where professionals can thrive in their flexible working careers. The issue is not really a female one it\u2019s a human one. But if we just focus on women all we\u2019re doing is entrenching gender roles.\u201d\n She said Juggle is going after the traditional recruitment industry which has not adapted to the modern workforce: \u201cThe problems that we\u2019re facing for a future workforce\u2026 need to be solved through a technology platform, and not by not the legacy industries that have created [the problems]

"note_en": "To finance the acquisition of its well-funded competitor,  Kobiton   raised a $14 million extension to its $5.2 million Series A from its existing investor  BIP Capital and new investor  Fulcrum Equity Partners.\n As Kobiton CEO Kevin Lee told me, we shouldn\u2019t take that as the acquisition price, but it\u2019s probably a fair guess that the real price isn\u2019t too far off. The companies declined to disclose the exact price, though. Mobile Labs, which was founded in 2011, had raised about $15 million before the acquisition,  according to Crunchbase. The last time it raised outside funding was in 2014. Kobiton and Mobile Labs do not share any common investors.\n   It\u2019s interesting that Kobiton, which launched in 2017 and which may seem like a smaller player at first glance, was able to acquire Mobile Labs. Lee argues that one of the reasons why Mobile Labs decided to sell is that while his company has long focused on using machine learning to help developers build the tests for their apps \u2014 and the open-source Appium testing framework \u2014 Mobile Labs had fallen behind in this area.\n \u201cThey were a little slow to invest in [AI] and I think they realized \u2014 and rest of the market, I think will realize it \u2014 if you don\u2019t invest heavily and early, you kind of get behind the eight ball,\u201d Lee told me.\n He also noted that there are a lot of obvious synergies between the two companies. Mobile Labs has a lot of clients in the gaming and financial services space, for example. A lot of those clients are relatively new to mobile, while Kobiton\u2019s existing customer base is often mobile-first.\n \u201cThey\u2019ve been around for 10 years and [have] a lot of partners, a lot of stuff outside the US,\u201d Lee noted. \u201cThey have mainly have focused on what I would call large established enterprises in regulated industries or industries that are really concerned about IP protection \u2014 so behind the firewalls \u2014 where they really succeeded well.\u201d\n Those Mobile Labs customers, Lee said, were also looking for AI/ML-based testing solutions and the acquisition will now allow the two companies to layers Kobiton\u2019s technology on top of the Mobile Labs solution. There will be an upgrade path for these customers and they\u2019ll be able to do so at their own pace. There\u2019s no plan to sunset Mobile Labs\u2019 existing services for the time being, though some of Mobile Labs\u2019 individual brands may change names.\n With this acquisition, Kobiton will more than double the number of its US-based employees, though that\u2019s in part because a good portion of the company\u2019s team is based in Vietnam.", "posttime": "2020-11-05 22:05:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "mobile,kobiton", "title": "\n\u79fb\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0Kobiton\u878d\u8d441400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u6536\u8d2d\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624bMobile Labs", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMobile testing platform Kobiton raises $14M, acquires competitor Mobile Labs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/mobile-testing-platform-kobiton-raises-14m-acquires-competitor-mobile-labs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["mobile", "kobiton"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "728a080ab7d012484eb2ac6dd2c73b01.jpg", "infoid": 1033342, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u806a\u660e\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684Axios AM&Amp\uff1bPM\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\n\u652f\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u806a\u660e\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u8ba2\u9605\u6211\u4eec\u7684Axios AM&Amp\uff1bPM\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636eCOVID\u8ffd\u8e2a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5468\u4e09\u62a5\u544a\u6bcf\u5929\u65b0\u589e103,087\u4f8b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u611f\u67d3\uff0c\u521b\u4e0b\u5355\u65e5\u75c5\u4f8b\u7eaa\u5f55\u3002\n\u91cd\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\u8fd9\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u4e00\u5929\u5185\u62a5\u544a\u8d85\u8fc710\u4e07\u4f8b\u65b0\u75c5\u4f8b-\u8fd9\u63d0\u9192\u4eba\u4eec\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9009\u7968\u7684\u7ee7\u7eed\u6e05\u70b9\uff0c\u9009\u4e3e\u7684\u5229\u5bb3\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u5927\u3002\n\u5468\u4e09\u7684\u8bb0\u5f55\u662f\u5728\u660e\u5c3c\u82cf\u8fbe\u5dde\u3001\u5bbe\u5915\u6cd5\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u4fc4\u4ea5\u4fc4\u5dde\u5728\u9009\u6c11\u6295\u7968\u65f6\u521b\u4e0b\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u5dde\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u5929\u3002\n\u73b0\u72b6\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u572810\u670830\u65e5\u521b\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5355\u65e5\u6700\u9ad8\u7eaa\u5f55--9.7\u4e07\u4f8b\u3002\n\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\uff0cCOVID\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9879\u76ee\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e861116\u4f8b\u65b0\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u548c2802\u4f8b\u65b0\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u6cbb\u7597\u3002\n\u770b\u70b9\uff1a\u516c\u5171\u4e13\u5bb6\u8b66\u544a\u8bf4\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fdb\u5165\u51ac\u5b63\uff0c\u6d41\u611f\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u4e0e\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6d41\u611f\u76f8\u4ea4\uff0c\u75c5\u4f8b\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4eba\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n\u7f8e\u56fd\u98df\u54c1\u548c\u836f\u7269\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\u524d\u5c40\u957f\u65af\u79d1\u7279\u00b7\u6208\u7279\u5229\u5e03\u4e0a\u5468\u65e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u662f\u611f\u6069\u8282\u5c06\u662f\u8f6c\u6298\u70b9\uff0c\u5c4a\u65f6\u5404\u5dde\u5c06\u5f00\u59cb\u51fa\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\u3002", "note_en": "Support safe, smart, REAL journalism.

"note_en": "\u201cThere is no syllable one can speak that is not filled with tenderness and terror, that is not, in one of those languages, the mighty name of a god.\u201d  \u2014 Jorge Luis Borges, \u201cThe Library of Babel\u201d (1941)\n \u201cWitness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of dreamers. A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page\u2026He\u2019ll have a world all to himself\u2026without anyone.\u201d   \u2014 Rod Serling, \u201cTime Enough at Last,\u201d  The Twilight Zone (1959)\n When entering a huge library\u2014whether its rows of books are organized under a triumphant dome, or they\u2019re encased within some sort of vaguely Scandinavian structure that\u2019s all glass and light, or they simply line dusty back corridors\u2014I must confess that I\u2019m often overwhelmed with a massive surge of anxiety. One must be clear about the nature of this fear\u2014it\u2019s not from some innate dislike of libraries, the opposite actually. The nature of my trepidation is very exact, though as far as I know there\u2019s no English word for it (it seems like some sort of sentiment that the Germans might have an untranslatable phrase for). This fear concerns the manner in which the enormity of a library\u2019s collection forces me to confront the sheer magnitude of all that I don\u2019t know, all that I will never know, all that I can never know. When walking into the red-brick modernist hanger of the British Library, which houses all of those brittle books within a futuristic glass cube that looks like a robot\u2019s heart, or the neo-classical Library of Congress with its green patina roof, or Pittsburgh\u2019s large granite Carnegie Library main branch smoked dark with decades of mill exhaust and kept guard by a bronze statue of  William Shakespeare, my existential angst is the same. If I start to roughly estimate the number of books per row, the number of rows per room, the number of rooms per floor, my readerly existential angst can become severe. This symptom can even be present in smaller libraries; I felt it alike in the small-town library of Washington, Penn., on Lincoln Avenue and in the single room of the Southeast Library of Washington D.C. on Pennsylvania Avenue. Intrinsic to my fear are those intimations of mortality whereby even a comparatively small collection must make me confront the fact that in a limited and hopefully not-too-short life I will never be able to read even a substantial fraction of that which has been written. All those novels, poems, and plays; all those sentiments, thoughts, emotions, dreams, wishes, aspirations, desires, and connections\u2014completely inaccessible because of the sheer fact of finitude.\n Another clarification should be in order\u2014my fear isn\u2019t the same as worrying that I\u2019ll be found out for having never read any number of classical or canonical books (or those of the pop, paper-back variety either). There\u2019s a scene in  David Lodge\u2019s classic and delicious campus satire   Changing Places: A Tale of Two Campuses in which a group of academics play a particularly cruel game, as academics are apt to do, that asks participants to name a venerable book they\u2019re expected to have read but have never opened. Higher point-values are awarded the more canonical a text is; what the neophytes don\u2019t understand is that the trick is to mention something standard enough that they still can get the points for having not read it (like  Laurence Sterne\u2019s   Tristram Shandy) but not so standard that they\u2019ll look like an idiot for having never read it. One character\u2014a recently hired English professor\u2014is foolish enough to admit that he skipped   Hamlet in high school. The other academics are stunned into silence. His character is later denied tenure. So, at the risk of making the same error, I\u2019ll lay it out and admit to any number of books that the rest of you have probably read, but that I only have a glancing Wikipedia familiarity with:  Marcel Proust\u2019s   Remembrance of Things Past,  James Joyce\u2019s   Finnegan\u2019s Wake,  Don DeLillo\u2019s   White Noise,  David Foster Wallace\u2019s   Infinite Jest. I\u2019ve never read  Harper Lee\u2019s   To Kill a Mockingbird, which is ridiculous and embarrassing, and I feel bad about it. I\u2019ve also never read  Jonathan Franzen\u2019s   The Corrections, though I don\u2019t feel bad about that (however I\u2019m wary that I\u2019ve not read the vast bulk of  J.K. Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter books). Some of those previously mentioned books I want to read, others I don\u2019t; concerning the later category, some of those titles make me feel bad about my resistance to them, others I haven\u2019t thought twice about (I\u2019ll let you guess individual titles\u2019 statuses).\n I offer this contrition only as a means of demonstrating that my aforementioned fear goes beyond simply imposter syndrome. There are any number of reasons why we wish we\u2019d read certain things, and that we feel attendant moroseness for not having done so\u2014the social stigma of admitting such things, a feeling of not being educated enough or worldly enough, the simple fact that there might be stuff that we\u2019d like to read, but inclination, will power, or simply time has gotten in the way. The anxiety that libraries can sometimes give me is of a wholly more cosmic nature, for something ineffable affects my sense of self when I realize that the majority of human interaction, expression, and creativity shall forever be unavailable to me. Not only is it impossible for me to read the entirety of literature, it\u2019s impossible to approach even a fraction of it\u2014a fraction of a fraction of it. Some several blocks from where I now write is the Library of Congress, the largest collection in the world, which according to its website contains 38 million books (that\u2019s excluding other printed material from posters to pamphlets). If somebody read a book a day, which of course depends on the length of the book, it would take somebody about 104,109 years and change to read everything within that venerable institution (ignoring the fact that about half-a-million to a million new titles are published every year in English alone, and that I was also too unconcerned to factor in leap years).\n If you\u2019re budgeting your time, may I suggest the British Library, which though it has a much larger collection of other textual ephemera, has a more manageable 13,950,000 books, which would take you a breezy 38,291 years to get through. If you\u2019re of a totalizing personality, according to Google engineers from a 2010 study estimating the number of books ever written, you\u2019ll have to wade through 129 million volumes of varying quality. That would take you 353,425 years to read. Of course this ignores all of that which has been written but not bound within a book\u2014all of the jottings, the graffiti, the listings, the diaries, the text messages, the letters, and the aborted novels for which the authors have wisely or unwisely hit \u201cDelete.\u201d Were some hearty and vociferous reader to consume one percent of all that\u2019s ever been written\u2014one percent of that one percent\u2014and then one percent of that one percent\u2014they\u2019d be the single most well-read individual to ever live. When we reach the sheer scale of how much human beings have expressed, have written, we enter the realm of metaphors that call for comparisons to grains of sand on the beach or stars in our galaxy. We depart the realm of literary criticism and enter that of cosmology. No wonder we require curated reading lists.\n For myself, there\u2019s an unhealthy compulsion towards completism in the attendant  tsuris over all that I\u2019ll never be able to read. Perhaps there is something stereotypically masculine in the desire to conquer all of those unread worlds, something toxic in that need. After all, in those moment\u2019s of readerly ennui there\u2019s little desire for the experience, little need for quality, only that desire to cross titles off of some imagined list. Assume it were even possible to read all that has been thought and said, whether sweetness and light or bile and heft, and consider what purpose that accomplishment would even have. Vaguely nihilistic the endeavor would be, reminding me of that old apocryphal story about the conqueror, recounted by everyone from the 16th-century theologian  John Calvin to  Hans Gruber in   Die Hard, that \u201c Alexander the Great\u2026wept, as well indeed he might, because there were no more world\u2019s to conquer,\u201d as the version of that anecdote is written in  Washington Irving\u2019s 1835 collection   Salmagundi: Or, The Whim-whams and Opinions of Launcelot Langstaff, Esq. and Others. Poor Alexander of Macedon, son of Philip, educated in the Athenian Lyceum by  Aristotle, and witness to bejeweled Indian war-elephants bathing themselves on the banks of the Indus and the lapis lazuli encrusted Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the gleaming, white pyramids at Cheops and the massive gates of Persepolis. Alexander\u2019s map of the world was dyed red as his complete possession\u2014he\u2019d conquered everything that there was to be conquered. And so, following the poisoning of his lover  Hephaestion, he holed up in  Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s Babylonian palace, and he binged for days. Then he died. An irony though, for Alexander hadn\u2019t conquered, or even been to all the corners of the world. He\u2019d never sat on black sand beaches in Hokkaido with the Ainu, he\u2019d never drank ox-blood with the Masai or hunted the giant Moa with the Maori, nor had he been on a walkabout in the Dreamtime with the Anangu Pitjantjatjara or stood atop Ohio\u2019s Great Serpent Mound or seen the grimacing stone-heads of the Olmec. What myopia, what arrogance, what hubris\u2014not to conquer the world, but to think that you had. Humility is warranted whether you\u2019re before the World or the Library.\n Alexander\u2019s name is forever associated not just with martial ambitions, but with voluminous reading lists and never-ending syllabi as well, due to the library in the Egyptian city to which he gave his name, what historian  Roy MacLeod describes in   The Library of Alexandria: Centre of Learning in the Ancient World as \u201cunprecedented in kingly purpose, certainly unique in scope and scale\u2026destined to be far more ambitious [an] undertaking than a mere repository of scrolls.\u201d The celebrated Library of Alexandria, the contents of which are famously lost to history, supposedly confiscated every book from each ship that came past the lighthouse of the city, had its scribes make a copy of the original, and then returned the counterfeit to the owners. This bit of bibliophilic chicanery was instrumental to the mission of the institution\u2014the Library of Alexandria wasn\u2019t just a repository of legal and religious documents, nor even a collection of foundational national literary works, but supposedly an assembly that in its totality would match all of the knowledge in the world, whether from Greece and Egypt, Persia and India.  Matthew Battles writes in   Library: An Unquiet History that Alexandria was \u201cthe first library with universal aspirations; with its community of scholars, it became a prototype of the university of the modern era.\u201d Alexander\u2019s library yearned for completism as much as its namesake had yearned to control all parts of the world; the academy signified a new, quixotic emotion\u2014the desire to read, know, and understand  everything. By virtue of it being such a smaller world at the time (at least as far as any of the librarians working there knew) such an aspiration was even theoretically possible.\n \u201cThe library of Alexandria was comprehensive, embracing books of all sort from everywhere, and it was public, open to anyone with fitting scholarly or literary qualifications,\u201d writes  Lionel Casson in   Libraries in the Ancient World. The structure overseen by the Ptolemaic Dynasty, who were Alexander\u2019s progeny, was much more of a wonder of the ancient world than the Lighthouse in the city\u2019s harbor. Within its walls, whose appearance is unclear to us,  Aristophanes of Byzantium was the first critic to divide poetry into lines, 70 Jews convened by  Ptolemy II translated the Hebrew Torah into the Greek Septuagint, and the geographer  Eratosthenes correctly calculated the circumference of the Earth. Part of the allure of Alexandria, especially to any bibliophile in this fraternity of dreamers, is the fact that the vast bulk of what was kept there is entirely lost to history. Her card catalogue may have included lost classical works like  Aristotle\u2019s second book of  Poetics on comedy (a plot point in  Umberto Eco\u2019s medieval noir   The Name of the Rose), Protagoras\u2019s essay \u201cOn the Gods,\u201d the prophetic books of the  Sibyllines,  Cato the Elder\u2019s seven-book history of Rome, the tragedies of the rhetorician  Cicero, and even the comic mock-epic  Magrites supposedly written by  Homer.\n More than the specter of all that has been lost, Alexandria has become synonymous with the folly of anti-intellectualism, as its destruction (variously, and often erroneously, attributed to Romans, Christians, and Muslims) is a handy and dramatic narrative to illustrate the eclipse of antiquity. Let\u2019s keep some perspective though\u2014let\u2019s crunch some numbers again. According to  Robin Lane Fox in   The Classical World: An Epic History from Homer to Hadrian the \u201cbiggest library\u2026was said to have grown to nearly 500,000 volumes.\u201d Certainly not a collection to scoff at, but Alexander\u2019s library, which drew from the furthest occident to the farthest orient, has only a sixth of all the books in the Library of Congress\u2019s Asian Collection; Harvard University\u2019s Widener Library has 15 times as many books (and that\u2019s not including the entire system); the National Library of Iran, housed not far from where Alexander himself died, has 30 times the volumes than did that ancient collection. The number of books held by the Library of Alexandria would have been perfectly respectable in the collection of a small midwestern liberal arts college. By contrast, according to physicist  Barak Shoshany on a Quora question, if the 5 zettabytes of the Internet were to be printed, then the resultant stack of books would have to fit on a shelf \u201c4\u00d710114\u00d71011 km or about 0.04 light years thick,\u201d the last volume floating somewhere near the Oort Cloud. Substantially larger shelves would be needed, it goes without saying, than whatever was kept in the storerooms of Alexandria with that cool Mediterranean breeze curling the edges of those papyri.\n To read all of those scrolls, codices, and papyri at Alexandria would take our intrepid ideal reader a measly 1,370 years to get through. More conservative historians estimate that the Library of Alexandria may have housed only 40,000 books\u2014if that is the case, then it would take you a little more than a century to read (if you\u2019re still breezing through a book a day). That\u2019s theoretically the lifetime of someone gifted with just a bit of longevity. All of this numeric stuff misses the point, though. It\u2019s all just baseball card collecting, because what the Library of Alexandria represented\u2014accurately or not\u2014was the dream that it might actually be possible to know everything worth knowing. But since the emergence of modernity some half-millennia ago, and the subsequent fracturing of disciplines into ever more finely tuned fields of study, it\u2019s been demonstrated just how much of a fantasy that goal is. There\u2019s a certain disposition that\u2019s the intellectual equivalent of Alexander, and our culture has long celebrated that personality type\u2014the Renaissance Man (and it always seems gendered thus). Just as there was always another land to be conquered over the next mountain range, pushing through the Kush and the Himalayan foothills, so too does the Renaissance Man have some new type of knowledge to master, say geophysics or the conjugation of Akkadian verbs. Nobody except for Internet cranks or precocious and delusional autodidacts actually believes in complete mastery of all fields of knowledge anymore; by contrast, for all that\u2019s negative about graduate education, one clear and unironic benefit is that it taught me the immensity and totality of all of the things that I don\u2019t know.\n Alexandria\u2019s destruction speaks to an unmistakable romance about that which we\u2019ll never be able to read, but it also practically says something about a subset of universal completism\u2014our ability to read everything that has survived from a given historical period. By definition it\u2019s impossible to actually read all of classical literature, since the bulk of it is no longer available, but to read all of Greek and Roman writing which survives\u2014 that is doable. It\u2019s been estimated that less than one percent of classical literature has survived to the modern day, with Western cultural history sometimes reading as a story of both luck and monks equally preserving that inheritance. It would certainly be possible for any literate individual to read all of  Aristophanes\u2019s plays, all of  Plato\u2019s dialogues, all of  Juvenal\u2019s epigrams. \u00a0Harvard University Press\u2019s venerable Loeb Classical Library, preserving Greek and Latin literature in their distinctive minimalist green and red covered volumes, currently has 530 titles available for purchase. Though it doesn\u2019t encompass all that survives from the classical period, it comes close. An intrepid and dogged reader would be able to get through them, realistically, in a few years (comprehension is another matter).\n If you need to budget your time, all of Anglo-Saxon writing that survives, that which didn\u2019t get sewn into the back-binding of some inherited English psalm book or found itself as kindling in the 16th century when  Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries, is contained across some four major poetic manuscripts, though 100 more general manuscripts endure. The time period that I\u2019m a specialist in, which now goes by the inelegant name of the \u201cearly modern period\u201d but which everybody else calls the \u201cRenaissance,\u201d is arguably marked as the first time period for which no scholar would be capable of reading every primary source that endures. Beneficiary of relative proximity to our own time, and a preponderance of titles gestated through the printing press, it would be impossible for anyone to read everything produced in those centuries. For every William Shakespeare play, there are hundreds of yellowing political pamphlets about groups with names like \u201cMuggletonians;\u201d for every  John Milton poem, a multitude of religious sermons on subjects like double predestination. You have to be judicious in what you choose to read, since one day you\u2019ll be dead. This reality should be instrumental in any culture wars d\u00e9tente\u2014 canons exist as a function of pragmatism.\n The canon thus functions as a kind of short-cut to completism (if you want to read through all of the Penguin Classics editions with their iconic black covers and their little avian symbol on the cover, that\u2019s a meager 1,800 titles to get through). Alexandria\u2019s delusion about gathering all of that which has been written, and perhaps educating oneself from that corpus, drips down through the history of Western civilization. We\u2019ve had no shortage of Renaissance Men who, even if they hadn\u2019t read every book ever written, perhaps at least roughly know where all of them could be found in the card catalogue. Aristotle was a polymath who not only knew the location of those works, but credibly wrote many of them (albeit all that remains are student lecture notes), arguably the founder of fields as diverse as literary criticism to dentistry. In the Renaissance, whereby it could be assumed that the attendant Renaissance Man would be most celebrated, there was a preponderance of those for whom it was claimed that they had mastered all disciplines that could be mastered (and were familiar with the attendant literature review).  Leonardo da Vinci,  Blaise Pascal,  Athanasius Kircher,  Isaac Newton, and  Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz have all been configured as Renaissance Men, their writings respectively encompassing not just art, mathematics, theology, physics, and philosophy, but also aeronautics, gambling, sinology, occultism, and diplomacy as well.\n Stateside both  Benjamin Franklin and  Thomas Jefferson\n......", "posttime": "2020-11-05 21:58:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u68a6\u60f3\u5bb6,fraternity,\u56fe\u4e66\u9986", "title": "\u68a6\u60f3\u5bb6\u7684\u5144\u5f1f\u4f1a", "title_en": "A Fraternity of Dreamers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://themillions.com/2020/10/a-fraternity-of-dreamers.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u68a6\u60f3\u5bb6", "\u56fe\u4e66\u9986"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "eb9134a9b5be8db5814b597fcdb6e495.jpg", "infoid": 1033340, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e00\u6295\u8d44\u7c7b\u522b\u5728\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5df2\u8fc5\u901f\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7c7b\u522b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5b83\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u56f0\u60d1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "note_en": "Despite being relatively new to market, this investment category has quickly become one of the most active.

"note_en": "Every week, Netflix sends out thousands of takedown requests, most of which target pirated copies of its movies and TV-shows.\n Yesterday, however, we spotted a series of copyright infringement notices with a different and rather uncomfortable theme.\n The streaming giant asked Twitter to remove dozens of tweets that included footage from the French coming-of-age film  Cuties. This film hasn\u2019t been without controversy and the same can be said about the takedown requests too.\n  To provide some context, Netflix acquired the global distribution rights for Cuties and started promoting it this summer. This created quite some backlash as many people felt that the young actors had been sexualized after being filmed in all kinds of suggestive poses.\n We won\u2019t go into the various viewpoints on this topic or the lawsuit Netflix faces in Texas over \u2018 lewd visual material.\u2019 Opinions from both sides are readily available all over the web, including social media.\n For a while, the hashtags #cancelnetflix was trending and today it\u2019s still being used. It\u2019s clear that, weeks after the film came out, many people are still upset.\n  Netflix didn\u2019t cancel Cuties, however, but this week it actively started to pull Cuties clips from Twitter. Not just a handful, but several dozens. Legally the company is allowed to do this of course, as they own the rights. However, it is at least a bit peculiar that the company appears to have targeted only negative tweets.\n The good news is that the texts of the tweets remain online. We don\u2019t know if that is Twitter\u2019s decision or if Netflix had a say in it. The  takedown requests, which are posted  on Lumen, target the full tweet URLs.\n  Over the past day, we took a detailed look at the flagged tweets which all condemn Netflix. The language is quite harsh at times, including terms such as child exploitation,  pedophilia, as well as repeated calls to  cancel Netflix.\n TorrentFreak spoke to Amber, who had a video that was posted in her tweet removed. This wasn\u2019t an illegally recorded clip of the film, she says, but the trailer which was widely distributed by Netflix.\n \u201cSomeone posted the trailer and I retweeted it and stated how I felt about the movie. I believe people have the right to be upset about the movie. If people share the trailer and say \u2018go watch it\u2019 it\u2019s not a problem but if someone disagrees with it, it\u2019s a problem,\u201d she tells us.\n  Like many others, Amber had no idea that she had done anything work. There was no indication that retweeting the trailer would be a problem or that she would break the law doing so. Clearly upset, she decided to delete her Twitter account.\n \u201cThe whole thing is just sad and shame on Netflix and Twitter for taking away people\u2019s voices. That is how I feel,\u201d Amber says.\n Author and entrepreneur Sindiso Lubisi was also affected by the takedowns. He posted some clips on Twitter to criticize the content. Today, most of the clips are removed but the accompanying tweets, with hundreds of likes and retweets, survived.\n Lubisi says he wasn\u2019t contacted by Twitter or Netflix directly. In his case, Netflix has a stronger claim as he  posted short clips from the film itself instead of the trailer, but fair use would still be a defense.\n  All the targeted tweets we\u2019ve seen are negative about Cuties. This also applies to  one posted by Twitter user \u201cllessurtap\u201d who is 100% sure that the video he posted was just the trailer.\n \u201cThis is vile &amp; 11 year old girls should NOT be using dance expression to convey sexuality. As a father it makes me want to PUKE!\u201d he tweeted at the time, sharing the Cuties trailer.\n  Llessurtap received an email from Twitter informing him that the content had been removed following a request from the copyright holder. He also says that his account was temporarily locked as a result, but is now accessible again.\n  Whether Netflix views copies of the trailer are being shared online seems unlikely. When we searched briefly, we could easily find other trailers, albeit  not in a negative context. Nonetheless, the takedown notices clearly mention copyright issues.\n We reached out to Netflix to hear why the company is suddenly going after Cuties clips on Twitter but at the time of writing, we have yet to hear back. It\u2019s possible that the company has a good reason, but the context in which this is happening is definitely odd.\n As mentioned earlier, the targeted tweets are all focused on negative Cuties responses. The easy conclusion would be that Netflix is trying to shove these under the carpet. However, there are still thousands of similar comments online, so that wouldn\u2019t be very effective.\n  That said, these takedown notices are certainly out of the ordinary. Over the past month, Netflix has asked Twitter to remove (content from) roughly 300 tweets. More than half of these were sent on November 3, singling out the Cuties tweets.\n Another big difference is that tweets that were targeted earlier appear to target classic pirated content from accounts such as ShowsPopular, SeriesFilmy, iMeuTv, and  StreamComplet2.\n Finally, as we hinted at before, even if Netflix is legally allowed to remove the Cuties trailers and clips from Twitter, that doesn\u2019t make it right. It seems that the people who were targeted have a clear fair use defense.\n After all, people can use copyrighted clips for \u2018criticism\u2019 under some conditions, and if there\u2019s anything beyond doubt it\u2019s that the targeted tweets are critical.", "posttime": "2020-11-05 21:32:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Every year, TorrentFreak compiles a list of the  most popular torrent sites in the world. The vast majority are general purpose sites that link to a wide variety of content, meaning they are of interest to most people.\n However, a major outlier is Nyaa, a site focused on anime and other East Asian media. That makes its position among the top five torrent sites in the whole world even more impressive since it derives large volumes of traffic from a relative niche audience\n Located at Nyaa.si, the platform is a reincarnation of the now-defunct Nyaa.se and like its predecessor has had its fair share of copyright-related issues. In 2018, Nyaa.si was kicked out by Cloudflare for  alleged abuse of its copyright systems, a claim denied by the site. Now, however, things have become much more personal.\n  Documents obtained by TorrentFreak dated September reveal the MPA, acting through legal representatives, attempting to pressure individuals who they believe are important at Nyaa and could have the ability to shut the site down.\n Information suggests that several people in North America, Europe, and Australia have all received similar correspondence. The letters allege massive copyright infringement via the Nyaa site and include a sample of copyrighted works, to which the MPA\u2019s members hold the rights, that were allegedly infringed via the platform.\n The MPA clearly states that none of its cited members (Disney, Paramount, Universal, Columbia, Warner Bros, and Netflix, in addition to Amazon) have granted their permission for the works to be made available via Nyaa or the BitTorrent network(s) that underpin it. As a result, \u201csignificant, irreparable damage\u201d has already been caused to the copyright owners by the site\u2019s activities.\n  While emailed threats are still a common anti-piracy strategy, we are informed that at least two of the individuals were personally served with legal documents at their homes. Others were served with similar documents via regular mail.\n We are currently unable to determine exactly how many people were served in total. At the moment the suggestion is around five but that may not be the full picture. What we do know is that some or all stand accused of being part of the mysterious \u2018Anime Cartel\u2019 supposedly behind Nyaa.\n TorrentFreak has no way to confirm whether those who received letters are in any position of power at Nyaa but we are told that some \u2013 if not all \u2013 were at some point involved in fansubbing \u2013 i.e creating subtitles for anime releases that appeared on Nyaa. Nevertheless, the MPA appears to be operating from the position that these individuals are key to the running of Nyaa so, as a result, are making several demands.\n With immediate effect, recipients have been told to take all necessary steps to ensure that Nyaa is completely shut down. The MPA also wants to take control of the site\u2019s domain \u2013 Nyaa.si \u2013 a common tactic in other anti-piracy actions. Overall, recipients are warned that they must cease-and-desist any and all of their activities related to the site, including making available the copyrighted works of the MPA\u2019s members.\n  Documentation seen by TorrentFreak indicates that the MPA\u2019s outreach represents an opportunity to bring the allegedly-infringing activities to an early conclusion, thereby avoiding what could develop into costly legal action. Perhaps unsurprisingly, at least some of the individuals are being given an opportunity to pay a financial settlement to help that along.\n We understand that when combined, these settlements (payable in local currency) amount to many tens of thousands of dollars but based on current information, it is unclear whether any of the letter recipients have taken the movie group up on its offer.\n In addition to receiving settlements, it appears that the MPA also wants information on the Nyaa service and its operations. The MPA also wants the rights to the Nyaa site and any technologies connected to it, wherever the recipient has the ability to transfer those rights. The MPA also demands that those entering into a settlement agreement should never infringe its members\u2019 rights again.\n  It is common for the MPA and associated Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment to demand confidentiality from their targets. On the other hand, it\u2019s also common for them to insist that when they want to publicize a settlement, they may do so.\n The settlement offers currently on the table don\u2019t deviate from this standard, noting that while the agreement must remain confidential, the MPA reserves the right to publicize its achievements in the event Nyaa is shut down.\n  TorrentFreak isn\u2019t able to confirm whether the individuals approached have anything to do with the running of Nyaa or whether any are negotiating with the MPA in some way, either along the lines of their settlement offers or perhaps outside of those less formally.\n What we can confirm is that the MPA demanded that the torrent site should be quickly shut down in September and that has clearly not happened. For the site\u2019s tens of millions of monthly visitors that will come as a relief, particularly considering the  untimely demise of HorribleSubs, a group dedicated to official stream-ripping, just over a month ago.", "posttime": "2020-11-05 21:11:37", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7535\u5f71,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u5f8b\u5e08,giant,nyaa", "title":

"note_en": "Bulletins       The law will replace the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was passed in 2018, following a separate push to get a privacy measure on the ballot that year. The author and chief financial backer of Proposition 24, real estate mogul Alastair Mactaggart, was behind CCPA&#39;s passage as well.\n  &#34;With tonight&#39;s historic passage of Prop 24, the California Privacy Rights Act, we are at the beginning of a journey that will profoundly shape the fabric of our society by redefining who is in control of our most personal information and putting consumers back in charge of their own data,&#34; Mactaggart said in a statement Wednesday.\n  Earlier this year, Mactaggart told Protocol that he wanted to take a new privacy initiative, then called the California Privacy Rights Act, to the ballot because he had watched business groups attempt to undermine CCPA through changes in the legislature. &#34;At some point it feels like when you let your guard down, one of these changes is going to come through, have a massive impact, and end up gutting the law,&#34; Mactaggart  said at the time.\n  He undertook months of negotiations with privacy groups and business leaders, including tech giants like Facebook, Google and Microsoft in hopes of coming up with a measure that both advocacy and industry groups could live with. But Prop. 24 ended up splitting the privacy community, with organizations like Consumer Reports coming out in favor of the measure and the ACLU coming out against it. The tech community notably didn&#39;t fight the measure the way they did when Mactaggart was first pushing a privacy initiative in 2018.\n But that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re supportive of it either. On Election Day, Linda Moore, CEO of the lobbying group TechNet told Protocol that while her organization hadn&#39;t taken a firm stance on Prop. 24, the measure is &#34;not at all in alignment&#34; with TechNet&#39;s views on privacy law. &#34;Part of our opposition is a part of the ballot measure [which] lays out that no changes can be made to [it] without a supermajority of the legislature, which is incredibly hard to corral,&#34; Moore said. &#34;The legislature should be in charge, along with the governor, in setting privacy policy. This takes it out of the hands of the people who can work on this complicated issue.&#34;\n The new law will preserve much of CCPA, but it will also allow Californians to require companies to limit the use of their sensitive personal information, create a new agency to handle privacy law enforcement and establish new fines for violations of children&#39;s privacy rights, among other things. Groups like the ACLU worry that the complex nature of Prop. 24 will introduce new loopholes for businesses that further expose Americans&#39; data or require them to pay for data protection.\n  Businesses operating in California now have until January of 2023 to comply with the new law before it goes into effect.", "posttime": "2020-11-05 21:05:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

disease has been overblown. In August President Trump retweeted a post claiming that only 6 percent of these reported deaths were actually from COVID-19. (The tweet originated from a follower of the debunked conspiracy fantasy QAnon.) Twitter removed the post for containing false information, but fabrications such as these continue to spread. U.S. Representative\u00a0Roger Marshall of Kansas  complained in September that Facebook had removed a post in which he claimed that 94 percent of COVID-19 deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cwere the result of 2-3 additional serious illnesses and were of advanced age.\u201d\n Now some facts: Researchers know beyond a doubt that the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have surpassed 200,000. These numbers are supported by three lines of evidence, including death certificates. The inaccurate idea that only 6 percent of the deaths were really caused by the coronavirus is \u201ca gross misinterpretation\u201d of how death certificates work, says Robert Anderson, lead mortality statistician at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.\n The scope of the coronavirus\u2019s deadly toll is clear, even if final numbers  will not be known until the pandemic is over. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident about the scale and order of magnitude of deaths, but we\u2019re not clear on the exact number yet,\u201d says Justin Lessler, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. To understand why the figures contain some uncertainty, it is important to know how they are collected and calculated.\n The first source of death data is called case surveillance. Health care providers are required to report cases and deaths from certain diseases, including measles, mumps and now COVID-19, to their state\u2019s health department, which, in turn, passes this information along to the CDC, Anderson says. The surveillance data are a kind of \u201cquick and dirty\u201d accounting, says Shawna Webster, executive director of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems. The states gather all the information they can on these diseases, but this is the first pass of the accounting\u2014no one has time to double-check the information or look for missing lab tests, she says. For that, you have to look for the next source of information: vital records.\n  This second line of evidence comes from the  National Vital Statistics System, which records birth and death certificates. When somebody dies, a death certificate is filed in the state where the death occurred. And after the records are registered at a state level, they are sent to the National Center for Health Statistics, which tracks deaths at a national level. Death certificates are not filed in the system until outstanding test results are in and the information is as complete as possible. By the time a record gets to the vital records system, \u201cit is as close to perfect as it\u2019s going to get,\u201d Webster says.\n A physician, medical examiner or coroner fills out the cause of mortality on the death certificate, and they are instructed to include only those conditions that caused or contributed to death, Anderson says. One field lists the sequence of events leading to the death. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really trying to get at is the condition or disease that started the chain of events leading to the death,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cFor COVID-19, that might be something like acute respiratory distress due to pneumonia due to COVID-19.\u201d A second part of the certificate lists other significant conditions that may have contributed to the death yet were not part of the sequence of events that led up to it, he says. These are called comorbidities, and while they can be contributing factors, they cannot be directly involved in the chain of cause and effect that ended in death. Preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes or heart disease are common comorbidities, and they can make a person more vulnerable to the coronavirus, Anderson says, \u201cbut the fact is: they\u2019re not dying from that preexisting condition.\u201d\n \u201cWhen we ask if COVID killed somebody, it means \u2018Did they die sooner than they would have if they didn\u2019t have the virus?\u2019\u201d Lessler says. Even such a person with a potentially life-shortening preexisting condition such as heart disease or diabetes may have lived another five, 10 or many more years, had they not become infected with COVID-19.\n The 6 percent number touted by Trump and QAnon comes from a  weekly CDC report stating that in 6 percent of the coronavirus mortality cases it counted, COVID-19 was the only condition listed on the death certificate. That observation likely means that those death certificates were incomplete because the certifiers only gave the underlying cause of death and not the full causal sequence that led to it, Anderson says. Even someone who does not have a preexisting condition and dies from COVID-19 will also have comorbidities in the form of symptoms, such as respiratory failure, caused by the coronavirus. The idea that a death certificate with ailments listed in addition to COVID-19 means that the person did not really die from the virus is simply false, Anderson says.\n The surveillance and vital statistics data provide a pretty good picture of how many deaths are attributable to the coronavirus, but they do not capture all of them, and that is where the final line of evidence come in: excess deaths. They are the number of deaths that occur above and beyond the historical pattern for that time period, says Steven Woolf, a physician and population health researcher at the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine. In a paper published in  JAMA this month, Woolf and his colleagues  examined death records in the U.S. from March 1 through August 1 and compared them with the expected mortality numbers. They found that there was a 20 percent increase in deaths during this time period\u2014for a total of 225,530 excess deaths\u2014compared with previous years.\n Two thirds of these cases were attributed to COVID-19 on the death certificates, and Woolf says there are two types of explanations for the rest: Some of them were COVID-19 deaths that simply were not documented as such, perhaps because the person died at home and was never tested or because the certificate was miscoded. And some of the extra deaths were probably a consequence of the pandemic yet not necessarily the virus itself. For instance, he says, imagine a patient with chest pain who is scared to go to the hospital because they do not want to get the virus and then dies of a heart attack. Woolf calls this \u201cindirect mortality.\u201d \u201cThe deaths aren\u2019t literally caused by the virus itself but the pandemic is claiming lives,\u201d he says.\n The numbers in Woolf\u2019s study come from provisional death data, the kind that the CDC has not yet checked for miscoding or other issues, so it comes with some degree of imprecision. What builds his confidence in these results, however, is the fact that they have been replicated numerous times by his group and others. \u201cAll serious analyses of these data are showing that the number of deaths we\u2019re hearing on the news is an undercount,\u201d he says.\n COVID-19 is now the third leading cause of death in the U.S. Whether the deaths add up to 218,511, 219,681 or 219,541\u2014as reported by the CDC, Johns Hopkins University and the  New York Times, respectively, on October 19\u2014it\u2019s a staggering number of lives cut short.\n Read more about the coronavirus outbreak from Scientific American   here.

"note_en": "While it seems likely that some future version of the accessory will sport that functionality, truth is there are two primary technologies at the heart of the newer, more modular battery pack: wireless charging and good old-fashioned adhesive. That means, among other things, that the system effectively works with any handset that supports Qi wireless charging.\n In fact, the system is actually pretty bare bones by design. There\u2019s not even a case included in the box. You\u2019ve got to supply your own. Instead, the system ships with the battery pack, a grip/stand and, helpfully, two adapters. That last bit is nice in case you need a do-over or plan sharing the battery with someone else.\n   Installation is pretty simple. There\u2019s even a little cardboard guide to insure you center it properly, \u00e0 la the sort of frame you\u2019d get to install a screen protector. You can install it directly onto the back of the phone, as well, but I prefer to stay noncommittal with my accessories if possible. That said, you\u2019ll need to live with the little adapter nub on the rear of your device when other accessories aren\u2019t attached.\n The accessories slide onto the anchor from the side. The battery pack is easily the nicest-looking part of the whole rig \u2014 and the one that most closely retains the design language of the original Juice Packs. The ring/stand is a bit cheaper-feeling and feels like a bit of an afterthought to occupy the system when not charging. One of the big trade-offs is that the more compact battery design means a smaller capacity; 5,000mAh isn\u2019t bad, but you can find a higher capacity case for cheaper.\n  The other trade-off you probably already know, which is that wireless charging is slower than the wired kind. For that reason, the system is better adapted to keeping your device alive for long stretches, rather than fast charging. That said, if you\u2019re really in a pinch and have the right cables handy, you can charge your phone up faster via the USB-C port (which is also used to top off the battery).\n The Connect Stand is serviceable. It serves better as a stand than a grip. It would be useful if the company offered something more like a Pop Socket for a more solid grip. That\u2019s the nice thing about modularity, though \u2014 they can always add more accessories.

"note_en": "The sovereign wealth fund is investing $1.3 billion in  Reliance Retail   for a 2.04% equity stake in the largest retail chain in India. The investment values Reliance Retail, which was founded in 2006, at $62.4 billion, the Indian firm said.\n Reliance Retail, which serves more than 3.5 million customers each week (as of early this year) through its nearly 10,000 physical stores in more than 6,500 cities and towns in the country, has now  raised over 6.4 billion since September this year.\n  Ambani (pictured above), who raised more than $20 billion for Jio Platforms this year from a roster of marquee investors including Facebook and Google, is expected to raise another few billion dollars for Reliance Retail by the end of the year. One of the companies that is  widely expected to invest in Reliance Retail is Amazon, which has poured in  over $6.5 billion in its India business to date.\n The two commerce giants are currently stuck in a deadlock over Reliance\u2019s  $3.4 billion acquisition of several businesses of Future Retail, the second largest retail chain in India. Amazon, which owns  a small stake in one of Future Retail\u2019s subsidiaries, is  fighting a legal battle to block the deal between Reliance and Future Retail. Future Retail and Reliance Industries have said that they intend to proceed with their deal.\n \u201cWe at Reliance have a long-standing relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. PIF is at the forefront of the economic transformation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I welcome PIF as a valued partner in Reliance Retail and look forward to their sustained support and guidance as we continue our ambitious journey to transform India\u2019s retail sector for enriching the lives of 1.3 billion Indians and millions of small merchants,\u201d said Ambani, who runs Reliance Retail\u2019s parent firm,  Reliance Industries,   in a statement today.\n As for Reliance Retail, the retail chain last year entered the e-commerce space with JioMart through a joint venture with Jio Platforms.\u00a0JioMart now has a presence in  over 200 Indian cities and towns, and it also maintains a  partnership with Facebook for WhatsApp integration.\u00a0Facebook, which\u00a0 invested $5.7 billion in Jio Platforms earlier this year, has said it will explore various ways to work with Reliance to digitize the nation\u2019s 60 million mom and pop stores, as well as other small and medium-sized businesses.\n \u201cWe are pleased to be furthering our trusted partnership with Reliance Industries, the leading player in some of India\u2019s most exciting sectors,\u201d said Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Governor of PIF, in a statement. \u201cThis investment further demonstrates PIF\u2019s commitment to generating returns for the Saudi people and driving the economic diversification of Saudi Arabia.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-11-05 20:37:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

"note_en": "As many of us have seen, personal trainers, yoga teachers and similar types of freelance professionals have all had to shift to offering virtual sessions over Zoom and similar platforms. But until recently, these sessions were hard to monetize.\n Since the pandemic arrived, Citysocializer recognized this phenomenon and quickly pivoted to a hybrid model, which they describe as being somewhere between  Airbnb\u2019s Online experiences and  Meetup.com.\n  It\u2019s now become a platform for virtual fitness classes, learning workshops, and the like, with users in the UK, Europe, US and Canada participating in hundreds of live, virtual group events, classes, and workshops. The company has previously raised a \u00a31.5m VC funding from PROfounders Capital and EC1 Capital.\n CEO and founder  Sanchita Saha says she has seen per person event bookings increase 300% from an average of two to six events per person per month. She said: \u201cBecause the world is set to be in various stages of lockdown over the next six months or more, now more than ever people need and want to feel connected, be entertained, creatively inspired, stay fit and on top of their mental health \u2013 and the easiest and safest way to do that is virtually\u2026 Enabling workers from these industries to monetize their skills and talents by hosting their own virtual events for a captive audience who are stuck at home is a win-win situation.\u201d\n She said former workers in the hospitality and entertainment industries \u2013 hit hard by the pandemic \u2013 are switching to offering things like cocktail classes; chefs are hosting cooking classes; and singers, musicians and entertainers are using the platform to host live virtual gigs. Other activities include Games nights (Pictionary, Articulate, Bingo..); Theatre, Performance &amp; Storytelling Workshops; Wine Workshops; Beauty &amp; skincare classes and Guided Meditations.\n But why would someone not just throw up an Eventribe page or similar to achieve this? Speaking to TechCrunch, Saha said: \u201cWe have a social networking and community piece that sits around the events, who are already actively attending virtual events, classes and workshops and inviting their friend networks on Citysocializer to join them as well. There are also higher repeat bookings because of this. If someone joins an event once and enjoys it, we make it easy (and they are more likely) to join future events. Hosts can build a following for their events amongst the community.\u201d\n Most events and experiences are priced \u00a34 \u2013 \u00a315 per household, or discounted with Citysocializer membership that starts from \u00a39.99/month. Commercial event hosts earn 100% of the net revenue from their event bookings and can host multiple events for international users across multiple time zones.\n Another startup that has appeared during the pandemic to take advantage of this switch to virtual events has been  Livelink, which offers \u2018tailored recommendations for live content and events\u2019 via email. Curators, who don\u2019t even have to be running the actual virtual events, find the live content available and send their selection to subscribers via the platform.", "posttime": "2020-11-05

"note_en": "Osome, a Singapore-headquartered business assistant app that digitizes accounting and compliance tasks, has raised $3 million. An extension of Osome\u2019s  seed round, the new funding was led by XA Network and AltaIR Capital.\n The startup currently has about 4,500 SME clients across Singapore, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom, founder and chief executive officer Victor Lysenko told TechCrunch. The new funding brings Osome\u2019s total raised to $8 million from investors including Target Global. \u201cWe are in a good place in terms of cash reserves and operational performance so we used this opportunity to raise funding before a much larger Series A planned for 2021,\u201d Lysenko said.\n  When the startup launched in 2018, he said it reached $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of the year, then increased that amount to $4 million in December 2019. Osome expects to hit $8 million ARR by the end of this year.\n Osome\u2019s platform uses machine learning-based tech to automate administrative, accounting, payroll and tax-related work. Depending on subscription tier, it also gives businesses access to chartered accountant services.\n  The startup started two years ago in Singapore, where it also offers incorporation services, before expanding to the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.\n Lysenko told TechCrunch that Osome launched in Singapore because the country\u2019s \u201csimple business rules and a simple tax system allowed us to offer clients a ready-made solution quickly.\u201d The city-state\u2019s small size also made it easier to get quick client feedback and arrange partnerships.\n Osome is now looking at Australia as a potential new market, because of its proximity to its Singapore headquarters and its similar accounting and corporate service rules.\n  Thanks to the country\u2019s relatively digital and streamlined process for incorporating businesses, several other tech-based business service platforms are also based in Singapore. These include Sleek, Lanturn and Bluemeg. Despite competing with each other, Lysenko said the number of companies \u201cis an excellent support for our thesis that this market is ripe for disruption.\u201d\n \u201cHaving said that, we believe that while all our competitors are looking at this space from a digital perspective, our special sauce is that we digitize the process to a much deeper extent and do not rely on third-party solutions as much as others do,\u201d he added.\n The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns prompted some companies to start using Osome, particularly in the e-commerce segment. About one in 10 of Osome\u2019s clients earn most of their revenue online, and that share is growing, Lysenko said.\n \u201cWe found ourselves in a very stable industry,\u201d he added. \u201cWe saw a slight 10% drop in revenue in April and May, but in June, growth resumed, and we returned to our previous trajectory. We have tripled our revenue in the last 12 months.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-11-05 20:37:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "Kicking off in 2016, Brave saw its first  1.0 release almost 4 years later, and following another trip around the Sun, it has hit the milestone of 20.5 million active monthly users.\n At the same time last year, the browser had 8.7 million active monthly users, and of the 20 million monthly users, 7 million are daily users, which represents more than a doubling of last year&#39;s 3 million.\n Brave added that since Apple allowed  browsers other than its own to be the default option on iOS, it has seen its iOS user base increase by a third.\n   One of the touted features of the browser is that it hates ads, and will go out of its way to block them, unless users decide to see Brave-powered advertisements. To that end, Brave has hit &#34;2 billion ad confirmation events&#34; and completed 2,215 campaigns from over 460 companies. The browser maker says its users have a click-through rate of 9%, way and away outstripping industry averages.\n The browser also has its own cryptocurrency, Basic Attention Tokens, that users use to &#34;tip&#34; content creators. Thus far, 26 million of the tokens have been sent to creators. At the time of writing, the blockchain-based token is  trading for just under 18 cents, meaning $4.6 million has been sent from users.\n &#34;Users are fed up with surveillance capitalism, and 20 million people have switched to Brave for an entirely new web ecosystem with an opt-in ad economy that puts them back in control of their browsing experience,&#34; said Brendan Eich, CEO and co-founder of Brave.\n   &#34;The global privacy movement is gaining traction, and this milestone is just one more step in our journey to make privacy-by-default a standard for all Web users.&#34;\n In June, Brave was caught out for\u00a0 auto-completing certain URLs to append a referral id.\n Eich said at the time it was a mistake, while  others looked at Brave&#39;s source code and found it was doing the same thing to links to Ledger, Trezor, and Coinbase.\n   &#34;The autocomplete default was inspired by search query clientid attribution that all browsers do, but unlike keyword queries, a typed-in URL should go to the domain named, without any additions. Sorry for this mistake \u2013 we are clearly not perfect, but we correct course quickly,&#34; Eich said.\n  While Brave boasts of hitting its 20 million number, Firefox has\u00a0 reported\u00a0having 10 times that number to sit above 220 million. According to  Statcounter, Firefox&#39;s market share is 4%, while Chrome itself has 66% of the market, giving it an install base measured in multiple billions.", "posttime": "2020-11-05 20:36:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,\u6708\u5ea6,monthly", "title": "\u52c7\u6562\u8005\u57281.0\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e00\u5e74\u8fbe\u52302000\u4e07\u6708\u5ea6\u7528\u6237", "title_en": "Brave Hits 20 Million Monthly Users a Year After 1.0 Release", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/brave-hits-20-million-monthly-users-a-year-after-1-0-release/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u5e03", "\u6708\u5ea6", "monthly"]}]
