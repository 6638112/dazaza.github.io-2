Louise Fitzhugh—author of  Harriet the Spy—and James Merrill—the poet—were joined by friendship, craft, and graphomania: the compulsion to write.</p><p>Louise Fitzhugh，哈里埃特的作者，诗人James Merrill被友谊，工艺和格拉曼尼亚加入：写作的强迫。 Louise Fitzhugh-Author of Harriet The Spy-and James Merrill-The Poet  - 由友谊，工艺和Graphymania加入：写作的强迫。</p><p> Harriet the Spy, Louise Fitzhugh’s iconic 1964 novel, appears to be a book with an aspiring writer as its protagonist, but the writer is the vehicle for the actual main character: her notebook. Harriet’s notebook acts like the broom in “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” Goethe’s fable (made famous by Mickey Mouse in Walt Disney’s  Fantasia). The apprentice animates his broom to do his dirty work, but then he can’t turn off the spell. Like the apprentice’s broom, the notebook initially seems to be Harriet’s helper, a dutiful work of magic under the author’s control that helps the writer learn lots of titillating secrets—yet the book soon dominates, the process itself becoming the story, the tool overtaking its master. At its core, then, Fitzhugh’s classic isn’t a novel about a budding writer—it’s about the act of writing. And writing, for Harriet, goes far beyond a benign act of recording or expressing her feelings. More than that:  Harriet the Spy is a compelling case study of graphomania.</p><p> 哈丽斯·斯蒂格·斯蒂茨富姬的标志性的1964小说，似乎是一本带有抱负的作家作为主角的书，但作者是实际主角的车辆：她的笔记本。哈丽特的笔记本类似于“巫师的学徒”的扫帚，歌德的寓言（由Walt Disney的幻想幻想寺庙所闻名）。学徒会让他的扫帚动漫肮脏的工作，但是他无法关闭咒语。就像学徒的扫帚一样，笔记本电脑最初似乎是哈丽特的帮助，这是作者控制下的一切忠实的魔法，帮助作者了解大量的刺激秘密 - 然而这本书很快就占主导地位，这个过程本身成为故事，这个工具超越了这个故事掌握。在它的核心，那么，Fitzhugh的经典不是一个关于崭露头角的作家的小说 - 这是关于写作的行为。和写作，为哈丽特，远远超出了良好的录音或表达她的感情。不止于此：哈丽特谍，这是对石像亚洲的令人信服的案例研究。</p><p> Graphomania, or the compulsion to write, might seem like a boon for an aspiring author. Incredibly prolific writers like Joyce Carol Oates (whose Twitter production alone is staggering, not to mention that she also publishes titles under the pseudonyms Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly) and Walter Mosley (whose dozens of titles include  The Graphomaniac’s Primer: A Semi-Surrealist Memoir) use their hypergraphic tendencies to fuel productivity. More often, however, graphomania dissolves into logorrhea and incoherent nonsense. Harriet’s notebook walks that fine line. It is at once her trusted confidante and her traitor: the very thing she loves the most also becomes her downfall. Harriet’s graphomania is inextricably braided with secrecy: secrets only come to life on the page, and that’s where they need to stay to remain safe.</p><p> Graphymania，或者强迫写作，可能看起来像一个有抱负的作者的福音。令人难以置信的多产作家，如乔伊斯卡罗·奥茨（单独推特生产令人震惊，更不用说她也在假名罗萨蒙史密斯和Lauren Kelly（劳尔·凯利）下出版的标题（其数十个标题包括Graphomaniac的底漆：半超现实主义的回忆录）使用它们的超图倾向来燃料生产力。然而，更常见的是，Graphymania溶解成令人障碍和非连贯的废话。哈丽特的笔记本走了那条细线。它立即得到了她信任的信念和她的叛徒：她最喜欢的是她最令人沮丧的事情。哈丽特的Graphymania与保密性钩住：秘密只会在页面上生命，这就是他们需要保持安全的地方。</p><p>    Sometimes You Have to Lie, Leslie Brody’s excellent new biography of Fitzhugh, reveals its subject’s genius not only as a writer of children’s literature but as an artist. Fitzhugh is primarily remembered as the creator of Harriet, the (in Fitzhugh’s words) “nasty little girl” of the  Harriet the Spy novels—but, as Brody documents, Fitzhugh’s work is about far more than that. The later Harriet novels delve into racial inequity and social justice, with  Nobody’s Family Is Going to Change focusing on a Black family in Harriet’s Upper East Side neighborhood.</p><p>    有时你必须撒谎，Leslie Brody的Fitzhugh新的传记，揭示了其受试者的天才，不仅是儿童文学的作家，而且是作为艺术家。 Fitzhugh主要被记住为哈拉特的创造者，（在Fitzhugh的话语）“令人讨厌的小女孩”的哈里埃特小说 - 但作为Brody文件，Fitzhugh的工作大约不止于此。后来的哈里埃特小说深入研究种族不公平和社会正义，没有人的家人将改变哈丽特上东侧邻居的黑人家庭。</p><p> Even though Harriet is outspoken, and though Fitzhugh’s work pushes boundaries, during Fitzhugh’s lifetime, she kept her own personal life closely under wraps. Although  Harriet the Spy became a phenomenon and Harriet one of most iconic and beloved characters of children’s literature, her author remained deeply elusive to the reading public.</p><p> 尽管哈拉特直言不讳，但虽然Fitzhugh的工作推动了边界，但在Fitzhugh的一生中，她让她自己的个人生活密切关注。虽然哈丽特间谍成为儿童文学最具标志性和心爱的人物中的现象和哈丽特，但她的作者仍然难以忽视阅读公众。</p><p> Much of the secrecy was due to her sexuality; as Brody notes, exposure of a children’s book writer as a lesbian was still publicly unacceptable long after Stonewall. Yet Fitzhugh, Brody reveals, was at the center of a vibrant literary and artistic circle. One of the more surprising revelations in  Sometimes You Have to Lie is the relationship between Fitzhugh and her first faculty adviser at Bard, the poet James Merrill. Indeed, Merrill’s the person to whom Fitzhugh originally described Harriet as the “nasty little girl who keeps a notebook on all her friends.”</p><p> 大部分秘密是由于她的性行为;随着Brody Notes，儿童书籍作家作为女同性恋者的曝光仍然在石墙之后仍然公开不可接受。然而，Brody揭示了Fitzhugh，是在充满活力的文学和艺术圈的中心。有时你必须撒谎的一个更令人惊讶的启示是Fitzhugh和她的第一家族顾问在诗人James Merrill之间的关系。事实上，Merrill是Fitzhugh最初将哈丽特描述为“在她所有朋友身上保留笔记本的令人讨厌的小女孩”的人。</p><p> Merrill and Fitzhugh are also connected through their graphomania, and through a key object—Harriet’s notebook, Merrill’s Ouija board—that allows them to both unlock secrets and keep them safe.</p><p> Merrill和Fitzhugh也通过他们的Graphymaia连接，并通过一个关键的Object-Harriet的笔记本，Merrill的Ouija Board  - 这让他们既可以解锁秘密，并保持安全。 </p><p>    Fitzhugh was born in Memphis and raised in her millionaire grandparents’ mansion. Her father and grandparents lavished attention, money, and servants on their precocious, dainty-looking girl (Fitzhugh was four feet eleven inches fully grown). They told her that her mother was dead—but that was a lie. In reality, her parents had had a scandalous divorce when Fitzhugh was a baby, with her mother losing all custody. Eventually, Fitzhugh realized that the strange woman who occasionally lurked around the mansion was her mother. So Fitzhugh learned that adults lied, and extravagant attention was never to be trusted.</p><p>Fitzhugh出生于孟菲斯，并在她百万富翁祖父母的豪宅中提出。她的父亲和祖父母慷慨地关注，金钱和仆人在他们的早期精致的女孩（Fitzhugh是四英尺11英寸完全成长）。他们告诉她，她的母亲已经死了 - 但这是谎言。实际上，当Fitzhugh是一个婴儿时，她的父母有一个丑闻离婚，她的母亲失去了所有的监护权。最终，Fitzhugh意识到偶尔在豪宅周围潜伏的陌生女人是她的母亲。因此，Fitzhugh了解到成年人撒谎，并且奢侈的关注永远不会被信任。</p><p> Harriet’s notebook’s entries, always in all-capital block letters, enter the novel like voices from beyond. At first, Harriet is at the center of every act of writing, and before we get a direct quote from the book, we see Harriet in action: “Harriet wrote in her notebook”; “She sat on some steps and took out her book”; “When she recovered herself she grabbed her notebook.” The observations shift from snarky photographic records of daily life to interior monologue. Harriet watches a self-satisfied wealthy couple who appear to sit around all day smirking and declaring in smug, if doth-protest-too-much, tones how glad they are not to have children. “IF THEY HAD A BABY IT WOULD LAUGH IN ITS HEAD ALL THE TIME AT THEM,” she writes, “SO IT’S A GOOD THING THEY DON’T. I’M GLAD I’M NOT PERFECT—I’D BE BORED TO DEATH.”</p><p> 哈丽特的笔记本的条目，始终处于全部资本的块字母，从超越外面输入像语音的小说。起初，哈丽特位于每一项写作行为的中心，在我们从书中获得直接报价之前，我们看到哈拉特行动：“哈丽特写在她的笔记本上写道”; “她坐在一些步骤上拿出书”; “当她恢复自己时，她抓住了她的笔记本。”观察结果从日常生活记录转向内部独白。哈拉特看着一个自满的富裕情侣，似乎整天坐在傻笑和宣布的耻辱，如果是抗议 - 太多，音调有多高兴他们不生孩子。 “如果他们有一个宝宝，它会一直嘲笑他们的头脑，”她写道，“所以这是一个好事。我很高兴我不完美 - 我会感到无聊。“</p><p> Children’s writing by adult authors often seems squelched: either drowning in squishy-cute whimsy or a drolly robotic Dick-and-Jane autotune. Harriet’s notebook, however, comes to life as its power grows. The observations veer from wildly mundane (“MISS WHITEHEAD’S FEET LOOK LARGER THIS YEAR”) to weirdly associative (“I HAVE HEARD THAT PIGEONS MAKE PEOPLE GET CANCER”) to just plain mean (“IF MARION HAWTHORNE DOESN’T WATCH OUT SHE’S GOING TO GROW UP INTO A LADY HITLER”). But all of them share one trait: they have a clear, sharp voice, distinct from both Harriet’s and the narrator’s.</p><p> 儿童的成年作者的写作通常似乎突然突然：要么淹死狡猾的奇思妙想，要么是粗糙的机器人Dick-and-Jane自动运动。然而，哈丽特的笔记本随着力量的发展而来。从疯狂的妇女地区的观察意见（“今年的白头脚下看起来更大”）到奇怪的联想（“我听说鸽子让人们患有癌症”）只是平凡的（“如果Marion Hawthorne不看她会去长大到一位女士希特勒“）。但所有这些都分享一个特质：他们有一个明确，尖锐的声音，与哈丽特和叙述者不同。</p><p> To really possess the reader, sometimes you have to be possessed to the point of losing control.</p><p> 为了真正拥有读者，有时你必须拥有失去控制的程度。</p><p> In the first half of the novel, the reader only gets to read the notebook filtered through Harriet’s perspective: that is, we only get to see her words as Harriet’s writing them down. But that all changes when Harriet loses the notebook, and Fitzhugh does her big reveal. Harriet doesn’t possess the notebook: the notebook possesses her. In the novel’s climactic setup, Harriet and her classmates play a version of tag where the person who’s “it” has to knock all the schoolbooks off the others. Once she’s been tagged, Harriet realizes her notebook’s gone missing. She flies into a panic, screeching as she races back to rejoin the group—but, of course, they’ve already found the damning journal. As soon as the notebook’s out of Harriet’s hands, Fitzhugh abruptly packs Harriet home and to bed, even though it’s the middle of the afternoon. Harriet is a marionette, and, without the notebook to pull her strings, she collapses into an inert bundle of limbs and joints. Having dispatched Harriet, Fitzhugh swings her full spotlight onto the students reading the notebook. The students only want to read about themselves, and the notebook provides for them, readily yielding up gold nuggets. For the first time, we get to read what’s in the notebook without actually seeing Harriet  in scribende flagrante.</p><p> 在小说的上半场，读者只能通过Harriet的角度来阅读笔记本过滤的笔记本：也就是说，我们只能看到她的话语作为哈丽特写下他们的话。但是，当哈里埃丢失笔记本时，所有的变化都会做她的大露出。哈丽特没有笔记本：笔记本拥有她。在小说的高潮设置中，哈丽特和她的同学扮演一个标签版，那个“它”的人将所有的校对脱离他人。一旦她被标记，哈丽特就实现了她的笔记本失踪了。她陷入了一种恐慌，尖叫着，因为她回到了群体 - 但当然，他们已经发现了该渔获期刊。一旦笔记本电脑从哈丽特的手中出来的，Fitzhugh突然包装了哈丽特家和睡觉，即使这是下午中期。哈丽特是一个牵线木偶，而没有笔记本滚动她的弦，她陷入惰性束肢体和关节。派遣哈丽特，Fitzhugh将她的全部聚光灯摇摆到读笔记本的学生身上。学生们只想读自己，笔记本为他们提供了，容易屈服于金块。我们第一次来阅读笔记本中的内容，而实际上在斯克拉图斯斯克拉特州看到哈拉特。</p><p> At this point, the notebook takes over. She graphomaniacally records every detail as though it won’t exist unless she writes it. “THEY ARE OUT TO GET ME,” we read in the notebook. “THE WHOLE ROOM IS FILLED WITH MEAN EYES.” Harriet pours herself more and more into the notebook, and the notebook absorbs her. “During math class she wrote all the time,” Fitzhugh reports. “The next day was even worse. She didn’t even make any pretense of doing her work. She just wrote all the time.” Harriet’s harried parents send her to a therapist—and just as the tag game is the eerily perfect excuse to get the notebook out of Harriet’s hands, the therapy session is crafted to target her craving. When the therapist brings out his notepad, every synapse in Harriet’s body starts twitching. He gives her a notebook, and she lights up, spending the rest of the session scribbling.</p><p> 此时，笔记本电脑接管了。她将所有细节记录，除非她写它，否则它不会存在。 “他们出去了，”我们在笔记本中读书。 “整个房间都充满了卑鄙的眼睛。”哈拉特越来越多地倾倒在笔记本上，笔记本吸收了她。 “在数学课程中，她一直在写，”Fitzhugh报道。 “第二天更糟糕。她甚至没有借着她的工作借口。她刚写一直写道。“哈里埃特的曾经担心的父母送她去治疗师 - 就像标签游戏就是让笔记本电脑从哈里埃特的手中获得的热情借口，治疗会议被制作以瞄准她的渴望。当治疗师带出他的记事本时，哈丽特的身体的每个突触都开始抽搐。他给了她一本笔记本，她点亮了，花了剩下的会议潦草。</p><p> Harriet’s notebook also displays warning signs of typomania, the desire to see one’s name in print: “I AM GOING TO FINISH UP THESE MEMOIRS AND SELL THEM TO THE BOOK OF THE MONTH SELECTION THEN MY MOTHER WILL GET THE BOOK IN THE MAIL AS A SURPRISE. THEN I WILL BE SO RICH AND FAMOUS THAT PEOPLE WILL BOW IN THE STREETS AND SAY THERE GOES HARRIET M. WELSCH—SHE IS VERY FAMOUS YOU KNOW. RACHEL HENNESSEY WILL PLOTZ.”</p><p> 哈丽特的笔记本也显示了typomania的警告标志，看到一个人的名字打印：“我要完成这些回忆录并将他们卖给月份的选项书，然后我的母亲将把这本书邮件作为一个惊喜。然后我会如此富有和名人，人们会在街上鞠躬并说出去哈丽特米·韦尔彻 - 她非常有名。 Rachel Hennessey将Plotz。“ </p><p> In the novel’s grand finale, a classmate spills blue ink all over Harriet. Lady Harriet Macbeth scrubs and scrubs, staining her bathtub blue in her effort to wash away the sins. The only thing that can reverse the notebook’s power is writing. Harriet publishes a retraction in the student newspaper, which appears in the notebook’s all-caps style, denouncing the writings in the notebook as “UNFAIR STATEMENTS” and “LIES,” and offering the class a “GENERAL APOLOGY.” The retraction works: Harriet’s friends return to her, and she’s able to rejoin sixth-grade society.</p><p>在小说的大决赛中，一个同学们在哈里埃特洒了蓝墨水。 Lady Harriet Macbeth擦洗和磨砂，染色浴缸蓝色，努力洗掉罪。唯一可以扭转笔记本电源的东西是写作。哈丽塔在学生报纸上发表撤回，这些报纸出现在笔记本的全面的风格中，将笔记本中的着作谴责为“不公平陈述”和“谎言”，并提供“一般道歉”。撤退工作：哈丽特的朋友回到她身边，她能够重新加强六年级社会。</p><p> But truth isn’t the ultimate goal: writing itself is. Harriet’s notebook has the last word: “SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LIE,” declares the notebook. In order to keep writing—in order to keep the story going—Harriet had to pretend to be reformed. “NOW THAT THINGS ARE BACK TO NORMAL,” she writes, “I CAN GET SOME REAL WORK DONE.”</p><p> 但事实不是最终目标：写作本身就是。哈丽特的笔记本有了最后一句话：“有时你必须撒谎，”宣布笔记本。为了保持写作，为了保持故事，哈拉特不得不假装改革。 “现在事情回归正常，”她写道，“我可以得到一些真正的工作。”</p><p>    Harriet the Spy is also beloved as a novel celebrating queerness, from Harriet’s unisex uniform—blue jeans, hoodie, tool belt—to her disgust for stereotypical gender roles. In most young adult books, the novel’s twist would be to turn away from the notebook, the protagonist giving up childish things as she grows up. After chasing each other in tag, Sport and Harriet would have fallen down on some grass patch far away from the gang, breathless, and their hands would have touched as they suddenly lurched at each other for a kiss. But  Harriet the Spy isn’t about prepubescent hormones, and, anyway, neither Sport nor Harriet have shown any sexual interest in anyone, let alone each other.</p><p>    哈拉特间谍也是作为一部小说庆祝Queer，从哈里埃特的男女通用统一 - 蓝色牛仔裤，连帽衫，工具腰带 - 对陈规定型性别角色的厌恶。在大多数年轻的成人书中，小说的扭曲将转向从笔记本转向，主角放弃幼稚的东西，因为她长大了。在互相追逐标签时，体育和哈里埃特将落在一些远离团伙的草地上，气喘吁吁，他们的手会触动他们突然互相吻。但哈丽斯父亲的间谍不是关于青春期激素，无论如何，无论如何，两种运动和哈丽特都没有对任何人表达任何性兴趣，彼此互相别说。</p><p> Fitzhugh’s refusal to bring Sport and Harriet together as a couple has a sharp analog in her own life: her relationship with the poet James Merrill. The “bright, funny, tiny tomboy from Memphis,” as Merrill described her in his memoir,  A Different Person, immediately impressed him with her perfect villanelles. They grew close through tutorials, went out dancing, and, one night, they tumbled into Merrill’s bed. “She began undressing me,” Merrill wrote, but Fitzhugh quickly stopped and fled. Merrill, who was gay, hoped that Fitzhugh might be his “cure” and pursued her. In  A Different Person, Merrill wrote that he “slipped pleading messages into her campus mailbox, brought prophylactics, sought to waylay her on the paths between dormitory and classroom”—to no avail. (Merrill was all of 22 at the time, which doesn’t make his actions less creepy.) Fitzhugh changed her major from literature to psychology and was very clear with Merrill that she had no intention of sleeping with him. She had come out as a lesbian, and she definitely wasn’t interested in any “cure.” Soon, Merrill accepted his own sexuality and stopped trying to pursue Fitzhugh. While they did reconnect and “even went to bed one sunny, tipsy dusk,” as Merrill put it, nothing happened—they were both set in their ways, and “made do with a lifelong friendship.”</p><p> Fitzhugh的拒绝将体育和哈丁们在一起，因为一对夫妇在自己的生活中有一个尖锐的模拟：与詹姆斯美林诗人的关系。 “明亮，有趣的，来自孟菲斯的小小的小男孩”，因为美林地区在他的回忆录中描述了她一个不同的人，立即用她的完美别墅印象深刻。他们通过教程缩写，出去跳舞，一天晚上，他们倒入了美林的床上。 “她开始脱掉我，”美林写道，但Fitzhugh迅速停止了。 Merrill，谁是同性恋，希望Fitzhugh可能是他的“治愈”并追求她。在一个不同的人，美林写道，他“将恳求消息滑入她的校园邮箱，带来了预防性，试图在宿舍和教室之间的路径上，无济于事。 （Merrill当时都是22岁的，这不会使他的行为令人毛骨悚然。她作为一个女同性恋者出来了，她对任何“治愈”肯定不感兴趣。很快，美林的接受了自己的性行为，并停止追求Fitzhugh。虽然他们确实重新连接并“甚至去了一个阳光明媚，但是醉酒黄昏”，因为美林盖了它，没有任何事情发生 - 他们都以他们的方式设置，“与终身的友谊做出了。”</p><p> On the page, the friendship comes through in the profound artistic connection between this odd couple: Harriet’s notebook and Merrill’s Ouija board. For both Fitzhugh and Merrill, writing also lets the master overtake the tool, reversing the magic and regaining authority. In  The Long Secret, Fitzhugh’s sequel to  Harriet the Spy, Harriet has two notebooks going: one for spying and one for writing stories and poems. Notebooks frame not only how she experiences the world, but how she experiences herself. They also provide a balance: notebooks are what allows her to sift through the world and create her own order out of chaos.  The Long Secret has a beautiful digression on how Harriet makes a poem, scouring the alphabet for words that rhyme. She is in control of the writing, creating out of words; as she scrolls through the alphabet, the spell is in her own hands again. Merrill, similarly, writes several volumes of poems alongside  The Changing Light at Sandover that have nothing to do with the Ouija board: though voices from beyond might inspire him, he manages the inspiration.</p><p> 在这个页面上，友谊在这个奇怪的夫妇之间的深刻艺术性联系来源：哈丽特的笔记本和美林的ouija板。对于Fitzhugh和Merrill来说，写作也让主人超越了工具，扭转了魔法和重新获得的权威。在漫长的秘密中，Fitzhugh的Harriet Spy续集，Harriet有两个笔记本电脑：一个用于间谍活动，一个用于写作故事和诗歌。笔记本框架不仅是她如何经历世界，而且她如何经历自己。他们还提供平衡：笔记本是让她通过世界筛选的东西，并从混乱中创造自己的命令。漫长的秘密有一个美丽的讨论哈丽特如何制作一首诗，为押韵的词语偷偷摸摸。她控制着写作，造成了单词;当她通过字母表滚动时，咒语再次在她自己的手中。类似地，Merrill在桑德拉的冰盖上写了几卷诗歌，与Ouija Board无关：虽然来自其他人可能会激励他，但他管理灵感。</p><p> The unlikely friendship between Fitzhugh and Merrill played a relatively minor role in both their lives, but it reveals a major connection in their work: the “sorcerer’s apprentice” mode of writing. Even for these two masters, to really possess the reader, sometimes you have to be possessed to the point of losing control.</p><p> Fitzhugh和Merrill之间的不太可能的友谊在他们的生活中发挥了相对较小的作用，但它在他们的工作中揭示了重要的联系：“巫师的学徒”的写作方式。即使对于这两个大师而言，要真正拥有读者，有时你必须拥有失去控制的程度。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.publicbooks.org/when-the-writing-takes-over-the-writer/">https://www.publicbooks.org/when-the-writing-takes-over-the-writer/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/哈丽特/">#哈丽特</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/louise/">#louise</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/笔记本/">#笔记本</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
