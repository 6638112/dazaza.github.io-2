This post is an attempt to document how the meaning of this term has changed historically.</p><p>最近发布的几款游戏重新点燃了人们对“无赖”一词含义的旧有讨论。这篇文章试图记录下这个词的含义在历史上是如何变化的。</p><p> Roguelikes have evolved separately from mainstream video games: whil e mainstream games focused on features that sell well, roguelikes were made by skilled programmers who wanted to create games interesting for themselves, and share them with other people with similar tastes. The term was never defined well, with every player using it according to their own feelings; for this reason, I have decided to make this quite subjective. Also, much of the emphasis is put on the community — since the roguelikes tend to be ignored by mainstream media, the fans gathered in online communities, which have been crucial for the evolution of the genre.</p><p>流氓游戏与主流视频游戏是分开进化的：主流游戏专注于畅销的功能，而流氓游戏是由熟练的程序员开发的，他们想要为自己创造有趣的游戏，并与其他有相似品味的人分享这些游戏。这个术语从来没有被很好地定义，每个球员都根据自己的感觉来使用它；因此，我决定把它变成相当主观的。此外，大部分的重点都放在了社区上-因为流氓往往被主流媒体忽视，粉丝们聚集在网络社区，这对这一流派的演变至关重要。</p><p>   I have not yet been in any online communities when the term “roguelike” has been coined; luckily, Santiago Zapata has written  a blogpost about this. The term was invented by the Usenet community to group several games which they thought they were similar; these games were (1) free (2) dungeon crawl games (3) using ‘character display’ (in-game entities represented by letters and other characters). Gameplay features such as (4) permadeath or (5) randomness were not considered. Roguelikes at that time included  Rogue,  Moria,  NetHack,  Angband, and several other minor games.</p><p>当“无赖”这个词被创造出来的时候，我还没有进入过任何网络社区；幸运的是，圣地亚哥·萨帕塔(Santiago Zapata)已经就此写了一篇博文。这个术语是由Usenet社区发明的，用来将他们认为相似的几款游戏分组；这些游戏是(1)免费的(2)地下城爬行游戏(3)使用“角色显示”(游戏中的实体由字母和其他字符表示)。游戏特征，如(4)永久死亡或(5)随机性没有被考虑。当时的流氓游戏包括盗贼、莫里亚、奈萨克、英国佬和其他几款小游戏。</p><p>   Around that time, I have been playing  Valhalla (more commonly known as  Ragnarok). Was it a roguelike?</p><p>大约在那个时候，我一直在玩瓦尔哈拉(通常被称为Ragnarok)。是个无赖吗？</p><p>  (2) dungeon crawl — partially: the first major part of the game took part in a forest, although dungeons were prominent too</p><p>(2)地牢爬行-部分：游戏的第一个主要部分是在森林中进行的，尽管地牢也很突出。</p><p> (3) character display — no: it had simple graphics (although you still can see some letter notation in the map above)</p><p>(3)字符显示--不是：它的图形很简单(尽管你在上面的地图上仍然可以看到一些字母符号)。</p><p> (4) permadeath — partially: while in a roguelike you typically you could not reload your older savefile when something bad happens, and start a new game if defeated, Valhalla featured an “expert mode” with very resticted saving, and a “beginner mode” where you could create a reloadable save every 200 turns. Still, the game was balanced for permadeath.</p><p>(4)永久死亡-部分：在像你这样的流氓中，当有不好的事情发生时，你不能重新加载你的旧保存文件，如果被击败，你不能开始新的游戏，Valhara的特点是具有非常严格的保存的“专家模式”，以及“初学者模式”，在这种模式下，你可以每200回合创建一个可重新加载的保存。尽管如此，这场游戏还是平衡了永久死亡的可能性。</p><p> Yet, the  Roguelike FAQ still considered it a roguelike. As it should — the actual gameplay was very similar to  NetHack. It was</p><p>然而，流氓般的常见问题解答(FAQ)仍然认为它是流氓。理应如此--实际的游戏玩法与Nethack非常相似。确实是</p><p>  It had some weird conventions, like you could press the ‘!’ key to see all your potions (this was weird for me, but for roguelike fans it should be obvious — ‘!’ looks like a bottle, and was a typical potion symbol in ASCII roguelikes). I wanted to create my own game like  Valhalla. Many minor roguelikes have been created around that time, such as  Alphaman, a 1995 game set in the post-apocalyptic future when Donald Trump became the president. The Roguelike FAQ also includes  Crossfire which probably would not be called a roguelike now, although I guess that the definition is loosened for multiplayer games.</p><p>它有一些奇怪的惯例，就像你可以按下‘！’查看你所有魔药的钥匙(这对我来说很奇怪，但对流氓粉丝来说应该是显而易见的-‘！’看起来像一个瓶子，是ASCII类流氓的典型药水符号)。我想创造我自己的游戏，就像瓦尔哈拉一样。大约在那个时候，出现了许多小流氓，比如1995年的Alphaman，这是一款以唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)成为总统后世界末日时代的未来为背景的游戏。流氓般的常见问题也包括了CrossFire，它现在可能不会被称为流氓了，尽管我猜多人游戏的定义已经放松了。</p><p>  In 1997,  Diablo was released. If you compare  Diablo to  Angband, the two games are obviously very similar. In fact, the developers originally wanted to create a turn-based roguelike; however, Real-Time Strategy was a hot new genre back then, and they have decided to make it a roguelike/RTS hybrid.  Diablo featured great graphics. I do not know the exact reasons why the developers have decided to drop permadeath, but this was common in commercial roguelike-inspired games back then.</p><p>1997年，《暗黑破坏神》上映。如果你把暗黑破坏神和英国佬相提并论，这两场比赛显然非常相似。事实上，开发者最初想要创造一个基于回合的流氓游戏；然而，当时实时策略是一个热门的新流派，他们决定将其制作为流氓和RTS的混合体。《暗黑破坏神》以出色的画面为特色。我不知道开发者决定放弃永生死亡的确切原因，但这在当时以流氓为灵感的商业游戏中很常见。</p><p> Reviewers did recognize it as a great game, and that it required a new classification — the light story, focus on combat, and randomness made it quite different from typical RPGs. If they recognized that these traits were taken directly from roguelikes, “action roguelike” would probably mean a game similar to  Diablo nowadays; however, they did not, so the new genre was called “action RPG”.</p><p>评论家们确实认为这是一款很棒的游戏，而且它需要一个新的分类--轻松的故事，对战斗的关注，以及随机性使它与典型的RPG有很大的不同。如果他们认识到这些特征是直接从无赖身上获得的，那么“动作无赖”很可能意味着一款类似于现在的“暗黑破坏神”的游戏；然而，事实并非如此，所以这种新类型的游戏被称为“动作RPG”。</p><p>  Somewhere around 1998 one of my school friends has found an  Angband variant called  GSNband. He has shared it with our group of friends, and quite a lot of us loved it too! We also started creating our own roguelike. Reading about  GSNband, I have found that it is classified as a “roguelike”, and learned about the existence of other roguelikes. By then, a new major roguelike has emerged, named  ADOM. It looked interesting, but its “simple character graphics” initially put it off. Eventually, I tried, and it was definitely worth it! I played it like an RPG as first (by copying the save files), but eventually switched to the correct, permadeath way.</p><p>大约在1998年的某个时候，我的一个学校朋友发现了一种叫做GSNband的英式变体。他把它分享给了我们的一群朋友，我们很多人也很喜欢！我们也开始创造我们自己的无赖形象。在阅读有关GSNband的文章时，我发现它被归类为“流氓”，并了解到其他流氓的存在。到那时，一个新的主要流氓出现了，名叫亚多姆。它看起来很有趣，但它的“简单的字符图形”最初让它变得迟钝。最后，我试了，这绝对是值得的！我先把它当RPG来玩(通过复制保存文件)，但最终还是切换到了正确的、永久死亡的方式。</p><p> Some roguelike definitions from around 1999–2001 could be found  on the ADOM website and  on Petri Kuittinen’s site.</p><p>在ADOM的网站和Petri Kuittinen的网站上可以找到1999-2001年左右的一些流氓定义。</p><p> On  Darren Hebden’s site, a list of over 100 roguelikes could be found. There are some omissions that I consider very interesting:</p><p>在达伦·赫布登的网站上，可以找到100多名流氓的名单。我认为有一些遗漏是非常有趣的：</p><p> Beneath Apple Manor, a 1978 game. It came out before Rogue, but it had all the roguelike gameplay elements, invented independently.</p><p>在苹果庄园下面，是1978年的一款游戏。它在《盗贼》之前问世，但它拥有所有流氓般的游戏元素，都是独立发明的。</p><p> Castle of the Winds, a shareware game published in 1993. It was quite popular. if somebody remembered they played some roguelike in the 90’s, the answer was usually Castle of the Winds.</p><p>1993年发布的共享软件游戏《风之城堡》。它很受欢迎。如果有人记得他们在90年代扮演了一些无赖角色，答案通常是《风之城堡》(Castle Of The Winds)。</p><p> Mission Thunderbolt, developed in 1986 on mainframe computers, and released commercially for Windows and Mac in 1992. I have played it around 2010 and it was a really great roguelike, with quite good graphics for its time, great innovative ideas, and optional permadeath. It is sad how unknown this game is.</p><p>任务迅雷，1986年在大型机上开发，1992年在Windows和Mac上商业发布。我在2010年左右玩过它，它真的是一个非常棒的无赖游戏，在那个时代有相当好的图形效果，伟大的创新想法，以及可选的永久死亡。可悲的是，这场比赛是多么的不为人所知。</p><p> Soon I have started participating a bit in the roguelike communities, for example  here I have created a list of features which are typical to roguelikes, but are rare in other games. It was noticed that my list was slanted towards “hacklikes”; I am not a fan of  Nethack itself, but a big fan of  ADOM and  Valhalla. People recognized that roguelikes are difficult to define. Some games started to appear which were a bit difficult to classify:  Decker is a cyberpunk game that I did not consider a roguelike because it had completely different tactics.</p><p>很快我就开始参与一些流氓社区，例如，我在这里创建了一个典型的流氓特征列表，但在其他游戏中却很少见。人们注意到，我的名单偏向于“黑客喜欢”；我不是奈萨克的粉丝，而是亚多姆和瓦尔哈拉的铁杆粉丝。人们认识到流氓是很难定义的。一些很难归类的游戏开始出现：德克尔是一款赛博朋克游戏，我不认为它是流氓游戏，因为它有完全不同的战术。</p><p>  In 2002  DRL (“Doom the Roguelike”) was originally released. It was quite clear from the name what it was: it was a roguelike (character display, turn-based, randomly generated) where your primary weapons were guns, and you fought demons from Doom.</p><p>2002年，DRL(《恶棍末日》)最初发布。从它的名字可以很清楚地看出它是什么：它是一个流氓(角色显示，回合制，随机生成)，你的主要武器是枪，你和来自末日的恶魔作战。</p><p>  RogueBasin is a wiki initially created by Santiago Zapata. Created in 2005, it started collecting the knowledge related to roguelikes. RogueBasin is still active.</p><p>罗格盆地最初是由圣地亚哥·萨帕塔创建的维基。它创建于2005年，开始收集与流氓相关的知识。罗格盆地仍在活动。</p><p>  The first  7DRL challenge has been held in 2005. Roguelikes at that time were often extremely complex games which took years to produce; the 7DRL challenge instead focused on games created in seven days. Many of these submission were very experimental in nature. 7DRL challenge is still active today, with hundreds of roguelikes (and similar games) created every year. In my impression, the 7DRL challenge really helped to extract the specific things which made a game a roguelike. While major roguelikes so far were extremely complex games, 7DRLs did show that you could have a simple game which still had this elusive roguelike feeling.</p><p>第一届7DRL挑战赛于2005年举行。当时的流氓游戏通常是非常复杂的游戏，需要数年时间才能制作完成；而7DRL挑战赛的重点是在7天内创建的游戏。这些意见书中的许多都是非常实验性的。7DRL Challenges至今仍很活跃，每年都有数百款流氓游戏(以及类似的游戏)问世。在我的印象中，7DRL挑战真的帮助提炼出了让一款游戏变得像流氓一样的具体东西。虽然到目前为止，主要的流氓都是非常复杂的游戏，但7DRL确实表明，你可以有一个简单的游戏，但仍然有这种难以捉摸的流氓感觉。</p><p>  Originally released in 2006,  Dwarf Fortress has two modes: the adventure mode and the fortress mode. The adventure mode was a typical roguelike, while the fortress mode shared some features, such as high complexity, random generation and ASCII display.  Dwarf Fortress (and a bit of  ADOM) later became a big inspiration for  Minecraft, one of the most popular games today, and itself an inspiration to many other games such as  Terraria.</p><p>最初于2006年上映的《矮人堡垒》有两种模式：冒险模式和堡垒模式。冒险模式是典型的盗贼模式，而堡垒模式具有高复杂度、随机生成和ASCII显示等特点。《矮人堡垒》(还有一点《阿多姆》)后来成为当今最受欢迎的游戏之一《我的世界》的灵感来源，它本身也是其他许多游戏(如Terraria)的灵感来源。</p><p>  So far, the roguelike discussions were mainly held in Usenet, in the rec.games.roguelike.newsgroups.  Temple of the Roguelike has been established by Santiago Zapata around May 2007, and its web forums quickly gained popularity, while the newsgroups gradually declined. I did not like the Usenet newsgroups too much, and became more active in the Temple forums. I have been also active in the  IVAN forums (Iter Vehemens ad Necem is a graphical and very fun hacklike), where I started my own development contributions, with IVAN3D.</p><p>到目前为止，流氓般的讨论主要是在Usenet举行的，在rec.games.roguelike.news group中。圣地亚哥·萨帕塔在2007年5月左右建立了流氓神庙，它的网络论坛迅速走红，而新闻组却逐渐减少。我不太喜欢Usenet新闻组，在圣殿论坛上变得更加活跃。我还活跃在Ivan论坛(Iter Vehemens ad Necem是一个图形化的，非常有趣的黑客)，在那里我开始了自己的开发贡献，使用IVAN3D。</p><p>  In 2009 the roguelike developers have decided to meet in person, in the first International Roguelike Development Conference. They have decided that they need to actually define what the conference was actually about, and thus the  Berlin Interpretation was born. In my opinion, also  shared by other prominent roguelike people, they mostly failed, for two reasons:</p><p>2009年，这些无赖开发人员决定在首届国际无赖开发大会上面对面会面。他们已经决定，他们需要真正定义这次会议的实际内容，因此柏林的解释就应运而生了。在我看来，他们大多失败了，原因有两个：</p><p> (1) they only knew the games existing at that time, and some features were given too much or not enough weight (just like the original 1993 definition which cared about being free, portable and character display). Soon after, new innovations were created, bringing lots of confusion.</p><p>(1)他们只知道当时存在的游戏，有些功能被赋予了太多或太少的权重(就像1993年最初的定义一样，讲究免费、便携和人物展示)。不久之后，新的创新被创造出来，带来了很多困惑。</p><p> (2) the feeling of being a roguelike is quite elusive, it is more like  I know it when I see it rather than some specific list of features.</p><p>(2)流氓的感觉相当难以捉摸，更像是我看到它时就知道了，而不是一些具体的特征列表。</p><p>  Later in 2009,  Spelunky was released. Spelunky is a platformer which took the compatible elements from roguelikes: random generation, as well as some other minor references, such as the non-modal shops from hacklikes. Moreover, the original version was free. While Derek Yu did not call his game a roguelike, he made it clear that the game takes a lot of inspiration of roguelikes. In turn, Spelunky has inspired lots of other games. Unfortunately, most game journalists and players did not know what a “roguelike” was, and they started referring to games inspired by Spelunky as “roguelikes”. If I recall correctly, we had discussions at the time whether Spelunky should be counted as a roguelike or not; ultimately, it turned out that most people who have actually played the original roguelikes have felt that these games do not capture that elusive roguelike feeling, and called such games “roguelike-likes”, or later “roguelites”.</p><p>2009年晚些时候，斯佩伦基获释。Spelunky是一个平台，它从流氓中吸收了兼容的元素：随机生成，以及其他一些次要的参考，比如Hacklike的非模式商店。此外，最初的版本是免费的。虽然Derek Yu没有把他的游戏称为流氓游戏，但他明确表示，这个游戏需要大量流氓的灵感。反过来，斯佩伦基也启发了很多其他游戏。不幸的是，大多数游戏记者和玩家并不知道什么是“无赖”，他们开始把受到斯皮伦基启发的游戏称为“无赖”。如果我没有记错的话，当时我们曾讨论过Spelunky是否算得上流氓；最后，大多数真正玩过流氓游戏的人都觉得这些游戏没有捕捉到那种难以捉摸的流氓感觉，于是把这类游戏称为“流氓般的喜欢”，或后来的“流氓”。</p><p>  Another interesting departure from the traditional roguelike definition. Similar to  Decker, it had essentially all the basic properties from roguelike definitions (like the Berlin Interpretation), but I did not consider it a roguelike because tactically it was completely different. Still more similar to traditional roguelikes than games such as  Spelunky.</p><p>另一个有趣的背离了传统的流氓定义。与德克尔类似，它本质上拥有流氓定义的所有基本性质(就像柏林的解释)，但我并不认为它是流氓，因为在战术上它是完全不同的。与Spelunky这样的游戏相比，它更像是传统的流氓游戏。</p><p>  In 2008–2011 I have been working on  IRLDb, a database which took the data from RogueBasin and displayed it in a tabular way. It was also integrated with the RogueTemple forums, allowing the members to rate roguelikes, share their successes, and write reviews.</p><p>在2008-2011年间，我一直在从事IRLDb的工作，这是一个数据库，它从罗格盆地获取数据，并以表格的方式显示出来。它还与RogueTemple论坛相结合，允许成员对流氓进行评级，分享他们的成功，并撰写评论。</p><p> Around 2011 the roguelike community has started shifting from the web forums (such as RogueTemple) to  the roguelike subeddit. While the RogueBasin is still updated, the IRLDb ratings mostly show the state around 2011. Most roguelike fans have tried  Angband and  NetHack, but they are not considered to be that good by modern roguelike players. They prefer newer major roguelikes, such as  ADOM (very popular and rated quite highly) or  DCSS (even more popular and more highly rated).  Spelunky is also rated very highly.  Cogmind and  Caves of Qud have already existed by then, but they are (almost) not rated yet. They are extremely popular today.</p><p>大约在2011年，流氓社区开始从网络论坛(比如RogueTemple)转向流氓社区。虽然罗格盆地仍在更新，但IRLDB的评级大多显示了2011年左右的状态。大多数流氓球迷都尝试过Angband和Nethack，但现代流氓玩家认为他们不是那么好。他们更喜欢较新的主要流氓，如Adom(非常受欢迎，评分很高)或DCSS(更受欢迎，评分更高)。Spelunky也被评为非常高的评级。到那个时候，CogMind和Caves of Qud已经存在了，但是它们(几乎)还没有评级。它们现在非常受欢迎。</p><p>  Another innovative game which takes lots of inspiration from roguelikes. While a real-time game, it lets the player pause at any time, which makes it appealing to the part of the roguelike community who do not like action games. Another difference is that, while traditional roguelikes are non-modal (combat and exploration are the same thing), in  FTL you explore the galaxy and get “events”, which may affect your run in some way, or pull you into a combat, which is a separate mode. It calls itself a “spaceship simulation roguelike-like”.</p><p>另一款从流氓身上汲取灵感的创新游戏。虽然这是一款实时游戏，但它允许玩家在任何时候暂停，这使得它对不喜欢动作游戏的流氓社区的一部分很有吸引力。另一个不同之处在于，虽然传统的盗贼是非模式的(战斗和探索是一回事)，但在超光速飞行中，你可以探索银河系并获得“事件”，这可能会以某种方式影响你的跑步，或者将你拖入一场战斗，这是一种独立的模式。它自称是一个“类似于宇宙飞船的模拟流氓”。</p><p>  One of the platformers inspired by  Spelunky. It described itself as a “Rogue-lite. Your character dies, but with each passing your lineage grows and becomes stronger.” Today, there are lots of people who consider themselves experts on roguelikes, and consider  this particular thing to be what separates roguelikes from roguelites. For them, roguelike is a run-based game where the strength of your characters remains roughly constant in subsequent runs, while a roguelite is a run-based game where your characters get stronger and stronger. This feature is also caled “meta-progression” (progression which happens between runs, as opposed to inside a run).</p><p>受斯皮伦基启发的平台之一。它把自己描述成一个“无赖”。你的角色死了，但随着你的血统每过一次，你的血统就会变得越来越强大。“。今天，有很多人认为自己是流氓的专家，认为这种特殊的东西是流氓和流氓的不同之处。对他们来说，流氓是一款基于奔跑的游戏，你的角色的力量在随后的奔跑中保持大致不变，而流氓是一款基于奔跑的游戏，你的角色会变得越来越强壮。这一特性也被称为“元进展”(发生在两次运行之间，而不是在一次运行内部的进展)。</p><p> It does not make too much sense from the point of view of traditional roguelike communities. Most roguelike players seem to see the lack of meta-progression as an advantage — winning  DCSS for the first time after playing it for half a year was a great feeling, that could not be achieved in a meta-progression game, where it is never sure whether you win because you have mastered the game, or because the game let you. However,  NetHack (and other hacklikes) had the “bones” feature, where you could find the remains of a previous adventurer, with all their equiment, which also could make the further games easier.  Sproggiwood,  ToME, or  One Way Heroics have meta-progression, and they still do feel like roguelikes to us.</p><p>从传统流氓社区的角度来看，这没有太大意义。大多数流氓玩家在玩了半年后，似乎第一次把缺乏元进展视为一种优势-赢得了DCSS是一种很棒的感觉，这在元进展游戏中是不可能实现的，因为它永远不确定你赢是因为你掌握了游戏，还是因为游戏让你赢了。然而，Nethack(和其他黑客)有“骨头”功能，在那里你可以找到以前冒险家的遗骸，以及他们的所有装备，这也可以让进一步的游戏变得更容易。斯普格伍德、大部头，或者某种意义上的英雄都有超前发展的作用，但在我们看来，他们仍然像流氓一样。</p><p>  An action platformer. As usual with games from that era, it does not call itself a roguelike, but rather a game “with roguelike elements” or “rogue-lite”. Despite of that, players call it a “classic roguelike” nowadays. While these players give “procedural generation” and “permadeath” as the requirements for this classification,  Risk of Rain is not really procedurally generated: the level layout is mostly the same in every run (actually, there is one of two choices).</p><p>一个动作平台。与那个时代的游戏一样，它并不自称是流氓游戏，而是一款“带有流氓元素的游戏”或“流氓-轻量级”游戏。尽管如此，如今的玩家称其为“经典的流氓游戏”。虽然这些玩家给出了“程序生成”和“永久死亡”作为这个分类的要求，但雨的风险并不是真正在程序上生成的：每次运行的关卡布局几乎都是相同的(实际上，有两种选择之一)。</p><p>  According to the Steam store page, “ Darkest Dungeon is a challenging gothic roguelike turn-based RPG about the psychological stresses of adventuring”. While previously the developers of games inspired by roguelikes clearly said that their games are not roguelikes themselves (only inspired by them), it appears that the more recent games just call themselves roguelikes.</p><p>根据蒸汽商店的页面，“最黑暗的地下城是一部充满挑战的哥特式角色扮演角色，就像流氓一样，讲述了冒险的心理压力。”虽然之前受流氓启发的游戏开发商明确表示，他们的游戏本身并不是流氓(只是受到他们的启发)，但最近的游戏似乎只是称自己为流氓。</p><p> I have not played  Darkest Dungeon myself, but I have seen its roguelike, or even roguelite, nature  challenged because it does not really have permadeath in roguelike sense. Your characters die, but they are more of expendable resources, your run does not end, you will win your first run. Furthermore, according to the complaints, the game is very repetitive, which the randomness of roguelikes aims to avoid.</p><p>我自己没有玩过最黑暗的地下城，但我见过它流氓般的，甚至流氓的，大自然受到了挑战，因为它并没有真正的流氓意义上的永久死亡。你的角色死了，但他们更多的是可牺牲的资源，你的奔跑不会结束，你会赢得你的第一次奔跑。此外，根据投诉，这个游戏的重复性很强，流氓的随意性就是为了避免这一点。</p><p>  Slay The Spire has popularized the genre known as “roguelike deckbuilder” games. It combines the ideas of deckbuilders such as  Dominion, and the general event-based structure of  FTL.</p><p>“杀死尖顶”使这种被称为“流氓般的甲板建造者”的游戏变得流行起来。它结合了Dominion等甲板建造者的想法，以及FTL的通用基于事件的结构。</p><p> From my point of view, the name “roguelike deckbuilder” does not make much sense. The event-based structure is an innovation from  FTL, which goes against the traditional roguelike style of being non-modal. The combat system feels more like a jRPG; when playing jRPGs, I felt that the combat system (and its modality) was the major thing which separated them from roguelikes. Slay the Spire is run-based, but this is not an innovation, as all deckbuilders are! At least, every game of  Dominion you play will be completely different. Something like “dungeon crawl deckbuilder” (Dominion is not a dungeon crawl) would make more sense.</p><p>在我看来，“流氓般的甲板建造者”这个名字没有多大意义。基于事件的结构是FTL的创新，它与传统的非情态流氓风格背道而驰。战斗系统给人的感觉更像是JRPG；在玩JRPG时，我觉得战斗系统(及其形态)是区别于流氓的主要因素。杀死尖顶是基于运行的，但这不是一个创新，就像所有的甲板建造者一样！至少，你玩的每一款Dominion游戏都会完全不同。像“地牢爬行甲板建造者”(Dominion不是地牢爬行)这样的话会更有意义。</p><p>  A look at a  thread of roguelike recommendations shows what people consider to be “roguelikes” today. Most people recommended run-based games which are not roguelikes in the traditional sense, some did mention traditional roguelikes. Almost no one recommended games of both kinds. Some roguelike celebrities say that the  war is over, we should accept that “roguelike” means something different now.</p><p>看看一串流氓推荐信，就会发现今天人们认为的是“流氓”。大多数人推荐基于Run的游戏，这些游戏不是传统意义上的流氓游戏，有些人确实提到了传统的流氓游戏。几乎没有人推荐这两种游戏。一些无赖式的名人说战争已经结束了，我们应该接受“无赖式”现在的意思不同了。</p><p> While it is hard to fight the language change, I will exhibit some problems with the popular conventions.</p><p>虽然语言的改变很难抗拒，但我会向大家展示一些流行惯例的问题。</p><p> For some people, any game with permadeath and procedural generation is a “roguelike”. But it is not clear to me why these people even need this term. It is not a cool word: it was originally chosen as “the least of all available evils”. The main thing that all games called “roguelike” share is that they are run-based: the game is designed so that you play it many times. Randomness is a good way to make this interesting, but it is not necessary —in Risk of Rain, randomness is limited, and it is still fun. For some time, we had a “doom clone” genre, which was eventually renamed to the more descriptive “first-person shooter”, and I think we should similarly refer to run-based games as “run-based”. This would include games like Tetris, but it does not seem to be a problem, because these games are fun for the same reason as roguelikes are. Roguelike-like and roguelite did not catch, because they are too vague, and too similar to “roguelike”. Especially that there are like five significantly different meanings of “roguelike” commonly used, so  why not just say exactly what you mean if you can.</p><p>对一些人来说，任何与永生死亡和程序化世代有关的游戏都是“无赖游戏”。但我不清楚这些人为什么需要这个词。这不是一个很酷的词：它最初被选为“所有可能的邪恶中最小的一种”。所有被称为“无赖”的游戏的主要共同点是，它们都是基于运行的：这款游戏的设计是为了让你可以多次玩。随机性是让这件事变得有趣的好方法，但这并不是必要的--在下雨的风险下，随机性是有限的，它仍然很有趣。有一段时间，我们有一种“末日克隆”类型，最终被重新命名为更具描述性的“第一人称射击游戏”，我认为我们也应该同样地把基于奔跑的游戏称为“基于奔跑的”。这将包括俄罗斯方块这样的游戏，但这似乎不是问题，因为这些游戏和流氓一样有趣。流氓和流氓没有捕捉到，因为它们太模糊了，太像“流氓”了。尤其是通常使用的“无赖”有五种截然不同的意思，所以如果可以的话，为什么不直接说出你的意思呢？</p><p> On the other hand, we need a word for a “roguelike” in the traditional meaning. There are people who want to play a game in this particular style, and game developers who create such games and want to quickly tell what it is. When “Doom the Roguelike” was released, the name made it perfectly clear what it was (as long as you have played any roguelike and Doom).  HyperRogue is a roguelike taking place in non-Euclidean geometry; since roguelikes share their classic chess-like gameplay, they also share some basic strategies, and the change of geometry brings a new twist on them. It is annoying that such things would not be clear anymore. The original word was already bad, the least of all available evils, and run-based people have stolen it, even though they did not need it.</p><p>另一方面，我们需要一个词来形容传统意义上的“无赖”。有些人想要玩这种风格的游戏，还有游戏开发者，他们创造了这样的游戏，并希望很快就能知道它是什么。当《恶棍末日》上映时，它的名字就非常清楚地表明了它是什么(只要你演过任何恶棍和末日)。HyperRogue是一个发生在非欧几里德几何中的流氓；因为流氓分享了他们经典的象棋游戏，所以他们也分享了一些基本的策略，几何的变化给他们带来了新的转折。令人恼火的是，这样的事情将不再清晰。原来的单词已经是坏的，是所有可能的邪恶中最小的，而基于跑步的人已经偷走了它，尽管他们并不需要它。</p><p> Also, it seems that being run-based, while important, is not the most important quality of traditional roguelikes — commercial traditional roguelikes usually dropped it, others are still fun if you were cheating permadeath.</p><p>此外，看起来基于跑步的游戏虽然很重要，但并不是传统流氓游戏最重要的品质--商业上的传统流氓游戏通常会放弃这一点，但如果你欺骗了永生流氓，其他游戏仍然很有趣。</p><p> It is not clear whether so-called “roguelikes” are actually a genre. Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Spelunky, FTL are very different games. Why should they be a genre while, say, “games where you can pet a dog” are not?</p><p>目前还不清楚所谓的“流氓”是否真的是一种类型。《杀死尖塔》、《最黑暗的地下城》、《斯皮伦基》、《超光速》是截然不同的游戏。为什么它们应该是一种流派，而“可以抚摸狗的游戏”却不是呢？</p><p> It is suggested that “Traditional roguelike” should be used for the original meaning. There are some issues with this idea. Some people started calling  Spelunky a “traditional roguelike” even before this term was coined. Furthermore, “traditional” suggests lack of innovation; I would not call  HyperRogue, or mostly any other puzzle roguelike, “traditional”. Some people do not consider puzzle roguelikes to be roguelikes; I am fine with this, but it appears that the majority of the community does. The alternative for “traditional roguelike” is “action roguelike”, which would not include turn-based games which are not traditional roguelikes, and also does not include  Diablo for some reason, even though it is  more similar to the tradition.</p><p>建议使用“传统的流氓”作为原意。这个想法存在一些问题。甚至在这个词被创造出来之前，一些人就已经开始称Spelunky为“传统的无赖”了。此外，“传统型”意味着缺乏创新；我不会称HyperRogue或其他任何类似拼图的流氓游戏为“传统型”。有些人不认为拼图流氓是流氓；我对此没有意见，但似乎社会上大多数人都这样认为。“传统流氓”的另一种选择是“动作流氓”，它不包括非传统流氓的回合制游戏，也不包括暗黑破坏神，尽管它更类似于传统。</p><p> It seems that most roguelike fans accept using “roguelike“ as an adjective, for example “roguelike platformer” or “roguelike first-person shooter”. While slightly confusing, this makes sense: a game is a combination of two genres, it has all the properties of the genre appearing as a noun, and the compatible properties of the genre appearing as an adjective. We can also have “first-person shooter roguelike” (DRL) or “platformer roguelike” (a grid-based turn-based game where the structure of the level is similar to that of a platformer, e.g. Fuel or Bump). Although some people do this incorrectly (e.g. “deckbuilding roguelike” is wrong, “roguelike deckbuilder” is better).</p><p>似乎大多数流氓粉丝都接受将“流氓”用作形容词，例如“流氓般的平台”或“流氓般的第一人称射手”。虽然有点令人困惑，但这是有道理的：游戏是两种类型的组合，它具有该类型的所有属性以名词形式出现，并且该类型的兼容属性以形容词形式出现。我们也可以有“第一人称射击盗贼”(DRL)或“平台盗贼”(一种基于栅格的回合游戏，关卡的结构类似于平台，例如燃料或凹凸)。虽然有些人这样做是不正确的(例如，“甲板建造流氓”是错误的，“流氓般的甲板建造人”更好)。</p><p> It appears that the people who argue that roguelike means something different now have never (or almost never) played a roguelike in traditional sense. They think it is a tiny thing, or its rules are too specific to be a genre (there is about a thousand of games satisfying the criteria, and there are several subgenres, like hacklikes, puzzle roguelikes and broughlikes), very niche one (I know lots of people who play them — they are just not represented in more mainstream game media; while the part of the gaming audience who pays the most money would not be likely to enjoy them, you don’t need to be some kind of ultra-nerd either), less influential than classics such as  Spelunky (roguelikes inspired three major genres, Spelunky inspired just one). There is no rational reason not to try a r</p><p>那些认为流氓的意思不同的人现在似乎从来没有(或者几乎从来没有)玩过传统意义上的流氓。他们认为这是一件微不足道的事情，或者它的规则太具体了，不能成为一个流派(符合标准的游戏大约有一千种，有几个子流派，比如黑客喜欢、拼图流氓和粗俗喜欢)，非常小众的一个(我认识很多玩这些游戏的人--他们只是在更主流的游戏媒体中没有出现而已；虽然支付最多钱的那部分游戏观众不太可能喜欢它们，但你也不需要成为某种超级书呆子)，更少的是一些超级书呆子(我认识很多玩这些游戏的人--他们只是没有出现在更主流的游戏媒体上；虽然花钱最多的那部分游戏观众不太可能喜欢它们，但你也不需要成为某种超级书呆子)。没有理性的理由不去尝试。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://zenorogue.medium.com/what-roguelike-meant-fb8b0e1601a">https://zenorogue.medium.com/what-roguelike-meant-fb8b0e1601a</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/无赖/">#无赖</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/roguelike/">#roguelike</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
