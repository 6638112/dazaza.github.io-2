The king of Spain had offered a hefty reward to anyone who could solve the stubborn mystery of how to determine a ship’s longitude while at sea: 6,000 ducats up front and another 2,000 per year for life. Galileo thought his headgear, with the telescope fixed over one eye and making its wearer look like a misaligned unicorn, would net him the reward.</p><p> 当询问需要他的研究时，他将罗马天主教会被坚持的内容不是天线透中的太阳能系统，伽利略伽利略将他的能量转向了如何将望远镜贴在头盔上的争议较小的问题。西班牙国王为任何可以解决如何解决如何确定船舶经度的人而在海上的顽固神秘的人提供了一个令人满意的奖励：前面有6,000名杜卡特，每年终生2,000岁。伽利略思想他的头饰，望远镜固定在一只眼睛上，使其穿着者看起来像一个错位的独角兽，将他扣除他的奖励。</p><p> Determining latitude is easy for any sailor who can pick out the North Star, but finding longitude escaped the citizens of the 17th century, because it required a precise knowledge of time. That’s based on a simple principle: Say you set your clock before sailing west from Greenwich. Say when the sun hits its apex, the clock reads five hours past noon. Because you know the earth rotates 15 degrees per hour—completing the 360 in 24 hours—you know you’re 75 degrees west of London. Easy peasy. That only works, though, if you have a clock that can keep accurate time, which nobody sailing the high seas then did. Clocks were complex mechanical devices, ill-suited to sea voyages. The rolling oceans messed with the pendulums that kept time on land. Salt air messed with everything. So explorers increasingly interested in crossing the oceans had a dangerously limited understanding of where they were.</p><p> 确定纬度对于可以挑选北方明星的任何水手很容易，但发现经度逃脱了17世纪的公民，因为它需要精确的时间知识。这是基于一个简单的原则：说你在从格林威治航行的西方航行之前设置了你的时钟。说太阳击中它的顶点，时钟读了下午五个小时。因为你知道地球每小时旋转15度 - 完成360  - 你知道你是伦敦西部75度。十分简单。但是，只有有效，如果您有一个可以保持准确时间的时钟，那么没有人在海上航行那么。时钟是复杂的机械设备，适合海上航行。滚动的海洋陷入了悬崖上陷入困境的钟摆。盐空气弄乱了一切。因此，越来越有兴趣过海洋的探索者对他们所在的位置有危险的理解。</p><p>  Galileo’s solution lay with the incessant eclipses of what he called Jupiter’s four moons (and what astronomers now call Jupiter’s Galilean moons, having since discovered 75 more). In 1612, Galileo realized he could use the movement of the moons, which he charted, as a sort of astronomical clock. Over the next century, this became a common way of determining longitude on land. But it didn’t work on the ocean. The telescopes of Galileo’s age had tiny fields of view, and finding and tracking things that are at least 365 million miles away was virtually impossible on a ship bouncing along the waves. Galileo thought that by wearing the telescope on his face, a navigator could counteract that pitching and rolling more easily, and keep his focus on Jupiter’s moons.</p><p>  伽利略的解决方案介绍了他所谓的Jupiter的四个卫星（以及现在是什么天文学家叫木星的Glilan Moons，因为发现了75次）。在1612年，伽利略意识到他可以使用卫星的运动，他绘制的是一种天文时钟。在下个世纪，这成为在土地上确定经度的常见方式。但它没有在海洋上工作。伽利略的年龄的望远镜有很小的观点，并在沿着海浪弹跳的船上几乎不可能找到至少3.65亿英里的东西。伽利略认为，通过穿着望远镜在他的脸上，导航员可以抵消这种投球和滚动更容易滚动，并将其关注对木星的卫星。</p><p>  The Spanish were unimpressed, and no one ever claimed the king’s ducats. Then, in 1714, British Parliament passed the Longitude Act, offering £20,000 for a solution. After decades of trial and error, working-class clockmaker John Harrison presented the marine chronometer, a time-keeping device that could withstand the rigors of the seafaring life and keep its practitioners on the maps they were filling in as they went along.</p><p>  西班牙人不投手，没有人声称国王的杜阿特。然后，在1714年，英国议会通过了经度行为，为解决方案提供20,000英镑。经过几十年的审判和错误，工作舱钟表制造商John Harrison介绍了海洋时代，可以承受海上生命的严谨性，并将其从业者保持在他们填充的地图上。</p><p>  That successful iteration of the longitude prize was what Tony Tether, the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, had in mind when he concocted the 2004 Grand Challenge: a way to motivate the Harrisons of the world as well as the Galileis.</p><p>  经纬奖的成功迭代是国防高级研究项目代理主任的Tony系列，令他想到的是，他讨论了2004年的大挑战：一种激励世界哈里桑的一种方式以及伽利略。</p><p>  DARPA was the secretive arm of the Pentagon that had birthed the internet, GPS, and the stealth bomber. In the early 2000s, it turned its gaze to autonomous vehicles that could keep US soldiers out of harm’s way. Frustrated by the slow progress by the defense contractors and university labs that had spent decades on the problem, Tether tried something new: a race for autonomous vehicles, through the Mojave Desert, open to anyone. The $1 million prize and the audacity of the challenge drew in all sorts of hopefuls. Esteemed roboticists, university and high school students, hobbyist tinkerers, BattleBots veterans. What they lacked in experience with autonomous machines they made up for in enthusiasm. They spent the year leading up to race day sacrificing sleep, social contact, and in one case, $50,000 in  Jeopardy! winnings to the Grand Challenge. A qualifying round slimmed an original field of 86 teams to 15 finalists.</p><p>  DARPA是五角大楼的秘密臂，曾征用互联网，GPS和隐形轰炸机。在2000年代初，它将目光揭示到自动车辆，这些车辆可以让美国士兵摆脱伤害的方式。令人沮丧的是，国防承包商和大学实验室已经花了几十年的问题，Tether尝试了新的东西：通过莫哈韦沙漠，向任何人开放的自治车辆。 100万奖品和挑战的宣誓事项在各种各样的有希望中吸引。尊敬的机器人，大学和高中生，爱好者的特色，战斧退伍军人。他们缺乏他们以热情为主​​的自主机器缺乏经验。他们花了一年时间牺牲了睡眠，社会联系，在一个案例中，在一个案例中，危险率为50,000美元！赢得盛大挑战的奖金。一个合格的圆形削弱了86支球队的原始领域，为15名决赛者。 </p><p>  At 4 in the morning on March 13, 2004, race director Jose Negron handed each team a CD‑ROM detailing the course. This list of 2,586 latitude and longitude coordinates, each about a hundred yards from the one before it, would lead the robots from the Slash X Cafe in Barstow, California, to the finish line in Primm, Nevada, 142 miles away.</p><p>2004年3月13日早上4点，比赛导演Jose Negron每支团队递给了一个细节课程的CD-ROM。该清单为2,586个纬度和经度坐标，每个坐标都有大约一百码，将从加利福尼亚州巴斯托尔的斜坡X咖啡馆引导机器人，到距离内华达州的Primm的终点线，距离酒店有142英里。</p><p> While most teams simply uploaded the coordinates into their vehicle’s navigation system, a dozen members of Carnegie Mellon’s Red Team sat in a trailer and went to work on the task they had spent months training for. The route their software spat out said it would take their robotified Humvee, Sandstorm, 13 hours to reach the finish line. But Darpa wanted the winner to finish in 10 hours or less, and Team lead Red Whittaker—a cantankerous ex-Marine and one of the most talented roboticists on the planet—wasn’t about to settle. Neither was his team. Sitting shoulder to shoulder in front of a bank of computers, each student studied the waypoints for the section of route they&#39;d been assigned.</p><p> 虽然大多数团队只是将坐标上传到他们的车辆导航系统，但是有十几名卡内基梅隆的红色团队成员坐在拖车上，并向他们花了几个月培训的任务。路线他们的软件吐出来表示，它将采用它的机器化悍马，沙尘暴，13小时到达终点线。但是，Darpa希望获胜者在10小时或更短的时间内完成，而团队领先红惠特克 - 一个克隆的前海洋和地球上最有才华的机器人之一 - 不想安顿下来。他的团队也不是。每个学生都在一家电脑前肩上坐在肩膀上，研究了路线的路线的航点。</p><p> The team compared them with their database of satellite maps, evaluating the difficulty of the terrain and calculating where the Humvee would need to run slow and, more importantly, where it could gun it. They entered a specific speed for every bit of the course and loaded all the data into the computers whirring away in the huge electronics box. Their planning was aggressive, but this was a race. If Sandstorm could pull it off, it would be hard to beat.</p><p> 该团队将它们与他们的卫星地图数据库进行了比较，评估地形的难度和计算悍马需要慢慢地跑的地方，更重要的是，它可以枪起来。它们为课程的每一点输入了特定的速度，并将所有数据加载到巨大的电子盒中的电脑中。他们的规划很有侵略性，但这是一场比赛。如果沙尘暴可以拉出它，那就很难击败。</p><p> At 6:30 am on Saturday, March 13, 2004, with the sun just starting to peek over the hills to the east, the Grand Challenge was finally starting.</p><p> 早上6:30于2004年3月13日星期六，阳光下刚开始偷看东部的山丘，盛大的挑战终于开始了。</p><p> Sign up to get our best longform features, investigations, and thought-provoking essays, in your inbox every Sunday.</p><p> 在您的收件箱中注册以获得最佳的长大功能，调查和思想挑衅散文。</p><p> Safety monitors and reporters were in place along the route. Hundreds of people filled the bleachers. A helicopter whirred overhead, carrying cameras and the electronic kill switch that could stop any robot in its tracks. Darpa crew members sat in the chase vehicles that would follow each entrant through the course, with the same gear. A crew of biologists had run a final sweep for the endangered desert tortoise that called the Mojave home, and the first six vehicles sat in a semicircle, each in its own starting gate. They would enter the course at five-minute intervals, followed by the rest of the field. The Red Team, based on its impressive performance in qualifying, would go first. Chris Urmson, one of Whittaker’s lieutenants, prepared Sandstorm for its final journey, turning on its various systems, waiting for the green “it’s all good” lamp to signal that the emergency brake was primed, and flipping a silver switch from manual to auto.</p><p> 安全监视器和记者沿途到达。数百人填满了漂白剂。直升机的醒目的开销，携带相机和电子杀戮开关，可以阻止其轨道中的任何机器人。 DARPA船员坐在追逐车辆中，沿着每个进入者穿过课程，具有相同的装备。生物学家的船员为叫做莫哈韦家的濒临灭绝的沙漠龟进行了最后的扫描，而前六辆车坐在半圆上，每个车辆都在自己的起始门上。他们将以5分钟的间隔进入课程，其余的领域。基于其令人印象深刻的资格表现，红色团队将首先去。 Whittaker的中尉之一，克里斯·乌尔姆森为其最终旅程准备了Sandstorm，打开其各种系统，等待绿色的“这一切都是好的”灯，以发出紧急制动器的推动，并将银色开关从手动翻转到自动。</p><p> The national anthem played, and Tony Tether took his seat next to a four-star Army general who had showed up without warning. Then the race announcer went to work. “The command from the tower is to move,” he called out. The flag dropped. Yellow light flashing and siren sounding, Carnegie Mellon’s Humvee rolled out of the gate. “Ladies and gentlemen, Sandstorm! Autonomous vehicles, traversing the desert with the goal of keeping our young military personnel out of harm’s way,” the announcer went on. “Booyah!”</p><p> 国家国歌队和托尼系绳坐在旁边的四星级军队旁边，没有警告。然后比赛播音员去上班了。 “来自塔的命令是移动，”他喊道。旗帜下降了。黄光闪烁和警笛声，卡内基梅隆的悍马从门口滚出来。 “女士们，绅士，沙尘暴！自动车辆，遍历沙漠的目标，使我们的年轻军事人员摆脱伤害的方式，“播音员继续前进。 “福音！” </p><p> Jose Negron and course designer Sal Fish had made the opening moves of the course deliberately simple. The GPS coordinates would take each vehicle out of the starting gate, through a couple of easy turns, and past the grandstand. Then it was through a couple of cattle gates and onto Powerline Road, a dirt path barely distinguishable from the brown land around it. As long as a vehicle could stick to the road and handle any rocks or tumbleweeds it encountered, the first few miles would be easy going.</p><p>Jose Negron和课程设计师Sal Fish已经使开放的过程变得刻意简单。 GPS坐标将把每个车辆从起跑门中取出，通过几个容易的转弯，并经过看台。然后它是通过几个牛盖茨和电力线路，一个污垢路径从周围的棕色土地上几乎没有区别。只要车辆可以坚持道路并处理任何摇滚或遇到滚动，就会很容易。</p><p>  As Sandstorm turned the first corner and started to disappear into the open desert, its laser scanner detected a clear path ahead, and its detailed map data said it was time to hit the throttle. Sandstorm’s wheels spun, kicked up dust, and carried it away at more than 30 mph.</p><p>  当沙斯特转身第一角并且开始消失进入开放的沙漠时，它的激光扫描仪检测到前方明确的道路，其详细的地图数据表示是时候击中油门的时间。沙尘暴的车轮旋转，踢了灰尘，并以30英里以上的时间携带。</p><p>  For Chris Urmson and his teammates, the moment resonated. This was the first time they had let their robot out of sight and out of their control. There was nothing more they could do. No more testing, no more fixing. Sandstorm would complete the course, or it wouldn’t. And its first big test was just a few miles ahead. The trick to getting up and over Daggett Ridge was mastering the switchbacks, hairpin turns so tight that following a GPS path alone could easily send a vehicle tumbling off the path and hundreds of feet down. So could a misaligned sensor or any number of software glitches. If you could clear that hurdle, however, it was back to flat ground and mostly clear roads, nearly smooth sailing all the way to Primm.</p><p>  对于克里斯urmson和他的队友，那瞬间被共振。这是他们第一次让他们的机器人远离视线和失控。没有什么可以做到的。没有更多的测试，没有更多的修复。沙尘暴将完成课程，或者它不会。它的第一个大型测试只是未来几英里。起床和达格特山脊的诀窍是掌握了交换，发夹转动如此紧张，单独追随GPS路径可以很容易地送出从路径和数百英尺的滚动滚动的车辆。所以可以错解传感器或任何数量的软件故障。然而，如果你能清除那个障碍，它就回到了平坦的地面，大多数清晰的道路，几乎顺利航行一直到初步。</p><p> Over the next 20 minutes, three more vehicles left the gate, following Sandstorm’s trail. It looked like Tether was going to get a proper race, even after some very shaky showings in the qualifying round. Then the problems started.</p><p> 在接下来的20分钟内，在沙尘暴的踪迹之后，还有三辆车离开了门。它看起来像系绳会得到一个适当的种族，即使在合格的回合中有一些非常摇晃的节目。然后问题开始了。</p><p> Sixth off the line was Axion Racing, a group of friends from San Diego, funded by an investor in a company importing bottled water from Micronesia. Over the previous year, software lead Melanie Dumas, an engineer who’d once written off the Grand Challenge as impossible and not worth trying, had seen her skepticism and reluctance transform into swelling optimism.</p><p> 六个离线是轴赛车，来自圣地亚哥的一群朋友，由投资者资助的公司进口密克罗尼西亚的瓶装水。在去年，软件领导Melanie Dumas，曾经写过大挑战的工程师，这是不可能的，不值得尝试，已经看到她怀疑和不情愿地转化为膨胀乐观。</p><p>  She had seen her team’s Jeep drive in this kind of terrain, and drive well. She even thought that, with a bit of luck, it might outrun Carnegie Mellon’s Sandstorm. When the flag waved, the Jeep pulled out of the chute and made the first turn smoothly. But as it approached the first narrow gate, it turned again. All the way around. There was no obvious reason for the about-face. Maybe the sensors had deemed the opening too tight. Perhaps something else had acted up. It didn’t matter. As the Jeep drove back to the starting line, sending its chase vehicle backward like a linebacker, Darpa hit its emergency shutoff. Axion’s Grand Challenge was over in a matter of seconds. Dumas was devastated.</p><p>  她在这种地形上看到了她的团队的吉普车，并驾驶得很好。她甚至认为，有一点运气，它可能会超越卡内基梅隆的沙斯风暴。当旗帜挥手时，吉普车从滑槽中拉出并使第一转向平滑。但随着它走近第一个窄门，它再次转动。一路走来。关于脸部没有明显的原因。也许传感器被认为是太紧的开口。也许别的东西已经行动了。没关系。随着吉普车回到起始线，就像一个线卫一样向后向追逐车辆，DARPA击中其紧急关闭。轴突的大挑战在几秒钟内结束了。杜马斯被摧毁了。</p><p> Next up was the University of Louisiana’s six-wheeled Cajunbot. It smacked a wall on the way out of the chute, knocking itself out of contention. It was followed by Ensco’s bathtub of a bot. As the flag waved, it stood frozen for a few seconds, rolled forward, stopped, then started again. It drifted to the left, where the edge of the road sloped upward, tilting to one side before moving back to flat ground. Then it went left again, this time too far. It flipped over and landed on its side, 1,000 feet into a 142-mile course. The whole run lasted 1 minute and 6 seconds.</p><p> 接下来是路易斯安那大学的六轮Cajunbot。它在外面的途中打了一堵墙壁，敲开了争论。它跟着恩斯科的浴缸的机器人。随着国旗挥手，它冻结了几秒钟，向前滚动，停止，然后再开始。它漂移到左侧，路的边缘向上倾斜，倾斜到一侧，然后返回到平坦的地面。然后它再次左转，这次太过分了。它翻过来并将1000英尺落在142英里的课程上。整个跑步持续了1分6秒。 </p><p> A group of students from Palos Verdes High School had spent the night before the race scrambling to fix the steering controls for their vehicle. At the last moment, they settled on a solution they hoped would work, with no time to test it. Their prayer went unanswered. Their entry, Doom Buggy, never turned at all. It rolled out in a straight line and, after 50 yards, hit a concrete barrier.</p><p>来自Palos Verdes High School的一群学生在比赛前花了如争吵，以修复他们的车辆的转向控制。在最后一刻，他们解决了他们希望工作的解决方案，没有时间测试它。他们的祈祷没有得到答复。他们的入场，毁灭，从来没有转过身来。它在一条直线上推出，50码后，击中了一个混凝土屏障。</p><p> SciAutonics I, led by an engineer who’d worked on Germany’s autonomous driving efforts in the 1980s, saw its ATV wander off the trail, never to return. (The SciAutononics II made it about seven miles before getting stuck on an embankment.) The University of Florida’s Cimar strayed off course half a mile in and got tangled in a wire fence. Terramax, the 14-ton, lime-green, six-wheeled military truck, went 1.2 miles before getting stuck between a pair of small bushes that its sensors mistook for immovable obstacles. Tired of watching it lurch back and forth like a driver trying to escape an impossibly tight parallel parking space, Tony Tether ordered the kill.</p><p> Sciautonics I，由一名工程师领导，在20世纪80年代曾在德国自治驾驶努力工作，看到其ATV徘徊在路上，永不回报。 （Sciautononics II在陷入堤后达到七英里。）佛罗里达大学的Cimar偏离了半英里的路线，并纠结在钢丝篱笆上。 Terramax，14吨，石灰 - 绿色，六轮军用卡车前往1.2英里，然后陷入一对小灌木丛，即其传感器误解了不可移动的障碍物。厌倦了看着它来回蹒跚而是像司机试图逃避不懈的平行停车位，Tony Tether命令杀戮。</p><p>  More than one person had compared the field of homemade robots to something out of a Mad Max movie. Now they had the carnage to match.</p><p>  超过一个人将自制机器人的领域与疯狂的最大电影中的东西进行了比较。现在他们有狂欢节。</p><p>  Ignorant of the slaughter happening at the Slash X, Sandstorm carried on ahead, driving smoothly down the dirt road. But the race officials in the chase vehicle soon noticed troubling behavior. Nine minutes into its run, the Humvee approached a pair of fence posts about 12 feet apart, at a road crossing. Its laser sensor picked up the obstacles, and Sandstorm should have been able to slide through with a foot to spare on either side. But it hung to the left and smacked head on into one post, which didn’t stand a chance against a Humvee moving at speed. Neither did its compatriot at the other side of the intersection, which met the same fate a few seconds later.</p><p>  在斜线X上发生的屠宰时，沙尘暴在前面进行，驾驶顺利地沿着泥土道。但追逐车辆的竞赛官员很快就会注意到令人不安的行为。九分钟进入它的奔跑，悍马在一条路交叉路上接近了一对大约12英尺的围栏柱。它的激光传感器拾取了障碍物，沙尘暴应该能够在两侧脚滑过脚。但它悬挂在左边，并将头部被击打到一个帖子中，这并没有抵御悍马以速度移动的机会。交叉路口的另一边，它的同伴也不是在几秒钟后遇到了同样的命运。</p><p> Ninety seconds after the double whammy, Sandstorm stopped, possibly because of an inadvertent signal from Darpa’s emergency stop system. It got moving again after five seconds, but when it strayed into yet another fence post 44 yards up the road, it didn’t have the speed to blast through it. The Humvee wasn’t programmed to give up, though, and it pushed against the barrier for nearly two minutes before the post gave way. Sandstorm went the next 13 minutes without incident, then smacked into a boulder on the left side of the road. Its recovery software sent the robot too far back to the right, then corrected.</p><p> 双重鞭子后九十秒，沙斯风暴停止，可能是因为来自DARPA的紧急停止系统的无意中信号。它在五秒钟后再次移动，但是当它偏离另一个围栏的44码左右的道路时，它并没有通过它爆炸的速度。然而，Humvee没有被编程以放弃，并且它在帖子前近两分钟推动屏障。沙尘暴在没有事件的情况下接下来的13分钟，然后在道路左侧砸成巨石。它的恢复软件将机器人发送到右侧太远，然后纠正。</p><p> This “off-nominal behavior,” as Chris Urmson and his teammates put it in a postmortem report, was not disqualifying. Darpa had no rules against destroying a bit of property on the way to Primm. But some flaw in the Red Team’s system was leading their vehicle astray, and there was no fixing it as the robot headed for the narrow road that would lead it up and over Daggett Ridge.</p><p> 这种“非名义行为”，作为克里斯urmson和他的队友把它放在邮政报告中，并不取消资格。 DARPA在前往Primm的途中没有针对摧毁一系列财产的规定。但是，红球队系统的一些缺陷是引领他们的车辆误入歧途，并且没有将它固定在狭窄的道路上的机器人，这些机器人会导致它达到达格特山脊。</p><p> The robot worked its way through the first few turns of the road without incident. Then it headed into one hairpin a little bit wide. As it turned the corner, it cut toward the inside, going just a touch too far and pushing its left wheels off the road. Sandstorm kept going, straddling the embankment and lifting itself just enough that its wheels couldn’t get the traction to move forward. The computers didn’t know the vehicle was beached, so they stayed on the throttle. For three and a half minutes, Sandstorm spun its wheels, until the rubber melted off the front tires. Watching the smoke pour off the robot, a Darpa crew member hit the emergency stop. The wheels were going so fast, the clamping of the brakes snapped the half shafts that connected the transaxle to each wheel. That last bit of damage didn’t matter, though.</p><p> 机器人通过没有事件的前几轮转向道路的方式。然后它进入一个发夹一点宽。当它转过角落时，它会朝内侧切割，触摸太远，然后从道路上推动左车轮。沙斯斯特队继续走下去，跨越堤防，抬起自身，足以让其轮子无法让牵引力前进。电脑不知道车辆搁浅，所以他们留在节流阀上。三半分钟，沙斯风暴旋转其轮子，直到橡胶融化了前轮胎。观看烟雾倒出机器人，Darpa船员击中了紧急停止。车轮速度如此快，制动器的夹紧夹住了将轮廓连接到每个车轮的半轴。然而，最后一点伤害并不重要。 </p><p> Just 7.4 miles into the Grand Challenge, Sandstorm was dead. Back at the Slash X, Chris Urmson and his teammates had no idea how Sandstorm was doing until radio reports started to trickle in. As with most disasters, the first bits of news were hard to piece together: The robot was on fire, or its tire had come off, or it was stuck on a rock. It soon became clear, though, that the robot was finished. All that work— the freezing nights at their abandoned steel mill test site in Pittsburgh, the brutally hot days in the Nevada desert where they turned the Grand Challenge into a 24-hour affair, the endless practicing with the mapping software—and the team had made it just 5 percent of the way to the goal they had always refused to consider out of reach. They had come in as the favorites, the powerhouse to be reckoned with. And they had come up short. Some cried. Others let the exhaustion finally, fully hit them. At least they’d get to go home now.</p><p>Sandstorm已经死了7.4英里进入大挑战。回到斜线x，克里斯·urmson和他的队友不知道沙尘暴在无线电报告开始涓涓细流。与大多数灾难一样，第一个新闻的新闻很难在一起：机器人着火了，或者它是着火的轮胎脱落，或者卡在岩石上。但是，它很快就会清楚，机器人已经完成。所有工作 - 在匹兹堡的废弃钢厂试验网站上的冰冻夜晚，内华达沙漠中的残酷炎热的日子，他们将大挑战变成了24小时的事件，与映射软件的无尽练习 - 以及团队的练习只需5％的目标，他们一直拒绝考虑无法考虑的目标。他们作为最爱，省力被估计。他们已经留了很短。有些哭了。其他人最后让疲惫，完全击中它们。至少他们现在要回家了。</p><p>  By 9 am, Tony Tether knew he wouldn’t get to grin for the cameras as he handed someone an oversize check. The other vehicles that had looked good at the start met their own fates within a few miles: blocked by a rock, stuck on an embankment, stalled going up a hill. But one vehicle had yet to leave the start line: Anthony Levandowski’s Ghostrider.</p><p>  到上午9点，托尼系绳知道，当他递给某人的超大检查时，他不会咧嘴笑。看起来很擅长的其他车辆在几英里内遇到了自己的命运：被岩石挡住，卡在堤防上，停滞不前。但是一辆车尚未离开开始线：安东尼·莱曼德斯基的Ghostrider。</p><p> Two days shy of his 24th birthday, Levandowski was the foil to Red Whittaker and Chris Urmson’s effort. Without backing from UC Berkeley, where he was pursuing a master&#39;s degree, Levandowski had pulled together a scrappy team and created a robot nobody else had been crazy or stupid enough to attempt: an autonomous motorcycle. A two-wheeler could be more nimble than a hefty Humvee, Levandowski had thought. It would definitely attract plenty of attention for its creator.</p><p> 两天害羞他的24岁生日，Levandowski是红色惠特克劳特和克里斯·厄丝森的努力。如果没有从UC Berkeley抛弃，他正在追求硕士＆＃39; levandowski举起了一支扰乱的团队，并创造了一个机器人，没有其他人疯狂或愚蠢地尝试：一个自主摩托车。莱德沃斯基曾想过，两轮车可能比Hufty Humvee更灵活。它肯定会对其创造者引起很多关注。</p><p> Ghostrider had performed miserably in the qualifying round, but Tether and Negron saw the PR value—it encapsulated the open nature of their challenge—and invited it to the final. It couldn’t win, in any case: It didn’t carry enough gas to cover 142 miles. But Levandowski didn’t have to reach Primm to come away a winner. If the motorcycle could go a few miles, it would prove that he had the engineering chops to back up the gutsiest idea Darpa’s Grand Challenge had engendered, and prove a lot of naysayers wrong: the Berkeley faculty who had chuckled at his idea; the many, many potential sponsors who had turned him down; the established robotics community as a whole, whose recipe for autonomous driving Levandowski had ignored. He was the underdog, the kid with the crazy idea, the leader of the team that made the world’s first self-driving motorcycle. Ghostrider would show the world what he could create.</p><p> Ghostrider在资格赛中误导了，但系列和黑人看到了PR价值 - 它封装了他们挑战的开放性 - 并邀请了决赛。在任何情况下都无法获胜：它没有足够的气体覆盖142英里。但莱德沃斯基没有达到赢家的胜利者。如果摩托车可以走几英里，那将证明他有工程追溯到借助最重要的想法Darpa的大挑战已经发深了，并证明了很多反对者错了：伯克利教师笑了起来;很多，许多潜在的赞助商拒绝了他;建立的机器人社区整体，其自治驾驶莱德沃斯基的食谱忽略了。他是弱者，孩子们带着疯狂的想法，使世界第一是自动驾驶摩托车的团队的领导者。 Ghostrider会向世界展示他可以创造的。</p><p>  Levandowski rolled his robot cycle into the starting gate, set it to run, and passed it off to a Darpa official who would hold it upright until it was launched. The flag dropped. Ghostrider started to roll forward.</p><p>  Levandowski将机器人循环滚入起始门，将其运行，并将其传递给DARPA官员，直到它推出直接。旗帜下降了。 ghostrider开始向前推进。</p><p>   Levandowski ran to his machine, flapping his long arms in distress. In the heat of the competition, and after two days without sleep, he had forgotten to flip the switch to turn on the stabilizer system his team had spent a year developing. Darpa’s rules were clear: Once the vehicle started the race, it couldn’t accept any human help. Ghostrider wasn’t about to raise itself from the ground. It was done, dead. The bike had crashed somewhere between 600 and 800 times over the previous year. None hurt like this one, because this was the one time it was supposed to work, when everyone was watching. “Good try, guys,” the race announcer said. “Anthony, good effort.”</p><p>   Levandowski跑到他的机器上，拍打着他的长臂窘迫。在竞争的热量中，经过两天没有睡觉，他忘记了翻转开关打开稳定器系统，他的团队已经花了一年的发展。 DARPA的规则很清楚：一旦车辆开始比赛，它就无法接受任何人类的帮助。 Ghostrider不会从地面上抚养自己。它已经完成了，死了。骑自行车在去年的600到800次之间坠毁。没有像这个一样伤害，因为当每个人都在看，这是它应该工作的一次。 “好的尝试，伙计们，”比赛播音员说。 “安东尼，努力。”</p><p> Tony Tether got into the helicopter watching over the race and headed to Primm, where a gaggle of reporters was waiting to see the first robots cross the finish line. One asked him how it was going. “Well, it’s over,” Tether said. “You know, the farthest car went 7.4 miles, caught fire, blah blah blah. It’s over.”</p><p> Tony Tether进入直升机看着比赛，并前往Primm，记者的乐趣等待看到第一个机器人穿过终点线。一个人问他是怎么回事。 “嗯，它结束了，”系绳说。 “你知道，最远的车去了7.4英里，火灾，布拉拉布拉。结束了。” </p><p> The Darpa Grand Challenge was indeed over, and the headlines would mock it as an overhyped science project. “Foiled: Darpa Bots All Fall Down,” WIRED sassed. “Nobody won. Nobody even came close,” CNN wrote. “The reality of the event did not come close to meeting the hype surrounding it,” said tech site the Register. On that count,  Popular Science blamed the feds: “If Darpa was plainly guilty of anything, it was not managing inflated expectations. Instead of billing this inaugural Grand Challenge as a not-ready-for-prime-time field test to calibrate what was needed for future efforts, race manager Negron, in the months leading up to the checkered flag, continued to predict a victor.”</p><p>DARPA大挑战确实结束了，头条新闻将把它嘲笑为一个过度普遍的科学项目。 “挫败了：Darpa机器人都倒下了，”有线嘶嘶声。 “没有人赢了。没有人甚至接近了，“CNN写道。 “事件的现实并没有接近满足围绕它的炒作，”科技网站注册。在这一数目的情况下，流行的科学指责美联储：“如果DARPA对任何事情都显然犯了罪，则无法管理夸大的期望。而不是将这种就职大挑战作为一个未准备好的大挑战计费，以校准未来努力所需的东西，比赛经理黑仑，在通往方格旗帜的几个月内继续预测维克多。“</p><p>  Darpa didn’t have that victor, but an embarrassed Tether chose to focus on the positive. Watching these kids in the desert, competing but coming together, trading stories and strategies, he didn’t worry about the steel carcasses and burned-up tires they had left behind. His great race had proven the motivation to create autonomous vehicles was out there, and it had found the talent with the drive to make it happen. He wasn’t about to give up. A reporter asked him what he would do now.</p><p>  Darpa没有那种胜利者，但是一个尴尬的系绳选择专注于积极的。在沙漠中观看这些孩子，竞争但聚集在一起，交易故事和策略，他并不担心他们留下的钢铁尸体和烧毁的轮胎。他的伟大比赛已经证明了在那里创造自动车辆的动机，它已经找到了具有驱动器的人才来实现它。他不应该放弃。一位记者问他现在所做的事。</p><p> “ We’ll do it again,” Tether said. “And this time, the prize will be $2 million.”</p><p> “我们会再做一次，”系绳说。 “这次，奖项将是200万美元。”</p><p>  From  Driven: The Race to Create the Autonomous Car  by Alex Davies.
