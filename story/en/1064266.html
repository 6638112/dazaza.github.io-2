But there are ways to save yourself before it’s too late</p><p>工作中的慢性应力可以导致无精打采，疲劳 - 卒中和心脏病的风险更高。但是有些方法可以在为时已晚之前拯救自己</p><p>   S pencer Carter had been signed off work for three months with stress. Before that time was up, his employers “encouraged” him back early, then doubled the size of the team he managed – and his responsibility. “In the last couple of years, everything got worse,” he says, with a degree of understatement. In fact,  his GP warned him the stress was going to  kill him, thanks to his astronomically high blood pressure. He took, he says, “voluntary redundancy to save my life”.</p><p>   守护者卡特队伍已经签署了三个月的工作，压力。在那个时候起来之前，他的雇主“鼓励”早期回来，然后他管理的团队的规模翻了一番 - 以及他的责任。 “在过去的几年里，一切都变得更糟，”他说，有一定程度的轻描淡写。事实上，由于他的天文高血压，他的GP警告他的压力将会杀死他。他采取了，他说，“拯救我生命的自愿裁员”。</p><p> Although he had tried counselling in the run-up to his redundancy, it hadn’t helped with his overly demanding working environment as a business operations manager for a global company – endless data and spreadsheets, running teams across different time zones, and being responsible for huge budgets in a highly competitive culture.</p><p> 虽然他已经尝试了咨询了他的冗余，但它没有帮助他过于苛刻的工作环境作为全球公司的企业经理 - 无尽的数据和电子表格，在不同时区运行团队，并负责对于竞争激烈的文化中的巨额预算。</p><p>  “I was drinking heavily,” he says. “I could feel my relationship falling apart. My behaviour became erratic. And you can’t turn off. You take a holiday, but you don’t switch off.”</p><p>  “我很重，”他说。 “我可以感受到我的关系分开。我的行为变得不稳定了。而且你无法关闭。你休假，但你没有关闭。“</p><p>  Carter agonised over abandoning a well-paid career he had spent decades building, but in the end he thought, “What am I doing to myself?”</p><p>  卡特痛苦地痛苦地放弃了一大堆成功的职业，他已经花了几十年的建设，但最终他认为，“我对自己做了什么？”</p><p> A recent study by the World Health Organization and the International Labour Organization found that working at least  55 hours a week was causing hundreds of thousands of premature deaths and was linked to a higher risk of stroke and heart disease. Long hours were described as “a serious health hazard”.</p><p> 世界卫生组织最近的一项研究和国际劳工组织发现每周至少工作55小时的时间导致数十万例过早死亡，并与卒中和心脏病的风险相连。长时间被描述为“严重的健康危害”。</p><p> Burnout is the name given to the host of symptoms caused by an overwhelming, stressful environment – including fatigue, muscle aches, headaches and stomach issues, as well as psychological effects such as listlessness and loss of motivation. Numerous surveys have found burnout has increased among workers in the past year, as work-life boundaries have become blurred by people working from home and anxiety over job security has increased. And, for those in jobs directly dealing with the Covid crisis, exhaustion has long since set in.</p><p> Burnout是由压倒性，压力的环境引起的症状的名字 - 包括疲劳，肌肉疼痛，头痛，头痛和胃问题，以及精神效应，如无精打采和动机丧失。在过去一年的工人中，众多调查发现倦怠已经增加，因为工作寿命界限已经被家庭工作的人模糊，并且对工作保障的焦虑增加了。而且，对于直接处理Covid危机的就业机会的人来说，疲惫的速度已经开始。 </p><p> “ Burnout is the cumulative result of unresolved and chronic stress,” says the clinical psychologist Dr Roberta Babb. Generally, there are three main types, she says. You can be burned out by being overworked and overloaded (“frenetic” burnout), but also by its opposite, “boreout”, where you may feel “consistently underchallenged or underworked”. “It may seem counterintuitive but we need a certain amount of stimulation in our daily work and lives in order to perform and feel satisfied,” says Babb.</p><p>“倦怠是未解决和慢性压力的累积结果，”临床心理学家罗伯塔巴伯博士说。一般来说，有三种主要类型，她说。您可以通过过度劳累和过载（“狂热的”倦怠）来烧毁（“狂热的”倦怠），也是相反的，“学术”，你可能会感到“始终如一地妥协或营造”。 “它可能似乎是违反直观的，但我们需要一定程度的刺激，在我们的日常工作中，为了表现和感到满意，”巴布说。</p><p> And then there is “worn-out burnout” – just being ground down: “People have low amounts of energy, and feel exhausted on an emotional, physical and social level.”</p><p> 然后有“破旧的倦怠” - 只是在下来：“人们的能量较低，并且感到疲惫的情感，身体和社会。”</p><p> I got excited again about something that’s a little bit academic, brain-challenging ... There was a shift into feeling self-empowered.</p><p> 我又兴奋了一些有点学术，大脑挑战......感觉自我赋予的感觉。</p><p> Although many people, with supportive employers, can return to their job after burnout, for Carter, this was no longer an option. He was lucky to have a good redundancy package and he turned to his passion (and degree subject), archaeology. He went from a job earning £100,000 to a sector where salaries begin at £19,000, but he loved it. “I got excited again about something that’s a little bit academic, brain-challenging – it took me out of the house. It was frightening, exciting, enjoyable. There was a shift into feeling self-empowered.”</p><p> 虽然许多人与支持雇主，可以在倦怠后返回工作，对于卡特，这是不再是一个选择。他很幸运能拥有一个良好的裁判包，他转向他的激情（和学位主题），考古学。他从一份赚取的薪水赚了100万英镑的职业，薪水以19,000英镑开始，但他喜欢它。 “我又兴奋了，关于一些有点学术，大脑挑战 - 它把我带出了房子。这是可怕的，令人兴奋，令人愉快的。感受自我赋权的变化。“</p><p> That was in 2011, but his recovery has not been straightforward. In 2017, he had what he describes as “the second round of burnout, what I would call PTSD. Everything hits you, no matter how happy you have been for a couple of years.”</p><p> 那是2011年的，但他的康复并不简单。 2017年，他有他描述为“第二轮倦怠，我会呼叫关注点。一切都击中了你，无论你多年多有多开心。“</p><p> Still, Carter has become a specialist in his field, published papers and successfully changed career, although the pandemic has affected his job and health. “Sometimes,” he says, “I think [changing career] actually saved my life.”</p><p> 尽管大流行影响了他的工作和健康，但克特已经成为他的领域，发表论文并成功改变职业的专家。 “有时候，”他说，“我认为[改变职业]实际上拯救了我的生活。”</p><p> An emotionally rewarding job you love is also not necessarily a shield against burning out, as Tara Lewis discovered after working as a paramedic for 16 years, before leaving in 2015.</p><p> 您所爱的情绪奖励工作也不一定是抵御燃烧的盾牌，因为在2015年离开之前，塔拉刘易斯在担任医务人员之前发现了16岁。 </p><p> A year earlier, Lewis was signed off work for six months. She adored being a paramedic. “You go into it with that whole thing of, ‘I want to do the trauma, the proper emergencies, and make a difference.’”</p><p>一年同期，刘易斯签署了六个月。她崇拜成为护理人员。 “你用那个整个东西进入它，”我想做创伤，适当的紧急情况，有所作为。“</p><p>  But over the years, it was becoming too difficult. The number of callouts soared and increasingly they were to deal with social issues, rather than medical emergencies – such as people who were having difficulty accessing healthcare, and were using 999 to get help.</p><p>  但多年来，它变得太难了。飙升且越来越多地对社会问题的飙升，而不是医疗紧急情况 - 例如难以访问医疗保健的人，并使用999获取帮助。</p><p> She thinks it took her “a good three years to really feel properly well again” with the help of counselling and antidepressants, although in the first couple of months after leaving her job there was “a massive improvement”.</p><p> 虽然在离开她的工作后的最近几个月的帮助下，她认为她认为她的“好三年才能真正感受到恰当地觉得”。</p><p> While she was off work, Lewis decided to start training as a beauty therapist and the next year, when she was offered a job in a salon, she resigned from the NHS.</p><p> 当她下班时，刘易斯决定作为一个美容治疗师和明年开始培训，当时她在沙龙提供了一份工作时，她辞职了。</p><p> “It was still working with people, although it’s completely different. I really enjoyed it. It gave me a different focus. I was self-employed, so I could have control over it, which helped. I worked with a lovely bunch of people and had a good laugh. I just found my sense of humour again, and had the time to be able to enjoy life, spend time with my kids, with my husband.”</p><p> “它仍然与人合作，虽然它完全不同。我真的很喜欢它。它给了我一个不同的焦点。我是自雇人士，所以我可以控制它，这有助于。我用一群可爱的人合作，笑了。我刚刚发现了我对幽默感，并有时间能够享受生活，与我的孩子一起度过时光，和我的丈夫一起度过。“</p><p>  Burnout, says Mel MacIntyre, a business coach, can make people “call everything into question”. This was her own experience.</p><p>  Burnout说，商业教练Mel Macintyre说，Mel Macintyre，可以让人们“称之为致电”。这是她自己的经历。</p><p> “My life looked perfect on the outside,” she says, but her corporate job was taking an excessive toll. It came to a head on the day she took her father to hospital for a big operation, then went into work where she had to make several people redundant. “I woke up one day, and there was nothing left to draw on.”</p><p> “我的生活在外面看起来很完美，”她说，但她的公司工作正在过度收费。它在当天来到了一个脑袋，她带着父亲去医院进行大型操作，然后进入工作，在那里她必须让几个人冗余。 “我有一天醒来，没有什么可以借鉴。” </p><p> She had depression, anxiety and irritable bowel syndrome, was being investigated for a possible stomach ulcer and was using alcohol to cope. Her GP said it was pointless just signing her off for a couple of weeks, and advised her to make a serious change.</p><p>正在研究可能的胃溃疡，并使用酒精来应对抑郁症，焦虑和肠道肠综合征。她的GP说这只是毫无意义的只是签署了几个星期，并建议她做出严重的变化。</p><p> So, in her mid-30s, MacIntyre quit her job, spent a year travelling and tried “to learn how to relax. I realised I couldn’t keep living my life the way I had been.” She trained as a business coach and  set up her own company to help others to avoid burnout. Then she moved from Edinburgh to the Outer Hebrides, started a family and now lives on a tiny, remote island. “It’s so beautiful. It’s got 140 people, lots of wild horses and sheep. There are eagles that live at the back of my house.”</p><p> 所以，在30多岁的中间，麦金塔尔辞职，花了一年的旅行，试过“学习如何放松。我意识到我无法继续生活我的生活。“她被培训为企业教练，并设立自己的公司，以帮助别人避免倦怠。然后她从爱丁堡搬到了外面的赫布里赖，开始了一个家庭，现在生活在一个小小的偏远的岛屿上。 “这个很漂亮。它有140人，很多野马和绵羊。我家的后面有老鹰队。“</p><p> Among her clients, burnout is common. “We’re at a tipping point, I think, where the old world is not fit for purpose any more,” she says. “There’s this narrative in society which is that in order to be successful, you’ve got to sacrifice your health or your relationships, or things that are important to you. You’ve got to hustle. And I really don’t agree with that.”</p><p> 在她的客户中，倦怠是常见的。 “我们认为，我认为，旧世界不适合目的的地方，”她说。 “社会中存在这种叙述，这是为了成功，你必须牺牲你的健康或你的关系，或对你很重要的事情。你必须喧嚣。我真的不同意这一点。“</p><p>  Others, too, have seen the light. Mays Al-Ali has gone from a successful job in advertising to living in Ibiza and  working as a yoga teacher and nutritionist. She had burned out twice – the first time 10 years ago; her hair began falling out and she was suffering from fatigue as well as gut and skin issues. In 2019, she decided to quit completely and start a master’s degree in nutrition.</p><p>  其他人也看过光明。梅斯al-Ali已经从一个成功的工作中取得了成功的工作，以居住在伊维萨岛，并作为瑜伽教师和营养师工作。她烧掉了两次 -  10年前的第一次;她的头发开始掉出来，她患有疲劳以及肠道和皮肤问题。 2019年，她决定完全退出并开始营养硕士学位。</p><p> “It was hard to let go of the security of a career – it becomes part of your identity,” Al-Ali says. “I’m a lot poorer, but happier. A big part of my life now, that was hugely missing in advertising, is helping people. It’s so much more rewarding.” Although it was a little daunting to make the change, she says it never felt frightening. “It was more like saving myself.”</p><p> “很难放弃职业生涯的安全 - 它成为你身份的一部分，”Al-Ali说。 “我很穷，而且很开心。我现在的一大部分生活，在广告中非常失踪，正在帮助人们。这更有价值。“虽然做出改变是有点令人生畏的，但她说它从未感到恐惧。 “它更像拯救自己。”</p><p>  As an executive director at an investment bank, Shivraj Bassi was working such long hours that he was experiencing mood swings, sleep issues, skin problems and weight loss. “Each week, this feeling of dread would manifest itself consistently around 3pm on a Sunday.”</p><p>  作为投资银行的执行董事，Shivraj Bassi正在努力工作，他正在经历情绪波动，睡眠问题，皮肤问题和减肥。 “每周，这种恐惧的感觉将在星期天下午3点左右表现出来。”</p><p> Leaving a successful career seemed like a difficult decision, although he says now “staying and continuing to suffer is also a decision”. He resigned in 2011, but took at least a couple of years to feel better. “It takes a long time, and I didn’t realise that. I think if I had left sooner, maybe that recovery period would have been shorter.” Since then, he has created a wellbeing and  nutrition brand, Innermost. It has been daunting but “it’s a healthier kind of fear, it’s not dread. I feel much happier now.”</p><p> 留下一个成功的职业似乎是一个艰难的决定，虽然他现在说“保持并继续遭受苦苦的决定”。他于2011年辞职，但至少需要几年才能感觉更好。 “这需要很长时间了，我没有意识到这一点。我想如果我早日离开，也许那个恢复期将更短。“从那时起，他创造了一个福祉和营养品牌，最内心。它一直令人生畏但是“这是一种更健康的恐惧，这并不是恐惧。我现在感觉很开心。“ </p><p> Roles based on nurturing others: carers, nurses and teachers, all have high risks of burnout. Overwork among doctors has increased since the pandemic. A British Medical Association survey found that more than a third of GPs who responded were considering taking early retirement in the coming year, and a fifth were planning to leave the NHS or take a career break.</p><p>基于培养别人的角色：护理人员，护士和教师，所有人都有很高的倦怠风险。自大流行以来，医生之间的过度劳累已经增加。一项英国医学会调查发现，超过三分之一的GPS在来年考虑在未来一年提前退休，第五个计划留下NHS或致力于休息。</p><p>  Until the end of 2019, Scott Robinson worked for the Parliamentary and  Health Service Ombudsman, dealing with complaints about the NHS in England. It was emotional work – he was dealing with people whose lives had been affected by what they believed were failures of care. “Different people [at work] manage it in different ways,” he says. “Some become really aloof and detached.” He was the opposite.</p><p>  直到2019年底，斯科特罗宾逊为议会和卫生服务监察员工作，处理关于英格兰NHS的投诉。这是情绪化的工作 - 他正在与生活受到他们认为失败的影响的人打交道。 “不同的人[在工作]以不同的方式管理它，”他说。 “有些人变得非常冷漠和脱落。”他是相反的。</p><p> “I would get outraged on behalf of people,” Robinson says. He would worry about them outside of working hours. “You think: ‘Am I actually helping them?’” He had noticed he wasn’t able to manage his stress in the ways he used to, and was becoming much less social. “I didn’t want to deal with people, because I’d been basically dealing with people all day.”</p><p> “我会代表人们感到愤怒，”罗宾逊说。他会在工作时间之外担心他们。 “你觉得：'我真的帮助他们吗？”“他注意到他没有能够以习惯的方式管理他的压力，并且变得不那么社会。 “我不想和人打交道，因为我一整天都基本上与人交往。”</p><p> Eventually he left, and decided to train as a massage therapist. “It felt like a good idea to do something that would be focused on people’s wellbeing, and help them relax or heal and those sorts of things. Fortunately, my partner was able to support me in that shift. I was lucky – I wouldn’t have been able to do it the same way had I not had that support, and that’s not the case for everybody.”</p><p> 最终他离开了，并决定作为按摩治疗师训练。 “这觉得要做一些专注于人们的幸福的好主意，并帮助他们放松或治愈和那些类型的东西。幸运的是，我的伴侣能够在那个转变中支持我。我很幸运 - 我不可能以同样的方式做到这一点，而我没有那么支持，这不是每个人的情况。“</p><p> One of the characteristics of burnout, says Babb, “is the gradual onset. This, coupled with our ability to either ignore symptoms of stress, or quickly habituate to increasingly high levels of stress, means it can be difficult to identify and address the symptoms.”</p><p> BUSOUT的一个特征是BABB，“是渐进的发作。这使得我们能够忽视压力症状，或快速习惯越来越高的压力，意味着可能难以识别和解决症状。“</p><p>  For Melike Hussein, burnout was “a slow-burning process”. As an accountant and finance director for an international company, she loved her job. “This is the strange thing. I had a massive aptitude for it – I was the person that got the toughest jobs because I had this mental resilience to deal with it.” One morning, however, when she thought about the prospect of going into the office, “I started to lose control of my body. I started to shake, couldn’t move, couldn’t speak, I was temporarily paralysed.”</p><p>  对于Melike Hussein，倦怠是“燃烧缓慢的过程”。作为国际公司的会计师和财务总监，她喜欢她的工作。 “这是奇怪的事情。我对它有一个巨大的能力 - 我是那个有最艰难的工作的人，因为我有这种心理恢复力来处理它。“一天早上，当她想到进入办公室的前景时，“我开始控制我的身体。我开始摇晃，无法移动，不能说话，我暂时瘫痪了。“</p><p> Looking back, she could see how stress had accumulated during her 15 years in finance. “I lived with insomnia, I had panic attacks, chest pains, muscular pains. It was highly competitive, working in a tough environment but I never really had the tools to stop stress becoming chronic.” She experienced “brain fog”, and tasks that she had once done in 10 minutes ended up taking hours, “which added to my workload”.</p><p> 回顾一下，她可以看到在她15年期间在金融期间积累的压力。 “我用失眠症生活，我有恐慌的攻击，胸痛，肌肉痛苦。它具有竞争力，在一个艰难的环境中工作，但我从来没有真正有工具阻止压力成为慢性。“她经历了“大脑雾”，并在10分钟内完成的任务结束了几个小时，“加入我的工作量”。 </p><p> Hussein was signed off from work, and, although she was recommended antidepressants and therapy, found that what really helped her was breathwork – breathing exercises that it is claimed can transform mental and physical health.</p><p>侯赛因从工作中签下，虽然她被推荐的抗抑郁药和治疗，发现真正帮助她是呼吸 - 呼吸练习，它被声称可以改变心理和身体健康。</p><p> She ended up leaving her job in 2016 and retraining as a breathwork and meditation teacher to help others. “Within six months, I had almost none of the previous issues that I had dealt with.”</p><p> 她最终在2016年离开了她的工作，并将作为呼吸和冥想老师重新训练，以帮助别人。 “在六个月内，我几乎没有我处理过的问题。”</p><p> As soon as we start to feel better, we often return to the same environment and use the same coping strategies that triggered the burnout</p><p> 一旦我们开始感觉更好，我们经常返回相同的环境，并使用触发倦怠的相同应对策略</p><p> The good news, says Babb, is that there are “effective ways to manage and reduce the impact of burnout. They focus on developing your stress awareness, and resilience and coping strategies.”</p><p> BABB说，好消息是，有“管理和减少倦怠的影响的有效方法。他们专注于制定您的压力意识和恢复力和应对策略。“</p><p> Techniques include mindfulness, self-compassion and setting boundaries (the usual things of exercise, good diet, rest and sleep are all crucial). At work, she advises regular breaks, delegating tasks and reviewing your workload and responsibilities with a manager. And your GP can help. Leaving your job isn’t necessarily an immediate cure, she says. “We tend to underestimate the time it takes to recover. As soon as we start to feel better, we often return to the same environment and use the same coping strategies that triggered the burnout.” And so the cycle starts again.</p><p> 技术包括谨慎，自我同情和设定界限（通常是运动，良好的饮食，休息和睡眠都是至关重要的。在工作中，她向经理提供定期休息，委派任务，并审查您的工作量和责任。你的GP可以提供帮助。她说，离开你的工作并不一定是立即治愈的。 “我们倾向于低估恢复所需的时间。一旦我们开始感觉更好，我们经常返回相同的环境，并使用相同的应对策略引发倦怠。“所以周期再次开始。</p><p>  If you make enough changes, however, you can transform your life for the better. When the coronavirus hit, Lewis decided to use her paramedic training to help out and went on the temporary register for healthcare professionals who had recently left. When a paramedic position came up in a minor injuries unit last summer, she took it. It’s a different type of job – although she is now on the way to becoming a paramedic practitioner, with additional medical training – but it has all the features of the ambulance service she initially loved.</p><p>  但是，如果你做出了足够的变化，你可以改善你的生活。当Coronavirus打击时，刘易斯决定使用护理人员培训来帮助，并继续最近离开的医疗保健专业人员的临时登记册。当去年夏天，辅助职员在一名轻微的伤害单位中出现时，她接受了。这是一种不同类型的工作 - 虽然她现在正在成为护理人员，但额外的医学培训 - 但它拥有她最初被爱的救护车服务的所有特征。</p><p> “I don’t know who’s going to walk through the door, I don’t know what they’re going to have wrong with them. But it’s less stressful, it’s a lovely place to work and I’m able to get my teeth stuck in and learn new stuff, which I was missing,” she says.</p><p> “我不知道谁会走过门，我不知道他们会有什么问题。但它不那么紧张，这是一个可爱的工作场所，我能够让我的牙齿陷入困境，学习我缺少的新东西，“她说。 </p><p> Lewis is proof that there is life after burnout – perhaps even when returning to a similar job (with critical adjustments). “So far,” she says, “it’s all been really good.”</p><p>刘易斯证明了倦怠后有生命 - 也许即使返回类似的工作（带有临时调整）。 “到目前为止，”她说，“这一切都非常好。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/08/a-career-change-saved-my-life-the-people-who-built-better-lives-after-burnout">https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jun/08/a-career-change-saved-my-life-the-people-who-built-better-lives-after-burnout</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/变化/">#变化</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/change/">#change</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
