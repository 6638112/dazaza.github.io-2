In short, the startup allows a company\u2019s ops groups \u2014 sales ops, marketing ops, etc. \u2014 to set up automated business logic across applications that can include human-in-the-loop elements. And Tonkean built its system to be IT-friendly, allowing it to support enterprise-scale customers.\n The automation space has been broadly hot in recent quarters. Robotic process automation (RPA) is great for mechanizing repetitive tasks that waste human time. The method of using computers to do stuff that humans previously had to do by clicking far too much has  proven to be big business.\n   Tonkean allows for something a bit different. An example may help: During our interview, Eliyahu mused about what might happen if a salesperson for a Tonkean client wanted to send a lead into a nurture campaign. Tonkean would let the sales ops team set up logic so that when the frontline salesperson selects the lead for a nurture effort inside their CRM, the lead would then automatically be added to a specific Marketo campaign. Furthermore, the click-to-nurture system would alert a human on the sales team, perhaps asking for approval of the decision.\n Tonkean software employs no-code tools to let ops groups use off-the-shelf command modules to build business logic \u2014 or craft their own as needed. The use of the company\u2019s software could allow for more empowered teams at companies that are less reliant on engineering groups for help in accelerating and automating their work.\n That thematically fits inside the general narrative we\u2019ve seen from no-code startups in general: They want to allow non-technical folks to have more control of their work through less reliance on technical teams at their place of employment.\n Tonkean employs around 60 people today, up from around 15 folks at the time of its Series A. It plans to hire rapidly now that it has more capital. Eliyahu claims most of its Series A is still in the bank. So why did it raise?\n Because Eliyahu considers his startup\u2019s market to be so large that he wants to pull the company\u2019s future closer to today; the new capital will give Tonkean the space it needs to hire more rapidly and build more quickly than it might have if it continued to operate from a smaller capital case.\n Fifty million dollars is a lot of money. Let\u2019s see how far it gets Tonkean. The next time we talk to the company, we\u2019ll demand some harder growth metrics so we can see if the additional capital was the accelerant that the company hopes it will be.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:30:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,\u5546\u4e1a,accelerate", "title": "Tonkean\u57f9\u517b\u4e865000\u4e07\u7cfb\u5217B\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u662f\u6ca1\u6709\u4ee3\u7801\u5546\u4e1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u670d\u52a1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTonkean raises $50M Series B to accelerate is no-code business automation service\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/tonkean-raises-50m-series-b/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u7801", "\u5546\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b738ec7e128a645f05af6146ba213713.jpg", "infoid": 1067995, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "M12\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u53c2\u52a0\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005Boldstart Ventures\uff0cGrove Ventures\u548cCrescendo Ventures\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6536\u5230\u4e86330\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u56de\u5408\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u53bb\u5e744\u6708\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\u590f\u5929\u60ac\u6302\u4e86350\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u52a0\u5165\u3002\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u5706\u5f62\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u7b79\u96c6\u603b\u989d\u4e3a2380\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u516c\u53f8\u63a7\u5236\u4e91\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u9650\u5236\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u4e91\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u5230\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\n  \u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u53bb\u5e74\u56db\u6708\u4e0e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ea4\u8c08\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u521a\u8fdb\u5165\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7248\u3002\u636e\u516c\u53f8\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u517c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Ohad Maislish\u79f0\uff0c\u5b83\u4e00\u822c\u4e8e\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u7ea64\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u521a\u521a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u81ea\u52a9\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u975e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4ee3\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4e91\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u201c\u6bdb\u4e3b\u660e\u8bc6\u89e3\u91ca\u8bf4\u3002\n \u81ea\u4ece\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ed6\u62a5\u544a\u516c\u53f8\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u6570\u5341\u5bb6\u4ed8\u8d39\u5ba2\u6237\u5e76\u6b63\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u5165\u3002\u5ba2\u6237\u5305\u62ecJFROG\uff0cVARONIS\u548cBIGID\u3002\n \u8be5\u8d77\u59cb\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u4ece4\u670820\u65e5\u52307\u540d\u5458\u5de5\u4ece\u4eca\u5929\u523017\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u672a\u676518\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u8fbe\u523050\u4e2a\uff0c\u5b83\u5f00\u59cb\u5c06\u65b0\u8d44\u672c\u7eb3\u5165\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5de5\u4eba\u5e94\u8be5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u6210\u957f\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c06\u4eba\u4eec\u5e26\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u662f\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765[\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u5f0f]\u3002\u201d\n \u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4ee5\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f00\u8bbe\u529e\u4e8b\u5904..

The company received  a $3.3 million seed round, which we covered, last April and a previously unannounced $3.5 million add-on last summer. Today\u2019s round brings the total raised to $23.8 million.\n The company\u2019s service helps companies control cloud costs, while giving developers the ability to deploy to the cloud with cost limits. It also provides a level of governance for code as it moves through the development cycle to deployment.\n  When we spoke to the company last April  around its seed round, the company\u2019s product was just entering beta. It has been generally available for about 4 months now and they\u2019ve built out a lot of functionality since then, according to company co-founder and CEO Ohad Maislish.\n \u201cThe last time we spoke we were just focussed on manual self service and empowering developers in non production environments. Now with infrastructure as code automation and teams and governance, we basically manage all of the cloud deployments for our customers,\u201d Maislish explained.\n Since going generally available with the product this year, he reports the company now has dozens of paying customers and is generating revenue. Customers includes JFrog, Varonis and BigID.\n The startup has also grown from just 7 employees in April 2020 to 17 today with plans to reach 50 in the next 18 months it begins putting the new capital to work. He says that bringing in a diverse group of workers should help his company grow and bring different ways of solving problems. \u201cI think that bringing people with different cultures, different backgrounds, is key in that they will bring [different ways of thinking].\u201d\n For now, the company is based in Israel with plans to open offices in the U.S.. Mailslish says that his plans to move to California were put on hold by the pandemic, but he hopes to open an office in Sunnyvale in the fall.\n The Israeli office is a minimum of two days in the office, three days at home or whatever combination employees wish. He says that he plans to hire people in the U.S. office as he establishes himself there and some of those employees can be remote if it makes sense for the role.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:30:21",

", "note_en": "SEOUL, June 24 (Reuters) - South Korean retailer Shinsegae Group&#39;s E-Mart Inc  (139480.KS) said on Thursday it plans to acquire an 80% stake in eBay Inc&#39;s  (EBAY.O) South Korean business for 3.4 trillion won ($3 billion).\n With the deal, traditional retail giant Shinsegae gets a much-needed boost in the Korean e-commerce sector, where it has lagged after competitors such as No. 1 Coupang , while eBay Korea gains a powerful backer after years of underperforming, analysts said.\n EBay will retain a 20% interest in the Korean business, whose implied value is approximately $3.8 billion, eBay said in a statement.\n The transaction is expected to close by year-end or early next year, subject to regulatory approvals.\n Naver Corp  (035420.KS), which had teamed up with E-Mart in the bidding process for eBay&#39;s South Korean business, said earlier this week it had pulled out of the acquisition.\n EBay Korea, which was the leading e-commerce player in South Korea until 2015, saw transaction growth slow starting in 2016 due to intensified competition from the likes of Coupang, analysts said.\n Although the growth rate of South Korea&#39;s online shopping market reached 41% between 2018 and 2020, the estimated growth rate of eBay Korea&#39;s transactions was about 4%, Samsung Securities analysts wrote in a report last week.\n However, the business was still attractive to traditional retail giants including Shinsegae&#39;s E-Mart, South Korea&#39;s largest hypermarket chain, which have struggled to build a leading presence in online shopping, especially after the onset of COVID-19.\n &#34;The deal price is lower than what eBay Inc originally wanted,&#34; said Park Eun-kyung, analyst at Samsung Securities.\n &#34;But whether the price is competitive or not is expected to be judged in the short-term by improvement in eBay Korea&#39;s performance, as eBay Korea&#39;s recent efforts at direct-sourcing and rapid shipping can be helped by E-Mart&#39;s buying power and cost control,&#34; she said.\n EBay Korea operates the e-commerce platforms Gmarket, Auction and G9, and is the country&#39;s third-largest e-commerce firm with a market share of about 12.8% in 2020, according to Euromonitor.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:22:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u97e9\u56fd,south", "title":

"Tech     Adoption of apps to track pay, events and dispute complaints is soaring amid patchwork of regulatory efforts\n   Drivers for  Uber Technologies   Lyft  and  DoorDash  are flocking to a wave of apps designed to make gig work a better gig.\n  One app tracks weather patterns, aggregates drivers\u2019 earnings from multiple platforms and steers them toward more lucrative locations by keeping tabs on events and foot traffic at airports. Another transforms drivers\u2019 phones into dash cams, footage from which can be used to dispute passenger complaints.\n  Gridwise Inc., the app that collates drivers\u2019 earnings across platforms, said its downloads more than doubled in May compared with the same month in 2019. The Pittsburgh-based app, founded in 2017, said it has more than 140,000 active monthly users. New York-based Driver Technologies Inc., which started its dashcam app in 2018, said it saw 10 times more downloads in the same period. It has about 50,000 active monthly users, at least a third of which it estimates are gig workers.\n  Downloads of the apps are outstripping pre-pandemic levels as the U.S. reopens amid a patchwork of regulatory efforts that catapulted workers\u2019 rights to the fore last year.\n    Many workers banded together to rally for better protections and drove awareness about tools that drivers could use to boost earnings, track expenses and hold companies accountable when something goes wrong.\n    The surge in downloads comes despite a nationwide shortage of drivers that Uber and Lyft say they are contending with as the health crisis wanes and  demand picks up. These apps are free and most earn revenue by selling location data and insights to city planners and insurers, among others.\n  Uber and Lyft pioneered on-demand gig work, but the companies don\u2019t directly employ those workers. While many drivers want to remain independent, they say they also want more information on compensation, better tools to maximize earnings and guidance on how to manage issues such as wrongful terminations or complaints.\n  Rideshare and food-delivery companies acknowledge that third-party apps can help. A Lyft spokeswoman said that while the company arms drivers with earnings and other data, \u201cthird-party apps can aggregate information from numerous platforms and provide a more holistic view of someone\u2019s activity,\u201d adding that those insights \u201care a good thing, regardless of whether they come from Lyft or from another group.\u201d\n    Some apps are equipping drivers with the evidence needed to defend themselves and pointing them to legal aid.\n  Antonio Zermeno started using Driver, the dashcam app, a few months ago. The app uses the phone\u2019s rear camera to record the road and the front camera to film the interior of the car.\n  Mr. Zermeno said the footage gives him a sense that he can advocate for himself in case of traffic incidents or rider complaints.\n  While ferrying an Uber passenger last month, a car jumped a red light and damaged Mr. Zermeno\u2019s bumper. The app connected him to LegalRideshare LLC, a law firm in Chicago that guided him on using accident footage to file a claim with Uber at no cost. Mr. Zermeno expects to receive some compensation from Uber because the accident involved a rider.\n    In addition to recording, the Driver app can transform the phone\u2019s back camera into a driving assistant, said founder Rashid Galadanci. The front camera is powered with facial-recognition technology that can warn drivers if their \u201ceyes are closing or their head dipping\u201d for additional safety, he said. Mr. Galadanci said regular car owners also use those features.\n  Lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere have sought to reclassify ride-share and food-delivery drivers as employees to force companies to build more support infrastructure. The companies fought those attempts,  winning some big battles including in their home state in California late last year, and  losing others, such as in the U.K. this year.\n  A DoorDash spokesman said it is working to improve its couriers\u2019 experience and has struck partnerships with companies that offer discounts on automobile repairs and assist with tax preparation, among other things.\n  Uber said its partnerships also help drivers with taxes. The company has a guidebook for new drivers and virtual tutorials that can help them navigate issues such as complaints and accident claims.\n  Drivers themselves have taken to building an ecosystem that helps their peers navigate  the challenges and quirks of being an app-based worker.\n  \u201cGig workers are really taking matters into their own hands and using any and every tool to take control,\u201d said Hays Witt, co-founder of Driver\u2019s Seat Cooperative, a gig-worker-owned group that in late 2019 launched an app to help drivers track expenses such as gas and mileage.\n  The app gives drivers a more accurate picture of their mileage by also recording the time they spend driving to pick up passengers. Tracking mileage is important because it helps drivers save tax dollars. Uber and Lyft log only the miles during a ride. Driver\u2019s Seat said its app downloads doubled this May compared with February last year, before widespread lockdowns swept the U.S. It said the app is used by 2,000 drivers.\n  UberCheats was launched last year by a software engineer who became a food-delivery driver. The web tool pulls the GPS coordinates of trips from drivers\u2019 monthly statements and uses Google Maps to calculate the distance between pickup and drop-off locations. Drivers can use it to match it with the distance Uber paid them for.\n    How do you think app-based gig work will evolve in the coming years? Join the conversation below.\n  Former navy officer Ryan Green, co-founder of the earnings aggregator app Gridwise, came up with the idea after driving for Uber during off-duty hours while stationed at a military base in Pensacola, Fla. \u201cFairly quickly, I was exposed to the pain points that drivers were dealing with,\u201d he said.\n  He launched Gridwise after subscribing to some 30 services offering information such as weather conditions and airport traffic and sending that data to drivers. The app tracks events in more than 80 cities, including New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Drivers can see their combined earnings across platforms by linking each of their accounts to the app. The company has raised $5.6 million from venture-capital firms including Switch Ventures.\n  Los Angeles-based gig worker Ben Valdez likes that Gridwise keeps him informed about big events and tracks his activity across platforms. \u201cSo you don\u2019t have to write it down in a book. They do it all for you,\u201d he said.\n  He experimented with a Driver-like dashcam app, but found that it was better suited for drivers with an extra handset because it overheated his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s about adjusting your strategy through trial and error,\u201d Mr. Valdez said.\n  Appeared in the June 24, 2021, print edition as &#39;Apps Make Gig Work a Better Gig.&#39;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 22:22:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u53f8\u673a,earnings,\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f", "title": "\u770b\u770b\u4f18\u6b65\uff0cLyft\u548cDoordash\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u52a0\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5982Gridwise\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u6574\u7406\u53f8\u673a\u7684\u6536\u5165 ", "title_en": "A look at some of the apps used by Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash drivers to increase earnings, like Gridwise, which collates drivers' earnings across platforms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-lyft-drivers-race-to-apps-that-make-contract-work-a-better-gig-11624449601?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u53f8\u673a", "earnings", "\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f"]}]
