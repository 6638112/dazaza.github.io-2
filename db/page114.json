But unlike almost every other galaxy ever seen\u2014including our own Milky Way\u2014they didn\u2019t seem to be enshrouded in huge masses of dark matter, which would normally hold those stellar metropolises together with their gravity. The scientists picked one to zoom in on, a modest-sized galaxy about 250,000 light-years away, and they pointed the 27 radio telescope antennas of the Very Large Array in New Mexico at it.\n After gathering 40 hours\u2019 worth of data, they mapped out the stars and gas and confirmed what the earlier snapshots had hinted at: \u201cThe dark matter content that we infer in this galaxy is much, much smaller than what you would expect,\u201d says Fraternali, an astronomer at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. If the team or their competitors find other such galaxies, it could pose a challenge for scientists\u2019  view of  dark  matter, the dominant perspective in the field for at least 20 years. Fraternali and his team  published their findings in December in the  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n Based on decades of telescope observations and computer simulations, scientists have come to think of dark matter as the hidden skeleton of the cosmos; its \u201cjoints\u201d are massive clumps of invisible particles which host galaxies large and small. But Fraternali isn\u2019t the first to glimpse an exception to that rule. A few years ago, Pieter van Dokkum, an astronomer at Yale, and his colleagues  discovered similar galaxies with the  Hubble telescope that also seemed to lack dark matter. \u201cThese galaxies that we found in 2018, they created a lot of controversy and discussion and follow-up work because they were unexpected and difficult to explain,\u201d van Dokkum says.\n    Those other galaxies lived in a crowded environment, where bigger, neighboring galaxies frequently fly by, possibly pulling away dark matter with them. In contrast, Fraternali\u2019s galaxy is pretty isolated, with no such bothersome neighbors, so its dearth of dark matter can\u2019t be explained that way. \u201cIt could be very significant,\u201d van Dokkum says. \u201cHow do you get stars and gas in that location together without the help of dark matter?\u201d\n These strange objects have come to be called \u201cultra-diffuse galaxies.\u201d They\u2019re extreme outliers: In terms of their mass, they\u2019re minuscule, but they\u2019re spread out over vast distances. Some are as large as the Milky Way, but with only a hundredth as many stars\u2014or even fewer. They\u2019re so close to being transparent that they\u2019re tough to spy in the night sky. \u201cThey\u2019re slightly fainter in the center, so they\u2019re difficult to detect. Now, with better telescopes and deeper observations, they have become more well known,\u201d says Mireia Montes, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and an expert on such galaxies.\n Starting in the 1960s, American astronomer Vera Rubin and others first revealed the likely existence of unseen, or \u201cdark,\u201d matter while measuring how fast stars in galaxies whirl around the center, showing that inner stars orbit at different speeds than outer ones. Based on those stars\u2019 rotation, scientists calculated how much mass the galaxy must have to keep them constantly orbiting, rather than being flung into space. For many galaxies, that mass was many times larger than that of all the stars added up. Scientists resolved the problem by inferring the presence of some kind of dark matter, which doesn\u2019t emit or reflect light, and which must be making up the rest of the mass that\u2019s holding the galaxy together.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:22:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28,discover,\u661f\u7cfb", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5947\u602a\u7684\u661f\u7cfb", "title_en": "Astronomers discover a strange galaxy without dark matter", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/astronomers-discover-a-strange-galaxy-without-dark-matter/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6697\u7269\u8d28", "discover", "\u661f\u7cfb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6e6da9d28a385fb2f3a94fa10fb4c084.jpg", "infoid": 1072523, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel Fernandez\u662fCapchase\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u548c\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6539\u53d8\u8425\u8fd0\u8d44\u91d1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73b0\u91d1\u6765\u6e90\u3002\n\u6536\u5165\u878d\u8d44\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6210\u957f\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7acb\u5373\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u4ed8\u6b3e\u4e2d\u7acb\u5373\u83b7\u53d6\u672a\u6765\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u5904\u662f\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u9650\u989d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u5176\u6bcf\u6708\u9884\u671f\u589e\u957f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u7ed8\u5236\u8d44\u91d1\u3002", "note_en": "Miguel Fernandez is CEO and co-founder of  Capchase. He is passionate about changing working capital dynamics to make it the main source of cash for tech companies.\n  Choosing the right financing partner can be tedious, as they need to align with your mission, values and objectives. Otherwise, you get stuck in a relationship that doesn\u2019t align with your goals and may lead you ending up with lower ownership than expected.\n Here\u2019s a rundown of how alternative financing came to be, how it can benefit high-growth SaaS startups and how to know if it\u2019s right for you.\n  There is a dearth of non-dilutive financing options for growth-stage, recurring-revenue businesses. We\u2019ve found that traditional sources of debt capital (such as banks) simply prefer to provide debt to asset-heavy businesses where collateral can be secured.\n  When it comes to SaaS or asset-light business models, there simply isn\u2019t an asset base to collateralize, which makes traditional debt providers uncomfortable. Moreover, while subscription or recurring revenue business models aren\u2019t technically new, they have been undersupported. SaaS companies can often only look to traditional banks for financing after achieving profitability and/or receiving institutional venture capital backing.\n This rules-based approach is pragmatic, but results in a massive gap in the market for early-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and serious revenue traction. If they don\u2019t fit the \u201cchecklist,\u201d they simply get thrown into the backlog until all the boxes can be checked off, regardless of the underlying traction.\n  Revenue financing allows founders to have more control over their decisions without compromising board seats. SaaS companies can especially benefit from this model, as it advances future revenue from customers who are already signed up.\n Revenue financing enables companies on a healthy growth trajectory to instantly access future cash flows from their customers\u2019 monthly payments.

It\u2019s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It\u2019s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement.\n The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all.\n  Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW\u2019s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here\u2019s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us.\n  We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term \u201cco-pilot\u201d and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver-assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video \u2014 especially not when in a moving vehicle.\n All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on.\n    Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering  automotive in-vehicle tech at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant\u2019s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected \u201cplatforms\u201d consisting of systems on a chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or \u00e0 la carte.\n The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.\n Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to  power its next-gen ADAS.\n  While Volvo\u2019s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm\u2019s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia\u2019s.  Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022 that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.\n Nvidia\u2019s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that\u2019s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions.\n JiDU Auto, Baidu\u2019s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC. This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.\n Other companies using Drive Orin include\u00a0Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.\n  Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a  new supercomputer to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\n The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system on chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.\n The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ SoC for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.\n  What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds.\n Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it\u2019s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery\u2019s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d? There\u2019s tech for that, too.\n The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining.\n   Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android\u2019s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car. This year, Google took it a few steps further.\n Volvo and Google announced an integration with the Google Home ecosystem, which would allow Volvo car owners to issue voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled devices. They can tell the assistant to do things like turn the car on and off, heat it up or cool it down and provide car info like battery life. Volvo also shared plans to enable YouTube app downloads, thanks to both Google integrations with Volvo vehicles and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon cockpit.\n Google also added features to its digital car key with BMW, which enables users to lock, unlock and start certain BMW cars with select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. Now, the car will automatically unlock itself when the device gets close enough, and users can share their digital car key with friends or family.\n   In previous years at CES, Amazon showed up in a number of vehicles via its virtual assistant Alexa. This year, the power of Alexa is combining with  Amazon\u2019s Fire TV streaming platform, which is working its way into more cars.\n Last year, global automaker Stellantis integrated the Fire TV into its vehicles, and at CES 2022, we\u2019re seeing the in-car entertainment systems of certain Jeep, Chrysler,  BMW and Ford vehicles get an upgrade, as well.\n Fire TV for cars will do more than offer a TV streaming platform. It\u2019ll sync with Alexa so drivers and passengers can simply speak a command and  poof!, \u201cOlaf Presents\u201d is playing in the backseat and your children are blessedly quiet. Users can also ask Alexa to show their Ring doorbell video on the Fire TV using voice commands.\n Stellantis is getting even cozier with Amazon. At CES 2022, Stellantis  announced a wide-ranging collaboration that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon\u2019s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.\n As part of this multiyear deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.\n  Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car\u2019s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver\u2019s behalf.\n Cerence\u2019s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them.\n While the company didn\u2019t share which automakers are signed onto integrate the co-pilot, a video demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past.\n  Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company\u2019s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo\u2019s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup.\n The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn\u2019t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles\u2019s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range.\n  In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver-assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving.\n That doesn\u2019t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn\u2019t show up at CES; they just weren\u2019t the ones yelling the loudest this year.\n  As we mentioned earlier, GM\u2019s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.\n The system is an upgrade from the automaker\u2019s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it\u2019s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios.\n Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM\u2019s software that will then output decisions.\n   Volvo shared plans to work with  lidar company Luminar and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier.\n  Chinese internet giant Baidu\u2019s EV startup JiDU came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.\n JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.\n   While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it\u2019s worth noting how  Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.\n Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there\u2019s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers\u2019 heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.\n   Last October, teams from around the world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.\n The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.\n Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this  one that was filmed at night.\n  Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.\n The company showed a lot, but its ultra-sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver-assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures and activities.\n    In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company Vinfast announced the formation of its early-bird reservation site. The first to preorder will receive a \u201cVinFirst\u201d certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number.\n The term \u201cdigital twin\u201d popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.\n  Indi EV, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is \u201cthe world\u2019s first social media-oriented car.\u201d What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud.\n If all that wasn\u2019t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that\u2019s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start preordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000.\n  BMW  unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow. Right now, the e-paper wrapping the vehicle can only change between black and white, but more colors are expected in the future that will enable users to give their car a more personalized look to match their mood.\n  NextbaseDash cam tech company Nextbase unveiled its smart and connected dash cam, the Nextbase iQ. It gives drivers a lot of the same safety and security features they would get in their home-monitoring systems, like real-time alerts and access to incident video even while they\u2019re away from their car. Users can also get real-time access to the dash cam from anywhere at anytime through the iQ app.\n  Finally, Mercedes revealed the  Vision EQXX, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker\u2019s electric future will look like. This eye-popping sport EV wasn\u2019t just about aerodynamics and a sleek design. The company squeezed in power, efficiency and range into the compact and sporty package.\n  Some of the neat tech in the EQXX worth noting is the\u00a0one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen has responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes.\n The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company\u2019s newer models, the EQXX also featured an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.\n  In the lidar world, Luminar\u2019s eyebrow-raising stunt comparing Tesla\u2019s ADAS system to its own (to the peril of several child-size dummies) was affecting, and its inclusion in Volvo vehicles and Mobileye systems is a coup. But it\u2019s still an expensive and complex system, a major investment with uncertain (if potentially significant) benefits.\n Here\u2019s me driving the Tesla Model Y on the left. It, of course, doesn\u2019t have LiDAR. On the right is the  @luminartech enabled vehicle.  $LAZR  pic.twitter.com/FlQVlQcw8O\n Manufacturers are struggling to produce something that creates a useful outcome for a vehicle at a reasonable price. Costs haven\u2019t come down as much as they\u2019d like, and there\u2019s still confusion over who does what in a perception stack.\n Blickfeld is attempting to take over as much as possible, for instance, with on-device movement detection, object classification and so on, which could make their devices easier to drop in \u2014 or possibly make them partially redundant with an already intelligent in-car computer vision system.\n Arbe is focusing more narrowly on what it calls \u201cfree space mapping,\u201d where it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a bush or a raccoon or what \u2014 the question is, is it safe to drive on? A quick, dedicated sensor for identifying driveable surfaces in the vicinity could be a useful feature and one that contributes to the autonomous vehicle collective intelligence.\n Innoviz is improving on the traditional spinning puck lidar type, which has proven to be useful in many circumstances. A cheaper, better version may find success where trailblazer Velodyne has over the years.\n Similarly,  Voyant Photonics is leaving the whole automotive market to deeper pockets, focusing on producing its tiny, inexpensive lidar unit for robotics and industrial applications, where certifications and liabilities aren\u2019t quite so intense.\n There\u2019s no doubt lidar has a future in autonomous vehicles and other equipment, but what form it will take and how much people will pay for it \u2014 that\u2019s still very much up in the air, something that no doubt makes everyone in the sector a little nervous.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:19:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u672a\u6765,future,\u6c7d\u8f66", "title": "CES 2022\u7684\u6700\u4f73\uff08\u548c\u6700\u5947\u602a\uff09\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u6280\u672f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThe best (and weirdest) future car tech at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u672a\u6765", "future", "\u6c7d\u8f66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7e5e90fe4981ba7deef341cba855cc70.jpg", "infoid": 1072521, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u79f0\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8eU.S.\u7684Facebook\u684c\u9762\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u201c\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u4eba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u201d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u201c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u201d\u83dc\u5355\u7684\u201c\u9690\u79c1\u201d\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u5728\u5b83\u6240\u4ee3\u8868\u4e2d\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5206\u4e3aFacebook\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6377\u5f84\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u68c0\u67e5\u83dc\u5355\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdc\u975e\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u4ef6\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "note_en": "The new privacy center, called  Privacy Center, is a test available to some U.S.-based Facebook desktop users for now but will roll out to \u201cmore people and apps in the coming months.\u201d If you\u2019re in the limited test, you can find the new privacy information center in the Privacy section of the Settings menu. As it stands, privacy settings are divided among Facebook\u2019s Privacy Shortcuts and Privacy Checkup menus, which are far from ideal but still an improvement over how the platform used to handle these controls.\n The new privacy center will break things down into five categories: Security, Sharing, Collection, Use and Ads. Meta is still pushing the idea of \u201cprivacy education\u201d with the changes, a kind of shorthand way of saying that if you don\u2019t go to the trouble of sorting through all of this stuff then it\u2019s on you when the company puts your personal data to good use.\n  Facebook has historically offered users byzantine, difficult to navigate privacy controls, often with the most important settings buried in menus.

As   The New York Times notes, the products affected include Google\u2019s Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and computers, as well as Chromecast devices. While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn\u2019t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.\n \u201cWhile we disagree with today\u2019s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,\u201d the spokesperson told   Protocol. \u201cWe will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos\u2019 frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.\u201d The commission didn\u2019t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.\n  In fact, the Nest team has recently  announced some changes to speaker groups, which it says is \u201cdue to a recent legal ruling.\u201d The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They\u2019d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.\n In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there\u2019s a possibility that \u201cGoogle will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.\u201d However, he said the tech giant\u2019s products will still \u201cinfringe many dozens of Sonos patents\u201d \u2014 that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.\n  \u201cWe appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos\u2019s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google\u2019s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos\u2019 groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.\n  There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can \u2014as other companies have already done \u2014 pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:19:22", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u8c37\u6b4c,google,\u4fb5\u72af,rules", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u4fb5\u72afSonos\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u4e13\u5229\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u89c4\u5219", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tUS regulator rules that Google infringed on Sonos speaker patents\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/us-regulator-rules-that-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "google", "\u4fb5\u72af", "rules"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "298d8f3057dc003a7cbba11d32533313.jpg", "infoid": 1072519, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u68d2\u7403\u662f\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u793a\u4f8b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u548c\u7535\u5f71\u201cMoneyball\u201d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5965\u514b\u5170\u7530\u5f84\u7684GM Billy Beane\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u8fd9\u9879\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4f9d\u9760\u4eba\u7ae5\u7ae5\u7ae5\u7ae5\u7ae5\u7ae5\u5de5\u961f\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u68d2\u7403\u7531\u5206\u6790\u5e08\u7edf\u6cbb\uff0c\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u68d2\u7403\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u4e00\u6837 - \u4f46\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff1f", "note_en": "Baseball is one of the best examples of how data can impact a business. The book and movie  \u201cMoneyball\u201d\u00a0showed how Oakland Athletics\u2019 GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals \u2014 but could there be too much data?\n Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe\u2019s  Sunday Baseball Notes column recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.\n Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, \u201cThe result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.\u201d\n  Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.\n Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information. Sure, machines and software can help sort it out \u2014 indeed, they are getting better at it \u2014 but anyone who has dealt with poorly targeted advertising or email marketing knows there\u2019s much work to be done.\n  Deepak Jeevankumer, managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, says the difference in play now compared to 2014 is that companies now are focused on getting insights to the people who need it faster. \u201cBig Data has become less relevant than \u2018fast data.\u2019 E-commerce shoppers, streaming media consumers, gamers, stock/crypto traders and enterprise marketeers are demanding fast insights and fast knowledge,\u201d Jeevankumer told me.\n He believes data needs to be analyzed at its source while streaming, and in real-time after a query is created, and that startups that create solutions that allow companies (and baseball teams) to do this will be more successful in the long run.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:19:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53ef\u7528,companies,\u68d2\u7403", "title": "\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff1f", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tWith more data available than ever, are companies making smarter decisions?\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/with-more-data-available-than-ever-are-companies-making-smarter-decisions/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u7528", "companies", "\u68d2\u7403"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "94c6fef7330750055515144af4e53a28.jpg", "infoid": 1072518, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7a0d\u540e\u7684\u5341\u5e74\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cVR\u8033\u673a\u5df2\u7ecf\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u66f4\u597d - \u4f46\u662f\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8bf4\uff0cVR\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u5c06\u662f......\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u6ce8\u5b9a\u8981\u7ed3\u675f\u8033\u673a\uff08\u4ed6\u4eecVR\uff0cAR\u6216\u4e24\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7269\uff09\u7ed1\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8138\u4e0a\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c11\u4e8e\u4e00\u5927\u4ef6\u4e8b*\u548c\u5343\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fb\u8d25\u519b\u5200;\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u8d85\u81ea\u7136\u3002\u9012\u589e\u66f4\u597d/\u66f4\u8f7b/\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8033\u673a\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4eba\u4eec\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8033\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u57f9\u8bad\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u7a81\u7136\u540c\u610f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n\u5b83\u5c06\u652f\u6301FOVEATED\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u7279\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u613f\u666f\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n\u591a\u5e74\u6765\uff0cVR\u8033\u673a\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u6279\u6b21\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u4ee4\u4eba\u751f\u5fc3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4ed6\u4eec\u771f\u6b63\u591a\u4e48\u5c0f\u4e86\uff1f", "note_en": "A decade of development later, VR headsets have gotten better and better \u2014 but it\u2019s safe to say, at this point, that VR\u2019s adoption will be \u2026 gradual. If we\u2019re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it\u2019ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on  what a metaverse is.\n This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at  CES. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering \u2014 but each another step in the progression.\n  (* the one potential meteor strike, of course, being if Apple does what it loves to do and swoops in late, drops its version and turns the category on its head. That\u2019s been the rumor \u00a0for a while now.)\n    We\u2019ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light \u201cWe\u2019re working on it!\u201d announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn\u2019t shared many specifics.\n  They\u2019re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what\u2019s now officially known  as the PS VR2. Such as:\n It\u2019ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.\n  It\u2019ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.\n It\u2019ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever\u2019s in the center of your vision.\n They\u2019re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5\u2019s mind-bending adaptive triggers.\n  What\u2019ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the  Oculus Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it\u2019s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.\n   What\u2019s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your  hand the controller, instead?\n Hand tracking isn\u2019t a brand new idea, of course. Companies  have come and gone with hand tracking as their primary focus.\n But HTC\u2019s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can\u2019t see \u2014 like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you\u2019ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.\n The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it\u2019ll only work with HTC\u2019s Vive Focus 3 headset.\n   VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they\u2019re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?\n Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an \u201cultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution\u201d headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3\u2033 (2560\u00d72560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don\u2019t expect to move around  too much in these ones \u2014 you\u2019ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.\n    Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm\u2019s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)\n   It\u2019s not flashy hardware, but it\u2019s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.\n  Omniverse is Nvidia\u2019s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It\u2019s the company\u2019s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.\n   This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so \u2026 well, don\u2019t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. \u201cHolographic optical waveguide technology\u201d pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:18:39", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ar,vr", "title": "VR\u548cAR\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728CES 2022\u7168", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tVR and AR continue to simmer at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/vr-and-ar-continue-to-simmer-at-ces-2022/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ar", "vr"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7f5397905636e5537b23df747befac7e.jpg", "infoid": 1072517, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5e74\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u9884\u7b97\u65d7\u8230\u548c\u4ece\u5e76\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u65b0onlyplus\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9884\u89c8\uff1f\u5f53\u7136\uff0cLG\u548cHTC  - \u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5e2e\u52a9 - \u8981\u4e48\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u534e\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u51e0\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f88\u5feb\u53c2\u52a0CES\u3002\n\u558a\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u914d\u4ef6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\uff0canker\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u672c; $ 220\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u89c6\u9891\u680f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c2K\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5185\u7f6e\u706f\u5854\u548c\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f1a\u66ff\u6362\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4ef6\u7269\uff0c\u86cb\u767d\u77f3\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u63d2\u5934\u548c\u64ad\u653e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\uff09\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "note_en": "This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren\u2019t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC \u2014 which were both involved in the show in some form \u2014 are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won\u2019t be participating in CES any time soon.\n Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they\u2019re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the  Martian metaverse. Certainly the show kept  Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week.\n  CES continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren\u2019t as many phones as there once were. It\u2019s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It\u2019s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness \u2014 the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.\n  At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the  Vivomove Sport is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.\n Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags. This year the former got another PC partner, in Lenovo, as the  ThinkPad X1 got Tile tracking support, allowing users to find their lost laptop for up to 14 days, even when powered down. Targus, meanwhile, built Apple\u2019s Find My support directly into  its latest backpack.\n   But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of  CARD. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I\u2019d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.\n  Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole  what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild \u2014 especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you\u2019re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link\u2019s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?\n  Shout-out to what\u2019s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you  the Video Bar, which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It\u2019s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it\u2019s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.\n  Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES\u2019s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at  Labrador\u2019s system this week, however, because it addresses a very real need \u2014 specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.\n  It\u2019s not CES without fun new form factors, and the  Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What\u2019s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I\u2019m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we\u2019ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.\n  Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year.

It\u2019s Friday and the snow is falling like the dickens in my neck of the woods. But it was no snow day in the tech world. Not at  all. In fact, one venture firm raised 10 figures of capital today. Can you guess who?\n Before we jump in, today\u2019s TechCrunch staff highlight is  Grace Mendenhall, a member of  the Equity team who is also a documentary film editor. And she\u2019s frankly just the best. Now, the news! \u2014 Alex\n   a16z reloads with $9B in new capital: \u00a0The venture capital money arms race continued this week with news that Andreessen Horowitz has put together $9 billion to invest in venture deals, growth deals and biotech more specifically. As TechCrunch notes, the resulting dollar figure is a boost on the group\u2019s last trio of similar funds. There is, it appears, an infinite capital appetite in today\u2019s startup market.\n Roblox pulls Chinese app: \u00a0Five months after launching with Tencent in China, Roblox\u2019s LuoBuLeSi was taken down. What happened? It may be that Roblox has some work to do on the data side of its service, something that it hinted at in a statement. Regardless, the move is yet another example of how hard it is for non-Chinese companies to build and sell digital products in the country.\n India to investigate Google:\u00a0In the wake of industry complaints from news groups, India\u2019s Competition Commission \u201csaid Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws,\u201d TechCrunch reports. Given how big and lucrative the Indian market is, this is not good news for Mountain View.\n  Before we jump into all the startup news of the day, TechCrunch has a little treat for you. We got veteran venture capitalist Matt Murphy on the phone as 2021 came to a close  to chat about prior tech booms, prior tech busts and what he sees as the strengths and weaknesses of today\u2019s venture game. It\u2019s a great weekend read.\n  Pendulum raises $5.9M for narrative tracking:\u00a0This is a fun one, as the company\u2019s target market is utterly new to me. Per our reporting, Pendulum \u201chelps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.\u201d I guess you and I currently do this by reading lots of tweets, but seeing a company build software for it makes good sense.\n Peter Reinhardt leaves Twilio: \u00a0Remember when Twilio bought Segment for $3.2 billion? It also bought Segment\u2019s CEO, Peter Reinhardt, as part of the deal. Now, however, the exec is leaving to \u201cbe full-time CEO at Charm Industrial, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018,\u201d Ron Miller reports. I can\u2019t quite connect  charm and  carbon, but we\u2019ll keep an eye out for what the startup does next.\n Avataar raises $45M for \u201clife-sized 3D product evaluation\u201d: No, this is not \u201cAvatar,\u201d like the movie. It\u2019s Avataar, a U.S.- and India-based startup that helps consumers \u201cvisualize products in real-life size and feel in their living room\u201d using their phones. Given that we all want to buy more stuff online, but it\u2019s not always easy to picture a new footstool in situ, I like what the company is up to. Unsurprisingly, Avataar is working with e-commerce brands in categories like furniture.\n Bfree wants to update the irksome business of credit collections:\u00a0If you have ever gotten a call from a person who thinks that you owe them or someone that they represent money, you may have harkened back to how much more fun it was to get a root canal. Bfree, a \u201cNigerian credit management fintech,\u201d as TechCrunch puts it, is working to build something that it considers to be more ethical debt collection. The company just raised $1.7 million and is busy recruiting in 16 markets, we report.\n From the CES Beat: TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the great consumer electronics confab continued today, with posts up on  the promises of elder tech and, well,  all things metaverse, good and bad.\n If you need  even more startup news and notes and analysis this weekend,  the Equity team has you covered.\n After talking to marketing leaders for a year, here\u2019s my advice for CEOs\n  This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you\u2019re trying to grow one \u2014 well, winter is coming.\n We\u2019ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers\u2019 growing desire for more privacy, but here\u2019s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.\n \u201cThis is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner\u2019s Annual CMO Spend Survey,\u201d the research company reported.\n Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.\n In a TechCrunch+ guest post, she covers the \u201cdownward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars\u201d and shares several strategies that are producing results \u2014 as well as some \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas \u201cthat seemed ridiculous at the time.\u201d\n (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.  You can sign up here .)\n  Apple keeps working on its fitness product: TechCrunch has news up today regarding Apple\u2019s fitness product, the somewhat lamely named Fitness+. What\u2019s new? Collections, which we write are \u201dcurated series of workouts and meditations\u201d that are targeted at a particular goal. Also new is what\u2019s called \u201cTime to Run,\u201d an \u201caudio running experience,\u201d as we put it.\u00a0Why doesn\u2019t Apple just buy Peloton? I don\u2019t know.\n When does a Twitter Space become a podcast? \u00a0We\u2019re going to find out. Twitter is working on recording its live-audio product, called Spaces. And the social network is saying that it will include replay analytics. Which is super cool? Twitter\u2019s product team is seemingly bringing its really solid 2021 product cadence into the new year.\n And finally, from CES, a   roundup of electric mobility two-wheelers for everyone out there who lives in a city that hasn\u2019t given up its soul to provide more parking for lazy folks.\n   If you have a software consultant that you think other startup founders should know about, fill out the survey  here.\n    Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking and focused execution. We chose them for their expertise, disciplined approach and excellent work ethic. Thanks to team 91Ninjas, our inbound marketing engine has picked up good momentum.

Parr looks ahead at what\u2019s coming down the pike, including web3 and NFTs, and gives his advice on how your startup should proceed.\n Should online sellers start planning now to start stocking NFTs? Parr noted that Shopify is testing a pilot program for Shopify Plus customers that helps them sell non-fungible tokens via its platform, but he still suggests a wait-and-see approach:\n \u201cUnless you\u2019re deep in web3-land or have a large enough budget for brand experimentation, you should probably wait until the technology becomes more mature or only dip your toe in the water to start,\u201d writes Parr. \u201cA great NFT launch requires a lot more work than making a JPEG and putting it on the blockchain.\u201d\n  Marketer: Ridhi Singh, founder,  91Ninjas  Recommended by: Anish Khadiya,  itilite  Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking, and focused execution.

Since the acquisition closed earlier this year, the CEO of Auth0, Eugenio Pace, and I have come a long way in uncovering the best ways to embrace our differences, unite our teams and learn the ins and outs of each other\u2019s leadership styles.\n Our journey so far offers lessons for other CEOs navigating partnerships with a new co-CEO or other C-suite leaders post-acquisition. Here are my top takeaways from working together during the past year.\n   It\u2019s worthwhile to put pen to paper on your company\u2019s vision ahead of an acquisition \u2014 it helps you solidify your goals in writing that you can then easily share. Before our acquisition, I wrote a long paper mapping out my five-year vision for Okta. While articulating Okta\u2019s vision is a big part of my role as CEO, I had never laid it out in this type of written format (which turned out longer than I intended \u2014 15 pages!).\n The exercise allowed me to reflect on Okta\u2019s growth over the past 12-plus years and what\u2019s to come.\n  Eugenio found it helpful in understanding my viewpoint as we started the process of learning how we\u2019d best collaborate and bring our two companies together. He\u2019d actually drafted a similar document outlining his view of success if we were to join forces. These vision documents have helped us align our goals and illustrate how we intend to scale and capitalize on our massive market opportunity.\n  With any new C-suite hire or partner, it helps to build a relationship by finding common ground and shared values. Eugenio and I knew we both placed equal importance on implementing the same \u201cnorth star\u201d guidelines for the integration: sustainable growth, putting our customers first, continued innovation, protection of our brands and empowerment of our teams.\n Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.\n  Along with our mirrored core culture values, Eugenio and I share similarities in our leadership styles and personalities that complement each other. We\u2019re introverts, and we even have the same Myers-Briggs score (INTP), translating into a natural leadership chemistry. We both take accountable, dependable leadership seriously and understand each other\u2019s work styles. Eugenio has a deep product and technology background, so we\u2019re able to get really technical when discussing and making decisions about the future of our joint companies. Our shared background also enables us to effectively share and receive feedback with each other.\n Ultimately, understanding your new partner\u2019s unique style and how you\u2019re similar (and different) can help you work together more efficiently, make faster decisions and build quick momentum.\n  Acquisitions signal that a significant threshold of success has been crossed for companies on either side of the deal. To acquire or be acquired, companies must be doing  something right and it\u2019s essential to identify the strengths within both organizations that have reaped such rewards. Combining the elements of each team that fosters an overall synergy while also protecting the unique areas is key when joining forces.\n For example, Auth0\u2019s collaborative culture has already helped Okta reignite its startup spirit. It\u2019s no easy task maintaining the same scrappy energy from the early days when we were pursuing our first 10 customers (we\u2019re now over 14,000), but Auth0 has introduced a new perspective on innovation while still allowing room to retain our respective brands and individual strengths. Auth0 is a brand beloved by developers, and its remote-first nature has also helped us navigate a dynamic work environment this year. Leveraging the strengths of the acquired company helps push your growth forward in new areas.\n  In the early stages of an acquisition, success depends on intentional and frequent communication with your new partner and team. Keep meetings and check-ins frequent, both with new leaders and with your broader employee base.\n This year, we\u2019ve regularly held full company and integrated all-hands meetings, and we\u2019ve made these meetings intentional and transparent. We format the agendas around decisions we\u2019ve made, things that won\u2019t change and what\u2019s undecided as a way to keep employees in the know while staying honest about what we\u2019re still figuring out. In any acquisition, discussions on office spaces, merged benefits and team integration timelines will inevitably arise, and giving employees an open line to ask questions and share concerns goes a long way in creating clarity and building trust.\n Acquisitions can test your team\u2019s strength and threaten existing close-knit cultures, so it takes purposeful communication to keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.\n It\u2019s worth the energy spent to make the partnership successful; Eugenio and I have worked together for less than a year, and we\u2019ve already benefited greatly from each other\u2019s perspectives and background as we move forward in this next chapter.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7528\u4e8e,navigate,\u9886\u5bfc", "title": "4\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bfc\u822a\u5458\u989d\u8ffd\u52a0\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t4 ways to navigate a post-acquisition partnership\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/4-ways-to-navigate-a-post-acquisition-partnership/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7528\u4e8e", "navigate", "\u9886\u5bfc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d22d72d6577d5d52418fe3730db12048.jpg", "infoid": 1072513, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u597d\u5947\u7684\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6Danielle Baskin\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u670d\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff08\u5982\u84dd\u8272\u652f\u7968\u5bb6\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u5632\u7b11\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u53d8\u6210\u5b9e\u9645\u516c\u53f8\uff08\u5982\u54c1\u724c\u6c34\u679c\uff09\u3002\u5979\u5230\u8fbe\u5723\u4f55\u585e\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u5927\u697c\uff0c\u5728\u62d6\u8f66\u7684\u624b\u63d0\u7bb1\uff0c\u5356\u8d43\u7269\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6885\u5c14\uff1a\u91d1\u53d1\u5047\u53d1\uff0c\u7ea2\u8272\u53e3\u7ea2\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u7684\u9ad8\u9886\u548c\u8840\u6db2\u80fd\u91cf\u996e\u6599\u3002\n\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u88ab\u7092\u4f5c\u6240\u5305\u56f4 - \u50cf\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5179\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u50cf\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b59\u5b50\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u5979\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53\u4ed6\u5728Theranos\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b59\u5b50\u6cf0\u52d2\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5c14\u8328\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u6000\u7591\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6b63\u5728\u9610\u8ff0Theranos\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u65af\u79d1\u8328\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u3002\n\u201c\u4ed6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u5728\u505a\u751f\u610f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u5b9a\u7f6a\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u5e73\u5eb8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u8ddf\u968f\u6211\u7684\u672c\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u201d\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u5728\u644a\u4f4d\u8bf4\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba9\u5979\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u798f\u5c14\u65af\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8001\u4f34\u4fa3\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u72af\u4e0b\u4e86\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u662f\u771f\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5979\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u7f6a\u6b3a\u9a97\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00\u4e5f\u5bf9Theranos\u5ba2\u6237\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u663e\u7740\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "note_en": "One of those curious onlookers was  Danielle Baskin, a San Francisco-based artist who often pokes fun at tech culture through elaborate pranks (like  Blue Check Homes) that sometimes turn into actual companies (like  Branded Fruit). She arrived at the courthouse in San Jose with a suitcase in tow, selling bootleg Holmes merch: blonde wigs, red lipstick, black turtlenecks and blood energy drinks.\n In the long cold morning outside the San Jose courthouse, I vended Elizabeth Holmes costumes out of a suitcase for anyone in the trial line.  pic.twitter.com/ITaneixBu0\n It was a joke, mocking the absurdity of the fact that someone on trial for fraud has \u201cstans\u201d who call themselves \u201c Holmies.\u201d But as Baskin watched Holmes\u2019 third day of testimony, she shared a key insight about how Theranos got so out of control.\n \u201cComing out of the Holmes trial, I think one of my biggest pieces of advice to startup founders is to have friends,\u201d Baskin  tweeted after court adjourned. \u201cYou need people in your life you enjoy hanging out with that say things like \u2018lol what are you talking about\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s a bad idea\u2019 when you say weird shit.\u201d\n  In his opening statement of the case, federal prosecutor Robert Leach described how Holmes constructed a company with a $10 billion valuation based on technology that was dangerously faulty, at best. He said that one of Holmes\u2019 techniques was to rely on \u201c false and misleading\u201d media coverage of Theranos to secure funding from investors. Holmes was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes and Inc. Magazine, and she was celebrated as one of TIME\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in 2015, lauded as a \u201ctech visionary.\u201d It made sense that people believed her vision when so many powerful people and institutions said she was the next Steve Jobs.\n  \u201cWhen I was introduced to Elizabeth by [former Secretary of State] George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate\u2019s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground,\u201d Henry Kissinger  wrote in the TIME 100 blurb about Holmes. \u201cElizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference.\u201d\n Kissinger went on to call Holmes a \u201cformidable advocate\u201d who was \u201con the verge of achieving her vision.\u201d But already, a level of uncertainty bubbled around Theranos. \u201cOthers will judge the technical aspects of Theranos, but the social implications are vast,\u201d Kissinger wrote in the final line of the blurb.\n Holmes was surrounded by hype \u2014 investors like George Shultz treated her like another grandchild. So when his grandson Tyler Shultz, who worked at Theranos, told him that he suspected Holmes was lying about the efficacy of Theranos\u2019 technology, the senior Shultz didn\u2019t believe him.\n \u201cElizabeth is a very, very charismatic person,\u201d Tyler Shultz said to  CBS News this week. \u201cWhen she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.\u201d\n  Tyler Shultz became the first whistleblower for Theranos, but at great personal and financial cost \u2014 in his audio-memoir \u201cThicker than Water,\u201d he discussed being threatened by high-profile lawyers like David Boies and being followed by  private investigators. But Shultz told a brief, yet poignant anecdote in his memoir about attending family dinners with his grandfather, who always invited Holmes and even hosted her thirtieth birthday party.\n \u201cThere was a weird situation where my parents kept telling [Holmes] to invite her parents, and they just kind of assumed that she did, and then my grandparents were talking to Elizabeth\u2019s parents on the phone, and Elizabeth\u2019s parents were completely unaware she was having a thirtieth birthday party, so it didn\u2019t seem she was very close with her parents at all,\u201d Shultz recalled. Throughout the trial, Holmes was usually seen clutching her mom\u2019s hand \u2014 but per Shultz\u2019s memory, they weren\u2019t all that close at the time of her crimes.\n Shultz goes on to describe the attendees of her birthday party: He says that he and Holmes\u2019 brother were the only people under 30, and the next youngest person was Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, who was almost 50 \u2014 he met Holmes when she was 18 and he was 37. They dated in secret for more than 10 years, unbeknownst to most Theranos employees and investors. Holmes moved in with Balwani in 2005, soon after she dropped out of Stanford.\n \u201cHe impacted everything about who I was and I don\u2019t fully understand that,\u201d Holmes testified.\n Holmes tearfully explained in court that Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her throughout their relationship. She said that he controlled what she ate, when she slept and how she behaved.\n \u201cHe told me that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished by my mediocrity, and that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,\u201d Holmes said on the stand.\n  Her defense submitted as evidence two documents that showed how Holmes was being controlled by Balwani: one was a schedule of her  daily routine, while another set  instructions for how she behaved. These guidelines would help her \u201cbecome a new Elizabeth,\u201d Holmes said Balwani told her. One \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d in her instructions declared that she would never meet with anyone \u2014 especially direct reports \u2014 for longer than five minutes unless she had written down a clear agenda for the meeting. According to the documents, her lifestyle was monastic: waking up at 4 A.M., praying, mediating, exercising, only eating certain foods and never doing anything for recreation.\n Holmes\u2019 schedule became a bit of a meme, with some journalists even  trying out her schedule for clicks \u2014 but the reality is much darker than that. It may be difficult to take Holmes\u2019 account of abuse seriously, since she\u2019s famously a liar and was just convicted of criminal fraud \u2014 but these documents, if legitimate, show a woman whose every action was being controlled by an older partner and business associate.\n \u201cHe said I needed to spend all of my time on the business, and that I should only be spending time with people who could help the business to be successful, that I needed to be working seven days a week, and I needed to be only doing things that could contribute to making the company successful,\u201d Holmes testified.\n In this context, Shultz\u2019s account of Holmes thirtieth birthday party makes more sense. She was so committed to building Theranos that she didn\u2019t seem to have any friends or hobbies, nor did she communicate enough with her parents to invite them to her birthday party.\n \u201cSunny would get very upset if I was with my family, because he said it was a distraction to the business,\u201d Holmes said in trial. Her defense referenced a  text from Balwani from Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, which said: \u201cWhen ur family is here, I feel lonely bcz u spend a total of 10 seconds with me a day.\u201d\n Maybe if Holmes had friends to confide in, someone would have told her that she was going too far by stretching the truth with investors, or that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to deliver unreliable blood test results to patients, even if her boyfriend-slash-COO said to do so. But by design, there was no one for the single-minded entrepreneur to talk to.\n  This is not to exonerate Holmes of her crimes. It can be true that she was abused by a controlling, manipulative, older partner, yet it can simultaneously be true that she committed fraud. Plus, even though she was not convicted of defrauding patients, her lies caused significant distress to Theranos customers who were given alarmingly false blood test results.\n We talk a lot about what the tech industry learned from Theranos, but we gloss over something so simple: Startup founders need to have a life outside of their job.\n We valorize founders like Elizabeth Holmes who are so dedicated to their vision that they will make huge sacrifices, abandoning their social lives to build their companies. But this isolating form of hustle culture doesn\u2019t usually breed success \u2014 it breeds burnout at best, and millions of dollars of criminal fraud at worst.\n If you\u2019re a startup founder, you\u2019re probably not the next Elizabeth Holmes. But if you just do normal things like, I don\u2019t know, see a gosh darn movie with some friends (COVID permitting), maybe you\u2019ll spare yourself from making some short-sighted mistakes.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:16:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "theranos,learn,\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af", "title": "\u4eceTheranos\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u3002", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tWhat\u2019s left to learn from Theranos?

The current boom in COVID cases is a huge bummer, but perhaps this is the last year we\u2019ll have to drag ourselves back to productivity under the specter of lockdowns, mass death and a lack of hugs. I hope so.\n Regardless, today we have a lot of fun stuff that should keep your mind off the state of the world for a few minutes.\n  Kicking off today, let\u2019s talk about Liquid Death. The excellently named company  kills thirst with  water, hence its name. That\u2019s really the company in a nutshell. Liquid Death sells water in a can, a business around which it has tailored an anti-plastic stance and a general heavy metal vibe. It\u2019s neat.\n But Liquid Death  also raised $75 million this week, which has me wondering why everything is so expensive to build these days. Why does a water company need to raise a whole pre-seed fund in a single investment? What does it need the money for? Research? It\u2019s selling water!\n There was a general perspective a few years ago that it was cheaper than ever to build a startup. With off-the-shelf software, cloud computing and modern fintech back ends, putting together the building blocks of modern business was becoming faster and less expensive. Apart from the high costs of hiring software developers, it seemed that startups would be able to do more with less.\n And yet. Startups are raising more money than ever. The Exchange is diving into venture capital data next week, but it\u2019s clear that the venture and startup classes are still moving funds around with great relish. So much so that Liquid Death has raised over $130 million to date,  per Crunchbase data.\n Square the circle of lower startup costs, and mega-rounds for me if you can. Are we seeing marketing spend raised through equity capital sources? If so, that makes me worry a bit!\n (Note that Liquid Death could be a kickass business with great margins and lovely economics; I don\u2019t know its numbers. But why does it need $75 million if it\u2019s in such good shape? What are we missing here?)\n  From deep in the notes docs, a brief note on  Level. Level is a company that  I covered back in February of 2021. The company had just closed a $1.5 million round for work we described as bringing \u201ccredit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the advance.\u201d\n It was a neat model, as lending based on assets over cash flow is a bit silly in a world where lots of folks work but don\u2019t live asset-heavy lifestyles. (That\u2019s a polite way of dissing NIMBY boomers, of course).\n Anyway, Level raised another round as 2021 closed, this time a $7 million Series A. Anthos Capital led the funding, with NextView Ventures and other prior inventors also kicking in cash. The capital came after the company grew its size by \u201c10x,\u201d per its own data.\n What I find most notable in the Level news item is not that the company raised more money \u2014 more that its goal set is super big. Per  the company, it wants to build a \u201cfinancial OS for microbusinesses.\u201d\n I dig that because tiny businesses are not the sorts of companies that get lots of attention from traditional financial institutions. Fintech should be, in my view, a method of applying tech to break down walls and bring more value to more folks. Level seems to be working along those lines, while also building a venture-ready business. Neat!\n  On the heels of news that a16z has  put together $9 billion in new funds for venture, growth and biotech investing it\u2019s easy to forget that there are smaller funds in the market as well. And some that are quite new, in fact.\n On the biotech front  PsyMed Ventures is busy raising a $25 million fund, the first close of which ($8 million) is in the bank. I chatted with the group Friday to dig in a bit more to their model.\n First, basics. PsyMed has three investing partners:  Dina Burkitbayeva,  Greg Kubin\u00a0and  Matias Serebrinsky. As you can work out from its first fund size target, it will be investing on the earlier side of things in the psychedelic medical space, along with a few related areas. The group isn\u2019t new to working together, having previously formed an investing group using AngelList tech to invest around $15 million to date.\n A few thoughts about PsyMed. First, I am hype that we\u2019re expanding the boundaries of what we\u2019re testing for medical use. Prudishness in my home country has held back this sort of work, to our detriment. Second, the biotech investing space is interesting to me as the companies founded go public a lot earlier than what we tend to see in, say, the enterprise software market. So, you get to see more about companies, more quickly and more frequently.\n For venture investors in biotech companies, this can also mean earlier liquidity possibilities than what is often seen in today\u2019s unicorn era.\n Talking with Burkitbayeva, Kubin and Serebrinsky gave me the impression that we\u2019re nearing a confluence point in terms of regulatory, scientific and medical progress that could unlock a lot of neat new treatments for some sticky human matters. Things like PTSD, treatment-resistant depression and my personal favorite, substance-use disorder.\n All this is to say that I\u2019ll be keeping out an eye for where the group puts its new fund to work and how quickly they can boost early-stage pharma startups into the public markets. Here\u2019s to reading more biotech S-1s this year and next, I suppose!\n  And that\u2019s what I have for now \u2014 don\u2019t forget that  Equity is back to its regular thrice-weekly cadence next week, so I\u2019ll chat with you on your podcasting app of choice in short order!

The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.\n   Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best \u2014 the ones who bet on you earlier than others \u2014 are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn\u2019t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.\n Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator  changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.\n \u201cWe have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,\u201d the  accelerator wrote in a post then. \u201cIn addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.\n \u201cSaid simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668,accelerators,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u542f\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u5668''\u503c\u6dfb\u52a0'\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\u5237\u65b0", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tStartup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a0\u901f\u5668", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e306d0d4b5502e34e4dd43d93da7faae.jpg", "infoid": 1072510, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2020\u5e744\u6708\uff0cNextview VC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u539a\u5b9e\u4e2d\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u800cy\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u548c500\u540d\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u5386\u53f2\u5b75\u5316\u5668\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u6279\u6b21\u5b8c\u5168\u9065\u8fdc\u548c\u6284\u5199\u961f\u5458\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u8c03\u6574\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5077\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u9884\u5148\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\nNextview\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u53d1\u5c04\u623f\u5b50\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u6837\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u8d8a\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff1a\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cBankaya\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaCeo Mauricio Cordero\uff0cRam\u00f3nChedraui\u548c\u8fed\u6208\u00b7\u74e6\u5c14\u52a0\u65af\u58f0\u79f0\u4ed6\u4eec\u964d\u843d\u4e8645\u4e07\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u542f\u52a8\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "note_en": "In April 2020,  NextView VC launched its debut accelerator in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.\n Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator  is launching its third cohort with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.\n  The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh\u2019s perspective is that the cash will \u201carm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.\u201d Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups \u2014 which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.\n \u201cIt just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,\u201d she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.\n Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they\u2019re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders  more activation energy when they need it most.\n And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThe way we engage with every company is \u2026 \u2018OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,\u2019 so we don\u2019t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.\u201d\n NextView isn\u2019t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.\n Even in a world where  capital is a commodity, investors are preparing \u2014 perhaps even more so \u2014 to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. \u201cValue add\u201d chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they\u2019re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That\u2019s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.\n For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column:  Startup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh.\n In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll dig into CES 2022 trends, a fintech startup with a contrarian view on CAC and a feature on the future of Black Girls Code.

All of our CES coverage  can be found at this nifty link, but I recommend starting with Brian Heater\u2019s  CES 2022 themes just to wet your palate.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Stand out announcements so far include BMW\u2019s plan  to turn cars into rolling cinemas, a  mission to scale paper-based tooth brushes and, on a more serious note, a statement on the  importance of a cushion that tracks your child\u2019s temperature.\u200b\u200b\n     Bankaya! As our own Mary Ann Azevedo reports, this Mexican fintech is opting for a non-traditional strategy when it comes to acquiring customers: going offline. The new, early-stage company is targeting 50 million underbanked individuals with face-to-face advertising: think street sales and debit card kiosks strategically placed in vaccination centers.\n Here\u2019s what to know:  Just one year after launch, Bankaya co-founders CEO Mauricio Cordero, Ram\u00f3n Chedraui and Diego Vargas claim they landed 450,000 customers. And, adding to their counterintuitive strategy, the company is fully bootstrapped to date.\n     Over the holidays, news broke that Black Girls Code co-founder and  CEO Kimberly Bryant was \u201csuspended indefinitely\u201d from the nonprofit organization she launched nearly a decade ago.
