Swedish VC Alfv\u00e9n &amp; Didrikson is leading the round on the equity raise, and British investment company Pollen Street Capital is providing a senior-secured asset-backed debt facility, which likely means Onto\u2019s fleet of over 3,000 electric vehicles will be used as collateral. Onto did not disclose how much of the round came from equity versus debt.\n The car-as-a-service company is finding that sweet spot between society\u2019s growing adoration for subscription services and EV adoption driven by legislation. The U.K., like many other countries, is banning internal combustion engine new car sales by 2030, so more people are looking for ways to make the switch to electric.\n  That shift from gas to electric is accelerating. New registrations of all-electric  and plug-in hybrid vehicles had a market share of 10.7% in the UK in 2020,  according to the\u00a0Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. That\u2019s up from 6.6% in 2019. The organization noted that battery and plug-in hybrid electric cars together accounted for more than one in 10 registrations, up from around one in 30 in 2019.\n Buying a car is often considered one of the worst investments you can make; it\u2019s an asset that both depreciates and costs money the moment a customer buys it through financing. Yet there are millions of new car sales each year in the U.K. With a market size that large, Onto founder and CEO Rob Jolly thinks there\u2019s plenty of room to make the subscriptions business a sustainable and profitable one.\n \u201cOur total cost of ownership is very comparable with having your own car but you don\u2019t have to worry about charging fees or servicing,\u201d Jolly told TechCrunch. \u201cThe ballpark cost is \u00a3330 (~$450) per month. There\u2019s no upfront deposit, which is huge. What we\u2019re trying to do is remove all the barriers and actually make it easier for people to recognize that having a car on subscription is actually easier and more affordable than having a petrol or diesel car.\u201d\n A brief glance at  Onto\u2019s website shows that the  \u00a3330 ballpark is only accurate for certain cars at the lower range of the company\u2019s fleet. The middle range could be a Peugeot at \u00a3450 (~$622) or a Hyundai at \u00a3560 (~$775), and high range could be a Jaguar or Tesla at \u00a31299 (~$1,800).\n If we crunch the numbers for leasing a Hyundai Kona, for example, it\u2019s not clear that Onto\u2019s service is cheaper.  A lease for this vehicle in the U.K. could cost a customer annually  \u00a39,888 over a four year period with a down payment of \u00a32,152. The  average cost of insurance for EVs in the U.K. is \u00a32,264. The  average person travels 35 miles by personal car per day, and the Hyundai Kona has a range of about 245 miles, so you really only need to fully charge it once a week. The  average cost of charging the battery is about  \u00a310, so you\u2019re looking at about \u00a3520 per year on charging. Maintenance for electric vehicles is minimal and usually included in a lease agreement. Tally it up and you get a number in the ballpark of \u00a315,000 (~$20,700) over four years. At \u00a3560 per month, Onto\u2019s service would cost a customer \u00a326,880 (~$37,145) over the same four year period. When factoring in U.K.\u2019s plug-in car grant, you could  buy the car for \u00a327,950 (~$38,620).\n It\u2019s certainly more of a high-end service, and the premium is on the convenience and flexibility. Onto\u2019s pricing is certainly comparable to other EV subscription businesses, like  Steer in North America. Flux, in San Francisco, is markedly cheaper, offering Teslas for $600 per month, but it doesn\u2019t include the \u201call-inclusive\u201d services like road tax and insurance that Onto does. Granted, in the U.K., EV owners don\u2019t actually have to pay for road tax.\n Among other things Onto says are included in a subscription are home delivery on its vehicles and access to free charging via network partners like BP Pulse, Tesla Supercharger, InstaVolt and as of earlier this year   Shell Recharge . The company has partnerships with 10 car brands and rents out 12 different EV models, and is in the process of firming up more automaker partnerships. Jolly wouldn\u2019t share specifics on future partnerships. However, updates to the company\u2019s website, which shows most recent additions of car models to book, suggest Volkswagen and its 2021 e-Up! will be the latest.\n  Jolly said it might take a while for the masses to catch on to both EVs and subscriptions, but he\u2019s confident that offering customers a white-glove service that can be canceled anytime makes the choice as easy as possible. In fact, Jolly said Onto is very nearly profitable, and that\u2019s evident in the company\u2019s plans to double its team size, which is currently at 70 staff members, every three to six months.\n Onto\u2019s lead investor, Alfv\u00e9n &amp; Didrikson (A&amp;D), which usually invests in more SaaS businesses, has a long term investing structure. This has allowed the VC to take bigger bets on businesses like Onto\u2019s that requires large upfront costs, according to Tiyam Afshari, partner at A&amp;D.\n \u201cWe\u2019re happy to take those bets that we see are transforming an industry,\u201d Afshari told TechCrunch. \u201cSubscription as a form of ownership when it comes to cars is just a no-brainer if you look at all the hassle that comes from owning a car. So we feel quite strongly that the subscription model should and will grow to quite a significant part of the financing industry, and Onto is in a prime position to capitalize on that.\u201d\n Given its lead investor\u2019s long term bet on Onto, it\u2019s perceivable that the company might look towards Sweden as it seeks to expand outside the U.K. After all, the Scandinavians have taken to EVs faster than other countries, and another EV subscription service in Norway,   imove, recently raised $19 million in a Series A.\n For many users, the EV subscription service isn\u2019t just about not having to worry about things like road tax, auto insurance and servicing. It\u2019s about the flexibility of keeping up with the latest EV models.\n \u201cThe iPhone has updates every year because the tech is improving and the battery life gets slightly better,\u201d said Jolly. \u201cThe same thing is going to happen and already is happening with EVs. We\u2019re seeing that this is car ownership now for millennials. They can swap in for the latest and greatest car when it comes out, even if it\u2019s just a car with 30 miles extra range. And that\u2019s hugely prevalent within our customers.\u201d\n For Simon Smith of East Devon, 32, it\u2019s never been about trying out the newest car. He joined Onto\u2019s service in 2019 for ethical and financial reasons, and has found the different iterations of the Renault Zoe ZE40 to suit his needs entirely.\n \u201cIt\u2019s still the most affordable way for me to drive electric,\u201d Smith told TechCrunch. \u201cI really wanted to go electric, but there wasn\u2019t any obvious way of doing that or making that happen in 2019, and I would say it\u2019s still fairly limited in the U.K. If you wanted to go electric, you\u2019d probably have to save up a good deal of money even to buy second hand, and then you just wouldn\u2019t have the flexibility.\u201d\n Smith says using Onto is a good approach for people who want to try before they buy, as well, which is no doubt at least partly why automakers like Tesla, Hyundai, Jaguar, Audi and Peugeot are interested in partnering up.\n \u201cAgain, it\u2019s an enormous market, of which we can kind of sit hand-in-hand with the car manufacturers and dealerships and the other aspects where we are one of a number of methods people have of acquiring the car now,\u201d said Jolly.\n Existing investors Legal and General, Campden Hill Capital and JamJar also participated in the equity round, alongside new investments from TotalEnergies Ventures, Vlerick Group, Dutch insurer Achmea Innovation Fund and the family office of Jim O\u2019Neill.

country\u2019s GDP. Last year, the coronavirus pandemic threatened the existence of some of these SMEs, and its effects linger as owners worry about revenue, sales and cash flow.\n Since launching in 2013, South African fintech  Yoco has positioned itself as the go-to platform to access offline payments among merchants in the country. Today, the company is announcing $83 million in Series C funding to scale offline and online offerings and expand to new markets.\n  Despite South Africa\u2019s high card and mobile penetration rates of over 70%, the country\u2019s SMEs still struggle to accept cards. Yoco\u2019s portable card machines have proved masterful in solving this problem; when TechCrunch  covered the company three years ago after its $16 million Series B raise, it had little over 30,000 merchants using its platform. Now, that number has quintupled.\n  As Yoco grew exponentially in providing offline payments, it built an online offering. After being in beta for a while, the rollout came right on time some days into South Africa\u2019s lockdown in March last year. This way, South African merchants could continue accepting payments on the platform.\n \u201cWe want to offer whatever payment methods our merchants need. And we did start in the in-person payment space, focusing on terminals, which was where the biggest demand was,\u201d chief business officer  Carl Wazen said. \u201cBut the pandemic, which had a devastating effect on so many businesses that relied on in-person trade, accelerated the need for businesses to accept payments online.\u201d\n During the height of the lockdowns in South Africa, sentiment across SMEs owners on a scale of -100 to 100 dropped to an all-time low of -12 in Q2 2020, according to Yoco\u2019s small business pulse monitor. It has since improved following the easing of the lockdowns, allowing businesses to move more freely and continue in-person payments. As a result, Yoco\u2019s online payments account for a minute part of the transactions made on the platform.\n But that\u2019s not to say people are transacting with cash. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite, according to Wazen. Wazen says one post-pandemic behavior he noticed was that once the lockdown was lifted, people came back to make in-person payments in an accelerated way because they stopped using cash. \u201cRecent consumer behavior shows a shift away from cash, and businesses have to rapidly adapt to this change. This presents a huge opportunity, and it is our mission to support that transition,\u201d he added.\n Earlier this year, chief executive  Katlego Maphai said Yoco was looking to expand its services into other aspects of digital payments. He listed mobile money, QR payments and electronic funds transfer (ETF) as offerings in its pipeline. Wazen corroborated this, but didn\u2019t provide an update about where the company is with these offerings. He did mention, however, that the company is still very much a card-focused payment provider.\n Yoco\u2019s strategy as the foremost card payments provider in South Africa lies in creating access and removing barriers to adopting digital financial services. The company does that by focusing on product capabilities that Wazen claims are the most comprehensive for small and medium businesses. He adds that in terms of market presence, Yoco is also the easiest for merchants to access services through different channels seamlessly.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got a brand that is recognized now. That\u2019s how we win and it\u2019s about staying as focused as possible on that part of the market that, in our opinion, people like other competitors are not focused on enough.\u201d\n South Africa has over 6 million small businesses that still transact only in cash; this provides a huge opportunity for Yoco. According to the company, the number of small businesses that were fully cashless jumped 300% from March to July 2020. Yoco currently serves 150,000 of these businesses and adds over 500 merchants per day. The company claims to be processing more than $1 billion in card payments per year, and in its six years of existence, it has processed over $2 billion in card payments.\n  Yoco has raised a total of $107 million. The company\u2019s Series C investment is the largest of its kind in South Africa and one of the largest for any African fintech (third only to  Flutterwave and  Chipper Cash). Wazen also claims it is the largest by any small business-focused payments platform in the Middle East and Africa.\n Yoco is currently one of the most valuable startups on the continent, and as a fintech startup, it comes as no surprise. The sector continues to dominate startup venture capital funding in Africa while its heavy hitters bring first-time investors to the continent.\n In Yoco\u2019s case, it\u2019s the lead investor in this round,  Dragoneer Investment Group. The fund has famously backed fintech giants like Chime, Klarna, Nubank, Mercado Libre and Square.\n Other investors that participated include new investors Breyer Capital, HOF Capital, The Raba Partnership, 4DX Ventures and TO Ventures; and existing investors Partech, Velocity Capital Fintech Ventures, Orange Ventures and Quona Capital. Current and former executives from global tech companies such as Coinbase, Revolut, Spotify and Gojek took part as well.\n \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to partner with the Yoco team,\u201d Christian Jensen, co-head of private investments at Dragoneer, said in a statement. \u201cAt Dragoneer, we look for great teams that are building durable businesses with wonderful economic models, and that is exactly what we\u2019ve found at Yoco. Yoco is already beloved by customers, and the product roadmap that the company is investing behind will drive even more value for merchants. While there is tremendous room for continued growth domestically, the opportunity for Yoco goes well beyond South Africa.\u201d\n There are three core enablers to Yoco\u2019s thriving business, Wazen pointed out. First is its product capabilities, second is its platform and third is its market presence. This investment will be there to accelerate all three. Yoco is transitioning from a pure payment acceptance play into a full financial ecosystem on the product side. The platform play will see Yoco continue to integrate and take advantage of regulatory easing vertically, and Yoco is deepening its market presence in South Africa.\n While Wazen believes Yoco has barely scratched the surface in South Africa, he\u2019s looking forward to replicating its growth in other parts of Africa and the Middle East. With over 100 million SMEs transacting in cash across both regions, Yoco plans to reach at least a million within the next four years.\n To accomplish this, Yoco is increasing its team by 200 people remotely and across its offices in Cape Town and Amsterdam within the next year. The company is also tapping into a current trend that has seen African soonicorns and unicorns hire former top employees from global companies to scale theirs to new heights. While it doesn\u2019t mention names, some of Yoco\u2019s new hires include a former VP of product at Monzo, a former product marketing director at Paypal and a former head of communications at Uber. The company has also brought on board a new chairman, Juan Fuentes, the former managing director of fintech unicorn Pagseguro.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 16:03:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

raised $30M of Series B funding in order to further accelerate Matrixdevelopment and improve Element, the flagship Matrix app. The round is led byour friends at  Protocol Labs and  Metaplanet,the fund established by Jaan Tallinn (co-founder ofSkype and Kazaa). Both Protocol Labs and Metaplanet are spectacularly onboard our decentralised communication quest, and you couldn&#39;t really ask fora better source of funding to help take Matrix to the next level. Thank youfor believing in Matrix and leading Element&#39;s latest funding!\n You can read all about it from the Element perspective over at the Element Blog,but suffice it to say that this is enormous news for the Matrix ecosystem as awhole. In addition to transforming the Element app, on the Matrix side thismeans that there is now concrete funding secured to:\n finish building out  P2P Matrixand get it live (including finishing Dendrite, given our P2P work builds on Dendrite!)\n Obviously this is in addition to all the normal business-as-usual work goingon in terms of:\n lots of little long-overdue fun bits and pieces (yes, custom emoji, we&#39;re looking at you).\n If you&#39;re wondering whether Protocol Labs&#39; investment means that we&#39;ll beseeing more overlap between  IPFS and Matrix, then yes -where it makes tech sense to do so, we&#39;re hoping to work more closelytogether; for instance collaborating with the libp2p team on our P2P work(we still need to experiment properly with gossipsub!), or perhaps giving MSC2706some attention. However, there are no plans to use cryptocurrency incentivesin Matrix or Element any time soon.\n So, exciting times ahead! We&#39;d like to inordinately thank everyone who hassupported Matrix over the years - especially our Patreon supporters, whosedonations pay for all the matrix.org infrastructure while inspiring others toopen their cheque books; the existing investors at Element(especially Notionand Automattic, who have come in again on this round); all the large scaleMatrix deployments out there which are effectively turning Matrix into anindustry (hello  gematik!) -and everyone who has ever run a Matrix server, contributed code, used thespec to make their own Matrix-powered creation, or simply chatted on Matrix.\n Needless to say, Matrix wouldn&#39;t exist without you: the protocol and networkwould have fizzled out long ago were it not for all the people supporting it(the matrix.org server can now see over 35.5M addressible users on thenetwork!) - and meanwhile the ever-increasing energy of the community and thecore team combines to keep the protocol advancing forwards faster than ever.\n We will do everything we possibly can to succeed in creating the long-awaitedsecure communication layer of the open Web, and we look forward to largeamounts of Element&#39;s new funding being directed directly into core Matrixdevelopment :)", "posttime": "2021-07-27 15:54:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "element,matrix", "title": "Element \u7b79\u96c6\u4e86 3000 \u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8 Matrix", "title_en": "Element raises $30M to boost Matrix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://matrix.org/blog/2021/07/27/element-raises-30-m-to-boost-matrix", "via": "", "real_tags": ["element", "matrix"]}]
