Nationwide expansion will begin in the following weeks.\n Hertz will offer Tesla Model 3, assumedly Standard Ran  ge Plus, for $334/week with plans available in the near future that will lower the price to $299 or less. Insurance and maintenance are both included. Drivers will have to currently maintain a 4.7 star rating and have completed at least 150 trips to be eligible for the program.\n Uber and Hertz have partnered since 2016 to provide drivers with vehicle rental options. With this partnership, Hertz will kick off the program by providing up to 50,000 vehicles by 2023 exclusively to drivers. If successful, the program could expand to 150,000 Teslas during the next three years. Hertz pointed out that these ambitions could be affected by factors outside of its control, such as semiconductor chip shortages or other constraints.\n Uber CEO Dara Khosrowhshahi issued a statement to CNN at the time of release that he hopes drivers who rent Tesla\u2019s through Hertz will eventually end up buying them in an effort to accelerate Uber\u2019s sustainability efforts.\n Uber is additionally offering a $1-a-ride bonus of up to $4,000 per year for Uber drivers who rent a Tesla through Hertz. Less than 10% of Uber drivers currently rent a vehicle.\n The rollout will be completed in 2023, with up to 50,000 Tesla\u2019s available for rent to Uber drivers. These Tesla\u2019s will be taken out of the 100,000 total purchase commitment that Herz made earlier this week, which pushed Tesla to a one-trillion dollar valuation.\n  Uber\u2019s CEO is completely spot-on: once drivers experience a Tesla, which is the goal of this program, they won\u2019t want to go back to driving an internal-combustion engine vehicle. This won\u2019t be a difficult sell either, as a recently-conducted survey of 6,000 Uber drivers found that 47% of drivers want their next vehicle to be fully electric.\n We do have to ponder the economics, as for many this will be a way to trial a Tesla as a taxi without the necessary commitments. $334/week, with a goal of getting prices to $299/week with volume, may sound slightly expensive at its surface but nonetheless carries a number of benefits along with the lack of a commitment.\n It is currently possible to finance a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus with $0 down for $789/month, or lease it for $672/month. This is with a market-adjusted starting price of $43,990 \u2014 up $7,000 from February of this year. While both figures ultimately represent a lower cost, Hertz is including all insurance and maintenance. We\u2019d have to presume that mileage limits will be high, or nonexistent, as well. There is also a variable of whether Hertz plans to enable Full Self-Driving Capability at a cost of $10,000 per Tesla, although we would assume they aren\u2019t planning to do so.\n Long-term it absolutely does become more cost-effective to purchase a Tesla, as on the used market they hold value well even with extremely high miles. Rental fees of ~ $1200/month are a sunken cost, whereas there is added utility to financing a new or used Tesla which includes a potential to use the vehicle on Tesla\u2019s own autonomous taxi network once it\u2019s ready. It\u2019s also possible to sell it once it\u2019s no longer in commission.\n Model 3 already lends itself to being the perfect electric taxi, so making it more accessible for Uber drivers will lead to a big push towards sustainability as well as increased driver satisfaction. We would recommend that drivers consider buying a Tesla, either new or used, to make it more economical over time \u2014 which is the goal here for both companies.\n  Interested in Listing or Upgrading YOUR Tesla?

This post is an attempt to remedy that.\n In 1929,  Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding. He observed that light emitted from distant celestial objects was redder than expected, due to the downward shift in frequency as their light receded from Earth.\u00a0And the further away the objects were, the proportionately greater their redshift. Since objects were getting further apart from each other, figures like  Lema\u00eetre and  Friedmann reasoned that there must have been some point in the past at which the whole universe was compressed into a single point.\n Embarrassingly, linear extrapolation implied an age of the universe of 1-2 billion years, shorter than the known age of the oldest rocks on Earth. One of the difficulties is that expansion flipped from slowing down to speeding up after several billion years, and this requires complex observations of supernovae to account for. In any case, astronomers eventually measured the age of the universe at about 13.8 billion years. This implies three tempting definitions for the observable universe \u2014 that part of the whole universe which we can theoretically see \u2014 only one of which is correct.\n Universe age in light-years: You would be forgiven for thinking that the observable universe is a sphere with a radius of 13.8 billion light-years centred on the Earth, since that\u2019s how long light has had to reach us.\u00a0However, this assumes the universe isn\u2019t expanding or contracting.\n The Hubble radius: Hubble found that the distance to a given galaxy was proportional to its recessional velocity, with a constant of proportionality now called the Hubble constant  H.\u00a0This implies there is a sphere past which everything is travelling away from us faster than the speed of light.\u00a0This is known as the Hubble sphere, and it has a radius of around 14.4 billion light-years.\n You may worry that this faster-than-light travel violates Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which says that nothing can travel faster than light.\u00a0However, what relativity says is that\u00a0matter\u00a0within space can\u2019t travel faster than light, but nothing about how fast space\u00a0itself\u00a0can travel.\n The Hubble sphere isn\u2019t the observable universe either.\u00a0The radius of the Hubble sphere will be given by\u00a0c/H, where  c is the speed of light.\u00a0And the Hubble constant is decreasing: the relative velocities of celestial objects are (on average) growing more slowly than the distances between them. Therefore the Hubble sphere is expanding.\u00a0If the Hubble sphere expands fast enough, light leaving an extremely distant object can get \u2018caught\u2019 and drop from the faster-than-light region outside the sphere to the slower-than-light region inside.\u00a0Once this light is within the Hubble sphere, it can make its way to Earth (this is explained well in  this video).\u00a0If you work out their present distance from us, it turns out that all\u00a0of the photons we receive from the first five billion years of the universe\u2019s existence were all caught by the Hubble sphere.\u00a0These objects were, are, and always will be travelling away from us faster than the speed of light!\n The particle horizon: The full extent of the observable universe is bounded by the\u00a0particle horizon, which is the region from which light has had time to reach us since the beginning of the universe, taking into account its expansion.\u00a0The particle horizon has a radius of 46.5 billion light-years, so the observable universe is 93 billion light-years across.\n The famous  cosmic microwave background is at the particle horizon, and its light has taken 13.8 billion years to reach us (the fact that it consists of microwaves is an extreme version of redshifting).\u00a0In the  jargon, the  proper distance (the actual distance not taking into account the expansion of the universe) is 46.5 billion light-years but the  comoving distance (taking account of expansion) is 13.8 billion years.\n The particle horizon limits how far in distance we can observe, while the Hubble sphere limits how far back in  time we can observe.\u00a0We could never\u00a0see objects outside the Hubble sphere\u00a0as they are now, no matter how long we waited.\u00a0Moreover, just as light can get caught in the Hubble sphere, the expansion of space can push light out of it.\u00a0Every second, 20,000 stars become newly unobservable from Earth.\u00a0In a few billion years, the observable universe will consist of only our  Local Group of a few dozen galaxies.\u00a0Future astronomers would gaze upon a barren universe.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 10:36:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89c2\u5bdf,observable,\u5b87\u5b99", "title": "\u6f84\u6e05\u201c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b87\u5b99\u201d\u5305\u62ec\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "Clarifying what the 'Observable Universe' includes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://samenright.com/2022/01/09/disambiguating-the-observable-universe/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c2\u5bdf", "\u5b87\u5b99"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072582, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u684c\u9762\u4e0a\u67e5\u770b\u6b64\u7ad9\u70b9\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9DMARC\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "note_en": "View this site on your desktop to get the full visual explanation on how DMARC works.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:44:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "dmarc,spf,\u67e5\u770b", "title": "\u770b\u770bDMARC\uff0cSPF\u548cDKIM\u5982\u4f55\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f", "title_en": "See how DMARC, SPF, and DKIM work interactively", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.learndmarc.com/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["dmarc", "spf", "\u67e5\u770b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "63a98cbd80d0907ccb96e8b98a63c103.jpg", "infoid": 1072581, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Iconic Comedian Bob Saget\u5728\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9152\u5e97\u623f\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u540e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\n\u7740\u540d\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u5728ABC SItcom\u5168\u623f\u5c4b\u53ca\u5176Netflix efreer House\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u7740\u540d\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u662f\u6700\u4e3a\u95fb\u540d\u7684\u804c\u4f4dDanny Tanner\u3002\u4ed6\u8fd8\u4ece1989\u5e74\u52301997\u5e74\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "note_en": "Iconic comedian Bob Saget has died after he was found unresponsive in a hotel room.\n  JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2013 Stand-up comedian, actor, television host and director Bob Saget has died at a hotel in Orlando,  according to the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n Hotel staff found Saget unresponsive in his room at the Ritz Carlton on Sunday afternoon around 4, according to police.

As talk of \u201cthe metaverse\u201d grows, and people float theories about owning items and cosmetic skins and being able to take between games, interest in what that means practically for gamers has lead to a wild array of theories, but they\u2019re largely pushed by people who know nothing about game development. So, as a developer, it falls to people like me who live and work in these spaces to share our knowledge, and so over the next couple of weeks, I\u2019ll attempt to do just that, so subscribe and stick around for the rest of the series.\n  The myth of \u2018storing an item\u2019 on the blockchain (or anywhere else) as an NFT (\u2190 You are Here)\n Thing is, being able to tell what someone owns in a game is a solved problem. APIs have been doing it for decades \u2014 that\u2019s how PSN and XBox Live tell games what people bought in their stores, and grant them access to stuff like games, or DLC. We\u2019ll dig into how that works in a later episode.\n The blockers to cross-game itemization are, and always have been, logical, technical, legal, and business issues.\n Before we start, I need to explain what an NFT is, and what it does.\n  At it\u2019s simplest form, an NFT is just a record in a kind of database. You can retrieve the wallet address that owns it, the contract address that created it, the transaction history of its previous owners and sales, and the contents itself, which are arbitrary. In most public use cases, the NFT contains  JSON \u2014 a structured text file containing data. It can execute arbitrary code or perform a function when certain conditions are met. Then it records the transaction on a blockchain. The NFT can never be edited or changed, and you can cryptographically prove that all transactions happened the way the blockchain says.\n You can think of it just like a database that anyone can read. If you don\u2019t understand why the kind of database a game uses is important, then this article is for you.\n   In this pitch, there are two games, and the concept is that Game A could store items people earn or buy in-game as an NFT on a blockchain, and then people who own it could use it in Game B.\n Some definitions: - Item: some in-game functional piece of gear, like a sword, gun, or armour. - Cosmetic: some non-functional appearance change, like a skin for an item. - Inventory: a collection of things you have, made up of both items and cosmetics.\n While there are many problems with this idea from the get-go, this article focuses on the idea that the NFT, or any off-platform storage, could contain an item in its entirety for use in another game, which it could load at will.\n To put names to it - here\u2019s one example I hear a lot.\n \u201cWith NFTs I could earn a rare sword in Diablo 3 and take it into Path of Exile!\u201d\n And there are fundamental problems with that idea, that are unrelated to blockchains or NFTs.\n You can\u2019t actually store the items or cosmetics themselves on the blockchain in a way that will let them be used automatically. They\u2019re big, complex, and games can\u2019t interpret them without a lot of manual work. In reality, if you were attempting to do this, the NFT would contain a string that uniquely represents them, the same ones the game uses internally, like \u201cWEAPON_ENERGY_SWORD_01\u201d, then it would be up to the other game to implement that in a way that can work with yours. This is how things like Twitch Prime drops are granted.\n Even if you could store the raw asset data and send it to the other game straight off the blockchain, the other game has to spend time and money implementing those items and cosmetics.\n To dig into these, we have to learn a little bit about how game assets are actually made, so let\u2019s start with some of the basics, and the processes that a human has to go through to take something out of one game, and put it in another.\n Since you can download assets from online stores and put them in games, you might think you can just export  meshes (what most people think of when you say a 3D model) between games as well. But the truth is much more complex, and simply put: no.\n  Game engines can\u2019t even agree on which way is up, let alone a myriad of other things. You cannot simply \u2018export\u2019 and \u2018import\u2019, let alone have that happen automatically without knowing the intricate details of how the asset was created, and what specific tasks need to be done to make it work in your game. These assets aren\u2019t just a model and textures - they all contain code of some sort that fundamentally ties them to the game they were created in. Even moving items or cosmetics between two games made in Unreal Engine is an extremely manual process, because they all depend on things in the codebase that don\u2019t exist in other games.\n At a high level, some of the things that can\u2019t be imported are:\n Behaviour. Every game has its own custom ways of storing and recalling that data. Even moving guns between two shooters can\u2019t be done programmatically without customizing the task. For example, one might store rate of fire as a \u2018rounds per second\u2019, and the other might store a \u2018delay between rounds\u2019. Others might use curves to represent ramp speed, while some might just use a number. Recoil might be a central library or a function per gun. You need to recode the objects.\n Audio. You could store wav files, but how they actually behave and produce sound are totally dependent on whatever audio middleware they might be using, like  WWise or  FMod. You need to reprogram the audio.\n VFX and Fabric. Many of the cool visuals that you see in a game are built off the same tools and plugins, and again, switching between games means losing those tools. You need to rebuild the behaviors in equivalent modules.\n Shaders. They\u2019re like tiny programs that you use to generate the look of a surface in a game. It\u2019s not as simple as just painting a surface with a texture, you code in how it handles reflections, how it emits light, what it does when you look at it. I\u2019ve written shaders that adjust colours depending on what\u2019s happening to the item, which refers back to the weapon code powering it, which can\u2019t work without bits of my core engine. Shaders are used to  simulate the liquid contents of bottles in Half-Life: Alyx. Some people use them to make it so text always faces the camera, which links back to the original font. So even the appearance of an item or cosmetic is likely to be tied to the internals of the game that created it. You need to rebuild these.\n Animation. In animation, you start with a mesh, and build out a rig for it, which you can roughly consider to be the skeletal structure that the body moves around. It sets the rules for the ranges of how bones can move, but also how bones pull on the rest of the character, like how if you push your hand forward, how your elbow also moves, and maybe your shoulder stretches out at full extension. So if you\u2019re moving a mesh that has a certain rig attached to it into a different engine that has a different rig, they\u2019re going to have different bones, with different rules. At a minimum, you\u2019ll have to go through something called Animation Retargeting in which you manually tell the game which bones in one rig correspond to the bones in a different one. You will need to manually reanimate or retarget.\n Procedural animation. Even after you\u2019ve done your retargeting, it\u2019s normal to need to make programmatic adjustments, with things like Control Rig.  This video from Epic shows Control Rig in action, and how despite having models and rigs for a gauntlet that\u2019s already compatible with the game engine, it needs additional manual work to be used on a Fortnite character to stop the gauntlet clipping through their hand, and sitting how it should. You need to reprogram this.\n Levels of detail. All of this is made more complex by that games all have different rules about what levels of complexity are shown at what draw distances. You might need to see all the details of a gun up close, but at 30 yards, perhaps it uses a simpler model to claw back some performance. Even simple 2D images like sprays or icons are not exempt from this. Mipmaps are a sequence of sequentially lower-resolution textures to be used at different distances, and it\u2019s likely that every game will be using slightly different rules. You need to regenerate the assets.\n QA. Adding items and cosmetics to games and their in-game data tables needs to be done  at build time, and be tested before you let players see it. And even if you could do all of this at run time, live, why would any game just  trust that some other game\u2019s stuff was going to go through this process and magically turn out production-ready?\n This is  not even close to the full list of problems; I\u2019ve stuck to the things that I think people who don\u2019t work on games will be able to understand easily. The systems that enable games to display moving, animated 3D objects go multiple layers deeper than this \u2014 mesh deformations as the rigs move, how much of the appearance comes from rendering and shading, which again, are both deeply tied to the game itself. One of my prototypes used anime-style cell-shaded characters, and their stylization had nothing to do with the character models; they got their look from a post-processing volume that encapsulated the Actor, which is something the engine provided.\n    Each game has its own processes (asset pipeline) that it goes through to manually take raw data like WAV files and meshes and turns them into functional things inside the game. So even  just having the raw assets doesn\u2019t help you. Converting them costs time, which costs money.\n So even if you were to arrange all this ahead of time for specific items, why would a game studio spend all that money and time to produce another game\u2019s items and cosmetics in their game, that they can\u2019t sell, QA, control, buff, nerf, or protect themselves against?\n And even if the myriad of things that you need to do to set something up in your game were done in advance, the only thing you\u2019d be checking off the blockchain is that User A has Item B. But since you know this item can  only come from Game B, you would just use an API to check for it. This is how games tell when people bought things like DLC for our games from the PlayStation or Xbox store. If someone\u2019s account claims to have bought something from PSN, clearly the best way to tell is to check PSN.\n Even if you were able to wave a magic wand and make all of the things that prevent it irrelevant, you\u2019d  still just be left with something that adds complexity while providing no additional value. The only extra functionality that would provide over a regular cross-game promotional item (like Little Big Planet was doing 10 years ago) is the ability to trade those items between users .. which Steam was doing 9 years ago.\n If you\u2019re currently thinking something about \u2018but decentralization\u2019, hold that thought. That\u2019s a falsehood people have been selling, and I\u2019ll address it in a future article. The point of  this article is singular - to show how NFTs do nothing to mitigate any of the difficulties of asset sharing.\n Game development is a complex, exciting, interdependent web of complexities that are largely invisible to people who never see them, and while I\u2019m thrilled to see people taking an interest in game development tech, I hope this has opened at least a small window into challenges at play.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:40:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,nft,fantasy", "title": "NFT

"note_en": "ANALYSIS:  \u2018Promoting a climate of fear and repression \u2026 damages creativity and drives excellent young scientists out of the field\u2019\n In December, Stanford University\u2019s Department of Computer Science released a  statement on the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict accompanied by an anti-racism  toolkit comprised of images of what looks like the reading list for a racial studies course.\n \u201cWe condemn the violence, trauma, and suffering that the Black community has both historically and contemporarily endured,\u201d the computer science department stated.\n \u201cThe pervasiveness of anti-Black racism reaffirms our department\u2019s mission to create an equitable, diverse, and inclusive community that centers, affirms, and uplifts everyone and prioritizes an enduring sense of belonging and community for all.\u201d\n Although academic departments related to science, technology, engineering, and math, collectively known as STEM, once operated largely unadulterated by the social and political ideologies that plague much of academia, many professors and students in those departments now find that espousing the proper views on a plethora of topics related to race, sex, and the broader Diversity, Equity and Inclusion philosophy has become prerequisite for a meaningful career.\n Patanjali Kambhampati, a chemistry professor at McGill University, recalled when he was a student in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n \u201cSome of my friends and professors in science were saying, \u2018Oh the people in sociology are trying to study us and judge us and tell us how to do better and be better people,\u2019 and we were laughing at that seeing how silly that was because we\u2019re the rational ones,\u201d he said in a phone interview with  The College Fix.\n  Kambhampati, whose research pertains to ultrafast lasers with the potential to play a role in numerous technological advancements, was recently  denied a grant by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for failing to \u201cadequately describe specific, concrete practices that will be put in place to ensure that EDI is intentionally and proactively supported\u201d in his lab.\n Responding via email to a series of questions sent by  The College Fix, Dorian Abbot, a professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago, wrote that \u201c20 years ago the emphasis was on reducing biases and identifying the most promising candidates from a scientific perspective regardless of their background, which I strongly support.\u201d\n But today, as a prominent critic of DEI\u2019s tendency to prioritize skin color above skills, Abbot was disinvited from giving a lecture at MIT about his geological studies.\n DEI has become \u201cfocused on trying to hit quotas for group membership, discriminating against members of undesirable groups, and suppressing the speech of those who disagree with any aspect of it,\u201d Abbot told  The Fix.\n \u201cThe effect,\u201d he added, \u201chas been that we are hindering our ability to produce the best science by (1) selecting young scientists partially using criteria other than scientific merit and potential and (2) promoting a climate of fear and repression, which damages creativity and drives excellent young scientists out of the field.\u201d\n Illustrating Abbot\u2019s point is a growing list of prominent victims of this systemic infection of STEM by DEI who have lost funding and professional opportunities due to their failure to take what Abbot described as an \u201cideological loyalty oath.\u201d\n  Academic departments in STEM routinely  post DEI statements to their websites, replete with all the proper slogans.\n Science departments issue statements on news stories unrelated to science if the story has any perceived racial overtones, as Stanford did with the Rittenhouse verdict and as many other STEM departments did in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death.\n For example, in the summer of 2020, the chair of Northern Illinois University\u2019s Department of Biological Sciences at the time sent out an unnecessary but seemingly heartfelt email condemning Floyd\u2019s death.\n Ironically, this also got him publicly scolded via mass email by a graduate student because he failed to use this opportunity to call for more race-based hiring and mandatory in-person anti-racism training within NIU\u2019s biology department.\n Further exemplars of Abbot\u2019s concerns include recent postings for faculty positions at both Illinois State University and the University of Hartford, with ISU  requiring aspiring neuroethologists to submit a \u201cone-page statement describing [their] interest in or effort toward furthering diversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d and Hartford  informing would-be anatomy and physiology instructors, \u201cA review of applicant diversity statements will precede that of any other application materials.\u201d\n None of this however has any apparent benefit to science or scientists. None of it furthers understanding of human disease, life on Earth, or the universe beyond.\n The net result, according to Abbot, is academic institutions are \u201cscreening out scientists with alternative political and moral viewpoints,\u201d which led him to ask: \u201cDo you care if the person who will come up with the cure for cancer agrees with you politically?\u201d\n For most people the answer is no. However, given today\u2019s academic climate, perhaps the better answer is that we should hope that the person who can come up with the cure for cancer agrees with the right people politically.\n \u201cSome topics which were topics taught in biology have become controversial over time. \u2026 A good example would be that sexes are binary,\u201d Luana Maroja, a professor of biology at Williams College and author of a 2019  Atlantic  piece on self-censorship by scientists, told  The College Fix.\n Debra Soh, who formerly did neurocognitive research on human sexuality as a graduate student, felt she needed to  self-exile from academia if she wished to comment on politicized scientific issues related to her area of expertise like  gender dysphoria in children.\n Former friendly neighborhood spider researcher Colin Wright gave up on an academic career after, according to his  account, he was blacklisted from long-term employment in academia upon penning several popular articles containing heretical truths pertaining to biological sex in humans.\n Commenting on the examples of Soh and Wright, Maroja stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think that just holding [these] views would have been detrimental\u2026I don\u2019t think their view is a niche view\u2026I think most people agree with them \u2013 especially biologists.\u201d\n However, Maroja said, \u201cThey were very open about it.\u201d In today\u2019s academic climate, \u201ca person having those views is fine. If they publish it and it becomes widely known, it\u2019s another story,\u201d she said.\n One of the greatest ironies of these types of requirements, according to Maroja, who is originally from Brazil, is that immigrants are sometimes among the most negatively impacted by them.\n \u201cPeople who are not Americans\u2026\u201d, she said, \u201cdon\u2019t understand what it is that they are expected to say.\u201d\n Many Americans working in academic STEM, however, have come to understand what they are expected to say, and, whether sincere or not, make a grand display of saying it as loudly as they can.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:39:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u963b\u788d,takeover,\u6545\u4e8b", "title": "Dei\u63a5\u7ba1\u830e\u963b\u788d\u80fd\u529b'\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66'", "title_en": "DEI takeover of STEM hinders ability \u2018to produce the best science\u2019", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thecollegefix.com/dei-takeover-of-stem-hinders-ability-to-produce-the-best-science-say-scientists/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u963b\u788d", "takeover", "\u6545\u4e8b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4979e0bf78a41f42e8e1b4519c154e75.png", "infoid": 1072578, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u7814\u7a76\u8fc7\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u5b58\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5927\u591a\u6570Web\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u62c5\u5fc3\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u5982\u679cWeb\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0a\u6cc4\u6f0f5 MB\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u901a\u77e5\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u5417\uff1f \uff08\u6709\u70b9\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u201c\u68ee\u6797\u91cc\u7684\u6811\u201dkoan\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u6211\u5fcd\u53d7\u3002\uff09\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u5f88\u6e05\u695a\uff0cWeb\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cc4\u6f0f\u7684\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5df2\u7ecf\u65e0\u60c5\u5730\u6740\u6b7b\u4e86\u6d88\u8017\u592a\u591a\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u9009\u9879\u5361\u3002 \uff08\u6211\u7684\u524d\u540c\u4e8b\u5728Microsoft Edge Performance Team\uff0cTodd Reifsteck\uff0c\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c2016\u5e74\u56de\u52302016\u5e74\uff0c\u201cWeb\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5c31\u50cf\u7b5b\u5b50\u3002\u201d\uff09\u5f88\u591a\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u662f\u5236\u8868\u7b26\uff08\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u4e3a\u4e66\u7b7e\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ed8\u5951\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u60a8\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6253\u5f00100\u4e2a\u9009\u9879\u5361\uff08\u4ece\u6b64\u5f00\u59cb\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fd0\u884c\u5e76\u7acb\u5373\u53ef\u7528\uff09\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u70b9\u51fb\u51e0\u5468\u5927\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u7e41\u8363\uff0c\u9875\u9762\u52a0\u8f7d\u65f6\u6709\u4e00\u95ea\u767d\u7684\u767d\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5f88\u591a\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5c06\u6211\u4eec\u5e26\u5230\u7b2c\u4e8c\u70b9\uff1a\u5185\u5b58\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5f88\u96be\u8bca\u65ad\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5199\u4e86\u5f88\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u8fd4\u56de\u65e7\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5c31\u6b64\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u60a8\u662f\u5177\u6709\u591a\u5e74\u7684Web\u5f00\u53d1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u7eca\u5012\u6211\u7684Gotchas\u5305\u62ec\u4f60\u5fc5\u987b\u5ffd\u7565\u5f31\u52bf\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14DevTools\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u4ee5\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5185\u5b58\u3002\n\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u60f3\u548cfuite\u4e00\u8d77\u53bb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u6307\u51fa\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u8ba9\u5b83\u544a\u8bc9\u60a8\u7a76\u7adf\u662f\u54ea\u4e00\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u3002 \uff08\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u6253\u5f00\u62c9\u52a8\u8bf7\u6c42\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u563f\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\uff09\n\u611f\u8c22Jake Archibald\u548cTodd Reifsteck\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u8349\u6848\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "note_en": "I\u2019ve researched and learned enough about client-side memory leaks to know that most web developers aren\u2019t worrying about them too much. If a web app leaks 5 MB on every interaction, but it still works and nobody notices, then does it matter? (Kinda sounds like a  \u201ctree in the forest\u201d koan, but bear with me.)\n Even those who have poked around in the browser DevTools to dabble in  the arcane art of memory leak detection have probably found the experience\u2026 daunting. The effort-to-payoff ratio is disappointingly high, especially compared to the hundreds of other things that are important in web development, like security and accessibility.\n  I would argue that they do matter, if only because the lack of care (as shown by  public-facing SPAs leaking up to 186 MB per interaction) is a sign of the immaturity of our field, and an opportunity for growth. Similarly, five years ago, there was much less concern among SPA authors for accessibility, security, runtime performance, or even ensuring that the back button maintained scroll position (or that the back button worked at all!). Today, I see a lot more discussion of these topics among SPA developers, and that\u2019s a great sign that our field is starting to take our craft more seriously.\n So why should you, and why  shouldn\u2019t you, care about memory leaks? Obviously I\u2019m biased because I have an axe to grind (and a tool I wrote,   fuite), but let me try to give an even-handed take.\n  In terms of actual impact on the business of web development, memory leaks are a funny thing. If you speed up your website by 2 seconds, everyone agrees that that\u2019s a good thing with a visible user impact. If you reduce your website\u2019s memory leak by 2 MB, can we still agree it was worth it? Maybe not.\n Here are some of the unique characteristics of memory leaks that I\u2019ve observed, in terms of how they actually fit into the web development process. Memory leaks are:\n   Most web apps can leak memory and no one will ever notice. Not the user, not the website author \u2013 nobody. There are a few reasons for this.\n First off, browsers are well aware that the web is a leaky mess and are already ruthless about killing background tabs that consume too much memory. (My former colleague on the Microsoft Edge performance team,  Todd Reifsteck, told me way back in 2016 that \u201cthe web leaks like a sieve.\u201d) A lot of users are tab hoarders (essentially using tabs as bookmarks), and there\u2019s a tacit understanding between browser and user that you can\u2019t  really have 100 tabs open at once (in the sense that the tab is actively running and instantly available). So you click on a tab that\u2019s a few weeks old, boom, there\u2019s a flash of white while the page loads, and nobody seems to mind much.\n Second off, even for long-lived SPAs that the user may habitually check in on (think: GMail, Evernote, Discord), there are plenty of opportunities for a page refresh. The browser needs to update. The user doesn\u2019t trust that the data is fresh and hits F5. Something goes wrong because  programmers are terrible at managing state, and users are well aware that the old turn-it-off-and-back-on-again solves most problems. All of this means that even a multi-MB leak can go undetected, since a refresh will almost always occur before an Out Of Memory crash.\n  Third, it\u2019s a tragedy-of-the-commons situation, and people tend to blame the browser. Chrome is a memory hog. Firefox gobbles up RAM. Safari is eating all my memory. For reasons I can\u2019t quite explain, people with 100+ open tabs are quick to blame the messenger. Maybe this goes back to the first point: tab hoarders expect the browser to automatically transition tabs from \u201cthing I\u2019m actively using\u201d to \u201cbackground thing that is basically a bookmark,\u201d seamlessly and without a hitch. Browsers have  different  heuristics about this, some heuristics are better than others, and so in that sense, maybe it is the browser\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d for failing to adapt to the user\u2019s tab-hoarding behavior. In any case, the website author tends to escape the blame, especially if their site is just 1 out of 100 naughty tabs that are all leaking memory. (Although this may change as more browsers call out tabs individually in Task Manager, e.g.  Edge and  Safari.)\n  What\u2019s interesting, though, is that every so often a memory leak will get so bad that people actually start to notice. Maybe someone opens up Task Manager and wonders why a note-taking app is consuming more RAM than DOTA. Maybe the website slows to a crawl after a few hours of usage. Maybe the users are on a device with low available memory (and of course the developers, with their 32GB workstations, never noticed).\n Here\u2019s what often happens in this case: a ticket lands on some web developer\u2019s desk that says \u201cMemory usage is too high, fix it.\u201d The developer thinks to themselves, \u201cI\u2019ve never given much thought to memory usage, well let\u2019s take a stab at this.\u201d At some point they probably open up DevTools, click \u201cMemory,\u201d click \u201cTake snapshot,\u201d and\u2026 it\u2019s a mess. Because it turns out that the SPA leaks, has always leaked, and in fact has  multiple leaks that have accumulated over time. The developer assumes this is some kind of sudden-onset disease, when in fact it\u2019s a pre-existing condition that has gradually escalated to stage-4.\n The funny thing is that the  source of the leak \u2013 the event listener, the subscriber, whatever \u2013 might not even be the proximate cause of the recent crisis. It might have been there all along, and was originally a tiny 1 MB leak nobody noticed, until suddenly someone attached a much bigger object to the existing leak, and now it\u2019s a 100 MB leak that no one can ignore.\n Unfortunately to get there, you\u2019re going to have to hack your way through the jungle of the half-dozen  other leaks that you ignored up to this point. (We fixed the leak! Oh wait, no we didn\u2019t. We fixed the other leak! Oh wait, there\u2019s still one more\u2026) But that\u2019s how it goes when you ignore a chronic but steadily worsening illness until the moment it becomes a crisis.\n  This brings us to the second point: memory leaks are hard to diagnose. I\u2019ve already written  a lot about this, and I won\u2019t rehash old content. Suffice it to say, the tooling is not really up to the task (despite some nice  recent innovations), even if you\u2019re a veteran with years of web development experience. Some gotchas that tripped me up include the fact that you have to ignore  WeakMaps and circular references, and that  the DevTools console itself can leak memory.\n Oh and also, browsers themselves can have memory leaks! For instance, see these ResizeObserver/IntersectionObserver leaks in  Chromium,  Firefox, and  Safari (fixed in all but Firefox), or this Chromium leak in  lazy-loading images (not fixed), or  this discussion of a leak in Safari. Of course, the tooling will not help you distinguish between browser leaks and web page leaks, so you just kinda have to know this stuff. In short: good luck!\n Even with the tool that I\u2019ve written,   fuite, I won\u2019t claim that we\u2019ve reached a golden age of memory leak debugging. My tool is better than what\u2019s out there, but that\u2019s not saying much. It can catch the dumb stuff, such as leaking event listeners and DOM nodes, and for the more complex stuff like leaking collections (Arrays, Maps, etc.), it can at least point you in the right direction. But it\u2019s still up to the web developer to decide  which leaks are worth chasing (some are trivial, others are massive), and to track them down.\n I still believe that the browser DevTools (or perhaps professional testing tools, such as Cypress or Sentry), should be the ones to handle this kind of thing. The browser especially is in a much better position to figure out why memory is leaking, and to point the web developer towards solutions.  fuite is the best I could do with userland tooling (such as Puppeteer), but overall I\u2019d still say we\u2019re in the Stone Age, not the Space Age. (Maybe  fuite pushed us to the Bronze Age, if I\u2019m being generous to myself.)\n  Here\u2019s the really surprising thing about memory leaks, though, and perhaps the reason I find them so addictive and keep coming back to them: once you figure out where the leak is coming from, they\u2019re usually trivial to fix. For instance:\n You added a DOM node, but forgot to remove it when the page transitions away.\n You might have a multi-MB leak, and the fix is one line of code. That\u2019s a massive bang-for-the-buck! That is, if you discount the days of work it might have taken to find that line of code.\n This is where I would  like to go with  fuite. It would be amazing if you could just point a tool at your website and have it tell you exactly which line of code caused a leak. (It\u2019d be even better if it could open a pull request to fix the leak, but hey, let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.)\n I\u2019ve taken some baby steps in this direction by adding  stacktraces for leaking collections. So for instance, if you have an Array that is growing by 1 on every user interaction,  fuite can tell you which line of code actually called  Array.push(). This is a huge improvement over v1.0 of  fuite (which just told you the Array was leaking, but not why), and although there are edge cases where it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m pretty proud of this feature. My goal is to expand this to other leaks (event listeners, DOM nodes, etc.), although since this is just a tool I\u2019m building in my spare time, we\u2019ll see if I get to it.\n  After releasing this tool, I also learned that  Facebook has built a similar tool and is planning to open-source it soon. That\u2019s great! I\u2019m excited to see how it works, and I\u2019m hoping that having more tools in this space will help us move past the Stone Age of memory leak debugging.\n  So to bring it back around: should you care about memory leaks? Well, if your boss is yelling at you because customers are complaining about Out Of Memory crashes, then yeah, you absolutely should. Are you leaking 5 MB, and nobody has complained yet? Well, maybe an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure in this case. If you start fixing your memory leaks now, it might avoid that crisis in the future when 5 MB suddenly grows to 50 MB.\n Alternatively, are you leaking a measly ~1 kB because your routing library is appending some metadata to an Array? Well, maybe you can let that one slide. ( fuite will still report this leak, but I would argue that it\u2019s not worth fixing.)\n On the other hand, all of these leaks are important in some sense, because even  thinking about them shows a dedication to craftsmanship that is (in my opinion) too often lacking in web development. People write a web app, they throw something buggy over the wall, and then they rewrite their frontend four years later after users are complaining too much. I see this all the time when I observe how my wife uses her computer \u2013 she\u2019s constantly telling me that some app gets slower or buggier the longer she uses it, until she gives up and refreshes. Whenever I help her with her computer troubles, I feel like I have to make excuses for my entire industry, for why we feel it\u2019s acceptable to waste our users\u2019 time with shoddy, half-baked software.\n Maybe I\u2019m just a dreamer and an idealist, but I really enjoy putting that final polish on something and feeling proud of what I\u2019ve created. I notice, too, when the software I use has that extra touch of love and care \u2013 and it gives me more confidence in the product and the team behind it. When I press the back button and it doesn\u2019t work, I lose a bit of trust. When I press  Esc on a modal and it doesn\u2019t close, I lose a bit of trust. And if an app keeps slowing down until I\u2019m forced to refresh, or if I notice the memory steadily creeping up, I lose a bit of trust. I would like to think that fixing memory leaks is part of that extra polish that won\u2019t necessarily win you a lot of accolades, but your users will subtly notice, and it will build their confidence in your software.\n Thanks to  Jake Archibald and  Todd Reifsteck for feedback on a draft of this post.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 08:47:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6027\u80fd,\u5185\u5b58,\u6cc4\u6f0f,leaks", "title": "\u5185\u5b58\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff1aWeb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u9762", "title_en": "Memory leaks: the forgotten side of web performance", "transed": 1, "url": "https://nolanlawson.com/2022/01/05/memory-leaks-the-forgotten-side-of-web-performance/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u80fd", "\u5185\u5b58", "\u6cc4\u6f0f", "leaks"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "642d6d3930d6a8f7670ee33c46d6e19a.png", "infoid": 1072577, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6811\u6728\u5bf95G\u53d8\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\n\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u65b0\u8349\u576a\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5d74\u4ec5\u4e3a\u51e0\u6beb\u7c73 - \u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u6ce2\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f88\u77ed\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5f88\u957f\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9891\u7387\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\uff0c\u572830\u5230300\u5343\u5146\u8d6b\u5179\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u67d0\u5904\uff0c\u6216\u6bcf\u79d2\u5341\u4ebf\u6ce2\u5cf0\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u4f20\u8f93\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5343\u8d6b\u5179\uff08\u9002\u7528\u4e8eAM\uff09\u548cMegahertz\uff08fm\uff09\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u65b0\u76845G\u4fe1\u53f7\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u9891\u7387 - \u4e0e\u6536\u97f3\u673a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u542c\u529b\u7684\u4e0a\u65b9\u7684\u9e1f\u7c7b\u63a8\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f4e\u97f3\u3002\n\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u8861\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u56e2\u961f\u8fd8\u770b\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u6750\u6599\u3002\u6728\u95e8\uff0c\u77f3\u818f\u677f\u5899\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u73bb\u7483\u5206\u522b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8\u8fbe40.5 dB\uff0c31.6 dB\u548c18.1dB\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u800c\u5916\u90e8\u5efa\u7b51\u6750\u6599\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe66.5 dB\u3002\uff09", "note_en": "Measurements of trees\u2019 impact on 5G transmissions could prove vital to using a new class of signal.\n  As 5G technology gets fully implemented over the next several years, cellphones and other wireless tech will grow more powerful with increased data flow and lower latency. But along with these benefits comes a question: Will your next-generation cellphone be unable to see the forest for the trees?\n That\u2019s one way to describe the problem confronting cell network designers, who have to embrace both the benefits and shortcomings of a new class of signals that 5G will use: millimeter waves. Not only can these waves carry more information than conventional transmissions do, but they also usefully occupy a portion of the broadcast spectrum that communication technologies seldom use \u2014 a major concern in an age when broadcasters vie for  portions of spectrum like prospectors staking out territory.\n However, millimeter waves also have drawbacks, including their limited ability to penetrate obstacles. These obstacles include buildings, but also the trees that dot the landscape. Until recently little was known about how trees affected millimeter wave propagation. And just as few of us would want to imagine a landscape without greenery, few designers would be able to plan networks around it without such a crucial fundamental detail.\n The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has set out to solve this problem by measuring trees\u2019 effect on millimeter waves. The effort could make a profound difference in our next-generation devices\u2019 ability to see the 5G antennae that may soon sprout.\n The 5G era will feature wireless communication not only between people but also between devices connected to the Internet of Things. The increased demand for larger downloads by cell customers and lag-free network response by gamers has spurred the wireless industry to pursue speedier, more effective communication. Not only could our current devices and services work more effectively, but we could realize new ones: Autonomous vehicles will depend on such quick network response to function.\n \u201cWe will be able to do new things if our machines can exchange and process information quickly and effectively,\u201d said Nada Golmie, head of NIST\u2019s Wireless Networks Division in the Communications Technology Laboratory. \u201cBut you need a good communication infrastructure. The idea is to connect, process data in one place and do things with it elsewhere.\u201d\n Millimeter waves, which are new turf for the wireless industry, could be part of the solution. Their wave crests are just a few millimeters apart \u2014 a very short distance compared with radio waves that can be several meters long. And their frequencies are very high, somewhere between 30 and 300 gigahertz, or billion wave crests per second. Compared with conventional radio transmissions, which are in the kilohertz (for AM) and megahertz (for FM) ranges, new 5G signals will be very high frequency indeed \u2014 something like a bird tweeting at the upper range of human hearing compared with radio\u2019s deep, low bass.\n It is millimeter waves\u2019 high frequency that makes them both tantalizing as data carriers and also hard to harness. On the one hand, more wave crests per second means the waves can carry more information, and our data-hungry era craves that capability to provide those faster downloads and network responses. On the other, high-frequency waves have trouble traveling through obstructions. Anyone who has passed near a house or car whose occupants are playing loud dance music knows that the throbbing bass frequencies are most of what reaches the outdoors, not the treble of a lilting soprano.\n For 5G networks, the obstructing wall can be no more than an oak leaf. For that reason, NIST scientists embarked on a somewhat unusual task in September 2019: They set up measurement equipment near trees and shrubs of different sizes around the agency\u2019s Gaithersburg, Maryland, campus. The study continued for months, in part because they needed seasonal perspective.\n \u201cThe tree study is one of the few out there that looks at the same tree\u2019s effect on a particular signal frequency through different seasons,\u201d Golmie said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t only do the survey in the winter, because things would have changed by summer. It turns out that even the shape of leaves affects whether a signal will reflect or get through.\u201d\n The team worked with the wireless community to develop the mobile equipment that was needed to take the measurements. The researchers focused it on single trees and aimed millimeter-wave signals at them from a range of angles and positions, to simulate waves coming from different directions. They measured the loss, or attenuation, in decibels. (Each 10 dB of loss is a reduction by a power of 10; a 30 dB attenuation would mean the signal is reduced by a factor of 1,000.)\n \u201cThe tree study is one of the few out there that looks at the same tree\u2019s effect on a particular signal frequency through different seasons. Even the shape of leaves affects whether a signal will reflect or get through.\u201d \u2014 Nada Golmie, NIST researcher\n For one type of leafy tree, the European nettle, the average attenuation in summer was 27.1 dB, but it relaxed to 22.2 dB in winter when the tree was bare. Evergreens blocked more of the signal. Their average attenuation was 35.3 dB, a number that did not change with the season.\n (As a measure of comparison, the team also looked at different types of  building materials. Wooden doors, plasterboard walls and interior glass showed losses of up to 40.5 dB, 31.6 dB and 18.1 dB, respectively, while exterior building materials exhibited even larger losses, up to 66.5 dB.)\n While NIST\u2019s contributions to 5G network development effort could end up as ubiquitous as trees themselves, for most of us they will be considerably less visible. The measurements the team made are intended mainly for companies that create models of how different objects affect millimeter waves. Part of the effort was a  collaboration with Ansys Inc. The company used the measurement data NIST shared with it to tune the tree simulation models, which cell companies use to plan out their networks of antennas in detail.\n \u201cMost models don\u2019t include measurement-based information about trees,\u201d said NIST\u2019s David Lai, one of the scientists who conducted the study. \u201cThey might simply say that for a given tree-like shape, we should expect a certain amount of signal loss. We want to improve their models by providing accurate measurement-based propagation data.\u201d\n NIST\u2019s collaboration with Ansys contributed to guidance issued by the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU), the organization that creates guidelines for telecom standards. The results now appear as a new section on trees in ITU\u2019s  Recommendation ITU-R P.833-10. This publication serves as a reference for signal propagation models, which others will develop.\n \u201cOur goal is to get these measurements in front of the  entire wireless community,\u201d Golmie said. \u201cWe hope this effort will help the entire marketplace.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 08:43:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "5g,\u53d8\u901f\u5668,trees,\u76f8\u6bd4", "title": "\u6811\u6728\u5bf95G\u53d8\u901f\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "title_en": "Measurements of trees\u2019 impact on 5G transmissions", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/01/nist-helps-next-generation-cell-technology-see-past-greenery", "via": "", "real_tags": ["5g", "\u53d8\u901f\u5668", "trees", "\u76f8\u6bd4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a30f2eedd9cf94ca117aaa963e19d056.jpg", "infoid": 1072576, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728200\u5e74\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u771f\u83cc\u6218\u4e89\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u523a\u732c\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0a\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8010\u836f\u7269\u6bd2\u6027\u83cc\u682a\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5229\u7528\u9752\u9709\u7d20\u63a8\u52a8MRSA\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3aMRSA\u5728\u523a\u732c\u76ae\u80a4\u4e0a\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u6218\u6597\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u8513\u5ef6\u5230\u7272\u755c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u201cWellcome Sanger Institute\u548c\u5251\u6865\u5927\u5b66\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5458ewan\u54c8\u91cc\u68ee\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u5251\u6865\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u3002", "note_en": "The first strains of drug-resistant staph bacteria evolved on the skin of hedgehogs 200 years ago, researchers found, in response to natural fungal warfare.\n The origins of a notorious bacterial superbug can be traced back to hedgehogs that lived centuries ago, new research this week suggests. The study found evidence that one particular type of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus, also known as MRSA, first emerged on the skin of hedgehogs. The bacteria likely evolved resistance in response to fungus also living on hedgehogs that naturally produced antibiotic compounds to kill off their competitors\u2014long before humans began using antibiotic drugs to treat these infections.\n  MRSA is one of the most well-known examples of antibiotic resistance. The term refers to any strains of  S. aureus that are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics\u2014a class of antibiotics that include methicillin but also many other drugs, including penicillin.  S. aureus strains, including MRSA, live naturally on our skin and elsewhere, typically without causing trouble. But when these bacteria do cause illness, often among people hospitalized or in poorer health, MRSA infections can be much harder to get rid of with conventional treatments and can turn deadly.\n Scientists   discovered the existence of MRSA almost immediately after methicillin became the standard drug of choice for staph infections in the 1960s. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that MRSA became widely known, as rates of hospital-related cases climbed and strains spreading between people outside of hospitals began to emerge. There has been   some progress in stemming the tide of MRSA within hospitals since then, though this progress may have slowed down in recent years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that almost 120,000 Americans   contracted serious bloodstream infections of MRSA in 2017, while nearly 20,000 died as a result.\n    The widespread use of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture since the 1940s has fostered the emergence of drug-resistant infections, including MRSA. But a few years ago, scientists made a curious discovery: Hedgehogs living in   Sweden and   other European countries seemed to widely carry a form of MRSA known as mecC-MRSA. mecC-MRSA is thought to cause only a sliver of MRSA infections in humans, and while other animals have been documented to carry it, rates of colonization were much higher in these hedgehogs (around two-thirds had it). This led scientists at the time to theorize that hedgehogs have been a natural host for mecC-MRSA for at least decades.\n  This new research,   published in Nature on Wednesday, has found genetic evidence that this timeline goes back much further. An international group of researchers from the UK, Denmark, Sweden, and elsewhere, including some of the first to document mecC-MRSA in hedgehogs and other animals, collaborated for the study. They sequenced the genomes of hedgehog MRSA strains and compared them to other  S.  aureus strains in order to build a likely family tree.\n   Near as they can tell, the lineages that first gave rise to the hedgehog-related MRSA we see today began in the 19th century, about 200 years ago. The team also found that a common fungus living on hedgehog skin, known as  Trichophyton erinacei, can produce two different types of beta-lactam antibiotics. And in the lab, hedgehog MRSA strains did appear better able to survive against these antibiotics than other strains.\n  \u201cOur study suggests that it wasn\u2019t the use of penicillin that drove the initial emergence of MRSA, it was a natural biological process. We think MRSA evolved in a battle for survival on the skin of hedgehogs, and subsequently spread to livestock and humans through direct contact,\u201d said senior study author Ewan Harrison, a researcher at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge and a senior author of the study, in a   statement from Cambridge.\n  mecC-MRSA infections in humans are rare and are typically mild and easily treated with other antibiotics when they do happen. So even though these bacteria may have occasionally sickened us over the past 200 years, the findings shouldn\u2019t make us fearful of hanging out with hedgehogs, the authors say.\n But they do illustrate that the world is a smaller and more connected place than we might think. Because most antibiotics we use today are derived from natural sources, this may not be the only example of important antibiotic resistance that has existed prior to the antibiotic era of medicine. And we already know that antibiotic resistance   found in other animals can have serious health consequences for humans. That said, while some animals may play host to their own native superbugs, our   continued overuse of antibiotics in livestock also plays a major, if not leading, role in causing this resistance.\n  \u201cThese results underscore the importance of taking a broad One Health perspective on antibiotic resistance that recognizes the role of natural selection in wild animals and the connectivity of natural, agricultural and human ecosystems in the evolution and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens,\u201d the researchers wrote.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 08:42:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8868\u660e,blame,\u7814\u7a76", "title": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u523a\u732c\u8d23\u5907MRSA Superbug\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u73b0\u4ee3\u6297\u751f\u7d20", "title_en": "Hedgehogs to Blame for a MRSA Superbug, Not Modern Antibiotics, Study Suggests", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/hedgehogs-to-blame-for-a-mrsa-superbug-not-modern-anti-1848301189", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8868\u660e", "blame", "\u7814\u7a76"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "227c6b2c0c2867726fbd76406457807d.jpg", "infoid": 1072575, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u514d\u8d39\u6a2a\u5411\u6d41\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9762\u5411\u65a7\u5934\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0eCovid\u4e00\u8d77\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u9c8d\u91cc\u65af\u7ea6\u7ff0\u900a\u5c06\u5728\u51e0\u5468\u5185\u5ba3\u5e03\u3002", "note_en": "Free lateral flow tests face the axe under plans for living with Covid which Boris Johnson will announce within weeks.\n More than \u00a36 billion of public money has been spent on mass testing using the devices.\n  The new system could mean free tests being provided only in high-risk settings such as care homes, hospitals and schools, and to people with symptoms.

Its promise was to develop an open-source smart home standard that would make every connected home device work together, simply and securely, regardless of who made them. The buzz was: \u201cThat\u2019s never gonna happen.\u201d\n Fast forward to CES 2022 (yeah, we all skipped 2021) and  Matter \u2014 as CHIP is now called \u2014 was the darling of the show, with a full dance card and a line of admirers that stretched to the virtual Starbucks.\n Practically every smart home device announcement this week had the tagline \u201cand we announce our support for Matter.\u201d Plus, the infrastructure gained significant support. There were  new chips designed for Matter, Amazon announced device makers can now add  Frustration-Free Setup on their Matter-certified devices with just the Matter SDK\u2014 no Amazon-specific SDK required. And Google showed off its own version of a simplified setup,  Fast Pair with built-in support for Matter. Both these announcements mean that as developers build new smart home products, all you\u2019ll have to do once you get them home is plug them in and they\u2019ll be ready to go.\n \u201cThe wave of Matter news at CES from our CSA members is a testament to the hard work that has gone into the development and testing of Matter in 2021,\u201d Tobin Richardson, president of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees Matter, told me during the show. \u201cHundreds of companies and thousands of engineers are at the heart of this global solution, creating a more open and innovative IoT, and I\u2019m really excited by what is to come in 2022.\u201d\n  The other interesting announcement was confirmation from Amazon that Alexa will share your smart home with other voice assistants. The main promise of Matter has been cross-platform compatibility, that you will be able to control your smart devices with the app or voice assistant of your choice. Now we\u2019re seeing exactly how that will be done.\n Amazon introduced  new tools for developers that let them add Alexa as an additional way to control a device already set up in another system. While today you can control, say, a Philips Hue lightbulb with multiple apps and voice assistants, you currently have to set it up with each one individually. With Matter, it\u2019ll be one and done. As a nice bonus, this new capability also adds local connectivity to the device, allowing for quicker response times and the chance to use your devices even if the internet is down.\n  In all, close to 30 companies showcased their involvement and / or pledged their support for the new smart home standard backed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and others. Many of whom represent a broader slice of the industry \u2014  Tuya Smart, an IoT development platform service provider based in China that supports over 446,000 developers with over 1,100 smart home products, said it will support Matter. We also saw a number of new  products debut with Thread, one of the main protocols of Matter.\n   All of this gives us a much better feel for what Matter will bring with it when it finally arrives, it\u2019s currently scheduled for June 2022. But let\u2019s take a step back and assess now that CES is over and we\u2019re faced with a bleak mid-winter before Matter gets here.\n It seems like there is significant momentum, minimal in-fighting (that we\u2019ve seen), and a clear directive from the consumer and direction for the manufacturers and platforms: We want smart home products to work together. Now make it happen.\n It\u2019s imperative that Matter doesn\u2019t leave existing smart homes in the dark.\n The momentum is big enough that it appears to have convinced the major appliance companies of the world to do the same thing. They went off and created their own alliance aimed at making sure your Samsung dishwasher can talk to your GE Appliances fridge.  The Home Connectivity Alliance, announced at  Samsung\u2019s CES keynote, was specifically formed to make sure legacy home appliances can move into the IoT future, Yoon Ho Choi of Samsung and president of the HCA told me at CES.\n This issue of upgradability of existing devices is still an area Matter  has largely skirted and one that it really needs to address. There\u2019s been talk about firmware updates for existing hubs and bridges, and we know that the newer  Amazon Echo smart speakers and Google Nest Hub devices have an upgrade path.\n   But, based on many of the announcements coming out of CES this week, it is looking increasingly like creating a Matter smart home is going to require users buying a fair number of new gadgets. As Mitch Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance told me late last year, \u201cWe can\u2019t leave devices behind, or this whole program won\u2019t work. The idea that everyone has to throw everything out and start again is just not going to work.\u201d It remains imperative that Matter doesn\u2019t leave existing smart homes in the dark.\n   August and Yale committed to making their smart locks work with Matter. Jason Williams, president of August and Yale Real Living, told me they plan to bring the first Matter lock to market when the standard launches in 2022. The company already has one Thread-enabled lock, the  aging Nest x Yale smart lock, and is looking at other ways to introduce the technology, says Williams. While he said its Wi-Fi powered August locks won\u2019t be among the first to be updated (Matter over Wi-Fi is only for hard line-powered devices currently, not battery-powered devices), they are actively looking at ways to bring their existing products into the new smart home standard.\n   Schlage may beat Yale to the punch with its new  Schlage Encode Plus lock, the company\u2019s first Thread-enabled product. While the Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, Donald Beene of Schlage told  The Verge that the hardware is there for Matter. \u201cThis will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don\u2019t know where those tech specs will land,\u201d he said.\n  If you make smart lights, switches, and plugs, Matter was on your mind this week. Belkin Wemo announced its working on  Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug, Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer that will support Matter over Thread. Cync, the GE Lighting company, told me that  its color A19 bulb and light strip will be Matter-compatible over Wi-Fi, and smart lighting company  Sengled said that it will have its first Wi-Fi A19 bulb ready to go when the standard launches. Nanoleaf, which has been all-in on Thread for over a year now, confirmed at CES that its mains-powered lighting panels, the Nanoleaf Shapes,  Elements, and  Lines, will become Thread border routers, initially for Thread over HomeKit but with an eye to Matter-compatibility.\n  While Matter should mitigate the whole multiple hub / gateway / bridge issue down to one teeny little box that\u2019s hopefully also your router, that is going to take a while. In the meantime, we\u2019ve still got hubs galore, and going forward, we will need Matter Controllers to act as remote controls for your home (think Google Nest Hub smart displays, but hopefully better).\n There were a few new hubs announced this week, including the new  Samsung Home Hub, Samsung has committed to adopt Matter across Samsung devices, so when this smart home controller makes it to the US (it\u2019s launching in Korean in March), it\u2019s likely to be part of that. Aqara, makers of inexpensive Zigbee sensors and decent HomeKit cameras that double as hubs, said it will update its  M2 and the M1S hubs, making all compatible connected sensors move over to Matter. It also announced it\u2019s developing Thread versions of its popular motion and contact sensors.\n Smart home security camera company Arlo  announced its home security system, which is based around its \u201cmodular hub.\u201d The word modular has us intrigued, as does the company\u2019s decision to finally join Matter. While we\u2019d love to think this is a sign of cameras coming into Matter sooner (they\u2019re currently not part of the Matter spec), the first product of Arlo\u2019s to get Matter support is more likely to be those spiffy new all-in-one sensors.\n Speaking of modular, edge-computing company  Veea showed off an intriguing smart home hub that it announced will be Matter compatible. The Veea STAX Smart Hub is a Wi-Fi 6 Mesh router and smart home hub in one, with the option of adding LTE or 5G cellular connection through stackable modules. A smart speaker module with directional mics is in the works, and STAX modules also feature Lutron and Philips Hue bridge tech (among others), along with HomeKit and Alexa compatibility.

As it turns out, science may be proving her right \u2014 though perhaps not in exactly the way she thought.\n I am a researcher who specializes in understanding the links between diet, sleep and health. Up until around 2014, my lab focused on examining how too little sleep affects obesity. Our work showed that reducing sleep by about four hours per night, for four nights, led to an increase in eating, amounting to about\u00a0 300 calories per day\u00a0(the equivalent of one McDonald\u2019s cheeseburger). The cause, we found, is increased activity in the\u00a0 reward centers\u00a0of the brain specific to food, along with alterations in hormones that control\u00a0 feelings\u00a0of fullness. In other words, people who sleep less feel hungrier, and tend to crave foods that are high in sugar and fat.\n    Then, in 2014, the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee \u2014 the group of scientists that makes recommendations about what Americans should eat to be healthy \u2014 reached out to me to ask the opposite question: How does diet affect sleep? This was an intriguing question.\n It\u2019s also a very important one. About\u00a0 35 percent of Americans get less than the\u00a0 recommended minimum of seven hours\u00a0of sleep per night;\u00a0 10 percent to 30 percent\u00a0suffer from a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea. Sleeping too little and sleep disorders have been associated with a host of problems ranging from psychological conditions to chronic diseases such as\u00a0 type 2 diabetes\u00a0and\u00a0 cardiovascular disease.\n But getting more and better sleep isn\u2019t always just a matter of going to bed earlier: It turns out that diet is an under-recognized contributor to good or bad sleep.\n Usually, people can pinpoint food or beverage triggers that contribute to bad sleep: Drinking coffee too late in the day or having a large meal too close to bedtime are two obvious ones that can interfere with sleep. What is less noticeable is how healthy choices made throughout the day can have a positive influence on slumber.\n Our studies over the past seven years have shown that eating more fiber and less saturated fat and sugar during the day results in\u00a0 deeper, less disturbed sleep at night. It may be particularly helpful to eat a Mediterranean-type diet rich in fruits and vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains and olive oil, and low in red and processed meat and whole-fat dairy. In\u00a0 our research, those who followed this diet were 1.4 times more likely to have good night\u2019s sleep and 35 percent less likely to have insomnia.\n Why? It\u2019s partly because protein-rich foods such as nuts and seeds, fish, poultry and eggs contain tryptophan, an amino acid from which the sleep-regulating hormone melatonin is produced in the brain. Other foods \u2014 including tomatoes, pineapple, tart cherries, bananas, apples, vegetable oils, nuts and animal products \u2014 contain melatonin itself. In plants, melatonin serves as an antioxidant to prevent damage, while in animals it serves to regulate their sleep (much as it does in humans). Eating such melatonin-rich foods may also boost your own melatonin levels, although research on this is sparse.\n  Our work suggests that the effects of diet on sleep can be as powerful, or maybe more powerful, than\u00a0 mindfulness\u00a0practices (increasing awareness and acceptance of one\u2019s thoughts and feelings, through meditation for example) or melatonin supplementation through pills. Studies show that melatonin supplements on average reduce the time to fall asleep by\u00a0 four minutes; in one of our studies, eating a healthy diet reduced time to fall asleep by about\u00a0 12 minutes, and the overall sleep quality was better.\n In the end, bad sleep and poor diet can be a vicious cycle: Lack of sleep leads to poor dietary choices, which in turn causes low quality sleep. But we can interrupt this cycle and turn it around. Eating well throughout the day could produce sounder, more restful sleep \u2014 which, in turn, could contribute to making better food choices.\n Interestingly, this may be easier to achieve for early birds. People who consider themselves night owls \u2014 feeling their best late in the day rather than early \u2014 tend, on average, to eat less\u00a0 plant protein, fruits and vegetables. This evening preference is also associated (again, on average) with\u00a0 greater rates of illness and earlier\u00a0death.\n           Thank you for your interest in republishing!

Mahogany trees drooping over sandy beaches.\n James Hastie, who was moving to Poyais with his wife and 2 children,  thought the country \u201chad a very beautiful appearance from the sea.\u201d\n Like many passengers, Hastie had signed a contract with the Poyaisian government to work as a laborer. Others, including doctors and lawyers, had cashed in their belongings in Europe for land in Poyais and the opportunity to establish themselves as a new upper crust in the Caribbean.\n Rich or poor, it seemed impossible not to prosper. The myriad Poyais advertisements that circulated through Britain had promised fertile land, rivers stocked with fish, and forests teeming with deer.\n But as Hastie and the others soon discovered, Poyais was not a country at all. It was one of the most elaborate \u2014 and deadliest \u2014 frauds in history.\n  Raised by a privileged Scottish family on the periphery of the aristocracy, Gregor MacGregor tasted enough wealth to know how good it would feel to have more.\n MacGregor went to top schools and, at 16, he joined the British army, a haven for status-seeking young men. But his real coup was winning the heart of Maria Bowater, a daughter of a navy admiral who ran in Britain\u2019s finest social circles.\n  A portrait of a young MacGregor in the British army (George Watson/National Gallery of Scotland/Wikipedia; 1804)\n Armed with Bowater\u2019s family wealth and prestige, military life suddenly got easier for MacGregor.\n   He paid  \u00a3900 (~\u00a372k today) to become captain of his regiment \u2014 a promotion that would have otherwise taken several years \u2014 and was on the fast track toward general, the highest distinction in the army.\n But the money didn\u2019t make MacGregor competent at his job. After a fight with a superior officer, he was forced to resign.\n Then, in 1811, Bowater died, and her embarrassed in-laws cut off MacGregor from their fortune. His supply of old money gone dry, MacGregor seemed destined for obscurity.\n  After spending several years as a hapless leader in Venezuela\u2019s revolution against Spain \u2014 which included deserting his troops during 2 key battles \u2014 MacGregor returned to England in 1821 with instant credibility because of his ties to the decorated politician  Francisco de Miranda.\n It also helped that he married rich  again, this time to a cousin of the famed revolutionary Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. The duo became a power couple, wined and dined by London\u2019s lord mayor.\n    In 1820, the brother of one of MacGregor\u2019s charges in Venezuela released a 418-page book that detailed MacGregor\u2019s military mishaps, more or less eviscerating him as a leader.\n \u201cThat any person could be induced again to join him in his desperate projects,\u201d wrote Michael Rafter, \u201cwould be to conceive a degree of madness and folly of which human nature, however fallen, is incapable.\u201d\n    Britain was swimming in cash and optimism after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. But there was no more war to finance, and the interest rates of the most popular British-backed securities declined, tempting the record numbers of people trying to time the market for maximum profit to find something stronger and riskier.\n South America \u2014 a catch-all for what is now Latin America \u2014 was the inevitable target.\n Several countries had gained independence from Spain and were floating bonds to finance their incipient governments. Countries like Colombia and Chile  sold bonds totaling  ~\u00a3100m-\u00a3200m in today\u2019s money, promising  6% in annual returns by tapping into profits from state-run agriculture and mineral industries.\n So began a craze akin to the dot-com bubble: Investors who knew basically nothing about the inner workings of South American countries went on a buying spree, inflating the value of the bonds and creating an intense resale market.\n    During his South American misadventures, he\u2019d befriended George Frederic August I \u2014 the king of the Mosquito Coast Territory (present-day Honduras and Nicaragua) \u2014 and had been gifted  8 million acres on the eastern shore of Honduras, an area roughly the size of Maryland.\n The land belonged to MacGregor, but it was under the dominion of the British-aligned Mosquito government. Of course, nobody in Europe knew these details.\n So back in London, at various society events, MacGregor presented his land as the independent country of  Poyais \u2014 and cast himself as the ruling \u201cCazique.\u201d\n  He designed a national flag and  a coat of arms for Poyais featuring two unicorns.\n He got British papers to detail  bond prices for Poyais just as they did for legitimate countries.\n Outside offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London, he and his representatives handed out brochures and sang songs about Poyais.\n To top it off, there was  a book about Poyais that concluded the new country \u201cwould rapidly advance in prosperity and civilization.\u201d (This ruse perhaps should have been obvious \u2014 the pseudonymous author\u2019s name was \u201cThomas Strangeways.\u201d)\n  MacGregor advertised Poyaisian land and estates in papers throughout Scotland and England. (Via Newspapers.com/The Caledonian Mercury)\n As 1822 wore on, the excitement spread, and MacGregor steadily increased the price of land from 1 shilling per acre to 4 shillings per acre ( \u00a36 to \u00a324 per acre today). In the fall, investors snapped up  \u00a3200k of bonds ( ~\u00a324m today) at a 6% rate of return.\n They believed they were financing a building boom in a developing country. In reality, the money lined MacGregor\u2019s pockets.\n There was just one major concern, according to David Sinclair\u2019s book   The Land That Never Was: How would Poyais pay the interest?\n Without any current revenues to describe, MacGregor assured the investors that funding would come from future inhabitants.\n  Fortunately for MacGregor, hundreds of British had fallen for the marketing hype, exchanging their life savings for Poyaisian money and  land grants. The first ~70 settlers left from England in fall 1822 on the  Honduras Packet. Another ~180 set sail from Scotland in January 1823 on the  Kennersley Castle.\n Before the 2nd group departed, MacGregor greeted them aboard the  Kennersley Castle and offered free passage for all the women and children. The future Poyais residents were elated at his generosity.\n \u201cWe gave him a salute of 6 guns and 3 cheers,\u201d Hastie  recalled in his memoir. \u201cLittle did we anticipate the misfortunes which were afterwards to befall us.\u201d\n  After the beautiful view from the ship, Hastie and the others believed they would find St. Joseph, a European-style capital city outfitted with a government center and a theater.\n Strangely, the new arrivals didn\u2019t see any dwellings or buildings. The only signs of life were the remaining passengers from the  Honduras Packet, holed up in bamboo huts, and 2 eccentric Americans who had been living off the land for years.\n There was no property to be assigned to the landowners. No banks for depositing and withdrawing Poyaisian money. No easy access to wild game.\n   Over the next couple months, the Poyais newcomers felt the consequences of the punishing heat and humidity, withering away from hunger, exhaustion, and malaria as they rationed provisions from the ship.\n One leader swindled by MacGregor, Hector Hall, and a Belizean general organized trips between Poyais and Belize, rescuing ~100 people whose health hadn\u2019t completely deteriorated.\n They also sent word to Britain that Poyais was a scam, leading the Royal Navy to intercept 5 more ships headed toward Poyais.\n In October 1823, ~50 of the Poyais settlers arrived in Britain, including Hastie and his wife. Hastie\u2019s 2 children did not survive, and fewer than \u2153 of the settlers who had arrived in Poyais in the previous year made it back alive. Those who did were in critical condition.\n \u201cThey had evidently undergone extreme suffering and illness, as their appearance was ghastly and cadaverous,\u201d  wrote one Scottish newspaper.\n MacGregor\u2019s scheme \u2014 and the entire British economy \u2014 were on the verge of collapse.\n   One guest  remembered being asked at a party to take an oath to Poyais, only to find it impossible to recite the words in their drunken stupor, \u201cfrom\u2026 the wine having passed very freely round.\u201d\n  South American bonds  faltered in the middle of his Poyais scheme because the countries that sold their bonds spent the proceeds on military conflicts, failing to pay back their debts. Many investors grew skeptical of Poyais by association \u2014 even before knowing it was fake \u2014 and declined to pay the new installments they owed for their bond purchases.\n  Top: A fictional illustration of Poyais (Chronicle Books); Bottom: A one-dollar note issued by the Bank of Poyais, Republic of Poyais (WIkipedia)\n MacGregor had spent enormous sums on marketing, on voyages to the fake country, and on his own extravagant lifestyle. When the bond payments ended, his cash flow trickled to nothing.\n The Poyais fraud was extraordinary because of the suffering and death it inflicted upon more than  200 would-be settlers. But the financial repercussions were hardly unique.\n The South American bond bubble popped, contributing to the Financial Panic of 1825. By 1827, nearly every Central and South American bond issue  had gone into default. In the aftermath of the panic,  52 English banks  failed.\n As with bubbles and scams today, it was the average British person who  fared the worst.\n Wealthy insiders got in on South American bonds at the earliest stages and lowest prices. Regular investors paid the higher prices, only to sell them for a fraction when the bonds didn\u2019t pay out.\n The few people who held onto their bonds made some money back when South American countries stabilized and started making interest payments in the 1840s and 1850s. Of course, if they invested in Poyais they never saw a dime.\n It\u2019s likely at least  ~\u00a33.6m in today\u2019s money was lost because the down payment owed on the \u00a324m of bonds sold was 15%, according to Sinclair\u2019s book.\n MacGregor also sold  ~500 grants of land (for amounts such as  100 acres and 1k acres) and bilked investors and settlers out of untold amounts of British pounds exchanged for fake Poyais currency.\n   Knowing more trouble lay ahead as his victims returned, MacGregor fled to France. He escaped prosecution for his fraud and tried selling land in Poyais twice more before retiring to Venezuela.\n And a peculiar thing happened when the Poyais survivors got back to Britain. Despite MacGregor organizing the scam and causing the deaths of their loved ones, they didn\u2019t blame him.\n In fact, when Hastie and several other passengers from the  Kennersley Castle read news coverage about Poyais, they were angry. They strode into the Mansion House, a seat of the London government, and signed  an affidavit stating they believed MacGregor had done nothing wrong. That he was a victim as well.\n And so, the scam ended as so many do, with the charismatic con artist getting away unscathed.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 07:43:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u827a\u672f,\u6295\u8d44\u8005,artist,poyais", "title": "\u9500\u552e\u4e30\u5bcc\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u662f\u5047\u56fd\u5bb6", "title_en": "The con artist who sold rich investors a fake country", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thehustle.co/the-con-artist-who-sold-rich-investors-a-fake-country/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u827a\u672f", "\u6295\u8d44\u8005", "artist", "poyais"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9a06b1320483df33cac03a2bda3ea941.jpg", "infoid": 1072571, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u90fd\u8bbe\u60f3\u65e5\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f1a\u60f3\u8c61\u4e00\u4e0b\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5929\u5802;\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u65e5\u672c\u6587\u5316\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u662f\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e5\u672c\u5546\u4e1a\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7269\u54c1\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u6c49\u8bfa\u6233\u662f\u5f00\u5c55\u4e1a\u52a1\u548c\u7b7e\u7f72\u6587\u4ef6\u65f6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u90a3\u4e48\u65e5\u672c\u6c49\u8bfa\u90ae\u7968\u7a76\u7adf\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e48\u91cd\u8981\uff1f\n\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u591a\u4eba\u90fd\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u3002\u8fd9\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f60\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f60\u662f\u5426\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u5408\u540c\u3002\u5373\u4fbf\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u662f\u5916\u56fd\u4eba\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u53ea\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7b7e\u540d\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6c49\u8bfa\u5e93\u7684\u5408\u540c\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u51e0\u5929\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6c49\u8bfa\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u518c\u5b83\u3002\nDaisekirinzan\uff08\u5927\u777f\u6797\u5c71\uff09\u5305\u542b\u8bb8\u591a\u5947\u602a\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u4e0e\u6d77\u71d5\u6811\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u963f\u4ec0\u7c73\u5229\u7684\u5c71\u4e0a\u3002", "note_en": "When most people envision Japan, they picture a high-tech, robotic paradise; however, the reality is that in many ways, many aspects of Japanese culture are exactly the opposite. Particularly in the Japanese business world, one outdated, simple item known as a hanko stamp is the key when it comes to conducting business and signing papers. So what exactly is a Japanese hanko stamp, and why is it so important?\n  Hanko, also known as  inkan, are stamps that can be used anytime someone needs to use a signature or initial something. Hanko are used for both individuals or for people acting on behalf of a business. A hanko is one\u2019s personal seal and they are used as a \u201csignature\u201d in many different situations, from serious matters such as banking to a more casual instance of receiving a package.\n While the idea of a personal seal is cool, many people find it a bit annoying to require a stamp when a signature would accomplish the same task. Especially if you run into a situation where you\u2019ve forgotten yours at home and they can\u2019t just use your signature. In 2020, the Japanese government, in its attempts to modernize its very old school business world, decided to phase out the use hanko. This phase out may take some time or may never actually even happen, so for now, hanko are still very much a thing.\n  Jitsuin  ( \u5b9f\u5370 ) \u2013 This is a person\u2019s officially registered seal that has to be registered at a town hall. It comes with an inkan card, which allows you to print certificates of registration (for a small fee). The certificates are normally needed to prove the seal is registered to you and not someone else. This seal may be required when buying a home, car, or other big and expensive items. Also things like setting up a company or taking out a loan require a  jitsuin.\n Ginkoin  ( \u9280\u884c\u5370 ) \u2013 \u201cGinko\u201d meaning bank and \u201cin\u201d meaning seal. A  ginkoin is used exclusively at the bank. This means instead of registering the hanko stamp with the city hall, it will need to be registered at the bank. If you need to do something at the bank, make sure you have your  ginkoin with you.\n Mitomein ( \u8a8d\u3081\u5370) \u2013 Mitome means \u201capproval\u201d and this seal is for personal use. A  mitomein isn\u2019t registered anywhere and therefore isn\u2019t legal binding in the same way as a  jitsuin. This makes it more useful for things like signing for a package. Things that require a  jitsuin will ask for a certificate or registration, which is why  jitsuin are legal binding and  mitomein aren\u2019t.\n Technically you can just use one hanko stamp for all of these different situations. However, it may not be wise to do so because your  jitsuin is basically a signature and it can be copied fairly easily. So the less you use it, especially for things where a  mitomein would suffice, the less likely it is to be copied.\n  Probably not, but many people do just in case. It depends on what you do and whether you sign many contracts. Even then, if you\u2019re foreigner, you can probably just sign your name in most circumstances. If there is a contract that requires a hanko, then it only takes a couple days to get a new hanko and to register it.\n  There are many hankoya (hanko shops) that specialize in making and selling hanko. You can order online at shops like  hankoya.com. There are also in-person stores like \u201cHankoyasan 21\u201d, which is a common hankoya chain in Japan. Since hanko is a specifically Japanese thing, the online shops won\u2019t have any English, so make sure you can read Japanese or at least be ready to Google translate.\n If you just want a hanko as a souvenir you could buy from one of the online or specialty shops above; however if you want to save a little money, there are cheaper options. Generic hanko for much cheaper can be found at 100 yen stores like Daiso. These will have common Japanese names or words rather than custom seals. And, because they are generic, they aren\u2019t allowed to be used as a  jitsuin or  ginkoin. If you\u2019re looking for a cheap but usable hanko, then shops like Donquiote have machines that sell customizable hanko for around 500 yen.\n  There are a few rules for what you can use for your seal. The most important rule is that it has to contain part of your name. It is supposed to be your whole name, but for foreign names they might not fit, so you can do either your whole, just your first, or just your last name. Also, the characters used must be actually part of your name, so using English letters or even the katakana version of your name is fine. However, you can\u2019t use kanji with similar readings/sounds for your name. If you do choose katakana, then it\u2019s important to make sure you have that katakana named registered somewhere\u00a0on something like a residence card. Otherwise your hanko might be rejected when you try to register it since it wouldn\u2019t technically be your official name.\n  While it is a bit of a hassle, it\u2019s not the end of the world if you happen to lose your hanko. In the case of losing your  ginkoin, you\u2019ll need to contact your bank and let them know. They will have you cancel/invalidate the registration for your lost hanko and you\u2019ll then need to register a new seal with them.\n It\u2019s a similar process if you lose your  jitsuin; however, you must contact the local government office where you originally registered it. They\u2019ll then have you sign some paperwork to cancel your lost hanko and you can get a new one to register. Also, it\u2019s a good idea to contact the police if you lose your hanko. Both to make them aware in case someone tries to use it and also because someone may turn it in to police and you could possibly recover it.\n         Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n Daisekirinzan (\u5927\u77f3\u6797\u5c71) contains many oddly shaped rocks, a beautiful forest with bayan trees, and is situated on the mountain of Ashimui.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 07:41:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65e5\u672c,hanko,\u6c49\u8bfa", "title": "\u65e5\u672c\u6c49\u8bfa\u90ae\u7968\uff1a\u65e5\u672c\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u5bc6\u5c01\u6307\u5357", "title_en": "Japanese Hanko Stamp: Guide to Japan\u2019s Personal Seals", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.japancentric.com/japanese-hanko-stamp-guide-to-japans-personal-seals/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65e5\u672c", "hanko", "\u6c49\u8bfa"]}]
