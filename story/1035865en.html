First, a number of behaviours appear to be characteristic of mammals. Those behaviours can be used as taxonomic markers alongside physical traits—a suggestion Konrad Lorenz made long ago, but which has been largely ignored. Second, some of those behaviours have heretofore been thought of as characteristic of human beings, but can now be seen as an extension of evolution.</p><p>2017年，我在佛罗里达科学院发表了题为“做哺乳动物的重要性”的论文。其论点是三方面的。首先，许多行为似乎是哺乳动物的特征。这些行为可以与身体特征一起用作分类标志。这是康拉德·洛伦兹（Konrad Lorenz）很久以前提出的建议，但实际上已被忽略。第二，迄今为止，其中一些行为被认为是人类的特征，但现在可以看作是进化的延伸。</p><p> I call these behaviours “the mammalian factor.” These behaviours have been overlooked by both ethologists and comparative psychologists and there is scant, if any, formal documentation of them in the professional literature. But they can be observed and anecdotal stories and videos could be used as a starting point for research. There is historical precedent for using anecdotes as the basis for scientific investigation, as in reports of a snow-capped mountain in central Africa (Mt. Kilimanjaro), an aquatic mammal with a duck’s bill that lays eggs and injects poison (the platypus) and a huge, hairy, human-like monster from central Africa (the gorilla).</p><p> 我称这些行为为“哺乳动物因素”。这些行为已被伦理学家和比较心理学家所忽视，并且在专业文献中也没有（如果有的话）正式文件。但是可以观察到它们，并且轶事故事和视频可以用作研究的起点。使用轶事作为科学研究的基础已有历史先例，例如在非洲中部一座雪山（乞力马扎罗山）的报道中，这是一种水生哺乳动物，带有鸭嘴，可产卵并注入毒药（鸭嘴兽），来自非洲中部（大猩猩）的巨大的，多毛的，类似人的怪物。</p><p>    To my knowledge, there has been no formal study of kissing in non-human animals, although a perusal of Google Images reveals a plethora of mammals kissing each other. Usually, at least one of the participants closes its eyes as it is being kissed and, if bipeds are involved, one of them will hold the face of the other kisser. In elephants, the trunks intertwine.</p><p>    据我所知，没有对非人类动物接吻的正式研究，尽管对Google图片的细读显示，有大量的哺乳动物互相接吻。通常，至少有一个参与者在被亲吻时会闭上眼睛，如果涉及到两足动物，则其中一个会握住另一个亲吻者的脸。在大象中，树干交织在一起。</p><p>     There have been several instances of an animal of one species helping an animal of a different species. For example, a hippopotamus was recorded lifting up a duckling that was unsuccessfully trying to get out of a  pond, a bear rescued a  crow from drowning, a  cat attacked a dog that was trying to maul a toddler, a  dog saved a cat from drowning, humans  have saved various wild animals in distress, a dolphin helped a beached pygmy sperm  whale, a  rabbit dug out a trapped cat and a rhinoceros freed a zebra  foal that was immobilized by mud. The hippopotamus and rhinoceros examples are particularly interesting, since those species are notorious for being highly aggressive.</p><p>     已经有几种实例，一种物种的动物帮助另一种物种的动物。例如，记录到一只河马抬起了一只未能设法从池塘中出来的小鸭，一只熊救了一只乌鸦免于溺水，一只猫袭击了一只正试图trying伤蹒跚学步的狗，一只狗救了一只猫免于溺水，人类拯救了各种濒临灭绝的野生动物，一只海豚帮助了一只搁浅的侏儒抹香鲸，一只兔子挖了一只被困的猫，犀牛释放了被泥土固定的斑马驹。河马和犀牛的例子特别有趣，因为这些物种因具有高度侵略性而臭名昭著。</p><p>  There have been many anecdotal accounts of similar behaviours. A child that had been lost in Africa was found, guarded from hyenas by a pride of lions. Once the human rescuers arrived, the lions calmly got up and walked away. Last year, a toddler who spent the night alone in a wintry forest reported that a bear had stayed with him to keep him warm. For centuries, there have been reports of dolphins keeping capsized sailors afloat. These anecdotes, of course, do not qualify as scientific proof, but they do provide a starting point for further investigation.</p><p>  有许多类似行为的传闻。发现了一个在非洲迷路的孩子，狮子的骄傲保护着它免受鬣狗的伤害。一旦救援人员到达，狮子就会平静地起身走开。去年，一个蹒跚学步的孩子独自在一个寒冷的森林里过夜，据报道，有一只熊陪在他身边，以保暖。几个世纪以来，有报道称海豚使倾覆的水手漂浮。这些轶事当然没有资格作为科学证据，但是它们确实为进一步研究提供了起点。</p><p>   REM sleep has been found in dogs, primates, cattle, cetaceans, platypuses, moles, sloths, giraffes, opossums, rats, humans and cats. Some birds have also been shown to have REM sleep, though it appears to be minimal.</p><p>在狗，灵长类动物，牛，鲸类，鸭嘴兽，痣，树懒，长颈鹿，负鼠，大鼠，人和猫中发现了REM睡眠。尽管看起来很少，但也有一些鸟类表现出REM睡眠。</p><p>  With the exception of insectivorous mammals, mammalian predators—unlike fish, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates—generally prefer to kill their prey before eating it. For humans, the thought of swallowing a living organism generally arouses disgust.</p><p>  除了食虫性哺乳动物外，与鱼类，爬行动物，两栖动物和无脊椎动物不同，哺乳动物捕食者通常更喜欢在捕食前杀死猎物。对于人类而言，吞食活生物体的想法通常会引起厌恶。</p><p>    There is very little data on mammalian defecation. Nonetheless, there is isolated documentation that mammals may practice rudimentary hygiene when defecating: house cats bury their faeces, dogs wipe their hind legs, horses lift their tails. Jane Goodall reported chimpanzees using leaves as toilet paper. Approximately once a week, arboreal sloths will descend from the trees where they live to defecate and bury their faeces; during such times they are very vulnerable to predation. Several species use a latrine: that is, a specific location for defecation. It is also possible that faeces may be aversive to some species. However, this is complicated because some animals have anal scent glands and the chemicals produced by these glands may intermix with waste matter. These chemicals relay a message to conspecifics, who may therefore inspect the waste.</p><p>    关于哺乳动物排便的数据很少。但是，有单独的文献表明，排便时哺乳动物可能会进行基本的卫生操作：家猫掩埋粪便，狗擦其后腿，马举尾巴。简·古道尔（Jane Goodall）报告说，黑猩猩使用树叶作为卫生纸。大约每周一次，树栖树懒将从它们生活的树木上下来排便并掩埋粪便。在这样的时期，它们非常容易被掠夺。有几种使用厕所：即排便的特定位置。粪便可能会厌恶某些物种。但是，这很复杂，因为某些动物具有肛门气味腺，这些腺产生的化学物质可能与废物混合。这些化学品将信息传递给特定人员，以便他们检查废物。</p><p> Non-mammalian species, such as reptiles, insects, fish, amphibians, echinoderms and crustaceans display no unusual behaviours after defecating  vis a vis the faeces, although some species of birds do lift their tails to defecate and some remove scat from their nests. The usual behaviour, however, is simply to ignore the faeces. On the other hand, I have observed several fish species (foxheads, groupers, puffer fish, yellow tangs and damsel fish) turn around immediately after defecating to ingest and then spit out the faeces, repeating this behaviour two to four times before finally ignoring the faeces.</p><p> 非哺乳动物物种，例如爬行动物，昆虫，鱼类，两栖动物，棘皮动物和甲壳类动物，在对粪便排便后没有任何异常行为，尽管有些鸟类确实抬起尾巴排便，有的从粪便中清除粪便。但是，通常的行为仅仅是忽略粪便。另一方面，我观察到有几种鱼类（狐狸，石斑鱼，河豚，黄塘鱼和少女鱼）在排便后立即转身，然后吐出粪便，重复这种行为2至4次，最后才完全忽略。粪便。</p><p> This is another behaviour that appears to have been overlooked by comparative psychologists and ethologists.</p><p> 这是比较心理学家和伦理学家似乎忽略的另一种行为。</p><p>   Although interspecies bonding does not appear to exist in reptiles, insects, echinoderms, fish or amphibians, a few species of birds do exhibit interspecies bonding through the imprinting that occurs immediately upon hatching. Aside from the phenomenon of imprinting, there have been no formal studies of interspecies bonding.</p><p>尽管爬行动物，昆虫，棘皮动物，鱼类或两栖动物似乎不存在种间键合，但仍有少数鸟类通过孵化后立即出现的印记显示出种间键合。除了印迹现象外，还没有正式的种间键合研究。</p><p>  Tickling has been recorded in humans, rats and some apes. It remains to be seen how widespread it is among other mammals, since research has been scarce. Care must be employed to avoid misinterpreting grooming and scratching as tickling.</p><p>  在人类，大鼠和一些猿类中都有发痒的记录。由于缺乏研究，因此它在其他哺乳动物中的普及程度还有待观察。必须小心避免将修饰和刮擦误解为发痒。</p><p>  There is a dearth of formal studies of this. Whereas non-mammals often fail to react to the discovery of the corpse of a conspecific, or may even cannibalise it, some mammals react with stress. Documented, anecdotal instances of dogs mourning the death of their owners or of a conspecific are legion. Some chimpanzee mothers have been observed carrying the corpses of their offspring and some cetaceans have tried to keep their dead offspring afloat and have kept vigil over a dying or dead conspecific. There has also been one documented instance of a cat meticulously burying its  dead offspring and another of a  cat trying to revive an unresponsive  dead conspecific. Of particular interest are the accounts of elephants coming across the bones of familiar elephants and carefully examining them; there are some reports of elephants “burying” dead conspecifics by covering the body with dirt and vegetation. One avenue of possible formal research would be to ascertain whether similar behaviours can observed among solitary mammals.</p><p>  对此缺乏正式的研究。非哺乳动物通常对特定物种的尸体无反应，甚至可能吞噬它，而某些哺乳动物则对压力产生反应。有记录的，轶事性的事例是，哀悼其主人或同种动物死亡的狗。观察到一些黑猩猩的母亲携带后代的尸体，而一些鲸类动物则试图让死去的后代继续漂浮，并为垂死或死去的物种保持警惕。也有一个文献记载的猫精心掩埋了死去的后代的实例，而另一只猫试图恢复无反应的死同种。特别令人感兴趣的是大象穿过熟悉的大象的骨骼并仔细检查它们的记录；有报道说，大象通过在身上覆盖灰尘和植被来“掩埋”死的物种。可能进行正式研究的途径之一是确定在单独的哺乳动物中是否可以观察到类似的行为。</p><p>   In mammals living in herds, packs, pods, etc., such as bottlenose dolphins, chimpanzees, baboons and sperm whales, touch appears to be very important. Sometimes an individual will appear to request another animal’s touch and an animal that seems to be experiencing fear, agitation or anger will often appear to calm down if touched by others, whether the touch is cursory or more intense (such as hugging in primates). Adult humans who sleep alone will often hug a large pillow. Human infants who sleep with a parent may fall asleep on one side of the bed, but while they sleep they will rotate their bodies until one of their extremities comes into contact with the parent, whereupon they cease movement.</p><p>   在宽吻海豚，黑猩猩，狒狒和抹香鲸等生活在畜群，动物群，豆荚等中的哺乳动物中，触摸似乎非常重要。有时，一个人似乎会要求另一只动物抚摸，而似乎受到恐惧，激动或愤怒的动物如果被他人抚摸，往往会显得平静下来，无论抚摸是粗暴的还是更加剧烈的（例如拥抱在灵长类动物中）。独自睡觉的成年人通常会抱着一个大枕头。与父母同睡的人类婴儿可能​​会在床的一侧入睡，但是当他们睡觉时，他们会旋转身体直到四肢之一与父母接触，然后他们停止运动。</p><p>  In several famous experiments conducted by Harry Harlow, some monkeys who had previously experienced touching were later deprived of touching by conspecifics. They appeared stressed while isolated. Others, who had reared without ever being touched by a conspecific, exhibited permanent maladaptive behavioural aberrations (they were unable to socialize or mate).</p><p>  在哈里·哈洛（Harry Harlow）进行的几项著名实验中，一些以前曾接触过的猴子后来被同种动物剥夺了接触。他们显得孤立时感到压力重重。其他人没有被同种动物所抚养，却表现出永久性的适应不良的行为异常（他们无法社交或交配）。</p><p>   Individual mammals have unique personalities. Both researchers and laymen have often remarked that animals like dogs, cats, wolves, cetaceans, apes, pigs, horses and elephants display behavioural idiosyncrasies. Anyone who has owned several mammalian pets or livestock of the same species can attest that, like human children, each individual behaves differently from its conspecifics even though they are in the same environment and exposed to the same stimuli. Dogs and cats often seem almost human in their behaviours. I have never come across a crab, snake or trout that appeared to have a personality. It is highly significant that most animals we keep as pets and feel emotionally attached to are mammals, as opposed to crustaceans, insects, amphibians, fish or reptiles.</p><p>个体哺乳动物具有独特的个性。研究人员和外行都经常指出，狗，猫，狼，鲸类，猿，猪，马和大象等动物表现出行为特质。拥有几只相同种类的哺乳动物宠物或牲畜的任何人都可以证明，即使人类处于相同的环境中并受到相同的刺激，他们也像人类的孩子一样，表现出与众不同的行为。狗和猫的行为通常看起来几乎是人类的行为。我从来没有遇到过看起来很有个性的螃蟹，蛇或鳟鱼。与甲壳类，昆虫，两栖动物，鱼类或爬行动物相反，我们作为宠物饲养并在情感上依恋的大多数动物都是哺乳动物，这一点非常重要。</p><p> By  personality here, I mean a pattern involving behaviours that are part of the repertoire of a specific animal and are not only not the result of learning or conditioning but are resistant to alteration through learning or conditioning. Some researchers are of the opinion that individual differences in an inborn behaviour—for example, differences in ability to learn navigation in mazes in different strains of rats—are synonymous with personality. They have broadened the term to include even insects and nematodes because of differences in their degree of, for example, aggression. I believe that personality-defining behaviours are distinct from the core behaviours of a particular species (such as duration and speed of flight in birds or insects, maze navigation in rats, length and intricacy of courtship, degree of aggression towards conspecifics etc.). Most behaviours follow a bell curve distribution, just as physical traits do.  Personality refers to consistent behaviours unique to a particular organism.</p><p> 这里的人格是指一种行为模式，该行为是特定动物的全部组成部分，不仅是学习或调节的结果，而且是抵抗通过学习或调节而改变的行为。一些研究人员认为，先天行为的个体差异（例如，不同品系的老鼠在迷宫中学习导航的能力的差异）是个性的同义词。由于其侵略程度的差异，它们将术语扩展为甚至包括昆虫和线虫。我相信定义人格的行为不同于特定物种的核心行为（例如鸟类或昆虫飞行的持续时间和速度，大鼠的迷宫航行，求偶的时间和复杂程度，对同物种的侵略程度等）。就像身体特质一样，大多数行为遵循钟形曲线分布。人格是指特定有机体独有的一致行为。</p><p>  This is well documented in the literature. Some juvenile mammalian predators often have difficulty killing prey so the adults will often bring helpless prey to them, presumably to demonstrate killing or for the juveniles to practise on. Other instances of modelling have been recorded in bottlenose dolphins, meerkats, monkeys, dogs, golden hamsters and apes. Interspecies behavioural mimicry has also been observed.</p><p>  这在文献中有充分记载。一些幼小的哺乳动物捕食者通常很难杀死猎物，因此成年成年人常常会带给他们无助的猎物，以示杀戮或让幼虫继续练习。在宽吻海豚，猫鼬，猴子，狗，金仓鼠和猿中也记录了其他建模实例。种间行为模仿也已观察到。</p><p> Some mammals that live in groups also create a rudimentary  culture: defined as learned behaviours that are copied by other members of the group and transmitted to offspring. This has been witnessed in banded mongooses, orangutans, dolphins, orcas, monkeys and apes.</p><p> 一些成群生活的哺乳动物也创造了基本的文化：被定义为学习的行为，该行为被该群体的其他成员复制并传播给后代。在带状猫鼬，猩猩，海豚，逆戟鲸，猴子和猿猴中都可以看到这一点。</p><p>  This has also been thoroughly documented in the formal literature, though the formal definition of  play remains elusive. Play is much more frequent in juveniles than adults (although in some species, such as otters, bonobos and ferrets, there seems to be little quantitative difference). Animals often engage in spurts of aimless energetic activity. Juveniles tend to exhibit excessive, occasionally non-functional activity: the play behaviour is not goal-directed. Juvenile carnivores engage in wrestling or mock fighting with each other and occasionally with adults and sometimes chase each other. Juvenile herbivores tend to have spurts of running and chasing each other; sometimes they will abruptly jump straight up into a standing position and begin to run energetically. Mock fighting between juvenile herbivores is infrequent, except in horned species.</p><p>  尽管游戏的正式定义仍然难以捉摸，但在正式文献中也对此进行了详尽的记录。在幼年人中，玩耍的频率要比成年人高得多（尽管在某些物种中，例如水獭，bo黑猩猩和雪貂，数量上的差异似乎很小）。动物经常会进行无目标的精力充沛的活动。青少年倾向于表现出过多的活动，有时是无功能的活动：游戏行为不是针对目标的。幼年食肉动物互相搏斗或进行模拟搏斗，偶尔与成年人搏斗，有时互相追逐。幼草食动物倾向于奔跑和追逐。有时他们会突然跳起来直站起来，开始充满活力地奔跑。除有角动物外，很少有幼年食草动物之间的模拟战斗。</p><p>  These are not the only behaviours that can be classified as play (a  panda bear cub has been recorded rolling back and forth on a snow bank and putting snow on its face). Dolphins and beluga whales in captivity and whales in the wild have been observed to create air bubbles in the shape of a ring—a toroidal vortex—and swim through it or  push it around, like humans blowing smoke rings. Humans occasionally introduce floating toys to the tanks of captive dolphins and beluga whales, which they either grab or push around. These stimuli will not elicit similar behaviour when introduced into the shark tank. Bubble bursting by beluga whales may also be a play activity.</p><p>这些不是唯一可以归类为玩耍的行为（据记录，熊猫熊在雪堆上来回滚动并在其脸上放雪）。观察到人工饲养的海豚和白鲸以及在野外的鲸鱼会产生环形环状涡流（环形涡流）的气泡，游动或推动气泡，就像人类吹烟圈一样。人类偶尔会将漂浮玩具引入圈养海豚和白鲸的缸中，它们要么抓住要么四处推挤。当引入鲨鱼缸时，这些刺激不会引起类似的行为。由白鲸引起的泡沫破裂也可能是一种娱乐活动。</p><p>  Interspecies play takes place when there is no possibility of aggression or predation, even on the part of animals that would ordinarily be hostile towards each other. YouTube has a plethora of videos documenting this. For example, wild polar  bears have been filmed playing with dogs. When a member of one species initiates play with a member of another, the latter often appears confused or apprehensive because of the differences between the typical play behaviours of their respective species. Occasionally, this confusion dissipates and play ensues. Dolphins have been observed playing with whales, pinnipeds and humans (a New Zealand dolphin named Moko often played with humans). One cetacean  was filmed gently pulling a snorkeler down into the water by the leg and then bringing her back up to the surface. This could have been an instance of play.</p><p>  当没有侵略或掠夺的可能性时，甚至在通常会相互敌对的动物方面，种间游戏就发生了。 YouTube上有很多视频对此进行了记录。例如，已经拍摄了野生北极熊和狗一起玩的电影。当一个物种的成员开始与另一个物种的游戏时，由于另一个物种的典型游戏行为之间的差异，后者常常显得困惑或忧虑。有时，这种混乱消散并随之而来。已经观察到海豚与鲸鱼、,鱼和人类一起玩（新西兰海豚叫Moko，经常与人类一起玩）。拍摄了一只鲸类动物，将一条浮潜者的腿轻轻拉入水中，然后将其浮回水面。这可能是游戏的一个实例。</p><p>  Some investigators insist that non-mammals, such as reptiles, cephalopods and spiders, also engage in play. However, they may be anthropomorphizing.</p><p>  一些研究人员坚持认为，非哺乳动物（例如爬行动物，头足类动物和蜘蛛）也会参与其中。但是，它们可能是拟人化的。</p><p> The best stimulus to elicit play behaviour, whether in humans or animals, is probably a ball. This could be used as the basis of comparative studies across species. Rabbits, horses, bears, cows, dogs, emus, tigers, lions, monkeys, cats and moose ferrets have all been recorded playing with a ball (a  moose was recorded invading a football game and seemingly trying to imitate the humans kicking the ball around).</p><p> 无论是在人类还是动物身上，引发游戏行为的最佳刺激可能是球。这可以用作跨物种比较研究的基础。据记录，兔子，马，熊，牛，狗，tiger，老虎，狮子，猴子，猫和麋雪貂都玩球（记录到麋鹿入侵了足球比赛，似乎在模仿人类踢球） ）。</p><p> A ball introduced to reptiles, insects, echinoderms, fish, amphibians, crustaceans or most birds will not result in play behaviour.</p><p> 引入爬行动物，昆虫，棘皮动物，鱼类，两栖动物，甲壳类动物或大多数鸟类的球不会导致游戏行为。</p><p>  Lower animals, such as fish, crustaceans, amphibians, reptiles, insects and some birds, exhibit stereotypical behaviours: when presented with certain stimuli, they will behave in a specific, undeviating manner. A century ago, Jacques Loeb pointed out that insects can exhibit behaviours that resemble the tropisms of plants. A ladybird, for instance, will exhibit negative geotropism; if put on a blade of grass it will climb up and if the blade is reversed, it will turn and climb up again and this can be repeated numerous times. Once the insect reaches the top, it will open its carapace and fly away.</p><p>低等动物，例如鱼类，甲壳纲动物，两栖动物，爬行动物，昆虫和一些鸟类，表现出刻板印象的行为：受到一定刺激后，它们会表现出特定的，无懈可击的行为。一个世纪前，雅克·勒布（Jacques Loeb）指出昆虫可以表现出类似于植物的向性的行为。例如，瓢虫将表现出负向地性。如果放在草叶上，它将爬上；如果草叶反向，它将转动并再次爬上，可以重复多次。一旦昆虫到达顶部，它将打开其甲壳并飞走。</p><p> Mammals rarely engage in repeated stereotypical behaviour when presented with a task wherein they cannot directly obtain their goal, but will change their behaviour and attempt different strategies. This could provide one possible definition of intelligence in animals: the more complex the improvised strategy, the more intelligent the animal. Other behaviours can also be used as markers of intelligence and there are gradations in intelligence.</p><p> 哺乳动物在执行任务时很少会反复出现定型行为，因为他们无法直接获得目标，但是会改变行为并尝试不同的策略。这可以为动物的智力提供一个可能的定义：即兴策略越复杂，动物就越聪明。其他行为也可以用作智力的标记，并且智力有等级。</p><p>  Morality did not occur in humans spontaneously. It must have had animal precedents. Ethologists such as Frans de Waal have discovered that some mammals, particularly monkeys and apes, show a rudimentary sense of fairness and inequity aversion. Similar studies have been carried out with dogs and humans. Only species that are habitually gregarious and cooperative appear to demonstrate inequity aversion. Some studies have raised doubts as to whether the phenomenon exists and, if so, is confined to primates, or is an aspect of mammalian behaviour more generally. Further research on this is necessary.</p><p>  道德不是自然发生在人类身上。它一定有动物的先例。弗朗斯·德瓦尔（Frans de Waal）等人种学家发现，某些哺乳动物，特别是猴子和猿类，表现出基本的公平感和不平等厌恶感。对狗和人也进行了类似的研究。只有习惯上合群和合作的物种才会表现出不平等厌恶。一些研究对这种现象是否存在以及是否仅限于灵长类动物，或者更普遍地说是哺乳动物行为的一个方面提出了疑问。有必要对此进行进一步研究。</p><p>  At times, nature defies the human desire for orderly taxonomy. For example, there are mammalian monotremes that lay eggs (e.g. echidnas), flowering plants that lack chlorophyll and cold-blooded naked mole rats.</p><p>  有时，自然无视人类对有序分类法的渴望。例如，有些哺乳动物的卵单胞胎会产卵（例如针），缺乏叶绿素的开花植物和裸露的黑痣鼠。</p><p> The  Psittacidae (parrots) appear to have some mammalian behaviours. They exhibit play, learning through modelling, interspecies bonding and kissing and certain species are highly regarded for their intelligence. Some humans reciprocally bond with them, carrying them on their shoulders. This is never done with other avian species.</p><p> 鹦鹉嘴鹦鹉科（鹦鹉）似乎有一些哺乳动物的行为。它们表现出玩耍，通过建模学习，种间结合和接吻的能力，并且某些物种因其聪明才智而受到高度重视。一些人与他们相互联系，将他们扛在肩上。其他鸟类从来没有做到过。</p><p>   Humans have always asked what differentiates mankind from the other animals—by which they generally mean what makes mankind superior to other animals. Plato proclaimed that man was a featherless biped; hearing this, Diogenes of Sinope plucked the feathers off a chicken and threw it over the wall of Plato’s academy, forcing the philosopher to amend his definition. He added “with broad, flat nails.” When Niko Tinbergen, the Nobel prizewinning ethologist, was asked how human beings differ from animals he responded, “I wish I knew.”</p><p>人类一直在问什么使人类与其他动物有什么区别？它们通常指的是什么使人类优于其他动物。柏拉图宣称人是没有羽毛的两足动物。听到此消息，中石化的Diogenes从鸡身上摘下羽毛，然后将其扔到柏拉图学院的墙上，迫使哲学家修改他的定义。他补充说“指甲宽而扁平。”当诺贝尔文学奖获得者尼科·廷伯格（Niko Tinbergen）被问及人类与动物有何不同时，他回答说：“我希望我知道。”</p><p> For millennia, people have recognized that humans are related to animals and have often felt shame at the connection, believing that we should transcend our animal nature.</p><p> 几千年来，人们认识到人类与动物息息相关，并常常为这种联系感到羞耻，认为我们应该超越动物的本性。</p><p> In the past, it was believed that what makes mankind unique is our use of tools, or of language, our opposable thumbs or our large brains.</p><p> 在过去，人们认为使人类与众不同的是我们对工具或语言，对立的拇指或大脑的使用。</p><p> I would suggest that what makes us unique is that we are mammals—only more so. The mammalian characteristics have been amplified in human beings. This echoes Darwin’s supposition in  The Descent of Man that humans differ mentally from animals in degree rather than in kind and that, as Giovanni Boniolo put it, it is only logical to suppose that human behaviour evolved from that of our non-human ancestors. Some people may not like this idea.</p><p> 我建议让我们与众不同的是，我们是哺乳动物，而且更是如此。哺乳动物的特征已在人类中被放大。这与达尔文在《人类的后裔》中的假设相呼应，即人类在精神上与动物在精神上而非在种类上有所不同，而且正如乔凡尼·博尼奥洛（Giovanni Boniolo）所说，合理地假设人类行为是由我们非人类祖先进化而来的。有些人可能不喜欢这个想法。</p><p> If you enjoy our articles, be a part of our growth and help us produce more writing for you:</p><p> 如果您喜欢我们的文章，请成为我们成长的一部分，并帮助我们为您撰写更多文章：</p><p>    By checking this box, you confirm that you have read and are agreeing to our terms of use regarding the storage of the data submitted through this form.</p><p>选中此复选框，即表示您确认已阅读并同意我们的使用条款，有关通过此表格提交的数据的存储。</p><p>    You May enjoy Robert Sapolsky’s Stanford speech on the uniqueness of humans.
