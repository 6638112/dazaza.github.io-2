That\u2019s an easy one: with Cloud Native technology, culture, and strategy. But how do you get started in moving your organisation toward the cloud? That\u2019s not so easy\u2014the choices are many, risk shadows every decision, and the complexity of the whole thing grows as you move forward.\n Having an experienced guide can make a big difference. We have been helping our customers in a variety of industries move to the cloud since before Cloud Native had a name. We\u2019ve distilled the lessons we\u2019ve learned into a book,   Cloud Native Transformation: Practical Patterns for Innovation (O\u2019Reilly Media, 2020).\n   We are proud that our book is being used as a blueprint for Cloud Native transformation by real-life enterprises. You don\u2019t need to be an engineer to understand it. It\u2019s written as a survival kit for anyone whose organisation is thinking about how to reduce its risks and stay competitive in an uncertain business environment.\n The book\u2019s centerpiece is a library of more than 70 patterns, solutions that have worked for our clients. The patterns tackle the essential elements of Cloud Native: architecture, process, technology, and culture.\n  What patterns are, how to use them, and how WealthGrid uses them to map its own Cloud Native journey.\n  \u2018The people at Container Solutions think differently, don\u2019t play it safe, and seem to have a lot of fun along the way,\u2019 writes Adrian Cockcroft, noted cloud architect and engineer, in the book\u2019s Foreword.  \u2018They\u2019ve worked on some very interesting projects over the years, and this is an unusual book\u2019.\n     P ini Reznik,  chief revenue officer and co-founder of Container Solutions, is a developer and configuration manager who\u2019s spent more than 20 years improving development processes and shortening time to market.\n Jamie Dobson, chief executive officer and co-founder of Container Solutions, has more than 20 years\u2019 experience\u00a0as a developer and a leader, focusing most recently on strategy formulation and execution.\n    Michelle Gienow, senior content marketing manager\u00a0at Gatsby, is a former content team lead at Container Solutions.

said Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, at  the Paris Air Forum. &#34;Ariane 6 is our most important launcher to come. We have to put all the energy and all the emphasis into making the maiden flight as soon as possible.\n Together with the leaders of the French space agency, CNES, and the Ariane 6&#39;s prime contractor, Ariane Group, Aschbacher said he had put &#34;a small group&#34; together to make an independent assessment of the schedule for the final development phase of the Ariane 6 rocket. The goal of this task force will be to ensure that Europe does everything it needs to do launch on time.\n  &#34;This is a huge challenge that we need to work together on,&#34; Aschbacher said. &#34;Because don&#39;t forget we are in this together.&#34;\n In referring to an &#34;on time&#34; launch, Aschbacher said he meant next year, before the European Space Agency&#39;s Ministerial Council meeting that is typically held in October or November. This is a high-level meeting where representatives from each member nation of the space agency gather to set policy. The European Space Agency&#39;s budget is provided, in varying amounts, by member nations.\n    &#34;This is a must,&#34; Aschbacher said of launching before the 2022 meeting, &#34;because we need good news, and good success, for our politicians to see that Europe performs, that Europe delivers, and therefore it is worth investing in space in the ministerial conference.&#34;\n The Ariane 6 rocket is a heavy-lift vehicle being developed to replace the venerable European Ariane 5 rocket. Although it is not reusable, European officials intend for Ariane 6 to have a lower launch cost than its predecessor and thus to be more competitive with SpaceX&#39;s Falcon 9 rocket.  Some critics in Europe, however, have said the new rocket does not go far enough to challenge the reusable Falcon 9, which has put downward pressure on launch costs around the world.\n Ariane Group and its contracting partners have been formally designing and building the Ariane 6 rocket since 2014, when the Ministerial Council agreed upon its development. Originally, this rocket was supposed to launch in 2020. Last November, however,  European officials said they were now targeting the period of April through June 2022 for the first Ariane 6 flight. They cited both technical issues and the global COVID-19 pandemic that affected activities at development facilities in Europe and the rocket&#39;s launch site in French Guiana.\n The comments from Aschbacher, however, suggest that Ariane 6 is no longer on target to launch during the first half of 2022.

The rare but devastating infection can destroy the eyes and spread to the brain.\n Cases now top 31,000, rising from an estimate of dozens to a few hundred cases just last month. Media reports have tallied  over 2,100 deaths, but federal health authorities have not released an official death count.\n Past medical reviews have estimated that the fungal infection\u2014mucormycosis\u2014has an overall fatality rate of around 50 percent. However, mortality rates vary by patients\u2019 underlying condition and what part of the body the mucormycetes fungi invade. Infection can take hold in the gastrointestinal tract, skin breaks, lungs, and the blood.\n In India, the fungi appear to be mainly taking root in the nose and sinuses, where they can spread to facial bones, eyes, and even the brain. Once an infection is established, it can quickly become aggressive and lead to tissue death. If it spreads to the eye, many patients end up permanently losing vision and, in some cases, need to have their eye entirely removed to keep the infection from spreading.\n    Mucormycetes are a ubiquitous group of molds, and they typically only strike immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes. The soil-lurking molds love acidic conditions, making patients with  diabetic ketoacidosis\u2014a complication in which the blood becomes acidic\u2014particularly vulnerable.\n Medical experts hypothesize that the current surge of mucormycosis in India is down to a confluence of factors related to the COVID-19 wave. Many of the cases are occurring in people who are recovering or have recently recovered from COVID-19. The combination of poor hygiene amid the health crisis, the country\u2019s large number of people with diabetes\u2014particularly uncontrolled diabetes\u2014and  an over-reliance on glucocorticoid steroids appear to be playing a role in the fungal epidemic. Steroid use can help treat COVID-19, but it can also tamp down immune responses and make people vulnerable to opportunistic infections, such as mucormycosis.\n An expert in fungal infections referred to the situation as \u201c triple whammy,\u201d as Ars reported previously.\n In recent days, media reports out of India have noted  children having their eyes surgically removed because of fungal infections, local governments  declaring epidemics, and  black-market sales of treatments for mucormycosis.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:06:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

", "note_en": "A couple of organizations have popped up over the years to make the leap easier. For instance,  Patriot Boot Camp, which  I profiled back in 2018, works in the earliest days of the startup journey to help veteran founders learn the key skills of building a company and fundraising. Yet, there still remains a lack of networking and funding that particularly targeted this group of entrepreneurs.\n That\u2019s the opportunity that Emily McMahan and Sherman Williams, the two managing partners of  Academy Investor Network, saw when looking at their peers at the five U.S. service academies. The firm is targeting a final first fund of $50 million, and today announced the close of its anchor investor, insurance and financial services provider USAA, which will invest $2.5 million. Prior to USAA, the fund\u2019s first investor was  Scout Ventures, which focuses on frontier tech and  where McMahan is a venture partner.\n  McMahan graduated from West Point in 2001 right as the War on Terror began. I \u201cwent really straight into the action post 9/11,\u201d she said. From there, she pivoted into a startup targeting the federal market, before founding Capitol Post, which taught entrepreneurial skills to veterans and their spouses and also had a co-working space in northern Virginia  before folding into Bunker Labs in 2019.\n \u201cMy career has always been focused around community, working with entrepreneurs, and really kind of harnessing the energy of the veteran entrepreneur community,\u201d she said. She is based in DC, and also sits on the board of Patriot Boot Camp.\n  Meanwhile, Williams hails from the Naval Academy, graduating in 2003 before going on four deployments in the midst of the war in Iraq, which started just weeks before his graduation. He ultimately ended up at Chicago\u2019s Booth School, where he studied finance and pivoted his career into investment banking focused on M&amp;A. \u201cI knew I needed to learn a lot,\u201d he said. I \u201cstarted investing and advising startups while as a banker, and then made made the flip to work with Emily to start AIN Ventures.\u201d He\u2019s based in New York City.\n The firm\u2019s first foray into venture was building an investment syndicate composed of alums of the five service academies, which was launched in June 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ve got astronauts, we\u2019ve got Navy SEALs,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cWe really think that we\u2019re very well positioned as a group, because we\u2019ve all lived it on active duty, and now we continue to see it and continue to serve.\u201d The syndicate has invested in a handful of deals since launching, including into  Polco, an online community engagement platform for local governments, and online identity service  ID.Me.\n \u201cThis is also where a lot of our service academy grads are excited to have a seat at that table and help these companies scale, connect, hire, all of those things,\u201d McMahan said. \u201cSo we\u2019re really excited to be on par with some of these other institutions \u2014 the Harvards, the Stanfords \u2014 who also have these types of syndicates.\u201c\n Williams said the goal with the syndicate was to work out the investment processes for the firm before turning toward a more traditional VC fund model. They kicked off fundraising in January.\n The new fund has a two-track thesis of investing in veterans across industries while also selecting startups building \u201cdual-use\u201d technologies that are useful to the private sector and governments. \u201cCivic technology, disaster tech \u2014 think FEMA \u2014 defense tech, obviously the military, intelligence agencies, and space tech. Things in and around climate that will affect constituents and governments,\u201d Williams said as examples where he sees the firm investing. \u201cWe want the company, when it achieves maturity, to achieve the majority of the revenue outside the government.\u201d\n The firm centers its investing around the stage right after product-market fit, although since the veterans pipeline can be a real gauntlet, Williams said the firm will selectively invest at the pre-seed stage there.\n The firm is also seeking to diversify the ranks of both venture capitalists and founders. McMahan said, \u201cI\u2019m a female, Sherman\u2019s an African American, you know, even in the military, we\u2019re sort of a unique team, and so we think we are also able to reach out to a much broader audience of underrepresented minorities, women, and groups, and we feel like we\u2019re pretty attractive in terms of that as a team.\u201c\n USAA\u2019s anchor investment is perhaps not surprising given the financial services company\u2019s focus on active service members and veterans.

But pulling off remote work in the Aloha state takes more than a plane ticket and a laptop.\n  The pandemic devastated the state\u2019s economy. According to the Hawaii Tourism Authority, visitor arrivals fell 97.6% between August 2019 and August the following year. Employment in the state\u2019s leisure and hospitality sector, which accounts for nearly one in five jobs, fell 53% between February and August 2020, according to the Pew Center.\n  Thanks in part to state initiatives\u2014including pre-arrival coronavirus testing for visitors and marketing campaigns wooing remote workers\u2014tourism is on the rebound. In April, visitors reached nearly 500,000, compared with roughly 4,500 in April 2020.\n  One program, called  Movers and Shakas (named after the friendly Y-shaped hand gesture with extended thumb and pinkie that means \u201chang loose\u201d), was launched in December with local business leaders. It offers free airfare to remote workers who commit to staying at least a month and participate in volunteer activities. The program\u2019s 50 spots attracted 90,000 applications. Applications for the second round will open this month.\n  As it is elsewhere, reliable Wi-Fi is the litmus test for many. Some areas of the Hawaiian islands, especially rural regions, lack robust broadband or cellular infrastructure. Tomasz Janczuk, a 45-year-old based in the Seattle area who owns and operates a software-development firm, chose the three Big Island hotels that he and his family lived in for a month based on Wi-Fi strength.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

ready for one more player as Facebook has entered the scene. Announced today, Facebook has launched its own podcasting service to compete against the other major players. It was only a matter of time before Facebook took notice of how popular podcasting has become and decided to jump in.\n In addition to podcasting, Facebook will also offer members access to a live audio service called \u201c Live Audio Rooms.\u201d Facebook originally announced these services back in  April 2021.\n   According to Facebook, anyone who\u2019s a member of Facebook can easily create a podcast in moments. However, the podcast service is only being rolled out to a select few currently. It will be made available to everyone else later during Summer 2021.\n The Live Audio Room is similar to that of  Clubhouse and  Twitter Spaces. I currently have the updated Facebook app on Android, and the Live Audio Room option was available to test. In the room, I had the ability to invite anyone to an audio-only session, or I could switch it to live video whenever I wanted. Or I could provide a link to my room, allowing anyone to join. So far I\u2019ve tested this with a handful of issues and outside of some of those people not liking Facebook, it worked without a hitch.\n You can schedule when you want the Live Audio Room session to start. These sessions can hold up to 50 speakers and unlimited listeners. You can also collect donations, which will show up during the Live Audio Room session. This will be handle when people are trying to raise donations for worthwhile events.\u00a0With Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces already out there, it will be interesting to see if people will end up utilizing Facebook\u2019s tools.\n  While this all sounds positive, there\u2019s also a downside to this: they may retain live audio after it is no longer available or deleted. This is to enforce its policies, which will be done both by human moderators and machine learning. I can understand this, especially if this is to help to solve crimes or other nasty things. At the same time, this is the sort of stuff that got Facebook into hot water, over and over. At the same time, I\u2019m not going to point the finger solely at Facebook as I\u2019m sure Twitter and Clubhouse, to name a few, have similar policies.\n  The podcasting and Live Audio Rooms are only available via  Apple iOS and  Google Android, at least for now.\n So there you have it, another option for both your podcasting and audio room gathers.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:58:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "facebook,\u64ad\u5ba2,\u63a8\u51fa,launches", "title": "Facebook\u63a8\u51fa\u64ad\u5ba2\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u97f3\u9891\u5ba4\u670d\u52a1 ", "title_en": "Facebook Launches Podcast and Live Audio Room Services", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theouterhaven.net/2021/06/facebook-launches-podcast-and-live-audio-room-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u64ad\u5ba2", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launches"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067220, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Git\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7248\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u65b0\u624b\u7528\u6237\u4ee4\u4eba\u5bb3\u6015\u3002\u5f53\u4ed6\u4eec\u72af\u9519\u65f6\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u5b81\u613f\u5220\u9664\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u514b\u9686\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b83\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u719f\u7ec3\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u901a\u8fc7\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u3002\n \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e94\u8be5\u6c38\u8fdc\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5931\u53bb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6613\u4e8e\u201c\u4e22\u5931\u201d\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\uff1f\n \u55ef\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u592a\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u53bb\u4f60\u7684\u6570\u636e - \u800c\u662f\u6062\u590d\u5b83\u592a\u96be\u4e86\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60a8\u8981\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u201c\u9b54\u6cd5\u201d\u5492\u8bed\u6765\u64a4\u6d88\u5b83\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u5728\u539f\u5219\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u6015\u72af\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u4e2d\u95f4\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u529f\u6548\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u63d0\u4f9bgit\u64a4\u6d88\uff0c\u90e8\u5206git-bancless of\u5de5\u5177\u5957\u4ef6\u3002\u636e\u6211\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u76ee\u524d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8eGit\u7684\u6700\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u64a4\u6d88\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u64a4\u6d88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0cGit\u64a4\u6d88\u53ef\u4ee5\u64a4\u6d88\uff0c\u5b83\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0eGit Rhallog\u64a4\u6d88\u3002\n \u6211\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u7269\u54c1\u672b\u5c3e\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u6211\u7684\u5e0c\u671b\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u89e3\u51b3\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u65b0\u624bGit\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u81ea\u7531\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\n     Git\u64a4\u6d88\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u8fd1\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230Git\uff1a\u53c2\u8003\u4ea4\u6613\u94a9\u5b50\u3002\u8fd9\u94a9\u5b50\u89e6\u53d1\u4e86\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5206\u652f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f55\u5236\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u524d\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4ea4\u56fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5f15\u7528\u53ca\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u5230\u5176\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u521b\u5efa\u6216\u5220\u9664\u5f15\u7528\uff09\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u64a4\u6d88\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002 \n\u6211\u6700\u521d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86Git-Brancless\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u590d\u5236\u67d0\u79cdMercurial\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u4f9bGit\u64a4\u6d88\u529f\u80fd\u3002 \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Git is a version control system with robust underlying principles, and yet, novice users are terrified of it. When they make a mistake, many would rather delete and re-clone the repository than try to fix it. Even proficient users can find wading through the reflog tedious.\n Why? How is it so easy to \u201close\u201d your data in a system that\u2019s supposed to never lose your data?\n Well, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s too easy to lose your data \u2014 but rather, that it\u2019s too difficult to recover it. For each operation you want to recover from, there\u2019s a different \u201cmagic\u201d incantation to undo it. All the data is still there in principle, but it\u2019s not accessible to many in practice.\n Here\u2019s my theory: novice and intermediate users would significantly improve their understanding and efficacy with Git if they weren\u2019t afraid of making mistakes.\n  To address this problem, I offer  git undo,  part of the git-branchless suite of tools. To my knowledge, this is the most capable undo tool currently available for Git. For example, it can undo bad merges and rebases with ease, and there are even some rare operations that  git undo can undo  which can\u2019t be undone with  git reflog.\n I\u2019ve presented demos below, and briefly discussed the implementation at the end of the article. My hope is that by making it easier to fix mistakes, novice Git users will be able to experiment more freely and learn more effectively.\n     git undo is made possible by a recent addition to Git: the  reference-transaction hook. This hook triggers whenever a change is made to a reference, such as a branch. By recording all reference moves, we can rebuild the state of the commit graph at any previous point in time. Then we accomplish the undo operation by restoring all references to their previous positions in time (possibly creating or deleting references in the process).\n I originally built  git-branchless in order to replicate a certain Mercurial workflow, but the data structures turn out to be flexible enough to give us a  git undo feature nearly for free.

", "note_en": "Ben Higgins is a distinguished software engineer at cybersecurity company  ExtraHop and has extensive experience in protocols, parsing, encryption, security, systems and performance engineering.\n  One key element of the cyber executive order is a \u201csoftware bill of materials\u201d (SBOM) that vendors would be required to provide as part of the federal procurement process. The SBOM would detail the exact software components utilized in a given product, including any open-source components, making it much easier and faster for federal agencies to determine whether they are subject to a vulnerability uncovered in one of these components.\n The SBOM is an important step in shoring up federal cybersecurity, but it\u2019s not enough. Understanding the software components included in various products will help agency security teams react more quickly when vulnerabilities come to light, but in other scenarios, like SolarWinds-style supply-chain attacks that surreptitiously insert software components, its impact is limited.\n   That\u2019s why the Biden administration should extend the cyber executive order to include not only an SBOM, but also \u201cbehavior transparency.\u201d\n Transparency requirements are not a new concept in technology. Certificate transparency (CT) is a public ledger of all certificates issued by any public certificate authority (CA) that provides a framework for monitoring and auditing CA activity, while Apple\u2019s recently announced  App Tracking Transparency allows users to see what activity apps are tracking and opt out. Behavior transparency is a proposed application of this concept to known software behaviors.\n The purpose of a behavior transparency framework is to enumerate the expected actions of interest that a given piece of software will take on a device or on the network. This helps security analysts distinguish between expected noise and indications of compromise. This, in turn, can give security teams an advantage in identifying the exploitation of unknown vulnerabilities in any proprietary or open-source software.\n The good news is that the enumeration of common software behaviors is already a standard industry practice for external network activity. Most major software vendors, including  Meraki,  McAfee,  Tenable,  LogMeIn/GoToMeeting, and my own company,  ExtraHop, already publish lists of common product behaviors. Even  SolarWinds has documentation describing its network behaviors.\n But the Biden administration can help effect critical changes that improve upon this industry practice and improve the overall security posture for public and private organizations alike.\n  First, the cyber executive order should form a working group in partnership with representative software and security software vendors, as well as organizations such as  MITRE, to create standards for the types of network activity that must be included for full behavior transparency.\n At a minimum, this should include things like external network destinations, internal network connection behavior with other software components, and, where applicable, a list of associated network ports and the purposes for which those ports are used. The behavior transparency framework should also include other network behavior, especially (but not limited to) anything that looks like scanning or reconnaissance behavior.\n  Second, the cyber executive order should mandate that known software behaviors be published in a machine-readable format such as JSON or CSV that could be ingested into common security products like security information and event management (SIEM), firewalls, endpoint protection platforms, network detection and response, and change management tools.\n  This is a crucial distinction from the current model, in which most behaviors are listed on a webpage or in a PDF that isn\u2019t machine-readable. With this change, common security tools could use that machine-readable behavioral data to help build baselines for activity within an organization to more quickly and accurately detect deviations that indicate compromise. Meraki is already doing this by providing its list in CSV format.\n  Third, the cyber executive order should establish a clearinghouse for behavior transparency data, administered by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency or another appropriate federal agency. The status quo is to hunt around on a vendor\u2019s website, consult their in-product documentation or open a support case to find out about network behavior. If the information provided is incorrect, that\u2019s also a support case.\n The current decentralized approach is deeply problematic. Unfettered network access for enterprise software products introduces substantial security risk \u2014 Zero Trust frameworks have been established to prevent precisely this \u2014 but typical practitioners do not have the time or expertise to individually track down the expected behaviors of each piece of enterprise software they have in the environment. Without centralized access to behavior transparency data, even the best Zero Trust implementations will have major gaps surrounding enterprise software.\n A clearinghouse would provide a centralized repository for behavior transparency data, organized by company, product and product version. A forum like GitHub is an ideal mechanism for such a clearinghouse, providing a widely used, centralized repository for this information.\n  Fourth, the clearinghouse should include a mechanism by which product users can easily provide feedback to software vendors. Feedback can be in the form of issues or even pull requests, though the companies should be involved in approving changes. This way, deficiencies in the behaviors can be pointed out in a public forum. Most deficiencies will be for reasons like a product update that wasn\u2019t reflected in the behavior transparency data, though as time goes on, companies will ideally make it a practice to make sure these are kept up to date. But there will also be true positives found.\n  The SolarWinds software supply chain attack, first disclosed in December 2020, illustrates and underscores the importance of behavior transparency. Prior to December 11, when FireEye first identified the vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion software, at least two other cybersecurity companies,  Palo Alto and  Fidelis, identified that their SolarWinds installations communicating with the attacker-controlled \u201cstage 1\u201d avsvmcloud[.]com domain. Palo Alto observed and blocked additional malicious behavior, but at the time neither company determined that the communication with avsvmcloud[.]com itself was suspect. That\u2019s due in large part to the notorious amount of \u201cnoise\u201d involved in looking at network data.\n But if more organizations had ready access to SolarWinds\u2019 behavior transparency data, as well as a forum in which to compare deviations from the baseline, things might have played out differently.\n SolarWinds Orion doesn\u2019t reach out to a lot of external destinations, so when the first stage of the supply chain attack started hitting subdomains off of \u201cappsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud[.]com,\u201d an analyst on a threat hunt running a SIEM query, or a machine-learning-based EDR or NDR product armed with that information, might have more quickly determined that something was amiss.\n Likewise, a low-friction public feedback mechanism could have tipped off SolarWinds and the industry that what seemed like noise in isolation (\u201cappsync-api, seems legit?\u201d) was actually something far more nefarious.\n The cyber executive order, alongside the sanctions on Russia, are strong early indications that the Biden administration intends to take a far more proactive approach to cybersecurity. Critical to the success of these efforts will be the partnership the administration forges with private-sector technology providers. Establishing standards at the federal level for disclosures about software products will benefit cybersecurity in the private sector, as well as improve the overall security of the software supply chain.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:16:45", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168,executive,\u884c\u4e3a", "title": "Biden\u5173\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u884c\u653f\u547d\u4ee4\u5e94\u5305\u62ec\u884c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tBiden\u2019s executive order on cybersecurity should include behavior transparency\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/bidens-executive-order-on-cybersecurity-should-include-behavior-transparency/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168", "executive", "\u884c\u4e3a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "16dbe3eb1eeec1e941a4ab6bf2231c87.jpeg", "infoid": 1067218, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e2d\u6295\u8d44\u201c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u201d\u6295\u8d44\u4e8eCellforce Group GmbH\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6210\u5458Michael Steiner\u544a\u8bc9\u8bb0\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u7b80\u62a5\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5382\u8fd8\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u76846000\u4e07\u6b27\u5143\uff087140\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u7684\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5fb7\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u548cBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u5316\u5b66\u516c\u53f8BASF SE\u4f9b\u5e94\u9634\u6781\u6750\u6599\u3002\n \u7535\u6c60\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u7845\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9633\u6781\u6750\u6599\uff0cPorsche\u8868\u793a\u5c06\u663e\u7740\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u627f\u53d7\u9ad8\u6e29\u7684\u80fd\u529b -

The factory also benefited from a \u20ac60 million ($71.4 million) investment from the German government and the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where it will be located. Chemical company BASF SE was selected to supply the cathode materials.\n The batteries will use silicon as the anode material, which Porsche says will significantly boost the energy density and their capacity to withstand high temperatures \u2013 both important variables for racing cars, which must be recharged quickly, but challenging in battery production (batteries don\u2019t tend to like getting very hot).\n  For that reason, the factory will be small scale, at least compared to other automakers such as the 35 gigawatt-hour \u201cgigafactory\u201d capacity at the Tesla and Panasonic joint facility in Sparks, Nevada or even its parent company VW\u2019s plan to bring  240 GwH of production to Europe by 2030. Porsche and Customcells\u2019 aim is an annual capacity of 100 megawatt-hours, or around enough batteries for 1,000 vehicles, starting in 2024. The initial workforce is expected to grow from around 13 people to up to 80 by 2025.\n The automaker has no plans to scale the technology for use in Porsche\u2019s more mainstream lineup of vehicles, Steiner said, though he noted that there may be a chance for higher volume in the future if the company sees a potential to bring down production costs. \u201cIn this market, we are looking for special purpose cells for high-end cars and motorsports, and this is not available in the market today,\u201d he said.\n It may be a challenge to scale this technology to passenger vehicles. The silicon anode-based cell chemistry has not shown the capacity to function in very cold conditions or to remain stable over many charging cycles, Porsche said in a statement. But it wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a Porsche vehicle benefited from technology developed for the race track: its leading electric model Taycan borrowed many of its technical features from the Porsche 919 Hybrid racing car.\n Although the first vehicles to use these batteries will be Porsche-made, Steiner said the technology will be made available to other brands in the Volkswagen Group, like Lamborghini or Bugatti.\n \u201cThe battery cell is the combustion chamber of the future,\u201d Porsche CEO Oliver Blume said in a statement Monday. \u201cThis joint venture allows us to position ourselves at the forefront of global competition in developing the most powerful battery cell and make it the link between the unmistakable Porsche driving experience and sustainability. This is how we shape the future of the sports car.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:16:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6027\u80fd,\u4e60\u60ef,high,\u7535\u6c60", "title": "\u4fdd\u65f6\u6377\u7528\u4e60\u60ef\u4e3a\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7535\u6c60 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPorsche to make high-performance batteries in joint venture with Customcells\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/porsche-to-make-high-performance-batteries-in-joint-venture-with-customcells/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u80fd", "\u4e60\u60ef", "high", "\u7535\u6c60"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "17fc0b65066fe60754f721ca374b8e44.jpg", "infoid": 1067217, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6d88\u8d39\u7684Fintech\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u5728\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u90e8\u95e8\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d44\u91d1\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u7ea7\u6602\u8d35\u3002\n \u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u57282020\u5e74\u4ee3\u540e\u671f\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u7ecf\u8425\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n Neobanks\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u94f6\u884c\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u79fb\u52a8\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u5f80\u5f80\u7684\u4f4e\u6536\u5de5\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u63a8\u52a8\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u7403\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\uff0cNeobanks\u5728\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u60f3\u5230\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u4e0a\u3002\u79c1\u4eba\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6597\u58eb\u7ade\u4e89Neobanks\u7684\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168 - \u5ba2\u6237 - \u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u5165\u3002\n  \u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u63a2\u7d22\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e02\u573a\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u3002\u6bcf\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u90fd\u5728\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7d27\u7f29\u6216\u6bcf\u5468\u516d\u83b7\u5f97\u4ea4\u6362\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\u3002\n  \u6295\u8d44\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u613f\u610f\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7530\u7eb3\u514b\u65af\u7684\u589e\u957f\u548c\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e2d\u8d44\u52a9\u5de8\u989d\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u6025\u5267\u8fd0\u884c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u7f8e\u56fd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005Fintech Chime\u62ab\u9732\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u7684EBITDA  - \u4e00\u4e2a\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u516c\u5236 - \u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u7684\u65b0\u53f0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5d07\u62dc\u7684\u9769\u547d\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df1\u6df1\u7684\u65e0\u5229\u53ef\u56fe2020.\u4f46\u662f\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u6316\u6398\u5176\u5b63\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u597d\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u7ebd\u4f2f\u514b\u65af\u7ec8\u4e8e\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u672c\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\n \u6240\u4ee5\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6212\u5f8b\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u770b\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4eceStarling\u548cMonzo\u6316\u6398\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u6765\u81ea\u7f57\u798f\u7279\u7684\u6709\u70b9\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bfa\u8d1d\u514b\uff1f \n\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u955c\u5934\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684Romain Dillet\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e7f\u6cdb\u770b\u51fa\u7f57\u798f\u7279\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u76ee\u524d\u53ea\u5173\u5fc3\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u8d22\u52a1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002  \u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u4e3b\u65e8\u662f\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u662f\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bdb\u5229\u7387\u5141\u8bb8\u5176\u6bdb\u5229\u4e8e2020\u5e74\u98d9\u5347\u3002 ", "note_en": "Building a consumer-facing fintech company is expensive. And if you want to build one in a sector crowded by both incumbent companies and richly funded startups, it can be  super expensive.\n That was the  lesson we learned in late 2020 by examining operating results from a number of neobanks.\n Neobanks are essentially software layers atop banking infrastructure, offering consumers digital-first, mobile-friendly and often lower-fee banking services. The push to rethink consumer banking is a global effort, with neobanks cropping up in essentially every market you can think of. Private investors have shown up in droves to fund competing neobanks because they have the potential to secure users \u2014 customers \u2014 that generate revenues for long periods of time.\n  The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.   Read it  every morning on Extra Crunch or get  The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n  Investors have proven more than willing to fund huge investments in growth and product at many neobanks, leading to steeply negative operating results at the unicorns. In short, while American consumer fintech Chime has  disclosed positive EBITDA \u2014 an adjusted profitability metric \u2014 many neobanks that we\u2019ve seen numbers from have demonstrated a stark inability to paint a path to profitability.\n  Recent results from Revolut that  TechCrunch covered earlier this morning show that the company had a deeply unprofitable 2020. But if we dig into its quarterly results, there\u2019s good news to be found. Neobanks could be maturing into their cost structure at last.\n So today we\u2019ll parse the key Revolut financial results and look at what we can dig up from Starling and Monzo. Perhaps the somewhat good financial news from Revolut is not merely to be found at just one neobank?\n  Our own  Romain Dillet has a broad look at Revolut\u2019s business  here, if you would like a wider lens. We only care about its raw financial results at the moment.\n   The gist of these figures is that the company\u2019s revenue growth was solid, but improving gross margins allowed its gross profit to spike in 2020.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:16:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4f11\u606f,neobanks", "title":

before gathering in a dimly lit room packed with high-powered computers. There, coaches helped them learn to outmaneuver opponents in a digital fantasy world fraught with ambushes and monsters. School was over by 5 p.m., but individual practice continued well into the night \u2014 all in a hard day\u2019s work for the students at one of South Korea\u2019s many e-sports academies.\n \u201cI sleep only three or four hours a day,\u201d said Kim Min-soo, 17, a student who wore a brace around his right hand to lessen the pain from so much gaming. \u201cBut I want to become a star. I dream of an e-sports arena packed with fans all rooting for me.\u201d\n Students like Min-soo have brought the same intense competitive energy often associated with South Korean education to their training at e-sports academies. South Korea is considered a birthplace of e-sports, but the highly selective multibillion-dollar industry is still frowned upon by many in the country. The academies have worked to change that image and give thousands of young people a chance to pursue careers in a place where gaming has long been seen as a way of life.\n  \u201cIn South Korea, players must do homework on their game before playing it, because if they disrupt the efficiency of their \u200bteam, they can be expelled,\u201d said Jeon Dong-jin, Korea head of the American video game developer Blizzard Entertainment, during  a recent forum in Seoul. \u201cSouth Korean gamers are deadly serious.\u201d\n Online gaming took off sooner and faster in South Korea than anywhere else in the world. When the country began introducing high-speed internet in the late 1990s, it saw the proliferation of 24-hour gaming cafes called PC bangs.\n These dark, often underground parlors became hotbeds for gaming culture, eventually hosting informal tournaments. By 2000, South Korean cable channels were the first in the world to broadcast online gaming competitions.\n E-sports is now the fifth-most popular future job among South Korean students, after athletes, doctors, teachers and digital content creators, according to a survey by the Education Ministry last year. It will soon be a part of the Asian Games in 2022.\n Top players like  Lee Sang-hyeok, who goes by the gaming name Faker, earn as much fame and fortune as K-pop idols. Millions watch them play over livestream. Before the pandemic, fans packed into  e-sports arenas that looked like a cross between a rock concert and pro-wrestling stadium.\n  The allure can be hard to resist. Parents have dragged children to counseling for  gaming addiction or to rehabilitation  boot camps. When  conscientious objectors ask to be exempted from South Korea\u2019s mandatory military service, officials will investigate whether they play online games involving guns and violence.\n Grades fall. Sometimes students drop out of school to spend more time gaming. Yet precious few will get the chance to make it big.\n The 10 franchised professional e-sports teams in South Korea competing in League of Legends, the most popular game here, hire only 200 players total. Those who do not make the cut have few alternatives.\n Lacking good grades \u2014 and often high school diplomas \u2014 gamers will find themselves with limited job prospects. And unlike some American universities, South Korean schools do not offer admission based on e-sports skills.\n When  Gen.G, a California-based e-sports company, opened its  Gen.G Elite Esports Academy in Seoul in 2019, it wanted to address some of those challenges because \u201cthis is where most of the talent is,\u201d said Joseph Baek, program director at the Gen.G academy. \u201cSouth Korea is still considered the mecca of e-sports.\u201d\n The school trains young South Koreans and other students on how to turn pro and helps gaming buffs find opportunities as streamers, marketers and data analysts. Together with the educational company  Elite Open School, it opened an English-only program that offers students a chance to earn an American high school diploma so they can apply to universities in the United States on e-sports scholarships.\n  On a recent morning, the sleep-deprived teenagers filed into Elite Open School wearing masks and branded T-shirts and hoodies. Divided into classrooms named after American universities like Columbia, M.I.T. and Duke, they studied English, American history and other required subjects. Some commuted two hours each morning to school.\n \u201c\u200bMy challenge is how to keep them awake and engaged during class,\u201d said Sam Suh, an English teacher.\n The real work began in the afternoon, when two buses carried the young gamers to a modest concrete building in a residential area for another intense training session at the Gen.G academy.\n Anthony Bazire, a 22-year-old former Gen.G academy student from France, said he had chosen South Korea as his training ground because he knew the country had some of the best players. Today, top prize winners in  League of Legends,  Overwatch and  StarCraft II are mostly South Koreans.\n \u201cWhen you see people working hard, it pushes you to work hard,\u201d he said.\n  The Gen.G program, the first of its kind in South Korea, has even helped some students convince their parents that they made a smart career move.\n In 2019, his second year in high school, Kim Hyeon-yeong played League of Legends for 10 hours a day. \u200bHis skills improved as he romped his way through the digital fantasy world\u200b. That summer, he decided to become a pro e-sports player, and quit school.\n \u201cMy parents were totally against it,\u201d said Mr. Kim, 19. \u201cI told them that I would have no regrets, because this was the one thing I wanted to try in my life, throwing in everything I got.\u201d\n His mother, Lee Ji-eun, 46, was so distressed that she lay in bed moaning. Ms. Lee eventually decided to support her son after he asked her one day: \u201cMom, what dream did you have when you were my age? Have you lived that dream?\u201d\n  Mr. Kim researched the Gen.G program, which costs $25,000 a year, and led his mother to the academy to convince her that he could find success as an e-sports professional. He cleared a big hurdle to his dream this year by winning admission, based on his online game skills, into the University of Kentucky.\n Mr. Bazire, the French gamer, joined Gen.G\u2019s League of Legends team as a trainee player in March. He and other trainees receive modest salaries along with food and lodging at a shared apartment in Seoul. They practice up to 18 hours a day, 60 to 70 percent more than players he knew in France, he said.\n But becoming a trainee is little more than securing a toehold. Trainees must climb fast through the second division to the main league, where professional League of Legends players are paid an average salary of $200,000 a year, and prize money and sponsorship deals.\n With younger and nimbler talents catching up constantly, the careers of most e-sports athletes in South Korea end before they turn 26, around the time when Korean men in their late 20s feel pressure to begin their mandatory military service.\n Min-soo, the student who dreams of becoming an e-sports star, first felt the electrifying vibe of an e-sports arena when he was in middle school. Since 2019, he has woken up at 6 a.m. every day, taking a two-hour bus and subway ride to the Gen.G academy. He returns home at 11:30 p.m. and then practices more, seldom going to bed before 3 a.m.\n This year, he was finally considered good enough to start taking tests to become a trainee on a pro team.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a hard and lonely life, because you have to give up everything else, like friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am happiest because I am doing what I enjoy the most.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 23:06:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "sports,\u97e9\u56fd,rise,\u6e38\u620f", "title": "\u770b\u770b\u97e9\u56fd\u7ade\u6280\u573a\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5d1b\u8d77\uff0c\u6210\u5343\u4e0a\u4e07\u7684\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7ade\u4e89\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\uff0c\u5e76\u52aa\u529b\u5728\u8be5\u884c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u521b\u9020\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "A look at the huge rise of esports in South Korea, where thousands of young people compete to go pro, and efforts to create sustainable jobs in the industry", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/19/world/asia/south-korea-esports.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["sports", "\u97e9\u56fd", "rise", "\u6e38\u620f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "cda9e9d41d93a93666ef59f881ad4bb7.png", "infoid": 1067215, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Shopify\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u5546\u5e97\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5546\u5bb6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u4eec\u6362\u53d6\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u5165\u7684\u524a\u51cf\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\n \u65b0\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u8054\u76df\u8425\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u548c\u6c83\u5c14\u739b\u7b49\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u96f6\u552e\u5de8\u5934\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u63d0\u4f9b\u51fa\u7248\u5546\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u90fd\u6709\u5f88\u957f\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f51\u7ad9\u5c06\u4e1a\u52a1\u53d1\u9001\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u90a3\u4e9b\u9500\u552e\u3002 BuzzFeed\u5df2\u7ecf\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u65b0\u8ba1\u5212\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5176\u73b0\u573a\u3002\u719f\u6089\u6b64\u4e8b\u7684\u4eba\u4eec\u719f\u6089\uff0cShopify\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u6570\u5b57\u5a92\u4f53\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548cVOX\u5a92\u4f53\u3002\n    Shopify\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u5546\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5185\u5bb9\u53d1\u5e03\u8005\u94fe\u63a5\u5230\u5546\u5e97\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5546\u5bb6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4eba\u4eec\u6362\u53d6\u4ea4\u6613\u6536\u5165\u7684\u524a\u51cf\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u65b0\u751f\u8fdb\u5165\u79f0\u4e3a\u8054\u76df\u8425\u9500\u7684\u533a\u57df\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u53d1\u5e03\u5546\u548c...
