And of course, there is a clear moral argument for increasing diversity among top management teams (TMTs). But when it comes to explaining why having more female executives is associated with better business outcomes, and what specific mechanisms cause those positive changes, existing research is much more limited.</p><p>  研究表明，在许多其他福利中，高级职位上有更多女性的女性更有利可图，更为社会责任，提供更安全，更高的客户体验。当然，对于增加顶级管理团队（TMT）之间的多样性，存在明确的道德论点。但是，在解释为什么拥有更多女性高管与更好的业务结果相关时，以及具体机制导致那些积极的变化，现有的研究更有限。</p><p>  We set out to explore these questions by  examining exactly how firms changed their strategic approach to innovation after appointing female executives. We tracked appointments of male and female executives and analyzed R&amp;D expenses, merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) rates, and the content of letters to shareholders for 163 multinational companies over 13 years to determine how these firms’ long-term strategies shifted after women joined their TMTs.</p><p>  我们首先通过审查公司在任命女性高管后如何改变其战略方法来探讨这些问题。我们履行了对男性和女性高管的约会，并分析了R＆amp; D费用，合并和收购（M＆amp; a）率，以及13多年超过13年的163家跨国公司的股东的内容，以确定这些公司的长期策略如何转移妇女加入他们的tmts后。</p><p>  As leaders in the European market, the firms we analyzed were all actively involved in activities associated with strategic innovation (e.g., technology-based M&amp;A and internal R&amp;D) during the observation period — but we found that their approaches to those initiatives varied significantly. Specifically, we were able to identify three distinct trends around shifts in firms’ strategic thinking following the appointment of female executives:</p><p>  作为欧洲市场的领导人，我们分析的公司都积极参与与战略创新（例如，基于技术的M＆amp; A和内部R＆amp; d）相关的活动 - 但我们发现他们对这些举措的方法显着变化。具体而言，在任命女性高管之后，我们能够确定公司战略思维的转变的三个不同趋势：</p><p>    First, we found that after women joined the C-suite, firms became both more open to change and less risk-seeking. In other words, these organizations increasingly embraced transformation while seeking to reduce the risks associated with it.</p><p>    首先，我们发现，在女性加入C-Suite后，公司都变得更加开放，更改和寻求风险更少。换句话说，这些组织在寻求减少与之相关的风险时越来越多地接受转型。</p><p>  To quantify these subtle cognitive shifts, we first conducted a linguistic analysis of changes in company documents issued by the TMT. We used a standard  word categorization methodology that grouped terms like “bold,” “venture,” and “chance” as likely reflecting a greater propensity for risk-taking, while terms such as “create,” “transform,” and “launch” indicated more openness to change. We found that after appointing women to the C-suite, the frequency of terms in company communications that indicated a propensity for risk-taking decreased by 14%, while the frequency of terms suggesting openness to change increased by 10%.</p><p>  为了量化这些微妙的认知班次，我们首先对TMT发布的公司文件的变化进行了语言分析。我们使用了标准的单词分类方法，这些方法分组了“粗体”的术语，如“粗体”，“冒险”和“机会”，可能反映了更大的风险倾向，而“创建”的术语，例如“创建”，“转换”和“发布”表示更改的更加开放性。我们发现，在将妇女任命到C-Suite后，公司通信的频率指示风险降低倾向的倾向减少了14％，而表明开放性变化的次数增加了10％。</p><p>  This suggests that adding women to the C-suite does not simply bring new perspectives to the top management team — it shifts  how the TMT thinks. Our research indicates that female executives don’t just offer specific new ideas to the team; their presence actually makes the TMT collectively more open to change and less comfortable with risk-taking. And as we discuss below, this mindset shift was reflected in tangible changes to how these firms made key strategic decisions.</p><p>  这表明将妇女添加到C-Suite并不只是将新的视角带到顶级管理团队 - 它转变TMT的方式。我们的研究表明，女性高管不会为团队提供特定的新想法;他们的存在实际上使得TMT更加开放，可以改变和对风险的风险更少。随着我们在下面讨论，这种心态转变被反映在这些公司如何成为关键战略决策的切实变化中。 </p><p>    Specifically, we observed that when TMTs added female executives, they gradually shifted from a  knowledge-buying strategy focused on M&amp;As — which could be described as a more traditionally masculine, proactive approach — towards a  knowledge-building strategy focused on internal R&amp;D, which could be described as a more traditionally feminine, collaborative approach.</p><p>具体而言，我们观察到，当TMTS增加了女性高管时，他们逐渐从专注于M＆amp的知识购买策略转移;因为它可以被描述为更传统的男性化，积极的方法 - 迈向专注于内部R＆amp的知识建设战略; D可以被描述为更传统的女性，协作方法。</p><p>  Our analysis suggests that this shift was a direct result of firms’ increasing aversion to risk, as we found that when a TMT experienced a one standard deviation increase in propensity for risk-taking, the likelihood of doing an additional M&amp;A the following year increased, on average, by 10%, while TMTs that became less open to taking risks were significantly less likely to engage in M&amp;A activity. Conversely, we found that after women were appointed to senior positions and firms began to exhibit higher levels of both openness to change and aversion to risk, firms reported an average 1.1% increase in R&amp;D investments — and the average total R&amp;D investment of the companies in our sample was $6,538 million, so a 1.1% increase is substantial.</p><p>  我们的分析表明，这一转变是企业越来越厌恶风险的直接结果，因为我们发现，当TMT经历了一个标准偏差的风险倾向时，额外的M＆amp的可能性;次年平均增加了10％，而变得越来越不开放风险的TMT明显不太可能从事M＆amp;一项活动。相反，我们发现，在妇女被任命为高级职位和公司开始表现出更高层次的开放程度，以改变和厌恶风险，企业报告的R＆amp投资平均增加了1.1％ - 以及平均总R＆amp; D投资我们样本的公司为6,538百万美元，因此增加1.1％是大量的。</p><p>  3. The impact of female appointments was greater when women were well-integrated into the TMT.</p><p>  3.当女性融入TMT时，女性约会的影响更大。</p><p>  Finally, we found that the more effectively female executives were able to integrate into the TMT, the greater the impact they were likely to have on its decision-making. There are two key factors that can influence this:</p><p>  最后，我们发现，女性高管越有效地集成到TMT中，它们可能对其决策的影响越大。有两个关键因素可以影响这一点：</p><p>  Whether she’s the only woman: We found that adding female executives to the TMT only actually changed C-suite thinking in cases where the executive team already had at least one woman. This may be because teams that already had a woman in the C-suite were  more comfortable working with and including female executives, reducing the obstacles facing new female appointees.</p><p>  她是否是唯一的女人：我们发现在执行团队已经至少有一个女人的情况下，只有实际改变了C-Suite思考的女性高管。这可能是因为已经在C-Suite中拥有一个女人的团队更加舒适地与女性高管一起工作，减少了新女性委托的障碍。</p><p>  Whether she’s one of many new appointees: We also found that larger shifts in thinking occurred when the new female executives were part of a smaller cohort of new appointees. In other words, if a firm promoted 10 men and 2 women to senior roles, we would see less of an impact than if a firm promoted 5 men and 1 woman. This could be because incumbent senior managers may feel more threatened when a larger group is promoted into their midst, leading them to be less trustful and less welcoming of the newcomers, and thus limiting new executives’ ability to contribute effectively.</p><p>  无论是新的任命者还是：我们还发现，当新女性高管是较小的新任命队列的一部分时，我们也发现思维的更大转变。换句话说，如果一个公司促进了10名男子和2名女性的高级角色，我们会看到比一个公司促进5名男子和1名女人的影响。这可能是因为现任的高级管理人员可能会在促进群体中晋升到他们的中间时可能会更威胁，导致他们对新人来说不那么信任，更不受欢迎，因此限制了新的高管有效贡献的能力。</p><p>  Importantly, we measured all of these metrics both before and a full year after female executives were appointed to the TMT. This ensured that we were actually observing the effect of adding women to the C-suite, as opposed to simply documenting trends that were already in play before the addition of the female executives. We also controlled for other factors that may have correlated with changes in C-suite makeup, such as product strategy, R&amp;D investment levels, and female board representation, to isolate just the effects of adding women to the TMT.</p><p>  重要的是，我们以前的所有这些指标衡量了女性管理人员被任命为TMT的全年。这确保了我们实际上观察了将女性添加到C-Suite的效果，而不是简单地记录在增加女性高管之前已经发挥的趋势。我们还控制了可能与C-Suite化妆的变化相关的其他因素，例如产品策略，R＆amp; D投资水平和女性委员会代表性，以孤立将女性添加到TMT的影响。 </p><p>    While our study focused simply on demonstrating these causal relationships, there are a few potential hypotheses we can offer based on prior research that could start to explain the root causes behind our findings.</p><p>虽然我们的研究仅仅用于了解这些因果关系，但有一些潜在的假设我们可以根据先前的研究提供，可以开始解释我们发现背后的根本原因。</p><p>  First, a look at many women’s paths to executive positions sheds some light on why these leaders might simultaneously court change and avoid risk. To advance to the highest corporate levels, many women need to walk a  difficult tightrope: They often learn to stand out by promoting novel strategies in an effort to overcome stereotypes of timidness, but at the same time, the  hyper-visibility that comes with being the only one of an underrepresented group drastically increases the professional costs of making mistakes, and so they learn to carefully weigh the benefits of their innovative proposals with the risks of potential failure. Based on this common experience, one could expect TMTs to become more focused on balancing innovation with risk mitigation as more women join their ranks.</p><p>  首先，看看许多女性的行政职位的道路揭示了为什么这些领导者可能同时进行庭院改变并避免风险。为了推进最高的企业水平，许多女性需要走一个困难的绳索：他们经常通过促进新的策略来努力克服懦弱的刻板印象，但同时，带来的超可见度不足的小组唯一的一个大幅增加了犯错的职业成本，因此他们学会仔细衡量其创新建议的利益，潜在失败的风险。根据这种共同的经验，人们可以预计随着更多女性加入他们的行列，TMT就会更加专注于平衡创新与风险减缓。</p><p>  In addition, prior research suggests that female executives are likely to  care less about tradition and are more open to  challenging the status quo than their male counterparts. Behavioral psychology has found that these sorts of attitudes fundamentally increase others’  receptiveness to change, and so it would make sense that as more women are appointed to executive teams, it could trigger more open-mindedness in existing TMT members.</p><p>  此外，目前的研究表明，女性高管可能不太关心传统，并且更加开放，以挑战现状而不是男性同行。行为心理学发现，这些态度从根本上提高了其他人的改变的接受力，因此随着更多女性被任命为执行团队，它可能会引发现有TMT成员的更多开放性。</p><p>  Similarly, if the individual women entering the TMT are on average more risk-averse (as  studies suggest is often the case), their presence could cause the entire team to become more cautious. When an individual who seems more risk-averse enters a group,  research has found that it can cause other group members to believe that the group as a whole is more risk-averse than it actually is, which can in turn lead everyone to become less open to risk.</p><p>  同样，如果进入TMT的个体妇女平均越来越多的风险 - 厌恶（随着研究往往是案例），他们的存在可能导致整个团队变得更加谨慎。当一个似乎更具风险的人进入一个团体时，研究发现它可能导致其他团体成员相信整个人的厌恶比实际更令人厌恶，这又可以让每个人都越来越少开放风险。</p><p>  Finally, it’s also possible that these changes are simply the direct result of increasing diversity in the TMT.  Research suggests that having more diverse perspectives to weigh in on key decisions can make a group more open to change, and more likely to see change as feasible. At the same time, having a wider range of opinions to consider often slows down decision-making, decreasing the chances that the group will make rash or risky decisions.</p><p>  最后，这些变化也是可能只是在TMT中增加多样性的直接结果。研究表明，在关键决策上具有更多样化的观点可以使一个群体更加开放变化，更有可能看到可行的变化。与此同时，拥有更广泛的意见考虑往往会减慢决策，降低小组将制造皮疹或冒险决策的机会。</p><p>    Of course, the trends we’ve identified are by no means a hard-and-fast rule. There are a number of  famous  examples of women-led companies that prioritized M&amp;A over R&amp;D, and certainly promoting women to the C-suite is no guarantee that a firm will invest more in R&amp;D or avoid M&amp;A opportunities.</p><p>    当然，我们所识别的趋势绝不是一个艰难而快速的规则。有许多着名的女性领导公司的例子，优先考虑的M＆amp;一个过度的R＆amp; D，肯定会促进妇女到C-Suite，并不能保证公司将在R＆amp; D或避免M＆amp;一个机会。</p><p>  But because our analysis is based on a comprehensive look at all TMT appointments (not just CEOs) across more than 150 multinational firms, we’ve been able to identify patterns that may not be obvious when thinking about singular, highly-visible female CEO appointments. While there are plenty of well-known female leaders who exemplify the patterns we found —  Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin,  Lisa Su of AMD, and  Susan Wojcicki of Google and YouTube, for example, are all known for being catalysts for internal change and innovation — many of the executives in our study are not household names. The scope of our analysis allows us to refocus the conversation from the impressive achievements (or notable failures) of individual female leaders to the broader impact of gender equity in the C-suite.</p><p>  但是，由于我们的分析基于全面看看超过150家跨国公司的所有TMT预约（不仅仅是CEO），我们已经能够识别在思考单数，高度可见的女性首席执行官的思考时可能并不明显的模式。虽然有很多知名的女性领导者，举例说明我们发现的模式 - 洛克希德马丁的Marlynn Hewson，洛杉矶的AMD，例如谷歌和YouTube的苏珊Wojcicki，也闻名于内部变革和创新的催化剂 - 我们研究中的许多高管不是家喻户晓的名字。我们的分析范围使我们能够将个别女性领导人的令人印象深刻的成就（或标记失败）的谈话重新分开到C-Suite中性别股权的更广泛影响。 </p><p>  Furthermore, while our study focused solely on how firms change when women join the TMT and did not include information about the impact of other forms of diversity, we would expect to see similar findings for members of other underrepresented groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities.  Research suggests that the career trajectories of these executives have much in common with those of women who make it to the top, and so while it is outside the scope of our current work, we wouldn’t be surprised to see similar patterns for TMTs that add members from any underrepresented group.</p><p>此外，虽然我们的学习仅关注公司如何在妇女加入TMT时改变，但没有包含有关其他形式多样性的影响的信息，但我们希望看到其他经验组的成员的类似调查，例如种族和少数群体。研究表明，这些高管的职业轨迹与使其到顶部的女性有很大的共同之处，虽然它超出了我们目前的工作范围，但我们不会感到惊讶地看到类似的模式的TMTS添加任何代表性的组的成员。</p><p>    Despite numerous studies linking greater representation of women in the C-suite to positive firm outcomes, the mechanisms driving those changes have largely remained unclear. Our study begins to explore those mechanisms, finding that when women are appointed to the C-suite, they catalyze fundamental shifts in the top management team’s risk tolerance, openness to change, and focus on M&amp;As versus R&amp;D. To be clear, we make no claim as to whether these shifts are intrinsically “better” — rather, our research aims simply to shed light on exactly how the integration of female leaders at the highest levels of an organization impacts its approach to innovation, and ultimately suggests that including more women in executive decision-making may lead firms to consider a wider variety of value creation strategies.</p><p>    尽管众多研究妇女在C-Suite中与阳性的成果相连，但驾驶这些变化的机制在很大程度上尚不清楚。我们的研究开始探讨这些机制，发现当妇女被任命为C-Suite时，他们催化了最高管理团队的风险公差，开放性的基础转变，并专注于M＆amp;与R＆amp; D。要清楚，我们没有主张这些班次是本质上的“更好” - 相反，我们的研究只是简单地阐明了女性领导人在最高水平的融合方式如何影响其创新方法，以及最终表明，在执行决策中包括更多妇女可能导致公司考虑更广泛的价值创造策略。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://hbr.org/2021/04/research-adding-women-to-the-c-suite-changes-how-companies-think">https://hbr.org/2021/04/research-adding-women-to-the-c-suite-changes-how-companies-think</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/女性/">#女性</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/adding/">#adding</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
