He claimed to be the only remaining survivor of a volcano that killed  an estimated 30,000–40,000 people and flattened the city of Saint-Pierre (known as the “Paris of the West Indies”) on the island of Martinique.</p><p> 事实上，他的故事太令人惊叹了Barnum＆amp; Bailey聘请他与马戏团一起旅行，而不是因为他有一个行为，而是因为他是一种遗物。他声称是火山唯一的剩余幸存者，估计估计了30万到40,000人，并在马提尼克岛上展开了圣皮埃尔（称为“西印度群岛的”巴黎“）。</p><p> In reality, his claim of being the only survivor isn’t entirely true. Still, his story is astonishing despite this detail.</p><p> 实际上，他作为唯一的幸存者的主张并不完全是真的。尽管如此，他的故事仍然是惊人的。</p><p> Ludger was not a nice guy. Born in 1875 on Martinique, Ludger (his actual name was Louis-Auguste) was a convicted felon who liked to drink and liked to fight. So it was no surprise when he was arrested for getting in yet another fight on May 7, 1902. Irritated with his antics, the police threw him into solitary confinement, a tiny, half-underground cell with no windows and only a very narrow slit in the door facing out to sea. The police didn’t realize it, but they had just saved Ludger’s life.</p><p> 路德不是一个好人。 Ludger（他的实际名字是Louis-Auguste）的1875年出生于Ludger（他的实际名字）是一个被定罪的重罪犯，他们喜欢喝酒并喜欢战斗。因此，当他在1902年5月7日被捕时，当他被捕时，他被捕时毫不奇怪。警方刺激了他的讽刺，他陷入了单独的监禁，一个没有窗户，只有一个非常狭窄的狭缝在门上朝海的门口。警方没有意识到这一点，但他们刚刚挽救了湖边的生活。</p><p>  The Mt. Pelée volcano had been showing signs of erupting for over a week. Since modern vulcanology did not yet exist, no one knew what to expect.  In fact, people had been planning to have a picnic on the volcano just three days before the eruption, but had to cancel due to the ash that was starting to come down. Just before the volcano erupted, thousands came from the countryside into the city to seek refuge. That was a big mistake.</p><p>  Mt. Pelée火山一直显示出爆发一周的迹象。由于现代硫磺尚未存在，没有人知道预期的预期。事实上，人们一直计划在火山前三天在火山上野餐，但由于开始下来的灰烬必须取消。就在火山爆发之前，数千人来自农村进入城市寻求避难所。这是一个很大的错误。</p><p> Mt. Pelée exploded and a cloud of smoke darkened the sky for fifty miles around. A cloud of superheated volcanic gas and dust rolled out of the volcano at hundreds of miles per hour, destroying everything in an eight mile radius. Within a single minute the 1,075 degree pressure wave had flattened every building in the city of St. Pierre. Anyone unlucky enough to be in its way instantly caught fire and burned to death. Even those in shelters were suffocated as the wave of super heated gas burned up the oxygen and replaced it with deadly gases. People’s lungs were burned from the inside by taking even a single breath. Nearly all 30,000 residents of the island were killed instantly, and the city burned for days afterward.</p><p> 公吨。 Pelée爆炸了，烟雾缭绕，在周围五十英里变暗。一片过热的火山气体和粉尘从火山上滚出来，每小时数百英里，八英里半径摧毁所有内容。在单一的一分钟内，1,075度压力波在圣皮埃尔市的每座建筑中展平。任何人不幸的是，瞬间瞬间起火并被烧死。即使是那些避难所的人也被窒息，因为超级加热气体烧毁氧气并用致命气体替换它。人们的肺部通过甚至呼吸从内部燃烧。几乎所有30,000名岛屿的居民立即被杀，城市后几天烧了。</p><p> Ludger couldn’t have been more lucky. He was found four days after the eruption by a rescue team who heard his cries. Despite being in the safest place on the island, he was horribly burned as the air in his room had flash heated to over 1,000 degrees. Ludger described the experience of seeing the light coming through the slit grow dark, and then superheated ash flying in. He urinated on his clothes and stuffed them in the slit, but it didn’t stop the heat.</p><p> Ludger不可能更加幸运。在救援队爆发后，他被发现了四天被发现。尽管在岛上的最安全的地方，但他的房间里的空气闪蒸到超过1000度时，他被烧毁了。 Ludger描述了看到通过狭缝的光的经验变得变黑，然后过热的灰烬飞翔。他挤进他的衣服，把它们塞进一个狭缝中，但它没有阻止热量。 </p><p> Ludger wasn’t the only one to survive the eruption, however. Sailors moored off the coast are said to have survived, as well as some residents of the island who are said to have died later from their burns. Of those who lived to tell of the event, only three names are known. One was a little girl named Havivra Da Ifrile. She is said to have seen the volcano beginning to erupt, and escaped by climbing into a boat and rowing to a cave where she and her friends used to play pirates. In her words: “Before I got there I looked back—and the whole side of the mountain which was near the town seemed to open and boil down on the screaming people. I was burned a good deal by the stones and ashes that came flying about the boat, but I got to the cave.” She was found floating unconscious in a burned and broken boat two miles out at sea.</p><p>然而，Ludger不是唯一一个生存爆发的人。据说沿海停泊的水手们据说幸存下来，以及据说岛屿的一些居民以后从他们的烧伤中死亡。那些住在一起的那些事件的人，只知道三个名字。一个是一个名叫havivra difrile的小女孩。据说她已经看到火山开始爆发，并爬进船上划船并划船到洞穴，她和她的朋友们曾经打海盗。在她的话说：“在我到达那里，我回到了镇附近的山的整个一侧似乎打开并沸腾了尖叫的人。我被带领船上飞行的石头和灰烬烧了很多，但我到了洞穴。“她被发现漂浮在海上两英里两英里的烧毁和破碎的船上无意识。</p><p> Another man, Léon Compère-Léandre, is said to have survived as well, though not much is known about him. It is unclear exactly how he survived. His own account describes being in a house during the disaster, but most scientists think that this is unlikely, and that he must have been saved by jumping (or being blown into) the ocean. He was thought to be a madman when he showed up naked and burned in the town of Fort-de-France. Leon’s luck was the opposite of Ludger’s, and he was nearly killed by the volcano twice more during subsequent explosions. He eventually died from a fall.</p><p> 另一个男人LéonCompère-Landre据说也幸存下来，虽然并不多对他而闻名。既不清楚他究竟是如何幸存的。他自己的帐户描述了在灾难期间在一所房子里，但大多数科学家认为这不太可能，他必须通过跳跃（或被吹进）海洋来节省。他被认为是疯子，当他出现赤身裸体并在堡垒德法斯镇烧毁。莱昂的运气与Ludger的运气相反，在随后的爆炸期间，他几乎被火山杀死了两次。他最终从秋天死亡。</p><p> Ludger’s luck, on the other hand, couldn’t have been better. After surviving the volcano he was pardoned for his crimes, and hired to tour with Barnum &amp; Bailey and tell the story of the horrific events he’d experienced. Ludger became something of a celebrity and was known as “the man who lived through Doomsday” and “the Most Marvelous Man in the World.” It is thought by some that the night he was imprisoned he was actually being put away for murder, which was why he was in solitary, but that Ludger later told everyone it was just because of a fight. Either way, the eruption was Ludger Sylbaris’ savior.</p><p> 另一方面，Ludger的运气不可能更好。在幸存上火山后，他被赦免了他的罪行，并聘请与Barnum＆amp一起游览;贝利并讲述他经历过的可怕事件的故事。 Ludger成了名人，被称为“通过世界末日生活的人”和“世界上最奇妙的人”。有些人认为，他被监禁的那个夜间实际上被谋杀，这就是他在孤独的原因，但那个路德后来告诉大家，这只是因为争夺战。无论哪种方式，爆发都是Ludger Sylbaris'救世主。</p><p> Today, the cell which saved Ludgers life can be visited in St. Pierre. The town never recovered from the devastation. Even today, over 100 years later, the town’s population is only a few thousand. Pelée is one of the most active volcanoes in the West Indies, and it will likely erupt again.</p><p> 如今，在圣皮埃尔可以访问拯救了潜伏的潜伏的细胞。该镇从未从破坏中恢复过来。即使在今天，超过100年后，镇的人口只有几千人。 Pelée是西印度群岛最活跃的火山之一，它可能会再次爆发。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-prison-cell-of-ludger-sylbaris-saint-pierre-martinique">https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-prison-cell-of-ludger-sylbaris-saint-pierre-martinique</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sylbaris/">#sylbaris</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/cell/">#cell</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/火山/">#火山</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
