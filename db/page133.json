But the exposed server was accessible from the internet and configured so that anyone from outside the organization could create a user account and log in unimpeded, SpiderSilk\u2019s chief security officer Mossab Hussin told TechCrunch.\n When TechCrunch visited the GitLab server, the login page showed it was accepting new user accounts. It\u2019s not known exactly how long the GitLab server was accessible in this way, but  historic records from Shodan, a search engine for exposed devices and databases, shows the GitLab was first detected on the internet on March 18.\n SpiderSilk shared several screenshots showing that the GitLab server contained secret keys and passwords associated with servers and databases belonging to New York State\u2019s Office of Information Technology Services. Fearing the exposed server could be maliciously accessed or tampered with, the startup asked for help in disclosing the security lapse to the state.\n TechCrunch alerted the New York governor\u2019s office to the exposure a short time after the server was found. Several emails to the governor\u2019s office with details of the exposed GitLab server were opened but were not responded to. The server went offline on Monday afternoon.\n Scot Reif, a spokesperson for New York State\u2019s Office of Information Technology Services, said the server was \u201ca test box set up by a vendor, there is no data whatsoever, and it has already been decommissioned by ITS.\u201d (Reif declared his response \u201con background\u201d and attributable to a state official, which would require both parties agree to the terms in advance, but we are printing the reply as we were not given the opportunity to reject the terms.)\n When asked, Reif would not say who the vendor was or if the passwords on the server were changed. Several projects on the server were marked \u201cprod,\u201d or common shorthand for \u201cproduction,\u201d a term for servers that are actively use. Reif also would not say if the incident was reported to the state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s office. When reached, a spokesperson for the Attorney General did not comment by press time.\n TechCrunch understands the vendor is Indotronix-Avani, a New York-based company with offices in India, and owned by venture capital firm Nigama Ventures.

Prior to founding Handsome, she spent six years as a vice president at an investment startup that raised and invested over $130 million during her time there.\n Nikki Dominguez is the co-founder and president of  Handsome, an app that provides beauty professionals with equal career opportunities. She also built two beauty academies and one school and turned a team of 70 into a team of more than 150 stylists.\n  Any funding opportunities we had in the pipeline evaporated. This was especially true for investors considering attempts to reach new and underrepresented founders.\n But the fundraising market came back pretty quickly in 2020 \u2014 for some. And though we are thrilled to have closed a $1.5 million pre-seed round in the middle of a pandemic, the challenges we faced in the past continued. The spotlight only turned back on minority founders after the Black Lives Matter movement took off last summer, and we began to pursue fundraising again in late 2020. We could tell by how investors interacted with our pitch deck or asked us questions that they already had preconceived ideas about us and our business.\n We were in our second year of running  Handsome and had traction similar to, if not better than, other male-centric startups that were getting funded, yet we still ran into friction when fundraising. The hard part was that we didn\u2019t have any concrete evidence as to why, or the extent to which, fundraising was harder for minority and female teams outside of our apparent challenges and personal experiences. Men are allowed to have a vision or an idea on the back of a cocktail napkin, while women need to have fully established businesses and revenue streams.\n  DocSend, a tool that we and thousands of other startups use to send out pitch decks to investors, analyzed how investors interact with pitch decks. A recent DocSend  study confirmed our hunch, finding that investors do indeed scrutinize the decks of businesses founded by women and minorities differently.\n For instance, their data showed investors spent 20% longer on the business model section of decks from all-female teams at the pre-seed stage than all-male teams. While more time spent on a particular section of a deck may seem to indicate more interest, it can actually be a sign of greater scrutiny and skepticism.\n  When you look at the makeup of the average VC you are pitching to, it is likely a middle-aged white man. When pitching Handsome \u2014 something that\u2019s reimagining the education and community of the beauty industry \u2014 you can imagine that most VCs don\u2019t understand the value and opportunity at hand. Although beauty is a $190 billion global industry ($60 billion alone in the U.S.), investors who don\u2019t follow this industry might have a hard time understanding how big it is, how the industry works, and how our business fits into this thriving market. Even further, investors might completely discredit our business because of the \u201cbeauty\u201d label.\n All these factors can lead to more time spent analyzing the business model \u2014 and its viability \u2014 articulated in our pitch deck. In reality, VCs are busy, and if they\u2019re spending more time on the fundamentals of your business, they don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s more likely they are looking for ways that your business won\u2019t work. And, frankly, we are not business school graduates or Stanford alumni, so investors who want to de-risk their portfolios will spend more time looking at our deck to gauge if we know how to build a business.\n  Despite all this, we believe that most of the time, investors don\u2019t even know they are acting on these biases. They don\u2019t realize they may have already written you off, which is part of the problem. Awareness of a subconscious bias is the first step toward making positive change. Investors may think they\u2019re widening the funnel simply by taking a meeting or providing mentorship over coffee when, subconsciously, they\u2019ve already counted you out.\n Even though the barriers are being lowered, minority founders just starting out still have a hard time getting their foot in the door. Most underrepresented founders don\u2019t have an established network, making it difficult to get even an initial introduction. That\u2019s why these founders aren\u2019t getting meetings. So even with more investor goodwill, founders are still unable to access the capital they need to grow their businesses.\n It takes time and effort to enact meaningful changes.

while\u00a0 BIOSConnect\u00a0provides remote firmware update and OS recovery features.\n The chain of flaws discovered by Eclypsium researchers comes with a CVSS base score of 8.3/10 and enables privileged remote attackers\u00a0to impersonate Dell.com and take control of the target device&#39;s boot process to break OS-level security controls.\n &#34;Such an attack would enable adversaries to control the device&#39;s boot process and subvert the operating system and higher-layer security controls,&#34; Eclypsium researchers explain in a\u00a0report shared in advance with BleepingComputer.\n &#34;The issue affects 129 Dell models of consumer and\u00a0business laptops, desktops, and tablets, including devices\u00a0protected by Secure Boot and Dell Secured-core PCs,&#34; with roughly 30 million individual devices exposed to attacks.\n  The reasearchers identified one issue leading to an insecure TLS connection from BIOS to Dell (tracked as\u00a0CVE-2021-21571) and three overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-21572, CVE-2021-21573, and CVE-2021-21574).\n Two of\u00a0the overflow security flaws &#34;affect the OS recovery process,\u00a0while the other affects the firmware update process,&#34; Eclypsium says. &#34;All three vulnerabilities are independent, and each\u00a0one could lead to arbitrary code execution in BIOS.&#34;\n Additional info on the vulnerabilities can be found in  Eclypsium&#39;s report\u00a0and the complete list of affected device models in\u00a0 Dell&#39;s advisory.\n  According to Eclypsium, users will have to update the system BIOS/UEFI for all affected systems. The researchers also recommend\u00a0using an alternate method other than the SupportAssist&#39;s BIOSConnect feature to apply BIOS updates on their devices.\n Dell is providing BIOS/UEFI updates for impacted systems and updates to affected executables on Dell.com.\n CVE-2021-21573 and CVE-2021-21574 don&#39;t require require additional customer action as they were addressed server side on May 28, 2021. However, the CVE-2021-21571 and\u00a0CVE-2021-21572 vulnerabilities require Dell Client BIOS updates to be fully addressed.\n Users who cannot immediately update their systems can disable BIOSConnect from the BIOS setup page or using the\u00a0 Dell Command | Configure (DCC)&#39;s Remote System Management tool.\n &#34;The specific vulnerabilities covered here allow an attacker to remotely exploit the UEFI firmware of a host and gain control over the most privileged code on the device,&#34; the researchers concluded.\n &#34;This combination of remote exploitability and high privileges will likely make remote update functionality an alluring target for attackers in the future, and organizations should make sure to monitor and update their devices accordingly.&#34;\n  This is not the first time owners of Dell computers have been exposed to attacks by security vulnerabilities found in the SupportAssist software.\n Two years ago, in May 2019, the company patched another high-severity\u00a0 SupportAssist remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability\u00a0caused by an improper origin validation weakness and reported by security researcher Bill Demirkapi in 2018.\n This RCE allowed unauthenticated attackers on the same Network Access layer with targeted systems to remotely execute arbitrary executables on unpatched devices.\n Security researcher Tom Forbes found a similar RCE flaw\u00a0 in the Dell System Detect software\u00a0in 2015, allowing attackers to trigger the buggy program to download and execute arbitrary files without user interaction.\n SupportAssist was again patched one year later, in February 2020, to address a security flaw due to a DLL search-order hijacking bug that enabled local attackers to\u00a0 execute arbitrary code with Administrator privileges\u00a0on vulnerable devices.\n Last but not least, last month Dell addressed a flaw making it possible to\u00a0 escalate privileges from non-admin users to kernel privileges, a bug found in the DBUtil driver that ships with tens of millions of Dell devices.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:02:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6f0f\u6d1e,\u9ed1\u5ba2,ios,\u4ee3\u7801,\u6234\u5c14", "title": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5728\u6234\u5c14SupportAssist\u7684\u751f\u7269\u8fde\u63a5\u529f\u80fd\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8ba9\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd129\u6234\u5c14\u578b\u53f7 ", "title_en": "Researchers discover four major vulnerabilities in Dell SupportAssist's BIOSConnect feature, letting hackers remotely execute code, affecting 129 Dell models", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dell-supportassist-bugs-put-over-30-million-pcs-at-risk/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6f0f\u6d1e", "\u9ed1\u5ba2", "ios", "\u4ee3\u7801", "\u6234\u5c14"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068068, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53C\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570ARGC\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u548cargv\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u63a5\u6536\u4efb\u4f55\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u89e3\u91ca\u8be5\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\n \u6709\u5f88\u591a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662fgetoptfunction\uff08\u4ee5\u4e0b\uff0cgetopt\u5c06\u5f15\u7528getopt\u548cgetopt_long\uff09.one\u6269\u5c55\u4e00\u4e9bgetopt\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u60e0\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5b83\u65f6\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8fArgv\u7684argnectents\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u7ec4\u9996\u5148\u51fa\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u662f\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n \u6b64\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u5206\u533a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6240\u6709\u9009\u9879\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u7684\u975e\u6d3b\u52a8\u90fd\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u3002\n \u53bb\u5e74\u6211\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86Parg\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eargv\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0egetopt\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u51fd\u6570parg_reorder\uff08\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5 -

It is upto the program to interpret the contents of this array of strings.\n There are many ways to do this, one of the simpler solutions is the  getoptfunction (in the following, getopt will refer to both getopt and getopt_long).One extension some getopt implementations offer, is that they reorder thecontents of  argv as they process it, resulting in an array where all theoptions appear first followed by the nonoptions.\n This reordering partitions the array. And we want a stable partition, so therelative order of all the options, and of all the nonoptions is the same.\n Last year I released  parg, a simple parser for  argv that works similarlyto getopt. It has a separate function,  parg_reorder(), that performs thisreordering. I used a simple algorithm for this \u2013 allocate a temporary arraythe size of  argv, parse the arguments, and fill in the options from the startand nonoptions from the end of the new array. Then copy them back, reversingthe nonoptions to their original order in the process. In hindsight, I couldhave moved the options into their final place in  argv right away.\n This runs in  time, but also requires  additional space. Thespace requirement could be a problem (for instance on embedded systems), solet\u2019s see if we can do better.\n The code examples in the following are pseudo-code, and glance over somedetails. Please see the  examples on GitHub for working C++ code.\n We note that if we already partitioned the two halves of an array,, we can compute the partition of both by swapping and . Swapping adjacent blocks in an array is sometimescalled  rotating, and can be done in linear time, for instance using reversal(observing that ).\n  So we can use  divide and conquer. With a recursive function thatsplits the array at the middle, this runs in  time and requires stack space.\n stable_partition_recursive ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t if  ( n  ==  1 )  {\t\t return  pred ( first )  ?  first  +  1  :  first ;\t }\t left  =  stable_partition_recursive ( first ,  n  /  2 ,  pred );\t middle  =  first  +  n  /  2 ;\t right  =  stable_partition_recursive ( middle ,  n  -  n  /  2 ,  pred );\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n Much better, but ideally we would like to use only constant extra space.To achieve this, we can use the same technique as in bottom-up merge sort. We first process the array in blocks of size 2, thenagain in blocks of size 4 (whose two halves of size 2 are alreadypartitioned), and so on, until we process the entire array as one block.\n stable_partition_bottomup ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t for  ( width  =  1 ;  width  &lt;  n ;  width  *=  2 )  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t for  ( i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  n ;  i  +=  2  *  width )  {\t\t\t limit  =  n  -  i  &lt;  2  *  width  ?  n  -  i  :  2  *  width ;\t\t\t if  ( limit  &gt;  width )  {\t\t\t\t middle  =  next  +  width ;\t\t\t\t left  =  std :: find_if_not ( next ,  middle ,  pred );\t\t\t\t next  =  middle  +  width\t\t\t\t right  =  std :: find_if_not ( middle ,  next ,  pred );\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t }\t\t }\t }\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n  In a sense, the price we pay to avoid the recursion is that we do not rememberthe partition points of the two halves, and need to find them again. This meanswe use the predicate  times instead of .\n However, since the two halves are already partitioned, we can use binary searchto find the partition points. This reduces the number of predicate applicationsto  (since ), whichmeans we have the same time complexities as the recursive algorithm, but usingonly constant extra space.\n stable_partition_bsearch ( first ,  n ,  pred ) {\t for  ( width  =  1 ;  width  &lt;  n ;  width  *=  2 )  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t for  ( i  =  0 ;  i  &lt;  n ;  i  +=  2  *  width )  {\t\t\t limit  =  n  -  i  &lt;  2  *  width  ?  n  -  i  :  2  *  width ;\t\t\t if  ( limit  &gt;  width )  {\t\t\t\t middle  =  next  +  width ;\t\t\t\t left  =  std :: partition_point ( next ,  middle ,  pred );\t\t\t\t next  =  middle  +  width\t\t\t\t right  =  std :: partition_point ( middle ,  next ,  pred );\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t }\t\t }\t }\t return  left  +  ( right  -  middle ); }\n If the array is almost partitioned, these algorithms still go through everystep. We can do something similar to natural merge sort, and repeatedlylook for the next place where a rotate is needed, stopping if we find none.We must be careful though, if we simply look for  areas and rotate them,we get quadratic time on alternating patterns. Instead we can look for and rotate the middle two, just like above.\n stable_partition_natural ( first ,  last ,  pred ) {\t do  {\t\t next  =  first ;\t\t change  =  false ;\t\t do  {\t\t\t left  =  std :: find_if_not ( next ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t middle  =  std :: find_if ( left ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t right  =  std :: find_if_not ( middle ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t next  =  std :: find_if ( right ,  last ,  pred );\t\t\t if  ( left  !=  middle  &amp;&amp;  middle  !=  right )  {\t\t\t\t rotate ( left ,  middle ,  right );\t\t\t\t change  =  true ;\t\t\t }\t\t }  while  ( next  !=  last );\t }  while  ( change ); }\n At best this runs in , while the worst-case complexity is the same asthe bottom-up version. Since the widths are no longer fixed size, we have toperform a linear search for the partition points, so the number of predicateapplications is back to . Also, we have to use the predicateto find the middle and next starting point, so we may use more predicateapplications than the bottom-up version.\n There is an algorithm that can perform stable partitioning in  usingconstant extra space ( PDF), but it is somewhat more involved,and not practical given the constraints of the specific task.\n Let us return to the problem of reordering arguments. One issue here is that wecannot tell if any given element is an option, an option argument, or anonoption, without parsing the entire array up to that point (i.e. we cannotassume random access).\n This is because any given element could be preceded by an option that uses itas its option argument (looking at the previous element is not enough, sincethat might be an option argument instead of an option). Or there could be a -- somewhere, which means the remaining elements are nonoptions (unless that -- is in fact the option argument of a preceding option).\n This makes the natural algorithm a good fit, since it applies the predicatelinearly from left to right in each loop.\n So how does this all compare to getopt implementations? The two I checkedperform the reordering in each call by scanning over any nonoptions from thecurrent position, and then rotating them to the end of the array. Thiseffectively builds the array of nonoptions at the end, while moving down thepart that has not yet been processed.\n  This requires constant extra space, but takes worst-case  time.While this could theoretically be used in an algorithmic complexity attack,most systems limit the size of the command-line arguments in some way. As anexample of the worst-case behavior, the following line runs  ls with 200,000nonoptions (redirecting the error messages for missing file), and takes about0.3 seconds (Fedora 24 running in a VM):\n  Whereas this line runs  ls with the same number of arguments, but alternatingnonoptions and options (the  -a option enables showing files that start witha period, and has no effect in this case), and takes 11 seconds:", "posttime": "2021-06-25 02:01:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6392\u5e8f,reordering", "title": "\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u8bba\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Reordering Arguments", "transed": 1, "url": "http://hardtoc.com/2016/11/07/reordering-arguments.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6392\u5e8f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d70e17a3efaa795b87d3eaf4d94395a0.jpg", "infoid": 1068067, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u201c\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u4e54\u65af\u7684\u65b0\u9896\uff0c\u9898\u4e3a\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u7684\u4e00\u4efd\u526f\u672c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d3e\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\uff0c\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u88ab\u544a\u77e54\u670828\u65e5\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e0d\u6765\u6885\u5728\u4e0d\u6765\u6885\u5883\u5185\u7684\u5377\uff0c\u4e8e1932\u5e745\u67083\u65e5\u661f\u671f\u4e8c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u6e2f\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5411\u60a8\u4f20\u8f93\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5b98\u65b9\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d77\u5173\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u60a8\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff0c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8c\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u8d5e\u626c\uff0c\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e8c\u5341\u4e16\u7eaa\u4e16\u754c\u6587\u5b66\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5176\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6587\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u786e\u4fe1\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u5e76\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u5173\u7a0e\u6cd5\u6848\u3002\u5728\u8bf4\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u4e66\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u6001\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5408\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e[Dennett\uff0c\u5df2\u5a5a\u7231\u548c\u907f\u5b55\u6848\u4f8b]\u8fd9\u4e00\u6001\u5ea6\uff0c\u9274\u4e8e[\u4e39\u5c3c\u7279\uff0c\u5a5a\u59fb\u7231\u60c5\u548c\u907f\u5b55\u6848\u4f8b]\u7684\u8fd1\u671f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u518d\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5236\u88c1\u3002\u201c\n \u51e0\u5929\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u968f\u673a\u4e4b\u5bb6 - \u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u6d77\u5173\u3002\u6124\u6012\uff0c\u6069\u65af\u7279\u4eb2\u81ea\u9001\u5230\u6d77\u5173\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u5305\u88f9\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u641c\u7d22\u5b83\u3002\u5f53\u68c0\u67e5\u5458\u6253\u5f00\u5b83\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u5600\u5495\u7740\uff0c\u201c\u54e6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e0a\u5e1d\u7684\u7f18\u6545\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u6ce8\u610f\u5b83\u3002\u201d\u6069\u65af\u7279\u575a\u6301\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u5b83\u3002 5\u67088\u65e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u672c\u4e66\u88ab\u6d77\u5173\u6b63\u5f0f\u6263\u62bc\u3002 Lindey\u6566\u4fc3\u6d77\u5173\u5b98\u5458\u5c06\u672c\u4e66\u8f6c\u53d1\u7ed9\u7f8e\u56fd\u5f8b\u5e08\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002 1932\u5e745\u670824\u65e5\uff0c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u6d3e\u5f80\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5357\u90e8\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u95e8\uff0c\u201c\u6839\u636e\u201d1930\u5e74\u5173\u7a0e\u6cd5\u6848\u201c\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7b2c305A\u6761\u7684\u89c4\u5b9a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u201d\u6ca1\u6536\uff0c\u6ca1\u6536\u548c\u7834\u574f\u4e66\u7c4d\u3002\u201c\u5c24\u5229\u897f\u65af\u7684\u6218\u6597\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f00\u59cb\u3002 ", "note_en": "In the early 1930s, James Joyce\u2019s  Ulysses was the most notorious banned book in the United States. Using a stream-of-consciousness style to describe twenty-four hours in the life of a lower-middle class Dubliner named Leopold Bloom, Joyce\u2019s classic, published in 1922, was brilliant, dense, convoluted, complex, and legally obscene.  Ulysses was the \u201conly volume of literary importance still under a ban\u201d in the country, Morris Ernst declared. He set out to \u201cliberate\u201d it, and the celebrated case, resolved by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1934, was not only a landmark in the law of literary censorship but also a turning point in Ernst\u2019s career.\n    Joyce\u2019s novel had a long history of suppression in the United States. Ulysses had been banned even before Joyce finished writing it. In 1918, as he was completing  Ulysses, Joyce sent chapters to the New York\u2013based literary magazine the Little Review, which published them in installments. The Post Office Department confiscated the issues and burned them. Shortly after, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice had obscenity charges brought against the Review\u2019s editors for having published the chapter in which Bloom masturbates while watching a young woman on the beach. John Quinn, a noted literary lawyer and patron of the arts, defended the editors in court. Despite Quinn\u2019s persuasive argument\u2014Ulysses was so dense and convoluted that no one could possibly understand it, much less be debauched by it, he argued\u2014a three-judge panel, using the Hicklin test, concluded that the book had the potential to corrupt youth and was therefore obscene. After the New York decision, no American publisher was willing to take a chance on  Ulysses. The book was eventually issued in Paris in 1922, under the imprint of the avant-garde bookstore Shakespeare and Company. Joyce gave Sylvia Beach, the bookstore\u2019s proprietor, the world rights to Ulysses.\n The ban on the book notwithstanding, Ulysses found a wide and receptive audience in the United States. Blue paperbound copies were smuggled into the country and sold at fantastic prices, sometimes as much as fifty dollars. Joyce won critical acclaim for Ulysses; articles and treatises were written about it, its style was widely imitated, and the book achieved masterpiece status. Observed critic Harry Hansen in 1933, a generation of Americans coming of age in the 1920s grew up \u201cwith the idea that [Ulysses] is a literary Bible.\u201d\n Because Ulysses could not be legally published in the United States, it could not be copyrighted. Samuel Roth, an infamous publisher of pornography, seized on this opportunity and began to publish bowdlerized installments of Ulysses in his magazine Two Worlds Monthly. Joyce sued Roth over the unconsented use of his name. One hundred sixty-seven of Joyce\u2019s literary friends, including T. S. Eliot, D. H. Lawrence, and Thomas Mann, signed a petition protesting the \u201cappropriation and mutilation\u201d of Joyce\u2019s work. Joyce won an injunction in 1927. Meanwhile, US Customs officials seized copies of the book that were imported from Paris. In 1928, the US Customs Court, in an action titled A. Heymoolen v. United States, affirmed the exclusion of Ulysses as an obscene book.\n  Joyce, who was living in Paris, launched a search for a reputable American publisher. Aging, syphilitic, and nearly blind, he was desperate for money, and it was rumored that Roth was going to sell another pirated edition, publishing as many as twenty thousand copies. A few US publishers, sensitive to the changing cultural climate around sex and the more liberal obscenity rulings in the New York courts, began to discuss the possibility of bringing out an American edition of  Ulysses. But no one was willing to commit to it; with the legal restrictions in place, publishing  Ulysses was a still a risky proposition. Ernst knew about the renewed interest in  Ulysses, and in the summer of 1931 he had asked Alexander Lindey to help him find a publisher that might be willing to publish the book and cooperate in a test case to remove the ban. Ernst planned to deploy the same strategy he had used in the Contraception and Married Love cases\u2014he would have a copy of Ulysses imported from France and seized by the Customs Office under the Tariff Act as an obscene book, and then he would challenge the seizure.\n  In August, Lindey had a lengthy conversation with Sylvia Beach\u2019s sister, Holly Beach Denis, about the possibility of an American publisher obtaining the rights and participating in the \u201clegalization of Ulysses.\u201d Denis said that she was \u201ctremendously interested\u201d and that Sylvia Beach would likely cooperate if a suitable publisher could be found. Shortly after, Lindey wrote to Ernst, \u201cI . . . feel very keenly that this would be the grandest obscenity case in the history of law and literature, and I am ready to do anything in the world to get it started. What do you suggest?\u201d\n \u201cTell Mrs. Denis that I want to see her,\u201d Ernst replied. \u201cI am sure I can get a good publisher.\u201d\n Two months later, Ernst lunched with Ben Huebsch, ACLU member and vice president of Viking Press. Viking had published Ernst\u2019s  To The Pure, as well as Joyce\u2019s  Dubliners and  Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. In a letter after the lunch, Ernst told Huebsch he was confident that because of his recent victories in obscenity cases,  Ulysses can \u201cnow be tested (in court) with the real hope of gaining immunity for it.\u201d Ernst assured Huebsch that he had little to lose under his plan. Because customs actions proceeded against the book, rather than its publisher or mailer, no one risked fines or jail sentences. Huebsch didn\u2019t have to spend a dime on publishing  Ulysses until the court approved it\u2014the fight would be waged over an imported copy of the Shakespeare and Company edition. Success in the customs case didn\u2019t mean that it was completely safe to publish  Ulysses, however, Ernst warned. The book could still be seized by the post office, and the publisher could be charged under state obscenity laws. The approval of  Ulysses by a federal tribunal, however, made subsequent actions against the book \u201chighly improbable,\u201d according to Ernst.\n  As an incentive to get Viking to publish Ulysses and sponsor the case, Ernst offered Huebsch his usual deal. His normal fee was a retainer of $1,000. If the case were appealed to the Supreme Court, fees and costs could run as high as $8,000. Ernst proposed a contingency arrangement in which he would be paid a retainer of $500 and an additional $500 for each subsequent appeal. The maximum would be $2,000 if the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. In exchange for the reduced rate, Ernst wanted 4 percent of the book\u2019s royalties.\n Ernst knew he had a good chance of winning the case and that the publicity around the litigation would drive up the book\u2019s sales. Huebsch agreed and approached Sylvia Beach about obtaining the American rights to Ulysses. When she demanded $25,000, Huebsch balked. Huebsch then wrote to Bennett Cerf, the young president of Random House, who had also expressed interest in publishing  Ulysses. Huebsch told Cerf that it was fine for him to try to acquire the rights from Beach. Around the same time, Robert Kastor, a New York stockbroker who was the brother-in-law of Joyce\u2019s son, approached Cerf and asked if Random House was interested in publishing  Ulysses.\n Cerf was thrilled at the possibility of issuing the first legal edition of  Ulysses. It would bring Random House, then a fledgling company (only six years old), into major prominence in the publishing world. Cerf and Ernst met in March 1932, and Ernst offered him the same contingency deal he had presented to Huebsch. Meanwhile, under pressure from Joyce, Sylvia Beach agreed to give Joyce the world rights to  Ulysses. By the end of the month, Random House had worked out a contract with Joyce in which Joyce received $1,500 and the firm obtained the US rights to the book. Ernst would litigate the customs case, and if the book were cleared, Random House would publish it. Under the final agreement with Random House, Ernst would receive 5 percent of the royalties if the book were legalized and published. Cerf \u201chad not the faintest doubt\u201d that Ernst would win the case. Ernst, he was sure, could handle the litigation \u201cbetter than anyone else in the country.\u201d\n  Ernst set the wheels of the \u201cgrandest obscenity case\u201d in motion in 1932 when he instructed Cerf to have a copy of  Ulysses sent from Paris to Random House\u2019s office in New York. Cerf wrote to Joyce\u2019s secretary Paul Leon asking him \u201cto purchase the latest edition of Ulysses.\u201d Knowing the courts\u2019 resistance to hearing expert testimony in obscenity cases, Ernst had come up with the idea of pasting positive reviews of Ulysses into the book itself, which would be introduced as evidence. Cerf advised Leon, \u201cif there has been printed . . . any circular containing opinions of prominent men or critics on this book, paste a copy of the circular into the front of the book. It is important that this circular be actually pasted into the book, as if it is separate we may not be able to use it as evidence when the trial comes up, but if these opinions of respected people are actually pasted in the book, they become, for legal purposes, a part of the book, and can be introduced as evidence.\u201d Leon was told to notify Cerf what ship the book would be coming in on so that Cerf and Lindey could alert authorities. Cerf explained, \u201cIt is necessary that they catch this book or all our efforts in this matter will have been in vain.\u201d\n  The main argument Ernst planned to make in court was by then a familiar one\u2014that the question of whether a work was obscene should be determined by contemporary social standards, and it was \u201cundisputed\u201d that the public accepted  Ulysses. Ernst planned to demonstrate this by showing the accolades the book had won from literary critics, professors, and other \u201cprominent men\u201d whose sentiments reflected public opinion. Ernst instructed Lindey to have Random House send more than five hundred letters to esteemed writers and intellectuals surveying their opinion on  Ulysses. Cerf was also told to put together a massive file containing essays, articles, and positive reviews of  Ulysses, as well as statements from \u201cprominent critics, librarians, authors, physicians, psychologists, welfare workers, and the like,\u201d attesting that  Ulysses had major \u201cliterary, scientific, [and] sociological value.\u201d Random House also sent a circular to one hundred colleges and universities, asking whether Joyce was used in courses. Nine hundred letters were sent to librarians, querying whether  Ulysses was on their shelves or whether they would like to have it in their collections. By the end of May, Random House had received favorable responses from several important literary figures, including George Jean Nathan, Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hundreds of librarians said they wanted to have copies of the book and saw  Ulysses as having major literary importance.\n On April 27, 1932, Leon telegrammed Cerf that he had shipped a copy of  Ulysses on the SS Bremen, scheduled to arrive in New York on May 3. Leon had pasted positive reviews into the book\u2019s cover; he also sent several articles praising  Ulysses that he hoped Ernst could use in his \u201cspeech before either the lower or the higher court.\u201d31 Lindey alerted the collector of customs:\n \u201cA copy of James Joyce\u2019s novel, entitled Ulysses, has been dispatched into this country, addressed to our client. We are informed that the volume left on the Bremen on April 28, and is due at the port of New York on Tuesday, May 3, 1932.\n \u201cWe are transmitting this information to you because we do not wish the book to slip through the Customs without official scrutiny. As you may know, Ulysses during the last two decades has been praised by critics as probably the most important contribution to the world literature of the twentieth century. Entirely apart from its profound literary significance, we are convinced that Ulysses is not violative of the Tariff Act. In saying this we are not unmindful of the adverse attitude of your department with regard to the book in the past.
