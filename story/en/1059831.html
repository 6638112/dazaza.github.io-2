What they saw was lots of cases of a new variant that featured high numbers of unusual mutations.</p><p> 他们开始研究在肯特横跨肯特的肠道序列（遗传分析）的病例。他们所看到的是许多新型的案例，它具有很多异常突变。</p><p> Unbeknownst to the team at the time, this variant would set off on a rapid expansion across the South East of England, eventually taking over as the dominant COVID-19 strain in the UK and spreading to over 100 countries.</p><p> 此类变种对团队不知数，这一变种将在英国东南部的快速扩张，最终将其作为英国的主导Covid-19菌株占据，并向超过100个国家传播。</p><p>  Doctor Meera Chand, one of the national COVID-19 incident directors at PHE, and Richard Myers, Head of Bioinformatics at PHE, were among the first to become aware of the new variant, then known as B.1.1.7, and were part of the team tasked with quickly understanding what the UK was dealing with.</p><p>  Phe的国家Covid-19事件董事之一，梅拉·梅纳·梅纳·汉德·迈克尔·迈尔氏派（Phe）首先是第一次意识到新变种，然后被称为B.1.1.7，并且是部分团队的任务是快速理解英国正在处理的内容。</p><p> “We immediately knew we had found something very concerning”, says Meera. “Normally when you’re looking at samples you would expect to see lots of small clusters made up of multiple strains that are all slightly different. But when we looked at Kent, we saw about 50% of the samples were extremely similar, forming one massive cluster.”</p><p> “我们立即知道我们发现了一些非常有关的事情”，Meera说。 “通常，当您正在看样品时，您希望看到大量的小簇由多种菌株组成，这些菌株都略有不同。但是当我们看着肯特时，我们看到了大约50％的样品非常相似，形成一个大规模的簇。“ </p><p> Richard adds: “It was quite unusual. Up to that point, the virus had been characterised by having a relatively slow mutational rate, maybe two variations a month. Suddenly out of nowhere we’ve got this large cluster featuring mutations that were significantly different to what we’d looked at before.”</p><p>理查德补充说：“这很不寻常。到那时，病毒的特点是具有相对缓慢的突变率，可能每月两个变化。我们突然出现了，我们已经有了这个大型集群，具有与我们之前看的内容有关的突变。“</p><p> A team of experts from a range of disciplines across PHE and academic partners, including virology, epidemiology, modelling and genomics, was quickly assembled to study the characteristics of the Kent samples.</p><p> 一系列来自PHE和学术伴侣的一系列学科的专家，包括病毒学，流行病学，建模和基因组学，迅速组装，以研究肯特样品的特征。</p><p> According to Meera: “It was really the first time we had brought together all the different disciplines needed to evaluate a variant at pace and understand how it behaves.”</p><p> 根据Meera的说法：“这真的是我们第一次把所有不同的学科汇集在一起​​，以便在节奏中评估一个变体并了解它的行为方式。”</p><p> The investigation immediately got underway, but there was a problem. The team knew which variant they were looking for, but data was limited to samples that had undergone whole genome sequencing (laboratory analysis that identifies a virus’s genetic make-up) – typically at the time around 5% of samples collected nationally.</p><p> 调查立即进行，但有问题。该团队知道他们正在寻找哪种变体，但数据仅限于经历全基因组测序的样本（鉴定病毒遗传构成的实验室分析） - 通常在全国收集的样本的5％左右。</p><p>  Fortunately, the team were assisted by an unexpected source. Staff at ‘lighthouse labs’ (localised centres that test tens of thousands of swabs per day through an automated system) began noticing a problem with their test results coming from the Kent area.</p><p>  幸运的是，该团队得到了意想不到的来源。 'Lighthouse Labs'（本地化中心通过自动化系统测试成千上万的拭子）的工作人员开始注意到他们的测试结果来自肯特地区的问题。</p><p> One of the mutations in B.1.1.7 causes the ‘S-gene’, one of the characteristics identified when analysing the virus’s genetic code, to ‘drop out’, or in other words go missing.</p><p> B.1.1.7中的一个突变导致“S-Gene”，在分析病毒的遗传密码时发现的特征之一，以“辍学”或换句话说缺失。</p><p> Meera explains: “The lighthouse labs were having problems detecting the S-gene in their samples. Initially they thought there was an issue with the test. It wasn’t working, and the rate at which it wasn’t working was increasing very steeply.”</p><p> Meera解释说：“Lighthouse Labs在其样品中检测到S-基因的问题。最初他们认为测试有一个问题。它不起作用，而不是工作的速度非常陡峭。“ </p><p> The team quickly began looking at the numbers of samples being tested across the lighthouse labs where the S-gene was missing. This widened the scope of their lens considerably, enabling them to identify cases of the new variant as they emerged.</p><p>该团队迅速开始查看在缺少S-基因的灯塔实验室中测试的样本数量。这大大加宽了镜头的范围，使他们能够在出现的情况下识别新变种的案例。</p><p> “Identifying cases through the lighthouse labs was a huge leap ahead”, explains Meera. “Whole genome sequencing takes time, but lighthouse results are a real time way of detecting what’s happening. A huge proportion of samples go through them, so we were able to give good, real time monitoring of big data.</p><p> “通过灯塔实验室识别案例是一个巨大的飞跃”，梅拉解释道。 “全基因组测序需要时间，但灯塔结果是检测发生的事情的实时方式。大部分样本通过它们，所以我们能够提供良好的，实时监控大数据。</p><p> “It was suddenly very clear that the rate of spread was very rapid and was much bigger than just Kent. It was in London, Essex and other parts of the South East and expanding across the rest of the country.”</p><p> “突然很清楚，传播率非常迅速，比肯特更大。它是在伦敦，埃塞克斯和东南部的其他地区，并扩大了全国其他地区。“</p><p>   By December 21, the South East of England was again under tight COVID-19 restrictions, with much of the region placed in Tier 4. However, the rapid spread of B.1.1.7 meant hospitalisations and deaths were inevitable, putting the team under increasing pressure to quickly learn more about the threats the variant posed.</p><p>   到12月21日，英格兰东南部再次受到严格的Covid-19限制，其中大部分地区均为第4层。然而，B.1.1.7的迅速传播意味着住院和死亡是不可避免的，把球队置于增加压力，以快速了解更多关于威胁的变种所带来的威胁。</p><p> Richard explains how it felt: “It was obviously scientifically interesting to observe the mutations we were seeing, but we mustn’t ever forget the consequences of what we’re looking at. We were massively concerned to try and understand what the biological significance of these changes to the virus would be. There’s a sense of frustration in that work. It’s relatively straightforward to identify the changes, it’s a far more labour-intensive job to be able to say what they mean.”</p><p> 理查德解释了它如何感受到：“观察我们看到的突变显然有趣，但我们绝不能忘记我们正在研究的内容。我们迅速担心尝试，了解这些变化对病毒的生物学意义是什么。这项工作有一种挫折感。识别变化相对简单，能够说出他们的意思是更多的劳动密集型工作。“</p><p> Meera adds: “In mid-December, when all the analyses started coming together, we were really very worried. We realised what a bad situation we were potentially in and it was daunting to think about how much was resting on an analysis that was being done for the first time. I wouldn’t want to underestimate how challenging that time was for the team. However, this is why we had invested so much in genomics, to ensure we were well equipped to deal with this very scenario.”</p><p> Meera补充说：“12月中旬，当所有分析开始融合时，我们真的很担心。我们意识到我们潜在的糟糕情况，令人生畏思考在第一次正在进行的分析上依赖于休息多少。我不想低估当时的挑战是对球队的挑战。然而，这就是为什么我们在基因组学中投入了这么多，以确保我们能够充分地处理这一方案。“</p><p> Thanks to their early work, and the analysis of samples gathered in the lighthouse labs, the team were quickly able to establish to high degrees of confidence just how much more contagious the new variant was - now understood to be around 50% more than the original COVID-19 strain. This was able to be factored into public health decision making in December.</p><p> 由于他们的早期工作，并分析了在灯塔实验室中聚集的样品，该团队迅速能够建立高度信心，只要新的变异是多么传染 - 现在被理解为比原始的50％左右约为50％ Covid-19菌株。这能够在12月的公共卫生决策中被考虑。 </p><p>  Understanding the severity of B.1.1.7 (now referred to as VOC-20DEC-01) and its impact on hospitalisations and deaths however has been a more complex task. That picture continues to become clearer through the work of many independent academic groups across the country and, increasingly, internationally.</p><p>理解B.1.1.7的严重程度（现在被称为VOC-20DEC-01）及其对住院和死亡的影响是一个更复杂的任务。通过全国各地的许多独立学术群体的工作继续更加清楚，越来越多地，国际上。</p><p> In January,  a report by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) concluded a “realistic possibility” that infection with B.1.1.7 is associated with an increased risk of death, potentially by up to 30 per cent.</p><p> 1月份，新的和新兴呼吸道病毒威胁咨询小组（神经创造）的报告总结了B.1.1.7的感染与死亡风险增加有关的“现实可能性”，可能会增加30％。</p><p> And a  PHE report published in February on the effectiveness of vaccines found the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer jabs both provide high levels of immunity against the variant.</p><p> 和2月份发表的PHE报告，疫苗的有效性发现牛津/阿斯塔州科和辉瑞刺刀两者都为变体提供高水平的免疫力。</p><p> “B.1.1.7 is now our virus until something displaces it. Understanding that severity and, more recently, vaccine effectiveness was needed in order to build it into our planning for healthcare and treatments,” says Meera.</p><p> “B.1.1.7现在是我们的病毒，直到一些东西取代它。理解严重程度，最近，需要疫苗的效果，以便将其建设到我们对医疗保健和治疗的规划中，“Meera说。</p><p> But despite major progress in understanding the behaviour of B.1.1.7, questions remain about the origin of the variant, and how and why such a range of mutations developed so quickly.</p><p> 但尽管在理解B.1.1.7的行为方面存在重大进展，但问题仍然是变体的起源，以及如何以及为什么这么快速发展的突变。</p><p> Richard explains: “I still don’t think we fully understand how and where that happened. A lot of the variants we observe in this country tend to be importation related, but in this one all evidence suggests this is probably a virus that has turned over in an individual in the UK for a long period of time and accumulated these mutations. It’s then popped out and started spreading, and by the time we saw it there were a significant number of cases.”</p><p> 理查德解释道：“我仍然不认为我们完全了解如何以及在哪里发生这种情况。我们在这个国家观察到的很多变体往往是有关的，但在这一件中，所有证据表明这可能是一段长时间在英国的个人身上转过来的病毒，并积累了这些突变。然后它会突然出来并开始传播，当我们看到它有很多案例。“</p><p>  Since the emergence of B.1.1.7, several other significant variants have been detected in the UK and are being tracked by PHE, though numbers remain low.</p><p>  由于B.1.1.7的出现，在英国检测到几种其他显着变体，并且通过PHE进行跟踪，但数字仍然低。 </p><p> Meera says: “We are going to see more variants. The conditions are there globally, and we will need to monitor and assess them even more quickly than we are now. The most concerning characteristic right now would be vaccine escape, though in the medium term if it is needed, vaccine updates could be used as they are in the global system for flu.”</p><p>Meera说：“我们会看到更多的变种。条件在全球范围内，我们将需要监控和评估它们比我们现在更快。现在最有关的特征将是疫苗逃脱，但如果需要在中期，如果需要，可以使用疫苗更新，因为它们在全球流感系统中。“</p><p> Domestically, genomic surveillance is expected to continue playing a leading role in informing national efforts to move out of restrictions by June 21, but international collaboration will also be essential for the future of the public health.</p><p> 在国内，预计基因组监测将继续发挥主导作用，以便在6月21日在6月21日迁出限制的情况下，但国际合作对公共卫生的未来也是至关重要的。</p><p> That global collaboration is already underway with the founding of the New Variant Assessment Platform, which aims to support the ability of countries around the world to identify variants of concern.</p><p> 全球合作已经在新的变体评估平台上进行，旨在支持全球各国的能力来识别关注的变体。</p><p> The platform is led by PHE, working with NHS Test and Trace, academic partners and the World Health Organization’s SARS-CoV-2 Global Laboratory Working Group.</p><p> 该平台由PHE领导，与NHS测试和追踪，学术合作伙伴和世界卫生组织的SARS-COV-2全球实验室工作组合作。</p><p> And feeding into these wider programmes will be data and analysis gathered by all the individuals working in the ever-evolving fields of genomics and bioinformatics.</p><p> 并进入这些更广泛的程序将是由所有在不断发展的基因组学和生物信息学领域工作的个人聚集的数据和分析。</p><p> Richard says: “The scale of this pandemic has blown previous outbreaks like Swine Flu out of the water. The fact this has coincided with a certain level of maturity in terms of genomic sequencing and bioinformatic technology has had a huge impact on our ability to gather valuable data and learn about this virus.”</p><p> 理查德说：“这种大流行的规模使先前的爆发出来就像猪流感出来的水。这一事实在基因组测序和生物信息技术方面恰逢一定程度的成熟度对我们收集有价值的数据的能力产生了巨大影响，并了解这种病毒。“</p><p> Meera adds: “The generation of viral genomic data in the UK has been an amazing development in the past year. And whilst we have to accept a bit of uncertainty in assessing a live situation, we need to use that data to provide the best insights we can in real time to help shape our response to the virus in this country going forward.”</p><p> GEERA补充说：“英国病毒基因组数据的产生是过去一年的惊人发展。而且，虽然我们必须接受评估现场情况的一些不确定性，但我们需要使用该数据来提供最好的见解，我们可以实时地帮助塑造我们对此国家的病毒的反应。“ </p><p> Interested in reading more?
