Snow blanketed the Rocky Mountains. I was on a solo backcountry ski trip, pausing in the pristine cordillera of the Healy Pass. Subalpine firs were bent over in casts of snow and ice, and the whitebark pines were spread-eagled like bouquets of bones, dead from mountain pine beetle and blister rust caused by the stress of climate change.</p><p> 阿西尼丁山，不列颠哥伦比亚省 -  11月。雪覆盖了落矶山脉。我在一个独奏的偏远的滑雪之旅，暂停在堆积的原始电线中。苏尔本山杉木在雪地和冰的铸造中弯曲，白银松树被淘汰的骨头，死于山松甲虫和气候变化压力引起的山虫甲虫和水疱生锈。</p><p> I was three months pregnant. In our year apart while my husband Don wrote his dissertation, perhaps because of our loneliness, there came a wordless dawning of the truth that I was 36 and he was 39, and the time for children had come. Skiing into Assiniboine was my celebration of this gift.</p><p> 我怀孕了三个月。在我们的一年里，我的丈夫唐写了他的论文，也许是因为我们的寂寞，我是36岁的真相无言越的曙光，他39岁，孩子们来了。进入Assiniboine是我对这件礼物的庆祝活动。</p><p> The beetles were on a rampage in the couloir. Four years earlier, in 1992, the outbreak had started northwest of here, in Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park; winter temperatures had increased by a few degrees and the coldest months stopped dropping below -30 Celsius, allowing the beetle larvae to thrive in the thick phloem of the aging pines.</p><p> 甲虫在库洛尔蔓延起来。四年以前，1992年，爆发已经开始在西北部，在斯皮萨迪高原荒野省级公园;冬季气温增加了几度，最冷的月份停止落下-30摄氏度以下，让甲虫幼虫茁壮成长在老化松树的厚厚的韧皮疙瘩中。</p><p> Lodgepole pine had coevolved with the beetles in this landscape, naturally succumbing, after about a century, to create space for the next generation. As the trees declined, fuel accumulated as a matter of course, and wildfires were ignited by lightning or people. Flames released pine seeds from resinous cones and stimulated aspens to sprout from thousand-year-old root systems, their moist leaves reducing the flammability of the young forest. As fire fingered through the landscape, it petered out in these aspen-clad glades, leaving a mosaic of different-aged forests that was itself resistant to future fires.</p><p> Lodgepole Pine在这种景观中携带甲虫，自然地在大约一个世纪后屈服，为下一代创造空间。由于树木下降，当然，省略的燃料和野火被闪电或人点燃。火焰从树脂锥中释放了松树种子，并刺激了千岁的根系中的白杨芽，他们的湿叶降低了年轻森林的可燃性。由于透过景观的火焰，它在这些阿斯彭 - 克拉德的兴趣别处彼得了，留下了不同老年森林的马赛克，这本身就是对未来的火灾抵抗力。</p><p> But in the late 1800s, European settlers disrupted this balance by burning the forest montage to the ground in search of gold, creating a vast blanket of new pine stands whose uniformity was later enhanced by fire suppression and herbicide spraying that ensured the aspens wouldn’t interfere with profits. As these pine trees turned 100 and the climate warmed, the beetle populations exploded, and the landscape ran red like blood flowing through water.</p><p> 但在18世纪后期，欧洲定居者通过将森林蒙太奇燃烧到地面来寻找金色的森林蒙太奇，造成一块巨大的新松树架，均匀的火灾抑制和除草剂喷洒的均匀性并不是干扰利润。随着这些松树100岁和气候温暖，甲虫人口爆炸，景观像血液一样汹涌澎湃。 </p><p> The air rushed cleanly into my lungs as I glided among the dead whitebark pines, intoxicated to be following tracks and carving new turns around rockfalls and tree wells. Don was taking the afternoon to build a cradle. Contentment had enveloped us both. But in the heart of the saddle between peaks, I stopped to check some tracks in the fresh snow and felt a familiar rush of fear. The paw prints were as large as saucers, claw marks an inch deep.</p><p>当我在死的白滨松树中滑动时，空气彻底冲进了我的肺部，醉酒追随轨道和落在岩石和树井周围的新转弯。唐正在下午建造一个摇篮。满足已经笼罩着我们两者。但在峰之间的马鞍心中，我停下来检查新雪的一些轨道，感受到熟悉的恐惧。爪印与碟子一样大，爪子深入。</p><p>  I skied away, across the pass. Soon, though, I was lost. When I circled back to the center, I shuddered to be back to my original tracks, already frozen in the drifting snow. And covered with fresh prints.</p><p>  我在过去的传球上滑过了。很快，但我迷失了。当我圈回到中心时，我颤抖着回到原来的轨道上，已经在漂流的雪中冷冻了。并用新鲜的印刷品覆盖。</p><p>  I instinctively kept skiing down the pass. Naked alpine larch, clustered in bowls below the peaks, their golden needles already fallen, were behind me. Down here, the subalpine firs were knotted together in small groves, their numbers increasing as I descended. Telemarking with 30 pounds on my back strained my legs. My baby, no bigger than an ounce of gold, didn’t throw off my balance. I cinched up the hip buckle to stabilize myself on the icy, broken terrain and turned slowly, one link at a time.</p><p>  我本能地保持滑雪通行证。赤裸的高山落叶松，聚集在峰值下方的碗中，他们的金色针已经下降，在我身后。在这里，亚水平杉木在小型树林中结合在一起，它们的数字随着我的下降而增加。在我的背上带着30磅的电话售价紧张我的腿。我的宝宝，没有大于一盎司的黄金，没有扔掉我的平衡。我把臀部扣紧贴在冰冷，破碎的地形上稳定，慢慢转动，一次一个环节。</p><p> I made a large traverse to the east to evade a ravine, avoiding a steep section before heading back. It was hard to see because the trees were tightly spaced. Younger lodgepole pines. There must have been a fire a few decades back. Soon I was off course again and checked my compass. If I didn’t stay oriented and get back to the main route, this could get dire.</p><p> 我在东边做了一个大的横向逃避山沟，在回头之前避免陡峭的部分。很难看，因为树木紧张。年轻的小屋松树。几十年来一定是火灾。我很快再次跑去检查我的指南针。如果我没有被定向并回到主要路线，这可能会变得急。</p><p> My fear built on some background frustration about my research. I had growing evidence that forests have intelligence — that they are perceptive and communicative — but I didn’t feel ready to take on the establishment. The fellows would ignore me or, worse, laugh at my talk of the sentience of plants.</p><p> 我的恐惧建立了一些关于我的研究的背景挫败感。我越来越多的证据表明森林有智慧 - 他们是看性和交际的 - 但我没有愿意接受建立。研究员会忽视我，或者更糟糕的是，嘲笑我谈论植物的感觉。</p><p> No, I was pregnant and needed to stay quiet to protect my child, the most precious thing in my life. A recent CBC radio interview had drawn some interest from local naturalists and environmentalists and even a few like-minded foresters, but it was met with silence from the provincial capital. Without even so much as an email from the policy guys, I wondered whether giving interviews was worth it. Or talks at conferences, for that matter. I couldn’t go public more than I already had; there was too much at stake now.</p><p> 不，我怀孕了，需要保持安静保护我的孩子，我生命中最珍贵的东西。最近的CBC无线电话面试吸引了一些来自当地的自然主义者和环保主义者的兴趣，甚至是一些志同道合的森林，但它与省级资本沉默。甚至没有那么多作为政策家伙的电子邮件，我想知道是否有面试是值得的。或者在会议上谈论这一事件。我不能比我所拥有的更多;现在有太多的赌注。</p><p> I skied back about 300 feet and found old tracks from earlier skiers. The wolf prints crossed them three times. It looked like at least five animals.</p><p> 我跳回了大约300英尺，从早期的滑雪者找到了旧轨道。狼打印越过它们三次。它看起来像至少五只动物。 </p><p> I skied farther. The lodgepole pine trees grew sparser, and their puffy crowns reached closer to the ground. There should be a special word for the type of mourning you know is to come. In a decade, almost 45 million acres of mature pine forest would be dead, representing about a third of the forested area of British Columbia. The beetles would continue to chew their way through whitebark, western white and ponderosa pines, through the U.S. from Oregon to Yellowstone, and would start infesting the jack-pine hybrids across the boreal forest of Canada, producing a total epidemic across North America in an area roughly the size of California. It would surpass any insect outbreak in recorded history and provide fuel for devastating wildfires down the road.</p><p>我滑过更远。 Lodgepole杉木树木稀疏，他们的浮肿冠越来越靠近地面。应该有一个特殊的词，你知道的是哀悼的类型。十年来，近4500万英亩的成熟杉木森林将被死亡，这是英国哥伦比亚森林地区的三分之一。甲虫将继续通过俄勒冈州的俄勒冈州的白票，西红柿和庞德萨松树咀嚼，并将开始在加拿大的北美北美的北美森林中侵染杰克松杂交种，在北美洲的总体流行病区域大致大小的加利福尼亚州。它将超越历史记录的任何昆虫爆发，并为在道路上毁坏野火提供燃料。</p><p> I passed a grove of bare aspens. The prints were melting in steaming urine. Dark orange-yellow. I kept to the main route out of the narrow valley, adrenaline making my pack lighter. The wolves stayed in front, just out of sight, leaving only traces.</p><p> 我通过了一块裸露的白杨树。印刷品在蒸汽尿液中熔化。深橙黄。我留在狭窄的山谷，肾上腺素中的主要路线让我的包装打火机。狼群在前面呆在外面，留下了痕迹。</p><p> Their tracks headed straight for the main northbound trail, and I suddenly calmed. The wolves were not pursuing me; they were leading me out of the valley. As the vista widened, my trail converged with one from the south. I turned onto it, while the wolf tracks veered abruptly north. A gust of wind blew over them as they disappeared into the trees.</p><p> 他们的曲目直接为主要的北行小径，我突然平静下来。狼没有追求我;他们带领我走出山谷。随着Vista扩大的，我的小径会融入南方。我转过身来，狼轨道突然转向北方。当他们消失在树上时，一阵风吹过它们。</p><p>  I lit a candle in the snow for my brother and for his spirit in those wolves. The lodgepole pines were tall and strong, and their lofty crowns shadowed me while they steadfastly watched over some sub-alpine firs. I needed to linger here where canyon rock and crystallized tree crowns and packs of wolves had come together. The sun climbed over the granite peaks, and I tilted my face toward it. I pulled out a sandwich, ready to stay forever. I felt welcomed, whole. Pure and clean and untroubled.</p><p>  我为我哥哥送了一支蜡烛，在那些狼群中为他的精神。 Lodgepole Pines身材高大，强壮，他们的崇高的冠冕遮蔽了我，而他们坚决看过一些亚高山的杉木。我需要在这里徘徊在这里峡谷摇滚和结晶的树冠和狼群一起聚集在一起。太阳爬过花岗岩峰，我朝着它倾斜。我拔出了一个三明治，准备永远保持着。我感到欢迎，整体。纯净，干净，无污染。</p><p> As I ate, I wondered why trees — these aspens and pines — would support a mycorrhizal fungus that provides carbon (or nitrogen) to a neighboring tree. Sharing with individuals of its own species, especially its own genetic family, seemed like an obvious benefit. Trees disperse most of their seeds — by gravity or wind or the odd bird or squirrel — in their small local area, meaning that many individuals in an immediate neighborhood are related.</p><p> 当我吃了时，我想知道为什么树木 - 这些白杨和松树 - 将支持一个菌根真菌，为邻近树提供碳（或氮气）。与自己物种的个人分享，特别是自己的遗传家庭，似乎是一个明显的益处。树木分散了大部分种子 - 以重力或风或奇怪的鸟类或松鼠 - 在他们的小局域中，这意味着即时邻居中的许多人都是相关的。</p><p> The pines clustered at the edge of this meadow were probably relatives of the same family, their genes diversified by pollen drifting in from distant fathers. These parent trees shared some of the genes of the trees around them, and passing along carbon to each other to increase the survival of their seedlings, their own offspring, would help ensure those genes got passed to future generations. A later study would show that the roots of at least half the pines in a stand are grafted together, and the larger trees subsidize the smaller ones with carbon. Blood runs thicker than water. This makes perfect sense from an individual-selection perspective. It’s Darwinian.</p><p> 在这个草地边缘聚集的松树可能是同一个家庭的亲属，他们的基因由遥远的父亲的花粉漂移多样化。这些父母树分享了它们周围的一些树木的一些基因，并沿着碳互相传递碳酸盐以增加他们自己的后代的生存，有助于确保这些基因被转移到后代。后来的研究表明，架子中至少有一半的松树的根部被移植在一起，并且较大的树木将较小的树木补贴着碳的较小。血液比水厚。这是从个人选择的角度来完美的意义。这是达尔文。</p><p> But my work was showing that some carbon also moved to unrelated individuals, ones of an entirely different species. From birch to fir and back again. I looked at the white aspen, its bark basking in the sun, and wondered if it shuffled carbon to the firs under its crown. The other way around too: firs to aspens.</p><p> 但我的作品表明一些碳也搬到了无关的人，一个完全不同的物种。从桦木到冷杉并再次回来。我看着白色的白杨，它的树皮在阳光下晒太阳，并想知道它是否会在其冠之下的冷杉上汇集碳。其他方式也是：杉木到白炽灯。 </p><p> Mycorrhizal fungi are generalists — they colonize plant root tissue, sometimes even intracellularly. They might invest in many tree species to hedge their bets for survival, and the off chance that some carbon would move to a stranger was simply part of the cost of moving it to relatives.</p><p>菌根真菌是一般主义者 - 他们殖民植物根组织，有时甚至细胞内。他们可能会投入许多树种来对冲他们的生存赌注，以及一些碳将转向陌生人的障碍只是将其转移到亲属的成本的一部分。</p><p> But this was not what my trees were showing. They were offering me evidence that the pattern of carbon movement was not just by chance, an unfortunate consequence of the moveable feast. No, my trees were demonstrating that they had a lot of skin in the game. Over and over, the experiments showed that carbon moved from a source tree to a sink tree — from a rich to a poor one — and that the trees had some control over where and how much carbon moved.</p><p> 但这不是我的树木所显示的。他们向我提供了证据表明碳运动的模式不仅仅是偶然的，可移动盛宴的不幸结果。不，我的树木正在展示游戏中有很多皮肤。一遍又一遍地，实验表明，碳从源树移动到水槽树 - 从富人到一个穷人 - 并且树木对移动的地点和多少碳有一些控制。</p><p> “Why would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals?”</p><p> “为什么老松子会对这些鸟类和动物的生殖成功相信？”</p><p> A squirrel chattered in the branch of a knotty juniper, waiting for me to toss it scraps of my sandwich. It kept an eye on the Clark’s nutcracker at the top of a pine, probably with a whitebark pine seed in its beak. A raven — a species that also coveted those energy-rich seeds — gurgled a song.</p><p> 一只松鼠在一个Knotty juniper的分支中喋喋不休，等着我扔掉我的三明治的碎片。它在松树顶部的克拉克的胡桃夹子中一直关注克拉克的胡桃夹子，可能在喙上有一个白班松种子。乌鸦 - 一种也垂涎的物种，富含能量的种子 - 咕噜咕噜。</p><p> Whitebark pine depends on all these species and more, including grizzly bears, to scatter its heavy seeds. Why would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals, whose interest in the seeds was only as food? A few seeds needed to be left to germinate and grow into offspring to ensure the successful reproduction of the elders; why trust that enough would remain? If one of these seed dispersers disappeared, perhaps in a fire or during a particularly harsh winter, then others might deliver the goods. In the same vein, why would a tree pass carbon to a generalist networking fungus — a Suillus or Cortinarius — that could then pass the carbon to an unrelated tree? From the pine to the understory subalpine fir?</p><p> 白班堡杉木取决于所有这些物种等，包括灰熊，散布其沉重的种子。为什么旧的松树会将他们的生殖成功相信这些鸟类和动物，其对种子的兴趣只是食物？需要一些种子需要留下来发芽并成长为后代，以确保成功的长老繁殖;为什么要信任足够的留下？如果这些种子分散器中的一个消失，也许在火灾中或在一个特别严酷的冬天期间，那么其他人可能会提供货物。在同一静脉中，为什么树木将碳通给通流网络真菌 - 一种杂志或cortinarius  - 然后可以将碳传递给一个不相关的树？从松树到林下亚水本子杉木？</p><p> I threw my crust toward the squirrel, and the raven and nutcracker swooped to jockey for the prize. Tail twitching, the squirrel launched off its stump. Just as the old whitebark pines were glad to feed their seeds to birds and squirrels, depending on more than one for dispersal, there must be a similar evolutionary advantage to a tree hosting many mycorrhizal fungal species making up the linking network, letting it benefit from a diverse suite as insurance in case one element got lost.</p><p> 我把我的外壳带到了松鼠，乌鸦和胡桃夹子赶到了歌剧奖。尾部抽搐，松鼠突破了它的树桩。正如旧白银松树很高兴为鸟类和松鼠喂养种子，就取决于一个以上的分散，必须对托管许多构成连接网络的菌根真菌物种时必须存在类似的进化优势，让它受益在一个元素丢失的情况下，一个不同的套件作为保险。</p><p> Maybe even more important was the fungi’s ability to reproduce rapidly. Their short life cycle would enable them to adapt to the rapidly changing environment — fire and wind and climate — much faster than the steadfast, long-lived trees could manage. The oldest Rocky Mountain juniper is about 1,500 years old and the oldest whitebark pine around 1,300, in Utah and Idaho, respectively. Meanwhile, the trees here would take decades to produce their first cones and seeds and then do so only sporadically thereafter, but their fungal network could spawn mushrooms and spores each time it rained, potentially enabling its genes to recombine several times a year.</p><p> 可能更重要的是真菌迅速繁殖的能力。他们的短暂的生命周期将使他们能够适应快速变化的环境 - 火灾和风和气候 - 比坚定不移的树木更快，长期的树木可以管理。最古老的岩石山杜松分别在犹他州和爱达荷州左右约有1500岁，最古老的白银湖泊左右，占地1,300棵。与此同时，这里的树木将花几十年来生产他们的第一锥和种子，然后每次偶尔这样做，但每次下雨都可以产生蘑菇和孢子，可能使其基因每年重新组合其基因。 </p><p> Maybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty. Instead of waiting for the next generation of trees to reproduce with more adaptive ways of coping with the soils warming and drying as the climate changes, the mycorrhizal fungi with which the trees are in symbiosis could evolve much faster to acquire increasingly tightly bound resources. Perhaps the Suillus and Boletus and Cortinarius fungi could respond more immediately to the warming winters that had spawned the mountain pine beetle outbreak and help the trees still gather nutrients and water to maintain a level of resistance.</p><p>也许快速循环的真菌可以为树木迅速调整以应对变化和不确定性的方式提供一种方法。除了等待下一代树木以随着气候变化的含量加热和干燥的更具适应性的方式再生，而是树木在共生中的菌根真菌可以发展得多，以获得越来越紧密的资源。也许是Suillus和Boletus和Cortinarius Fungi可以立即回应更加生成山松甲虫爆发的变暖冬天，帮助树木仍然收集养分和水来保持抗性水平。</p><p> “Maybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty.”</p><p> “也许快速循环真菌可以为树木迅速调整以应对改变和不确定性的方式提供一种方法。”</p><p> The raven won the battle for my sandwich crust and spiraled past the Clark’s nutcracker in a cloud of feathers and squawks. Not only was the squirrel too slow, it had no hope of wresting anything from the beak of a bird. It would have to unearth whitebark seeds instead, after the birds buried them. Or it could feast on a mushroom left drying in the branches of a pine. It wouldn’t live long with neighbors like the raven and nutcracker if it had to rely only on whitebark pine seeds they’d overlooked. Likewise, the fungus could hedge its bets, hitching its spores on legs or feathers, or catching an updraft to colonize new hosts.</p><p> 乌鸦赢得了我的三明治地壳的战斗，并在羽毛和枯萎的卷发中旋转过克拉克的胡桃夹子。松鼠不仅仅是慢，它并不希望从鸟的喙中缠绕任何东西。在鸟类埋葬时，它必须放弃白票种子。或者它可以在松树的分支中留下蘑菇。如果它不得不只依赖于他们忽略的白银杉木种子，那就不会像乌鸦和胡桃夹子那样长久。同样，真菌可以对冲它的赌注，勾勒出腿或羽毛上的孢子，或捕捉到新宿主的上升机。</p><p> If the fungus acquires more carbon from one tree than it needs for its own growth and survival, then it could supply the excess to the other networked trees in need and, in so doing, diversify its carbon portfolio — insurance in acquiring essential resources. The fungus could shuttle carbon produced by a rich aspen to a poor pine in the middle of the summer to ensure it had two different healthy hosts — sources of photosynthetic carbon — in case there was a calamity and one died. Like investing in stocks along with bonds in case the market crashed.</p><p> 如果真菌从一棵树中获得比其自身的生长和生存的需要更多的碳，那么它可能会向其他网络树木提供多余的需要，并且在这种情况下，它可以使其碳投资组合 - 在获得基本资源中的保险。真菌可以在夏季中间的富含白杨树生产的碳碳，以确保它有两种不同的健康主持人 - 光合碳源 - 以防有灾难和死亡。就像在市场崩溃的情况下投资股票一样。</p><p> The fungus might not care what species the hosts were, as long as at least one of its carbon sources remained viable. Investing in diverse plant communities is a lower-risk strategy than investing in just one species. The more stressful the environment, the more successful those fungi are at associating with multiple tree species.</p><p> 真菌可能不在乎宿主所在的物种，只要其至少一个碳源保持不可行。投资不同的植物社区是一个低于一个物种的较低风险策略。环境压力越强大，那些真菌的成功就越来越与多树种。</p><p> “Maybe birch and fir are in a prisoner’s dilemma where the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives.”</p><p> “也许桦木和冷杉在囚犯的困境中，团体合作的好处超过了个别特权的成本。”</p><p>  Though my puzzling elated me, something still didn’t quite fit together. As I shouldered my pack and turned to the fork that led south along Bryant Creek, I thought about the greater group of interacting species: the whole community of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. Individual selection might explain how the fluorescent Pseudomonads interacted with the mycorrhizal fungi of birch to reduce Armillaria root disease in Douglas fir. Could selection also operate at the group level?</p><p>  虽然我的令人费解了我，但有些东西仍然不太适合。当我的包装然后转向沿着布莱恩特克里克沿着南方的叉子转向叉子，我想到了更多的互动物种：整个植物，动物，真菌和细菌的整个社区。个体选择可能会解释荧光假单胞菌如何与桦树的菌根真菌相互作用，以减少道格拉斯冷杉的尸体生根疾病。可以选择也在集团级别运行？ </p><p> Do cooperative guilds of species — like guilds of people in societies — exist? Where multiple tree species are linked by a network for mutual aid, in the way it takes a village to raise a child, despite a risk that there might be cheaters in such guilds? This sharing would work if our behavior was ruled by steadfast tit for tat, like the two-way transfer between birch and fir and their principle of reciprocity, changing the direction of net transfer over the course of the summer. Quid pro quo.</p><p>存在合作社的物种 - 像社团人群的像会 - 存在吗？多树种被网络链接到互助的网络相关的地方，仍然需要一个村庄抚养孩子的方式，尽管有这种公会可能有骗子的风险？如果我们的行为由TAT坚定统治，这种共享将起作用，就像桦树和冷杉之间的双向转移以及它们的互惠原则一样，改变夏季过程中净转移的方向。 quid pro quo。</p><p> But what about longer-term shifts in trade? Such as when firs eventually grow taller than birches. Would the quid pro quo rule of engagement change, and how might this compare to our human lives when they become more complex and our relationships transform with age? If someone helps me with childcare, how do I repay her if she moves far away? I wondered why two tree species would continue to trade carbon over the long term, given the uncertainty of the future.</p><p> 但贸易中长期班次呢？比如冷杉最终生长高于桦树。 Quid pro quo的参与规则会改变，以及当他们变得更加复杂的时候，这对我们的人类的生活相比如何与年龄变换？如果有人帮助我托儿，如果她遥远的话，我如何偿还她？鉴于未来的不确定性，我想知道为什么两棵树种类将在长期内继续贸易碳。</p><p> Maybe birch and fir, and Armillaria ostoyae fungus and fluorescent Pseudomonads, are in a prisoner’s dilemma where, in the long run, the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives. Studies show time and again that cooperation is commonly chosen in groups, even when betrayal of others could lead to a better individual reward. Fir can’t survive without birch due to a high risk of infection from Armillaria , and birch can’t survive in the long run without fir because too much nitrogen would accumulate in the soil, causing the soil to acidify and birch to decline.</p><p> 也许桦树和冷杉，而Armillaria Ostoyae真菌和荧光假单胞菌，在囚犯的困境中，从长远来看，团体合作的好处超过了个别特权的成本。研究表明，即使对他人的背叛可能导致更好的个人奖励，也常常在群体中选择合作。由于来自阿米拿利亚的感染的高风险而没有桦树不能在没有桦树的情况下生存，并且在没有冷杉的情况下，桦树不能生存，因为太多的氮会积聚在土壤中，导致土壤酸化和桦木下降。</p><p> “Ecosystems are similar to human societies — they’re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system.”</p><p> “生态系统类似于人类社会 - 他们构建了关系。那些越强，系统越有弹性。“</p><p> In this scenario, the little fluorescent Pseudomonad bacteria serve two functions: They produce compounds that inhibit the spread of Armillaria root disease among the trees, ensuring there is still a source of carbon energy for the community, and they transform nitrogen using the carbon exuded by the mycorrhizal network. Was this still in line with selection at the individual species level, or was it at the level of the group?</p><p> 在这种情况下，小荧光假单胞菌细菌服务了两种功能：它们产生了抑制树木中尸体根源疾病的蔓延的化合物，确保仍然是社区的碳能源来源，并且它们使用碳渗出的碳菌根网络。这仍然是在各种物种级别的选择，还是在本集团的水平？</p><p> Distracted, I practically skied straight into a couple of biologists tracking the radio-collared wolves that had been guiding me earlier. They knew the pack well; the leader was an old mother wolf.</p><p> 分散注意力，我实际上直接进入了几位追踪了早些时候引导我的无线电衣裤的生物学家。他们很好地了解包装;领导者是一位老狼。</p><p> I asked why they were tracking the wolves. As the shadows of the peaks grew longer, the lead tracker, a lean, windburned woman with a dark ponytail, told me about the pressure to cull wolves in the park to alleviate the decline of caribou. She pushed her sunglasses back on her head as she spoke, radiating a fierce intelligence.</p><p> 我问为什么他们正在跟踪狼。随着山峰的阴影增长更长时间，引线跟踪器，一个带有黑色马尾辫的瘦衣服，一个瘦身的女人，并告诉我关于凯尔沃夫在公园的压力，以缓解驯鹿的衰落。当她说话时，她把她的太阳镜推回她的头上，辐射着激烈的智慧。 </p><p> “It’s the clear-cutting,” I responded, meeting her gaze. The sprouting willows and alders were attractive browse for moose, so their populations were increasing and attracting wolves. The problem was that the wolves also hunted mountain caribou, which were in precipitous decline due to habitat loss and interactions with people.</p><p>“这是清澈的，”我回答说，迎接她的目光。发芽的柳树和桤木对驼鹿有吸引力，因此他们的种群正在增加和吸引狼。问题是，狼也捕猎山驯鹿，由于栖息地的损失和与人的互动，急剧下降。</p><p> She nodded in agreement as she shifted on her skis and checked that her avalanche beacon was on.</p><p> 她在她的滑雪板上转移并检查了她的雪崩灯塔，她点头点头。</p><p> “Yes, the snow gets so deep in the clear-cuts, the caribou can’t outrun the wolves,” she said, looking toward the trail where the mother wolf had gone. And there were more and more clear-cuts as the beetle-killed pines were being salvaged.</p><p> “是的，雪地在清澈的剪切中变得如此深，驯鹿不能超越狼，”她说，朝着母亲狼走了的道路。随着甲虫杀死的松树正在挽救甲虫杀害的松树，越来越清楚。</p><p> “Gotta go or we’ll lose them,” her assistant said, squinting at a tracking device and tightening the chest strap on his pack. The researcher’s eyes narrowed toward the pass ahead.</p><p> “得走了，我们会失去它们，”她的助手说，在跟踪装置上眯着眼睛，拧紧他的包装上的胸带。研究人员的眼睛缩小了前方的传递。</p><p> “We can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony.”</p><p> “我们可以想到狼，驯鹿，树木和真菌的生态系统，创造生物多样性，就像伍德风，黄铜，打击乐器和弦音乐家组装成一个交响乐团的管弦乐队一样。”</p><p> “See ya,” she said, and I said goodbye too, appreciating her unwavering pursuit. They evaporated into the pines as seamlessly as they had appeared, reminding me that a person could easily disappear out here without a trace. It was past noon. I had to keep moving or I’d be skiing the last miles in the dark.</p><p> “看到你，”她说，我也说再见，欣赏她坚定不移的追求。当他们出现时，他们像他们一样无缝地蒸发到松树中，提醒我，一个人可以轻松消失在这里没有痕迹。正是在中午。我必须继续移动，或者我会在黑暗中滑雪。</p><p> The trail along Bryant Creek was fast and gently downhill, and as I raced past swaying pines, the sun at my back and the avalanche tracks falling behind me, I was grateful the wolf biologists had packed down the trail with their skis. I reached my car as the sky’s pink and purple stripes faded to black across the tilted sheets of sedimentary crust.</p><p> 沿着布莱恩克里克的踪迹快速轻柔地下坡，而当我摇摇欲坠的松树时，我的背部和雪崩轨道落后于我，我很感激狼生物学家用他们的滑雪板挤在小径上。我到达我的车，因为天空的粉红色和紫色条纹逐渐消失在沉积地壳的倾斜床单上。 </p><p> Ecosystems are similar to human societies — they’re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system. And since our world’s systems are composed of individual organisms, they have the capacity to change. We creatures adapt, our genes evolve, we can learn from experience. A system is ever-changing because its parts — the trees and fungi and people — are constantly responding to one another and to the environment. Our success in coevolution — our success as a productive society — is only as good as the strength of the bonds with other individuals and species. Out of the resulting adaptation and evolution emerge behaviors that help us survive, grow and thrive.</p><p>生态系统类似于人类社会 - 他们建立在人际关系上。那些越强，系统的弹性越大。由于我们的世界系统由个体生物组成，因此他们有能力改变。我们生物适应，我们的基因进化，我们可以从经验中学习。系统是不断变化的，因为它的部分 - 树木和真菌和人民 - 不断响应彼此和环境。我们在协会中取得成功 - 我们作为生产性的社会的成功 - 只是与其他个人和物种的债券的力量一样好。出于由此产生的适应和进化出现了帮助我们生存，生长和茁壮成长的行为。</p><p> We can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony. Or how our brains, composed of neurons, axons and neurotransmitters, produce thought and compassion. Or the way brothers and sisters join to overcome a trauma like illness or death — the whole greater than the sum of the parts.</p><p> 我们可以想到狼，驯鹿，树木和真菌的生态系统，创造生物多样性，就像伍德风，黄铜，打击乐器和弦音乐家组装成一个交响乐团的管弦乐队一样。或者我们的大脑，由神经元，轴突和神经递质组成，产生思想和同情。或兄弟姐妹加入的方式克服疾病或死亡等创伤 - 整体大于零件的总和。</p><p> The cohesion of biodiversity in a forest, the musicians in an orchestra, the members of a family growing through conversation and feedback, through memories and learning from the past, even </p><p> 森林中的生物多样性凝聚力，乐团的音乐家，一个家庭的成员通过对话和反馈，通过回忆和学习过去，甚至</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-intelligent-forest">https://www.noemamag.com/the-intelligent-forest</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/森林/">#森林</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/树木/">#树木</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
