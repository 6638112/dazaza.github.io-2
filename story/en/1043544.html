The results are positive throughout. Kudelski could not find any critical weaknesses and the few suggestions for improvement have already been implemented. In the following article, we provide an insight into the audit process and the results.</p><p>2020年5月，安全公司Kudelski对Boxcryptor进行了全面的外部审核。整个结果都是肯定的。 Kudelski找不到任何严重的弱点，并且已经提出了一些改进建议。在下面的文章中，我们提供了对审核过程和结果的深入了解。</p><p> Boxcryptor ensures that no one has access to data without authorization. Cloud providers and their staff, as well as potential hackers, are excluded reliably. For private users, Boxcryptor is a means of digital self-defense against curious third parties, for companies and organizations it is a path to genuine GDPR compliance and complete control over business data. With software as security-relevant as Boxcryptor, it is understandable that users want to be sure that the software works properly and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</p><p> Boxcryptor确保没有人未经授权就可以访问数据。可靠地排除了云提供商及其员工以及潜在的黑客。对于私人用户而言，Boxcryptor是一种针对好奇的第三方进行数字自卫的手段，对于公司和组织而言，这是实现真正的GDPR合规性以及对业务数据进行完全控制的途径。使用与Boxcryptor一样与安全性相关的软件，可以理解的是，用户希望确保该软件能够正常运行，并且能够正确执行其应有的功能。</p><p> For the audit we gave Kudelski access to the source code of Boxcryptor for Windows (our most widely used platform) and to our internal documentation.</p><p> 为了进行审核，我们使Kudelski可以访问Boxcryptor for Windows（我们使用最广泛的平台）的源代码以及内部文档。</p><p> All these components were logically correct and did not show any significant weakness under scrutiny. It is important to note that the codebase we audited was not showing any signs of malicious intent. (Boxcryptor Code Audit – Final Report)</p><p> 所有这些组成部分在逻辑上都是正确的，并且在审查中没有显示任何明显的弱点。请务必注意，我们审核的代码库未显示任何恶意意图。 （Boxcryptor代码审核–最终报告）</p><p> The goal of the audit was to give all interested parties an indirect insight into the software. This way they can be sure that no backdoors or security flaws are found in the code.</p><p> 审核的目的是使所有有关方面对软件都有间接的了解。这样，他们可以确保在代码中没有发现后门或安全漏洞。</p><p>  We have chosen to have our audit conducted by Kudelski Security. The world-renowned Swiss security company develops its own security software and has advised and audited many large companies. Kudelski’s technology and vulnerability assessment enjoy a very good reputation in the industry. In their audits, Kudelski’s independent security experts first obtain an overview of the software architecture of the technology under test. In a second step, they identify potential vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.</p><p>  我们选择由Kudelski Security进行审核。这家享誉世界的瑞士安全公司开发自己的安全软件，并已为许多大型公司提供建议和审计服务。 Kudelski的技术和漏洞评估在业界享有很高的声誉。在审核中，Kudelski的独立安全专家首先获得被测技术的软件体系结构的概述。第二步，他们确定需要解决的潜在漏洞。</p><p>  We were thinking about having Boxcryptor audited for quite some time now, but we have always decided against it for a variety of reasons. Our biggest problem with an audit has always been that audits are just a snapshot of the software. We are constantly working on the software, and – we thought – with the next update, the audit would be out of date again. Additionally, an audit is never a guarantee that a software is safe, because nothing in the field of security can ever be a 100% secure. Kudelski also records this in its report.</p><p>  我们本来想对Boxcryptor进行审核已经有一段时间了，但是出于各种原因，我们始终反对这样做。审核的最大问题始终是审核只是软件的快照。我们一直在开发该软件，并且-我们认为-随着下一次更新，审核将再次过时。此外，审计永远不能保证软件是安全的，因为安全领域中没有任何事物可以100％安全。库德尔斯基也将其记录在其报告中。 </p><p> It is important to notice that, although we did our best in our analysis, no code audit assessment is per se guarantee of absence of vulnerabilities. (Boxcryptor Code Audit – Final Report)</p><p>重要的是要注意，尽管我们尽了最大的努力进行分析，但没有代码审核评估本身就可以保证没有漏洞。 （Boxcryptor代码审核–最终报告）</p><p> In our opinion, this applies to the open source model as well. Just because software is openly available does not mean that you can rely on every change being critically reviewed by security experts. A real security analysis of open source software is also rather the exception, so in principle the same problem remains. Since an audit also has a significant financial impact, we have always wondered whether the potential benefits do justice to the financial outlay – especially in the first years as a start-up.</p><p> 我们认为，这也适用于开源模型。仅仅因为软件是公开可用的，并不意味着您可以依靠安全专家严格审查过的每项更改。对开源软件进行真正的安全性分析也是一个例外，因此原则上仍然存在相同的问题。由于审计也对财务产生重大影响，因此我们一直想知道潜在收益是否确实符合财务支出的要求，尤其是在刚成立的最初几年。</p><p>  Since Boxcryptor has been on the market for over nine years and is used by hundreds of thousands of users, we have decided to conduct an audit. For example, it may not be that important to audit every single version of a software. It is rather a matter of being able to assess three essential things:1.	the company behind the software2.	the quality of the software in general3.	the security-relevant source code (which is not constantly being changed)A positive audit report helps users to assure themselves of this quality. It also shows, in our opinion, the following.</p><p>  由于Boxcryptor在市场上已经存在了9年以上，并且已有成千上万的用户使用，因此我们决定进行审核。例如，审核软件的每个单一版本可能并不那么重要。能够评估三个基本问题是一个问题：1。该软件背后的公司2。总体上软件的质量3。安全相关的源代码（不会经常更改）积极的审核报告可帮助用户确保自己的质量。我们认为，它还显示了以下内容。</p><p>  The team behind Boxcryptor knows what it is doing. Cryptography is complex and to write secure software requires a lot of expertise and talent. Since verified experts examined Boxcryptor and found it to be secure, the user can assume that serious bugs and security problems are unlikely to occur in future versions of the software.</p><p>  Boxcryptor背后的团队知道它在做什么。密码术很复杂，编写安全的软件需要大量的专业知识和才能。由于经过验证的专家检查了Boxcryptor并发现它是安全的，因此用户可以假定在将来的软件版本中不太可能发生严重的错误和安全问题。</p><p>  The greatest expertise is of no use if the security aspect is not sufficiently taken into account in the development process. For example, if the company’s security expert does not even see new code, even companies with encryption legends may develop insecure products as a team.</p><p>  如果在开发过程中没有充分考虑安全方面，那么最好的专业知识就没有用。例如，如果公司的安全专家甚至看不到新代码，那么即使具有加密传奇的公司也可能会团队开发不安全的产品。</p><p>  We have always communicated our encryption protocol very openly. Based on our technical overview and a   release of our source code for our encryption on GitHub , Boxcryptor can almost be replicated conceptually. Nevertheless, most users do not have the time to check this information themselves by decrypting their own files “manually”. With Kudelski, a well-known, competent and independent partner has taken on this task and can now confirm that we actually do what we promise.</p><p>  我们一直非常公开地交流我们的加密协议。根据我们的技术概述以及在GitHub上用于加密的源代码的发布，Boxcryptor几乎可以在概念上进行复制。但是，大多数用户没有时间通过​​“手动”解密自己的文件来自己检查此信息。与Kudelski一起，一个著名的，能干的和独立的合作伙伴已经承担了这项任务，现在可以确认我们确实履行了我们的承诺。</p><p>  The audit shows that our cryptographic concept is secure. Users can be even more reassured after the independent audit by Kudelski, as the experts did not find any security-critical vulnerabilities in Boxcryptor.</p><p>  审计表明，我们的加密概念是安全的。经过Kudelski的独立审核，用户可以更加放心，因为专家们在Boxcryptor中没有发现任何对安全至关重要的漏洞。 </p><p> Overall the cryptographic primitives used and the architecture of the system are adequate to achieve the security goals we were presented. (Boxcryptor Code Audit – Final Report)</p><p>总体而言，所使用的密码原语和系统架构足以实现我们提出的安全目标。 （Boxcryptor代码审核–最终报告）</p><p>  Of course, it is possible that a weak point is overlooked during an audit. But it is very unlikely that major problems go unnoticed. We believe that this statement will remain true for future versions. We have always been convinced that we have done good and reliable work with Boxcryptor in the past. The result of the audit confirms this assumption and you can expect the same from us in the future.</p><p>  当然，在审核过程中有可能忽略了薄弱环节。但是，重大问题被忽视的可能性很小。我们认为此声明在将来的版本中将保持正确。我们始终坚信，过去我们与Boxcryptor进行了出色而可靠的工作。审核结果证实了这一假设，您将来可以期望我们也这样做。</p><p>   As already mentioned, security has always been a top priority in our software and we always pay great attention to security issues. Nevertheless, we only see Boxcryptor from our perspective and risk a certain amount of operational blindness. For this reason alone, it made sense to provide an external company with insight into the code. This way, external experts could point out problem areas to us if necessary.</p><p>   如前所述，安全一直是我们软件中的头等大事，我们始终非常重视安全问题。但是，从我们的角度来看，我们只能看到Boxcryptor，并且冒着一定程度的操作盲目性。仅出于这个原因，向外部公司提供有关代码的见解是有意义的。这样，外部专家可以在必要时向我们指出问题领域。</p><p>  One point that was important to us was the verification of our   Secure Software Development Lifecycle  (SSDL). We have a defined process to test our software for security before, during and after development. One of the goals of this SSDL is to identify as many problem areas, security-relevant scenarios and attack possibilities as possible. Kudelski’s external audit has now enabled us to match this process with the problems found. The questions we can ask ourselves when problems arise are as follows: What type of problem is it? In principle, could we have found the problem using our SSDL process? Does the report cover a whole area that we have not considered? Why were the problems that were found not discovered by us before? The audit could have given us input that would have allowed us to adapt and improve our SSDL.</p><p>  对我们而言重要的一点是对我们的安全软件开发生命周期（SSDL）的验证。在开发之前，之中和之后，我们都有定义好的过程来测试软件的安全性。该SSDL的目标之一是确定尽可能多的问题区域，与安全相关的方案和攻击可能性。 Kudelski的外部审核现在使我们能够将此过程与发现的问题相匹配。问题出现时我们可以问自己以下问题：什么类型的问题？原则上，我们可以使用SSDL流程发现问题吗？报告是否涵盖了我们尚未考虑的整个领域？为什么以前发现的问题是我们以前没有发现的？审核可以给我们提供输入，使我们能够适应和改进SSDL。</p><p> Fortunately, our SSDL has proven itself, so no changes to the process were necessary. Nevertheless, we have been able to take away a new line of thinking here and there for our own search for weaknesses.</p><p> 幸运的是，我们的SSDL已经证明了自己，因此无需更改过程。然而，我们能够在这里和那里采取新的思路，以便我们自己寻找弱点。</p><p>  In the course of the audit, we revised the complete internal documentation so that Kudelski can find its way around easily. This gave our internal documents a final polish once again. As a result, we now have documentation that is easy to understand, well-structured and clearly arranged in one place available for new employees of the company.</p><p>  在审核过程中，我们修订了完整的内部文档，以便Kudelski可以轻松地找到解决方法。这使我们的内部文件再次得到了最后的完善。因此，我们现在拥有易于理解，结构合理且清晰易懂的文档，可在一个位置提供给公司的新员工。</p><p>   At the beginning of the audit, we discussed and defined the goals of the audit, the threat model against which Boxcryptor has to protect its users, and the relevant code sections. First of all, we had to be clear what was to be audited at all and which attacker we were expecting.</p><p>   在审核开始时，我们讨论并定义了审核目标，Boxcryptor必须针对其保护用户的威胁模型以及相关代码部分。首先，我们必须明确要审核的内容以及我们期望的攻击者。 </p><p> For example, should Boxcryptor employees also be considered as potential attackers? Do we also want to protect ourselves against theoretical attacks from cloud providers? In both cases, the answer during our audit was yes. In this first step of the objective, the audit company was given access to our external and internal documentation, the source code and an intro to it.</p><p>例如，Boxcryptor员工是否也应被视为潜在的攻击者？我们是否还想保护自己免受云提供商的理论攻击？在这两种情况下，我们审核期间的答案都是肯定的。在目标的第一步中，使审计公司可以访问我们的外部和内部文档，源代码及其简介。</p><p>  Kudelski launched the audit process at the beginning of May, with short communication channels at all times to the developers and managers in the Boxcryptor team. We quickly noticed how routinely Kudelski worked, as they were able to get to grips with our – for them, foreign – code without any lengthy training. This was pleasant for us, as the effort required by the developers supervising the audit was surprisingly low. This is very relevant for us, because when considering the cost of an audit, one must always bear in mind the cost of the time lost by the staff if they were to be occupied by the audit company 24 hours a day.</p><p>  Kudelski于5月初启动了审核流程，并始终与Boxcryptor团队的开发人员和管理人员保持简短的沟通渠道。我们很快注意到了Kudelski的日常工作方式，因为他们无需任何长时间的培训就能掌握我们（对他们而言，对他们而言）的外国代码。这对我们来说是令人愉快的，因为开发人员监督审核所需的工作量非常少。这对我们非常重要，因为在考虑审计成本时，如果员工要一天24小时被审计公司占用，则必须始终牢记员工损失的时间成本。</p><p> Important: if Kudelski had found a serious security breach, they would not have held it back until the final report but would have reported the problem immediately. This made it clear to us that Kudelski’s priority was the same as Boxcryptor’s and our users’: the security of customer data has top priority at all times.</p><p> 重要提示：如果Kudelski发现了严重的安全漏洞，则他们不会等到最终报告后才将其推迟，但会立即报告此问题。这清楚地告诉我们，Kudelski的优先级与Boxcryptor和我们的用户的优先级相同：客户数据的安全性始终是头等大事。</p><p> In our case, the audit comprised two parts. We did not just want to have our software and its code verified, we also wanted to audit our Boxcryptor protocol (which you can have a look at at any time in our   technical overview . Since a building can only be as stable as it was designed, we wanted to make sure that our protocol, the foundation of Boxcryptor, is stable.</p><p> 在我们的案例中，审核包括两个部分。我们不仅要验证软件及其代码，还想审核Boxcryptor协议（您可以随时在技术概述中查看该协议。由于建筑物只能像设计的那样稳定） ，我们想确保我们的协议（Boxcryptor的基础）稳定。</p><p>  Once Kudelski had completed the audit, a preliminary report was drawn up. On the basis of this, the problems found were discussed and we had the chance to fix them. Kudelski then re-examined the measures taken and drew up a final report.</p><p>  库德尔斯基完成审核后，便草拟了初步报告。在此基础上，讨论了发现的问题，我们有机会对这些问题进行了修复。库德尔斯基随后重新审查了所采取的措施，并草拟了最终报告。</p><p>  In the following, we briefly summarize the results and their interpretation and assessment for you.   You can view the entire audit report here .</p><p>  在下文中，我们为您简要总结了结果及其解释和评估。您可以在此处查看整个审核报告。</p><p> Overall, there were few surprises. There was no critical and only one weakness rated “medium”. This concerned the software and not the underlying encryption technology. The problems could therefore be fixed quickly and we are thoroughly satisfied with the result.</p><p> 总体而言，没有什么惊喜。没有严重的漏洞，只有一个漏洞被评为“中级”。这关系到软件，而不是底层的加密技术。因此，可以迅速解决问题，我们对结果完全满意。 </p><p> The following issues were found in the audit:•	A issue rated as “medium”•	2 issues classified as “low”•	6 “observations” to be taken as an indication</p><p>在审核中发现以下问题：•被评为“中”的事件•被分类为“低”的2个问题•被视为“ 6”的“观察”</p><p>   Description:  The problem rated as medium is a part of the code that affects the connection to cloud providers that use the WebDAV protocol. Theoretically, the operators of such cloud storage providers could have tried to inject code into Boxcryptor for Windows. In practice, however, this part of the code was never used by Boxcryptor, so there was no danger for Boxcryptor users at any time.</p><p>   说明：等级为中的问题是影响与使用WebDAV协议的云提供商的连接的代码的一部分。从理论上讲，此类云存储提供商的运营商可能曾试图将代码注入Boxcryptor for Windows。然而，实际上，Boxcryptor从未使用过这部分代码，因此Boxcryptor用户在任何时候都没有危险。</p><p> Solution:  In response to the audit, we have now completely removed this redundant part of the code.</p><p> 解决方案：作为对审计的回应，我们现在已经完全删除了代码的冗余部分。</p><p>   Description:  The most interesting problem for us, rated as “low”, concerned Boxcryptor’s handling of the user password. Boxcryptor uses multiple password hashing to provide users with the highest possible security, even when they use a password that is actually insecure. In this process, the password is linked to bytes which are unique for each user, and then hashed several times. A hash is a kind of “fingerprint” of the password, which cannot be calculated back into the password. The random data serves the purpose of ensuring that two users with the same password still generate different fingerprints. This process has two goals: By hashing the password   before  the transfer, the user password is never sent to the server (of course we also hash this fingerprint a second time   after  the transfer). Multiple hashing also reduces the number of passwords that an attacker can test in a given time: Because generating so many fingerprints takes time, and that slows down the attacker. After all, he or she has to perform this calculation anew for each attempt.</p><p>   说明：对我们来说，最有趣的问题（被评为“低”）与Boxcryptor对用户密码的处理有关。 Boxcryptor使用多个密码哈希来为用户提供最高的安全性，即使用户使用实际上不安全的密码也是如此。在此过程中，密码链接到每个用户唯一的字节，然后进行多次哈希处理。散列是密码的一种“指纹”，无法将其计算回密码中。随机数据的目的是确保使用相同密码的两个用户仍然生成不同的指纹。此过程有两个目标：通过在传输之前对密码进行哈希处理，永远不会将用户密码发送到服务器（当然，我们也将在传输之后再次对指纹进行哈希处理）。多重哈希也减少了攻击者可以在给定时间内测试的密码数量：因为生成如此多的指纹需要时间，这会使攻击者放慢速度。毕竟，他或她必须为每次尝试重新执行此计算。</p><p> The number of hash passes was 5,000, while in other places we use a number of 10,000 hashes. Kudelski criticized both the fact that we remained “below our standard” here and that they would generally recommend 100,000 passes. In addition, Kudelski recommended taking a more critical look at users’ passwords when choosing them and, for example, not accepting passwords that were too short.</p><p> 哈希通过次数为5,000，而在其他地方，我们使用10,000的哈希值。库德尔斯基批评我们在这里仍然“低于我们的标准”以及他们通常会建议100,000次通过这一事实。此外，库德尔斯基（Kudelski）建议您在选择用户密码时更严格地考虑，例如，不要接受太短的密码。</p><p> Solution:  If you are a Boxcryptor user and have chosen a secure password, this problem does not concern you. For those who have chosen an insecure password, we have increased the iteration number of the hash to 10,000. Increasing the number to 100,000 would have slowed down old browsers or slow devices too much, so we decided to leave the number at 10,000. From now on, there is also a minimum password length for newly created passwords.</p><p> 解决方案：如果您是Boxcryptor用户，并且选择了安全密码，则此问题与您无关。对于选择了不安全密码的用户，我们将哈希的迭代次数增加到10,000。如果将数量增加到100,000，可能会大大降低旧版浏览器或设备的速度，因此我们决定将数量保留为10,000。从现在开始，新创建的密码还有一个最小密码长度。</p><p>   Description:  The second problem rated as low was the reading of the Boxcryptor configuration. An attacker who had writing access to the configuration files could have attempted to inject code there. However, this problem was purely theoretical. In order to exploit this vulnerability, additional constraints had to be met that were not present in the current version or any Boxcryptor versions in the past. An actual security hole could have been created in future versions, so this observation was noted.</p><p>   说明：评定为低的第二个问题是Boxcryptor配置的读取。拥有对配置文件的写访问权的攻击者可能试图将代码注入那里。但是，这个问题纯粹是理论上的。为了利用此漏洞，必须满足当前版本或过去任何Boxcryptor版本中不存在的其他约束。在将来的版本中可能会创建一个实际的安全漏洞，因此注意到了这一观点。 </p><p> Solution:  We have adapted the corresponding code location so that no security gap can occur in the future either.</p><p>解决方案：我们已经调整了相应的代码位置，以便将来也不会出现安全漏洞。</p><p>   Description:  The most interesting observation for us was that Boxcryptor does not hide from the cloud provider which files have just been modified by the user. If a file is changed by the user, Boxcryptor encrypts it and updates it in the cloud provider’s folder. Based on the access patterns, the cloud provider could now draw conclusions about the file, e.g. what type of file it is.</p><p>   描述：对我们来说最有趣的发现是Boxcryptor不会向云提供商隐藏用户刚刚修改过的文件。如果用户更改了文件，Boxcryptor将对其加密并在云提供商的文件夹中对其进行更新。根据访问模式，云提供商现在可以得出有关文件的结论，例如它是什么类型的文件。</p><p> Solution:  A practical solution to avoid this is currently not available. Academic solutions to this problem do exist, but they are not so easy to implement in practice without side effects for the user. For this reason, we are following Kudelski’s recommendation in this case: keep an eye on the progress of research in this area and adapt Boxcryptor accordingly as soon as possible.</p><p> 解决方案：目前尚没有避免这种情况的实用解决方案。确实存在针对该问题的学术解决方案，但是在实践中，在没有给用户带来副作用的情况下，实现起来并不容易。因此，在这种情况下，我们会遵循Kudelski的建议：密切关注该领域的研究进展，并相应地尽快调整Boxcryptor。</p><p> The remaining observations can be summarized in two categories:  Code that was not used and which we subsequently removed, and misleading naming of code constructs. The latter are not a problem in themselves, but could be misinterpreted by developers in the future and then used in an unsafe way. We have reduced this risk by renaming or documenting the code locations.</p><p> 其余的观察结果可以归纳为两类：未使用的代码以及我们随后删除的代码，以及对代码结构的误导性命名。后者本身不是问题，但是将来可能会被开发人员误解，然后以不安全的方式使用。我们通过重命名或记录代码位置来减少这种风险。</p><p>  We are very happy with the verification of the quality of the software and have gratefully accepted Kudelski’s small suggestions for improvement. The audit was a great opportunity for us to get an outside view of Boxcryptor.
