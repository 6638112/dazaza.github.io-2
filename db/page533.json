"note_en": "These glass-plate transparencies depicting life in Japan, likely the work of a number of photographers (names unknown), were collected in Yokohama during the years 1908\u20131918 by Herbert Geddes, a manager for a Canadian import-export company.  According to the University of Victoria, where the plates are housed, such photographs (known as &#34;Yokohama Photographs&#34;) were \u201csold to foreign tourists between about 1869 and 1912, before cameras and postcards were generally available\u201d.\n The subjects here range from what we would still associate with art aimed at tourists (temples, bridges, urban streets) to now less common images of labor (including silk factories, rice cultivation, and blacksmithing \u2014 not to mention the many women and girls carrying babies on their backs) \u2014 providing an intimate view into a largely bygone world.\n Positive glass transparencies such as these were made directly from glass negatives (which were commonly used before the introduction of photographic film). As the photography historian  Kim Timby writes, \u201cWhen a glass negative was contact-printed to create a glass positive, none of the transparency and precision provided by the glass support were lost. No paper fibers absorbed solutions at any stage or left their trace during printing.\u201d The resulting images were crystal clear, and could be projected through \u201cmagic lanterns\u201d to allow people to experience photograph at an impressive scale. There was also something about the use of glass, so Timby writes, that appealed to a modern aesthetic: \u201cIt called to mind the exactness of lenses and prisms, the science of vision, the light and transparency of greenhouses, and the covered arcades and shop windows of modern urban life.\u201d\n As with photographic prints, glass transparencies were often hand-colored, a practice which during the Meiji Period (1868\u20131912) became  more popular in Japan than it ever was in Europe or America. As photographs gradually replaced   ukiyo-e prints on the marketplace, printmakers found themselves out of work \u2014 and so turned their skilled hands to coloring the competition.\n The luminous effect of such coloring on glass, such as in Geddes&#39; collection, are particularly stunning. The depth of field in some of the images, combined with the artists\u2019 attentive shading and sense of tone, make it seem they could have been taken yesterday on color film.\n    \n We\u2019ve a selection of images from this post in our online prints shop\u2014all custom made to the highest standards, framed or unframed, and shipped to your door.", "posttime": "2020-10-11 16:27:48",

"note_en": "I grew up ski racing in Lake Tahoe. I was on the Squaw Valley Ski Team, and it was the center of my life for over a decade. At a conference a few months ago I was asked what skiing taught me about investing. This was on stage, where you can\u2019t ponder your answer \u2013 you have to blurt out whatever you can think of. I didn\u2019t think skiing taught me anything about investing. But one incident came to mind. \u201cWell, let me take this to a dark and tragic place,\u201d I said before telling a group of 500 strangers a story I hadn\u2019t talked about much in almost 20 years. A dozen of us had grown up skiing together. Most had known each other since we were young children. By 2001 we were in our late teens, having spent the majority of our waking hours over the previous decade never far from each other. We skied six days a week, 10 months a year, spending summers on the glacier of Mt. Hood, Oregon and in New Zealand, where the seasons mirror our own. Skiing took precedence to everything. Most of us were in an independent study program that let us bypass traditional high school. After skiing all day we read a few books and filled out a few forms in the evening in what \u2013 to our amazement \u2013 led to a diploma. The amount of time we spent together created a relationship closer to siblings than friends. Ski racing is an odd hybrid between a team and individual sport. You train and travel and eat as a team, but the sport itself is individual. Our race results did not rely on each other; our daily sanity did. Any group of a dozen teenagers will find a way to butt heads. Half the time I think we hated each other. Twenty years later, few of us keep in touch. But of the dozen teenagers who, by 2001, I had spent the majority of my life with, four of us had become inseparable best friends. This is the story of two of them \u2013 Brendan Allan and Bryan Richmond. You take amazing things for granted when they become routine. Squaw Valley is one of the largest ski resorts in North America, was home to the 1960 Olympics, and attracts a million visitors a year. It\u2019s staggeringly beautiful. To us, it was just an extension of home. Ski racing required four hours a day of training, which felt like work to us. The rest of the time \u2013 another four hours a day, six days a week \u2013 we just skied around, unstructured, having a good time. We called it \u201cfree skiing.\u201d Everyone else just calls it skiing. On February 15th, 2001, we had just returned from a race in Colorado. Our flight home was delayed because Lake Tahoe was blasted with a blizzard vicious even by its own standards. You can\u2019t race or train when there\u2019s a blanket of new snow \u2013 racing requires hard-packed ice. So it was time for a week of free skiing. Earlier that month Tahoe received several feet of light, fluffy snow that comes from Arctic temperatures. The storm that hit in mid-February was different. It was warm \u2013 barely at the freezing point \u2013 and powerful, leaving three feet of heavy, wet snow on top of the light powder that came before it. We didn\u2019t think about it at the time \u2013 we didn\u2019t think about much at age 17 \u2013 but the combination of heavy snow on top of fluffy snow creates textbook perfect avalanche conditions. Imagine a thick layer of sand with a layer of heavy cement on top. Now imagine putting those layers on a steep hill. It\u2019s fragile, prone to sliding down. That\u2019s what Squaw Valley was like in late February 2001. Ski resorts are good at managing these kinds of conditions to keep people safe. Few tourists realize it, but if you visit a ski resort in the early morning hours after a blizzard you will hear what sounds like bombs going off. The sound isn\u2019t deceiving. With a combination of mortars, grenades, and charges dropped from helicopters, ski patrol do controlled blasts of at-risk pitches to intentionally trigger avalanches when the resort is empty, preempting slides before guests arrive (check out some videos). It\u2019s an effective system, keeping avalanche accidents at major resorts rare. But if you\u2019re skiing out of bounds \u2013 ducking under the DO NOT CROSS ropes to ski the forbidden terrain untouched by masses of Bay Area tourists \u2013 the system won\u2019t help you. Skiing out of bounds is illegal, a form of trespassing. The main reason resorts don\u2019t want you doing it is because it\u2019s dangerous. Out-of-bounds areas aren\u2019t patrolled, so you\u2019re on your own if you get injured. They usually don\u2019t lead down to a chairlift, so you have to find your own way back up. And they\u2019re not bombed for avalanche control. So it\u2019s here \u2013 out of bounds \u2013 that a skier is most likely to discover Mother Nature\u2019s sliding wrath. On the morning of February 21st, 2001, Brendan, Bryan, and I met in the Squaw Valley Ski Team locker room, like we had hundreds of times before. Bryan\u2019s mom told me years later that his last words when he left his house that morning were, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom, I won\u2019t ski out of bounds.\u201d But as soon as we clicked into our skis, that\u2019s what the three of us did. The backside of Squaw Valley, behind the KT-22 chairlift, is a stretch of mountain about a mile long that separated Squaw with Alpine Meadows ski resort. It\u2019s good skiing \u2013 steep, wide open, with rolling terrain. And since it\u2019s out of bounds, it was completely untouched. Our private playground. Before February 21st I had skied it maybe a dozen times. It wasn\u2019t one of our frequent spots, because it\u2019s laborious. The end of Squaw\u2019s backside spits you out on a back country road, where we would hitchhike back to our locker room. Brendan, Bryan, and I decided to ski it that morning. When an event becomes life-changing, all kinds of mundane details sear into your memory. Almost 20 years later I remember Brendan duct-taping his ski pants shut on the chairlift because I had broken the side zipper while wearing them the week before. I remember Bryan cackling with joy as the three of us entered barren wilderness while the rest of the resort was packed with crowds. And I vividly remember getting hit by one of the only avalanches I\u2019ve ever experienced. It was tiny, not going over my knees. It wasn\u2019t scary. I remember laughing. But the feeling is unforgettable. I didn\u2019t hear or see the slide. I just suddenly realized my skis weren\u2019t on the ground anymore \u2013 I was literally floating in a cloud of snow. You have no control in these situations, because rather than pushing back on the ground to gain traction with your skis, the ground is pushing you in all directions. I remember putting my hands up and shouting, \u201cWahooo\u201d like I was on a roller coaster. I essentially was. The avalanche ended quickly. Brendan was to my left and Bryan was below us. No one stopped. We just charged to the bottom. \u201cHoly shit, did you see that avalanche?\u201d I remember saying when we got to the road. \u201cHaha, that was awesome.\u201d Brendan said. No one thought much more of it. We hitchhiked back. At first we had trouble getting a car to pick us up, so I decided if we took our shirts off in the 20-degree weather people would have sympathy for us and stop. It actually worked. Seventeen-year-old boys are resourceful. When we got back to Squaw Brendan and Bryan said they wanted to ski the backside again. I have no recollection of why, or how this came about, but I didn\u2019t want to go. It may have been the hitchhiking, which I always hated. That, more than the out-of-bounds skiing, felt risky to me. But I had an idea. Brendan and Bryan could ski the backside themselves. Rather than hitchhiking back, I would pick them up in my truck. Everyone agreed on the plan, which we made in the Wildflour Baking Company cookie shop in the Squaw Valley lodge after lunch. This was before we had cell phones, so syncing on concrete plans ahead of time was important. Brendan and Bryan walked out and skied off. Thirty minutes after Brendan and Bryan took the chair up to ski the backside, I drove to the back-country road where I was scheduled to pick them up. They weren\u2019t there. I waited another 30 minutes before giving up. It took maybe five minutes to ski the pitch, so I knew they weren\u2019t coming. It didn\u2019t occur to me that they were in danger. I figured they beat me to the bottom and hitchhiked back. I drove back to our locker room, expecting to find them. They weren\u2019t there, either. I asked around. No one had seen them. I drove to Brendan\u2019s house, which wasn\u2019t far from the pick-up point. No one was home. I drove back to the locker room and called his house. It went to voicemail. I remember ending the message with, \u201cI hope you\u2019re OK man.\u201d I was starting to get nervous, but not enough to make a big deal. People were more comfortable being out of touch before the texting era. Later that day, around 4 pm, Bryan\u2019s mom called me at home. I remember every word. \u201cHi Morgan, Bryan didn\u2019t show up for work. Do you know where he is?\u201d she asked. I told her the truth. \u201cWe skied the backside of KT-22 this morning. He and Brendan did it again, I was going to pick them up on the road. But they weren\u2019t there, and I haven\u2019t seen them since.\u201d \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. Click. I think in that moment she pieced together what likely happened to her son. I did, too. Later that evening, after sunset, my friend Ahren and I bought heavy duty flashlights at a drug store and drove to the pick-up spot. We shined the lights up the mountain shouting, \u201cBrennnndan \u2026. Bryyyyyan.\u201d I remember Ahren and I thinking they had likely broken their legs and were stuck on the hill. In the back of my mind I knew it was more serious, but it was comforting to think we could find them. We gave up quickly and drove to the locker room. I forget who made the call, but the police were suddenly taking our information in what had become a missing-person report. I don\u2019t fault the police for this, but they didn\u2019t take it very seriously. I remember one saying, \u201c99% of the time in cases like these the person is out drunk at a party, or ran off with a girl for the night.\u201d I\u2019m sure he was right \u2013 that was usually the case. But I knew he was wrong. \u201cTheir shoes are right there,\u201d I said, pointing to Brendan and Bryan\u2019s sneakers on the locker room floor. \u201cThat means their ski boots are on their feet. And it\u2019s now 9 pm. Think about that. It\u2019s 9 pm and they have their ski boots on their feet. They are not at a party.\u201d Around 10 pm I was told to go to the Squaw Valley Fire Department where I met the local search and rescue team. They took it much more seriously. I explained everything Brendan, Bryan, and I did that day. The search team pulled out maps, and I showed them exactly where we entered the out-of-bounds area, where we exited, and the path we took. I told them about the small avalanche we were caught in that morning. As soon as I mentioned it I could see the dots connecting in the rescuers\u2019 heads. These were seasoned professionals who understood the danger of mountains. When I finished talking I remember two of the rescuers looked at each other and sighed. They knew. I drove back to the locker room around midnight. The Squaw Valley parking lot can hold several thousand cars. By this time it was almost empty. Everyone had gone home, except two cars parked next to each other: Brendan\u2019s Jeep, and Bryan\u2019s Chevy pickup. Search and rescue teams were on the backside of Squaw by midnight. It was still a blizzard, with gusty winds and low visibility even during daylight. I remember watching them ski off in the pitchblack night. With giant floodlights, 12-foot probing poles, and a team of search dogs, they went looking for Brendan and Bryan. I later learned that as soon as the rescue team entered the out-of-bounds point where I told them we skied, they found the fresh scars of a massive avalanche field. I tried to sleep on a bench in the ski team locker room, but couldn\u2019t shut my eyes. I remember hoping Brendan and Bryan would come bounding through the door. The hours dragged on, and felt like days. By 9 am the locker room was packed with other ski racers, parents, friends, and family, all eager to help. It became a staging area for the search. I laid back down on the bench and finally fell asleep. A few minutes later I awoke to the sound of a scream, followed by yelling and commotion. I knew what happened. No one needed to say it. I walked to the second floor of the locker room where I saw Bryan\u2019s mom on a couch. The scream that woke me up off the bench was hers, made after she was told every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I told her, bawling. It\u2019s hard to describe a moment like that. I didn\u2019t know what else to say then. I don\u2019t know what else to say now. Search dogs had honed in on a spot in the avalanche field where rescuers with probe poles found Brendan and Bryan buried under six feet of snow. They were born one day apart, and died 10 feet from each other. Later that day I drove to see my dad at work. I wanted to be around family. He met me in the parking lot and said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so happy to see you.\u201d It was the only time I\u2019ve seen him cry. It didn\u2019t occur to me until that moment how close I was to going with Brendan and Bryan. Why did I ski the backside with them once that morning, but then decline a second run? I\u2019ve thought about it a million times. I have no idea. Why was the avalanche on our first run a tiny little thrill, but the second run triggered a deadly slide that killed two 17-year-olds? We\u2019ll never know. The next evening, Tom Brokaw told Brendan and Bryan\u2019s story on the NBC Nightly News. It was surreal to watch. We were laughing together 36 hours before. Now their death was national news. And the only thing that kept me from being a third name in the newscast I had watched religiously was a fluke decision I put no thought into. It\u2019s been almost 20 years since this happened. Sometimes I think about everything that\u2019s occurred since \u2013 college, marriage, career, kids \u2013 and remind myself that I\u2019ve only experienced it because of a blind, thoughtless decision to decline another ski run. This story isn\u2019t unique. Many people reading this have had near-death experiences. Most have lost someone dear to them. And everyone reading this has made what seemed like no-nothing, inconsequential decisions that fundamentally reshaped their lives. Sometimes those fluke decisions are positive. Sometimes they\u2019re negative. But they\u2019re always out of the blue, unforeseeable. It\u2019s just how life works. After I told this story at the conference I had to tie it back to an investing lesson. It was easier than I thought. My risk tolerance plunged after Brendan and Bryan died. I broke my back skiing (no nerve damage) a few months later, which crushed it even more. I haven\u2019t skied much since. Maybe ten times in the last 19 years. If I\u2019m honest, it scares me. I\u2019ve been risk-averse in other areas of life ever since, too. I drive the speed limit. I obey the seatbelt sign on airplanes. I invest in index funds. I don\u2019t know if Brendan and Bryan\u2019s death actually affected how I invest. But it opened my eyes to the idea that there are three distinct sides of risk: The odds you will get hit. The average consequences of getting hit. The tail-end consequences of getting hit. The first two are easy to grasp. It\u2019s the third that\u2019s hardest to learn, and can often only be learned through experience. We knew we were taking risks when we skied. We knew that going out of bounds was wrong, and that we might get caught. But at 17 years old we figured the consequences of \u201crisk\u201d meant our coaches might yell at us. Maybe we\u2019d get our season pass revoked for the year. Never, not once, did we think we\u2019d pay the ultimate price. But once you go through something like that, you realize that the tail-end consequences \u2013 the low-probability, high-impact events \u2013 are all that matter. In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news headlines. But the tail-end consequences of risk \u2013 like pandemics, and depressions \u2013 are what make the pages of history books. They\u2019re all that matter. They\u2019re all you should focus on. We spent the last decade debating whether economic risk meant the Federal Reserve set interest rates at 0.25% or 0.5%. Then 36 million people lost their jobs in two months because of a virus. It\u2019s absurd. Tail-end events are all that matter. Once you experience it, you\u2019ll never think otherwise.", "posttime": "2020-10-11 16:27:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "This world is a complex, interconnected web of systems. We&#39;ve tried to make sense of this by creating various (seemingly-unrelated) disciplines. With the huge number of disciplines, I think you&#39;ll agree with me when I say that it&#39;s impossible for any one person to be an expert in all of these fields.\n It&#39;s turtles all the way down, however, and even as you go deeper into a field, there&#39;s still so much complexity that you would despair at the idea of ever really understanding anything even within the confines of one specific field.\n Most fields seem to exhibit a fractal pattern. By this, I mean that the more you try to  zoom in onto a specific aspect of a system, the more detail is revealed. The same is true whether you&#39;re talking about economics or physics or biology. A whole new world of detail is revealed at all the different levels.\n Of course, when confronted with complexity, our first instinct is to  reduce and to treat these in isolation, and we&#39;ve tried to come to terms with the complexity within fields by creating  specializations, which are essentially sub-fields.\n This is why a microbiologist seems to speak a completely different language from an ecologist. This might make you wonder whether the two fields are even related; one could argue that they both view the world through a radically different set of lenses.\n As human knowledge progresses and we&#39;re able to understand systems at different levels, we&#39;re continuously spawning newer and newer specializations and hyperspecializations.\n Nowhere is this concept clearer than in computer science where incredibly complex systems have been built to deliver cat videos to your screen. There&#39;s nothing special about my choice of computer science here, as I&#39;m sure there are similar levels of complexity lurking beneath the surface of any domain.\n You could spend years and years in deep study and you still wouldn&#39;t really fully  get how a computer worked. There would always be gaps in your knowledge. Even behind something as seemingly simple as allowing you to read these words on your screen, there is so much hidden complexity. There are towers and towers of abstractions that enable this to happen:\n Your CPU (essentially a tiny piece of silicon that can&#39;t do much but add two numbers together) executed a few million instructions during the time you were reading this sentence. Welcome to Computer Architecture!\n These instructions are in most cases not understandable by a human. So we invented a  high-level language and wrote another software to convert this high level language into the instructions. Welcome to Compilers!\n There are multiple applications running on this system at the same time; somehow, a piece of code (the Operating System), managed to abstract all this away such that the applications are able to pretend that they&#39;re the only application running on the system. Similarly, there are other resources (RAM, files, I/O devices) that all need to be shared between the hundreds of programs running on your system. Welcome to Operating Systems!\n Your device doesn&#39;t exist in isolation. In fact, a lot of its capabilities arise in relation with other devices. Just for the purpose of loading this website and viewing it, it had to send signals out into the ether which somehow (like a labelled envelope) found its way to the right servers and then they responded back with the data you were requesting. Welcome to Networks!\n In fact, all of the cases above are huge simplifications. I haven&#39;t even begun scratching the surface. If you&#39;re curious to learn more,  look at how much detail is hidden behind a simple Google search.\n So how do you even begin to understand and make sense of things which seem to have so many interconnected pieces?\n A short digression here: there is a famous result in psychology about working memory (also called  Miller&#39;s Law). It suggests that humans can, on average, hold about 7 objects in their short-term memory at one time. Basically, if you&#39;re playing around with concepts in your head and thinking about how things relate with one another, there seems to be a cognitive limit of about 7 items.\n Of course that is quite fuzzy and it is of course dangerous to generalize too much from any one result. However, I&#39;d suggest that we can take away this lesson from Miller&#39;s Law: humans can&#39;t hold too many things in their head at the same time. Software systems are very complex beasts and it&#39;s beyond the scope of any person to hold in their head all the minute details of how something is working.\n This is where  Abstraction comes in. This is one of the fundamental building blocks of Computer Science, Engineering, and Problem Solving in general. Abstraction is when you squint your eyes and treat something as a  black box. You are temporarily choosing to not care about what&#39;s happening inside the black box because other details are more important.\n For an example of abstraction think about  interfaces to objects you commonly use. A car for example hides a lot of complicated circuitry and machinery, but at the end of the day, all you need to care about is the steering wheel and a couple of pedals. That&#39;s the abstract view of a car. I don&#39;t care how that car turns these inputs into the multiple complicated outputs of fuel intake, torque etc. I completely ignore that because it&#39;s not important to me. I just want to get from point A to point B and I just need to know how to use the interface of the car to achieve the goal.\n A well-designed interface (this is true of software interfaces too!) would allow you to focus on fewer aspects of the car and expend lesser  cognitive effort when driving the car; I&#39;m talking about manual vs automatic vs self-driving cars.\n Sure, that&#39;s all well and good, but this article is about  Dealing with Complexity, not about  Pretending it doesn&#39;t exist. After all, someone does ultimately have to design and work with the underlying complexity ( Tesler&#39;s Law). You&#39;d be a terrible automobile engineer if you were only able to see a car as its interface!\n Things are even harder when you&#39;re a student and trying to learn more about a certain field you have no prior knowledge in; with so much to learn, how do you decide what is worth digging deeper into?\n So hold on to this idea of abstraction, and let&#39;s talk about Fractal Learning, which is the focus of this blog post.\n  Fractal learning is essentially a strategy used to make sense of complex systems without getting too lost in the details. It&#39;s about being in that Goldilocks zone of not wasting your time learning too much (you have other things to do) while at the same time getting an overall understanding of how things fit together.\n I first came across this concept in the excellent  IntermezzOS Book. It beautifully encapsulates the challenges of students and researchers working to make sense of complex systems:\n It&#39;s impossible to learn everything at once. If you keep digging, you&#39;ll find more questions, and digging into those questions leads to more questions... at some point, you have to say &#34;okay, I know enough about this for now, it&#39;s time to move on.&#34;\n   Let&#39;s imagine that this tree represents your field of interest. Your job is to somehow navigate this tree (or a branch) and learn  everything. Now, clearly, learning everything isn&#39;t going to happen in this lifetime, but you still want to know enough to get a good idea of how everything fits together.\n  Most people seem to follow one of two strategies - and these strategies come under the umbrella of  tree-traversal algorithms in computer science.\n Let&#39;s dig a bit deeper into both of these as they are relevant to the discussion.\n The first is depth-first search (I call it  falling down the rabbit hole). It&#39;s represented by this animation  1:\n     Here, you start at the root of the tree (represented by 1) and you keep going deeper and deeper along any one path. You stop when you can go no further and then try one of the other paths.\n      I hope you get why I called it falling down the rabbit hole; you&#39;re just digging deeper and deeper into a specific topic without really taking a step back to explore other related topics. This is a laser-focused strategy that focuses on exclusion. It&#39;s the equivalent of the child who keeps asking &#34;Why?&#34; for a specific topic until she can no longer get a meaningful answer. If someone followed only this strategy for learning about things, she would have very detailed and specific knowledge about that one thing but have absolutely no idea about even closely related things.\n      This is the polar opposite of the previous approach. Here you are quite timid, and you never go more than one level at a time, and you make your way level-by-level.\n      Again, I hope it makes sense why I called it flooding; it works similarly to how water slowly rises to flood an area. Here you dig very shallowly and take the time to understand the basics of everything before making your way deeper. This is focused on being inclusive and getting a sense of how everything fits together, even if it&#39;s not relevant. Someone who followed only this strategy would be a jack of all trades, he would know the fundamentals of everything; but like the figure of speech goes, he would be a master of none.\n  Sadly, as with a lot of things in life, the answer is: it depends. You will have to use your judgment and intuition to decide which approach to use depending on the situation. Both approaches have their trade-offs.\n Of course, given enough time, both approaches would cover the entire tree. As we saw, both approaches managed to solve the maze.\n  In the following examples (both of which are real-world scenarios), the above strategies are sub-optimal. You will have to use a combination of both, carefully using your judgment to pick which topics are worth exploring deeper, and which are only worth skimming through.\n When you are new to a field and trying to get an overall sense of how the field works, it might be a waste of time to fall down any rabbit holes as you don&#39;t have the experience to know which lines of questioning are relevant. So a breadth-centric approach might serve you well. In this case, you should form appropriate abstractions for the concepts you are encountering so that you can dig deeper into them later if you need.\n An example of this would be reading only the Wikipedia introductions for the topics you encounter while skimming through the rest of the article, while clicking through the links in the introduction for further exploration. Here, it&#39;s important to still pay some attention to the details so you can return to it later.\n On the other hand, let&#39;s say you are trying to find a solution to a specific problem that you are trying to solve. Here it might be wiser to follow a more depth-centric approach, using your intuition to guide you down relevant lines of questioning. Note that it&#39;s much better to already have an overall sense of how things work; otherwise, you wouldn&#39;t know where to start, and it would just be an undirected (and probably fruitless) search. Here, it would just be a distraction to think too much about the things you are encountering. It may save you some time to skim through the material and get an overall sense of how things work, in case you need it later. However, it is essential to stay on track and not lose sight of the specific thing you are trying to solve at that moment.\n An example of this would be trying to find a specific piece of information on Wikipedia. You would have a sort of tunnel vision: You know exactly what you want, and everything else is a mere distraction. Here, it is important to not get too hyper-focused and pay some attention to the overall context as well. Then, your understanding of the entire field grows, not just the specific part you are dealing with.\n Ultimately these two examples really serve to demonstrate what the topic of this blog post is about: Fractal learning.\n  keeping the big picture in your mind even when digging into the details, whilst simultaneously\n It means that sometimes you choose to accept things the way things are without questioning deeper; and maybe later, you choose to dig deeper into those same assumptions.\n This might seem fundamentally to be quite contradictory. There&#39;s almost a very Zen aspect to it as it is not an easy or simple thing to do to make these trade-offs. Failure is inevitable and it is natural and expected that you sometimes you go too deeply into irrelevant details and too shallowly into the important details. But this  is definitely a skill that can be learned. In fact, It&#39;s not just a skill but a  meta-skill that would greatly increase the rate at which you learn all skills.\n I have seen a general tendency in myself to dig too deep into a topic early on and get lost in the maze. If you&#39;re like me, I hope this article encourages you to pause, take a step back, and think about the overall system every once in a while.\n It&#39;s okay to not &#34;fully&#34; understand something before moving on, whatever that means. You&#39;ll get back to it. Sometimes, learning something else is more important than diving into every last detail.", "posttime": "2020-10-11 16:26:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "Several years ago, I developed a public lecture on the  cosmic distance ladder in astronomy from a historical perspective (and emphasising the role of mathematics in building the ladder). I previously blogged about the lecture  here; the most recent version of the slides can be found  here. Recently, I have begun working with  Tanya Klowden (a long time friend with a background in popular writing on a variety of topics,  including astronomy) to expand the lecture into a popular science book, with the tentative format being non-technical chapters interspersed with some more mathematical sections to give some technical details. We are still in the middle of the writing process, but we have produced  a sample chapter (which deals what what we call the \u201cfourth rung\u201d of the distance ladder \u2013 the distances and orbits of the planets \u2013 and how the work of Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler and others led to accurate measurements of these orbits, as well as  Kepler\u2019s famous laws of planetary motion). As always, any feedback on the chapter is welcome. (Due to various pandemic-related uncertainties, we do not have a definite target deadline for when the book will be completed, but presumably this will occur sometime in the next year.)\n  That is an interesting topic , I have to ask about stars locations , Is there any mathematical law to predict the exact location of starts in the space ?\n    Astronomy (as any physical science) developed from the desire to find mathematical patterns among the accumulated observational data. It is possible that there is an ultimate mathematical theory with the potential to explain every possible observational data.\n  You\u2019d be wise to run your book past the Renaissance Mathematicus ( https://thonyc.wordpress.com/). He\u2019s very strong on how Science is a team effort, not (just) individual geniuses. This is an important message for kids wanting to go into Science. Or you can read his blogs on \u201cThe emergence of modern astronomy \u2013 a complex mosaic\u201d, currently up to Part XLVI.\n  Kindly read Cultural Foundations of Mathematics by C K Raju before writing anything on this topic.\n  On the very first paragraph \u2013 the vedas referred to the planets as demons. Any opinion on this? This reference is before the Greek connection to India. The question of precession of equinoxes is claimed to be tabulated long before the greeks  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayan%C4%81%E1%B9%83%C5%9Ba though for the purpose of astrology not for the purpose of knowing as in the Greek culture.
