The  CIA and lawyers for the Bush administration attempted to justify his torture by claiming he was a very senior figure in al-Qaida. It emerged that he was not a member of the organisation and he has never been charged with involvement in 9/11.\n For much of the time since his arrest, Zubaydah has been held incommunicado, at the insistence of the CIA as part of its efforts to prevent details of his torture from becoming public.\n Lawyers for Zubaydah believe it is highly unlikely that  Lithuania would have made the compensation payment without approval from Washington.\n \u201cThe situation is a lot less incommunicado when you pay \u20ac100,000 to someone and the whole world knows about it,\u201d Mark Denbeaux, one of Zubaydah\u2019s legal team based in the US, told the Guardian.\n  \u201cThis move is consistent with the idea that the US is softening its position on the detention of the forever prisoners. The US could clearly have kept Lithuania from handing over this money and the question is, why didn\u2019t they?\u201d\n News of the Lithuanian payment comes just days before the 20th anniversary of the military prison at Guant\u00e1namo, which  received its first detainees on 11 January 2002. In recent months there have been other signs of a shifting attitude towards Zubaydah and the torture that was inflicted upon him by CIA agents and contractors.\n In October, the US supreme court  heard arguments in a case in which the US government is seeking to block two CIA contractors from testifying in Poland about torture Zubaydah suffered in 2002 and 2003 at a secret or \u201cblack\u201d site in that country. In the course of the hearing, several of the justices, including conservatives, broke a legal taboo by  openly using the word \u201ctorture\u201d.\n In Zubaydah\u2019s case against Lithuania, which was led on the European side by his lawyer Helen Duffy, the European Court of Human Rights  heard that Zubaydah was held at a CIA black site in that country from February 2005 to March 2006. The site, codenamed Violet, was on the outskirts of Vilnius.\n The most brutal forms of torture endured by Zubaydah occurred in 2002 when he was held at a CIA black site in Thailand.

Much experimentation and data analysis later, he realised there was a fundamental relationship between force, mass and acceleration. He formulated a theory to describe that relationship \u2013 one that could be expressed as an equation, F=ma \u2013 and used it to predict the behaviour of objects other than apples. His predictions turned out to be right (if not always precise enough for those who came later).\n Contrast how science is increasingly done today. Facebook\u2019s  machine learning tools predict your preferences better than any psychologist. AlphaFold, a program built by DeepMind, has produced the most  accurate predictions yet of protein structures based on the amino acids they contain. Both are completely silent on why they work: why you prefer this or that information; why this sequence generates that structure.\n   You can\u2019t lift a curtain and peer into the mechanism. They offer up no explanation, no set of rules for converting this into that \u2013 no theory, in a word. They just work and do so well. We witness the social effects of Facebook\u2019s predictions daily. AlphaFold has yet to make its impact felt, but  many are convinced it will change medicine.\n Somewhere between Newton and Mark Zuckerberg, theory took a back seat. In 2008, Chris Anderson, the then editor-in-chief of  Wired magazine,  predicted its demise. So much data had accumulated, he argued, and computers were already so much better than us at finding relationships within it, that our theories were being exposed for what they were \u2013 oversimplifications of reality. Soon, the old scientific method \u2013 hypothesise, predict, test \u2013 would be relegated to the dustbin of history. We\u2019d stop looking for the causes of things and be satisfied with correlations.\n  With the benefit of hindsight, we can say that what Anderson saw is true (he wasn\u2019t alone). The complexity that this wealth of data has revealed to us cannot be captured by theory as traditionally understood. \u201cWe have leapfrogged over our ability to even write the theories that are going to be useful for description,\u201d says computational neuroscientist Peter Dayan, director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what they would look like.\u201d\n But Anderson\u2019s prediction of the end of theory looks to have been premature \u2013 or maybe his thesis was itself an oversimplification. There are several reasons why theory refuses to die, despite the successes of such theory-free prediction engines as  Facebook and AlphaFold. All are illuminating, because they force us to ask: what\u2019s the best way to acquire knowledge and where does science go from here?\n The first reason is that we\u2019ve realised that artificial intelligences (AIs), particularly a form of machine learning called neural networks, which learn from data without having to be fed explicit instructions, are themselves fallible. Think of the prejudice that has been documented in  Google\u2019s search engines and  Amazon\u2019s hiring tools.\n The second is that humans turn out to be deeply uncomfortable with theory-free science. We don\u2019t like dealing with a black box \u2013 we want to know  why.\n And third, there may still be plenty of theory of the traditional kind \u2013 that is, graspable by humans \u2013 that usefully explains much but has yet to be uncovered.\n So theory isn\u2019t dead, yet, but it is changing \u2013 perhaps beyond recognition. \u201cThe theories that make sense when you have huge amounts of data look quite different from those that make sense when you have small amounts,\u201d says Tom Griffiths, a psychologist at Princeton University.\n Griffiths has been using neural nets to help him improve on existing theories in his domain, which is human decision-making. A popular theory of how people make decisions when economic risk is involved is prospect theory, which was formulated by behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in the 1970s (it later won Kahneman a Nobel prize). The idea at its core is that people are sometimes, but not always, rational.\n  In  Science last June,  Griffiths\u2019s group described how they trained a neural net on a vast dataset of decisions people took in 10,000 risky choice scenarios, then compared how accurately it predicted further decisions with respect to prospect theory. They found that prospect theory did pretty well, but the neural net showed its worth in highlighting where the theory broke down, that is, where its predictions failed.\n These counter-examples were highly informative, Griffiths says, because they revealed more of the complexity that exists in real life. For example, humans are constantly weighing up probabilities based on incoming information, as prospect theory describes. But when there are too many competing probabilities for the brain to compute, they might switch to a different strategy \u2013 being guided by a rule of thumb, say \u2013 and a stockbroker\u2019s rule of thumb might not be the same as that of a teenage  bitcoin trader, since it is drawn from different experiences.\n \u201cWe\u2019re basically using the machine learning system to identify those cases where we\u2019re seeing something that\u2019s inconsistent with our theory,\u201d Griffiths says. The bigger the dataset, the more inconsistencies the AI learns. The end result is not a theory in the traditional sense of a precise claim about how people make decisions, but a set of claims that is subject to certain constraints. A way to picture it might be as a branching tree of \u201cif\u2026 then\u201d-type rules, which is difficult to describe mathematically, let alone in words.\n  What the Princeton psychologists are discovering is still just about explainable, by extension from existing theories. But as they reveal more and more complexity, it will become less so \u2013 the logical culmination of that process being the theory-free predictive engines embodied by Facebook or AlphaFold.\n Some scientists are comfortable with that, even eager for it. When voice recognition software pioneer Frederick Jelinek said: \u201cEvery time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recogniser goes up,\u201d he meant that theory was holding back progress \u2013 and that was in the 1980s.\n Or take protein structures. A protein\u2019s function is largely determined by its structure, so if you want to design a drug that blocks or enhances a given protein\u2019s action, you need to know its structure. AlphaFold was trained on structures that were derived experimentally, using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and at the moment its predictions are considered more reliable for proteins where there is some experimental data available than for those where there is none. But its reliability is improving all the time, says Janet Thornton, former director of the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) near Cambridge, and it isn\u2019t the lack of a theory that will stop drug designers using it. \u201cWhat AlphaFold does is also discovery,\u201d she says, \u201cand it will only improve our understanding of life and therapeutics.\u201d\n  Others are distinctly less comfortable with where science is heading. Critics point out, for example, that neural nets can throw up spurious correlations, especially if the datasets they are trained on are small. And all datasets are biased, because scientists don\u2019t collect data evenly or neutrally, but always with certain hypotheses or assumptions in mind, assumptions that worked their way damagingly into Google\u2019s and Amazon\u2019s AIs. As philosopher of science Sabina Leonelli of the University of Exeter explains: \u201cThe data landscape we\u2019re using is incredibly skewed.\u201d\n But while these problems certainly exist, Dayan doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re insurmountable. He points out that humans are biased too and, unlike AIs, \u201cin ways that are very hard to interrogate or correct\u201d. Ultimately, if a theory produces less reliable predictions than an AI, it will be hard to argue that the machine is the more biased of the two.\n A tougher obstacle to the new science may be our human need to explain the world \u2013 to talk in terms of cause and effect. In 2019, neuroscientists Bingni Brunton and Michael Beyeler of the University of Washington, Seattle,  wrote that this need for interpretability may have prevented scientists from making novel insights about the brain, of the kind that only emerges from large datasets. But they also sympathised. If those insights are to be translated into useful things such as drugs and devices, they wrote, \u201cit is imperative that computational models yield insights that are explainable to, and trusted by, clinicians, end-users and industry\u201d.\n \u201c Explainable AI\u201d, which addresses how to bridge the interpretability gap, has become a hot topic. But that gap is only set to widen and we might instead be faced with a trade-off: how much predictability are we willing to give up for interpretability?\n Sumit Chopra, an AI scientist who thinks about the application of machine learning to healthcare at New York University, gives the example of an MRI image. It takes a lot of raw data \u2013 and hence scanning time \u2013 to produce such an image, which isn\u2019t necessarily the best use of that data if your goal is to accurately detect, say, cancer. You could train an AI to identify what smaller portion of the raw data is sufficient to produce an accurate diagnosis, as validated by other methods, and indeed Chopra\u2019s group has  done so. But radiologists and patients remain wedded to the image. \u201cWe humans are more comfortable with a 2D image that our eyes can interpret,\u201d he says.\n  The final objection to post-theory science is that there is likely to be useful old-style theory \u2013 that is, generalisations extracted from discrete examples \u2013 that remains to be discovered and only humans can do that because it requires intuition. In other words, it requires a kind of instinctive homing in on those properties of the examples that are relevant to the general rule. One reason we consider Newton brilliant is that in order to come up with his second law he had to ignore some data. He had to imagine, for example, that things were falling in a vacuum, free of the interfering effects of air resistance.\n In  Nature last month, mathematician Christian Stump, of Ruhr University Bochum in Germany,  called this intuitive step \u201cthe core of the creative process\u201d. But the reason he was writing about it was to say that for the first time, an AI had pulled it off. DeepMind had built a machine-learning program that had prompted mathematicians towards new insights \u2013 new generalisations \u2013 in the mathematics of knots.\n In 2022, therefore, there is almost no stage of the scientific process where AI hasn\u2019t left its footprint.

The generals warned that it could succeed with the aid of rogue military elements. They contemplated the possibility of a breakdown of the chain of command, along partisan lines, in the aftermath of a contested election with \u201crogue units organizing among themselves to support the \u2018rightful\u2019 commander in chief\u201d.\n Eaton said in an interview that the American military and law enforcement have a history of underestimating the threat from the far right.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the Timothy McVeigh problem: what did we know about McVeigh and what were we doing about it?\u201d said Eaton.\n The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing killed 168 people and injured over 650 when one morning ex-army soldiers Timothy McVeigh and co-conspirator Terry Nichols parked a rental truck filled with homemade explosives outside a federal building and detonated it. It remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The two men harbored anti-government and racists beliefs.\n \u201cThe McVeighs of the world are still there, we had about 4,500 of them crawling all over the nation\u2019s capitol [during the 6 January attack],\u201d said Eaton, who added that the increased power of the internet and rise of social media had boosted the threat massively since McVeigh\u2019s attack.\n  \u201cThe infection of extremism into our state and local police and our armed forces is a very serious concern that needs to be monitored,\u201d said Eaton.\n Eaton added: \u201cThere\u2019s a recruiting effort going on locally, they\u2019re going to school boards, like missionaries sent to the islands to convert people. The Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are definitely recruiting.\u201d\u201d\n In many ways the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol in Washington DC laid bare the vulnerability of US service members to extremism. The  727 defendants charged in the 6 January Capitol riot include  81 with ties to the military, while five were active duty service members. A 35-year-old woman, air force veteran Ashli Babbitt, was fatally shot while attempting to break the doors into the House chamber.\n The appeal of extremism among active duty and veterans is a longstanding issue with a track record of violent incidents.\n Last year army  private Ethan Phelan Melzer confessed to prosecutors in the southern district of New York to plotting an attack on fellow soldiers in his unit. The federal indictment states that Melzer confessed to sharing sensitive information about his soon-to-deploy unit with members of a neo-Nazi group in order to facilitate an attack that would \u201cresult in the deaths of as many of his fellow service members as possible\u201d.\n In 2018 marine lance corporal Vasillios Pistolis was imprisoned after assaulting people at the 2017 Charlottesville \u201cUnite The Right\u201d rally. Pistolis was discovered to belong the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen after bragging about violence in  chats with other Atomwaffen members, which were eventually leaked.\n From 1990 to July 2021 there have been at least 354 people with military backgrounds that have committed criminal acts motivated by \u201cpolitical, economic, social, or religious goals\u201d according to data collected by  the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland.\n The data suggest the problem is growing in the US as from 1990-2010 there was an average of six cases a year, but over the last decade \u201cthat number has more than tripled to nearly 21 subjects per year\u201d.\n  The generals\u2019 public call for elections safeguards in the military comes as the Pentagon issued new guidelines aimed at rooting out extremism in its ranks. The defense chief, Lloyd Austin, ordered a 60-day \u201cstand down\u201d early last year to come up with rules to stomp out extremism among the military\u2019s various branches. The new rules adopted by the Pentagon last month specify that service members are prohibited from engaging in extremist activities and could face disciplinary action for even \u201cliking\u201d extremist content on social media.\n The new guidance specifies that commanders must not be \u201cindifferent\u201d and hold service members who participate in extremist activity accountable. The Pentagon defines extremism as advocacy for violence to achieve goals that are \u201cpolitical, religious, discriminatory, or ideological in nature\u201d. It includes efforts to overthrow the government and advocating widespread unlawful discrimination \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including pregnancy), gender identity, or sexual orientation\u201d.\n Bu the Pentagon\u2019s effort towards stomping out extremism in the military may not go far enough. An  Associated Press investigation found the new guidelines fail to account for racism among the ranks, membership in groups such as the KKK, and longstanding racial disparities in military justice.\n The new guidelines don\u2019t prohibit membership in extremist groups like the KKK as long as they are not \u201cactively participating\u201d. The new rules attempt to police acts rather than associations or beliefs. Some former military figures say it\u2019s absurd to allow service members to also be members of violent extremist groups.\n \u201cSeriously? You want to be in a foxhole with a guy whose a member of the KKK? Is that really what we want to do here?\u201d said Eaton. \u201cThe idea of service members having to be in close proximity to card carrying members of the Proud Boys, as long as they don\u2019t \u2018march\u2019, that just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d he added.\n Some experts also criticize the approach as ignoring the very real threat of white supremacists. \u201cIt reflects the institutional bias that permeates all of our government, that even calling out white supremacy is politically fraught,\u201d said Mike German, a former FBI special agent and current Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n German is concerned the classification has the potential for unintended consequences. \u201cIt opens the door to a strange political \u2018both sides-ism\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThe consequence is that somebody expressing anti-racism can be seen as an extremist under that description.\u201d\n Experts see the far-right and other extremists as actively trying to recruit members of the military, including foreign agents seeking to promote disruption within the US.\n \u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of an insurgency in the Untied States,\u201d said Kristofer Goldsmith, an Iraq war veteran and researcher.\n In a 200-page report published by Vietnam Veterans of America, Goldsmith found that between 2017 and 2019 foreign entities, such as Russian hackers, \u201ccoordinated online targeting of American service members, veterans, and their families\u201d in an effort to disrupt American democracy.\n \u201cWe found 10 different ways foreign entities were targeting veterans online,\u201d said Goldsmith, including through ads, fake veteran accounts that sent friend request to other veterans in order to penetrate the \u201crelatively small community of veteran advocates, and found large social media pages run by foreign admins that spread disinflation tailored to veterans in a effort to influence the election\u201d.\n Goldsmith sees anti-democratic, white supremacist and fascists movements targeting veterans for the same reason as foreign adversaries. \u201cVeterans are an economically efficient target for campaigns, because if you get one, they often bring their immediate social circle with them,\u201d said Goldsmith.\n Goldsmith warns that the coming election is vulnerable to a rising insurgency. \u201cWe saw a violent insurrection, we did not experience a peaceful transfer of power.

You will most definitely learn how to get your first client but if you\u2019re looking for a get rich quick scheme while you work in your underwear, please hit back on your browser.\n I promise you, if you take action on what you read in this article you could potentially have your first client tomorrow without spending a penny.\n  So, you\u2019ve recently decided that you want to take a shot at doing freelance or consulting work. That\u2019s great, and in this article I\u2019m going to give you a few tips on how to find your first freelance client but before that, you need to figure out what type of freelance worker you want to be.\n What I mean by that is, how much time are you looking to invest into freelancing? Are you looking to do it full time to replace a standard 9-5 job or as a side gig to create some extra income on the side?\n There is a very big difference between needing a check to pay rent when freelancing is your only source of income vs hoping to get some extra cash this month to either invest, enjoy life or help you climb out of debt just a little bit faster.\n Take some time to figure that out. For me, I use consulting as another revenue stream. As of this article, most of my income comes from a mixture of doing consulting work and selling software developer related courses but it wasn\u2019t always like that.\n Before I decided to create courses, it was all about freelancing and consulting for me. I made a lot of mistakes and left a ton of money on the table, so now I\u2019d like to write about how you can avoid those mistakes and start your business off on the right foot.\n   You might hear a lot of people say,  \u201coh you need a portfolio website and business cards before you can do anything, so step one is to do that!\u201d.\n Don\u2019t listen to them, you\u2019re going to waste money and time. This is just a  procrastination tactic. It\u2019s busy work that delays you from actually getting clients and making money.\n While I do think having a personal brand is important, I don\u2019t think having a portfolio site is all that important. I didn\u2019t even launch my own site until recently and if you look around, you won\u2019t find a portfolio of prior work. At most you\u2019ll find a few testimonials.\n That sounds almost impossible right? How could you possibly get clients without having a site, or a strong web presence. Simple, it comes down to how you find your clients.\n Trust me, no one is going to Google \u201cfind developer freelancer in NY\u201d and then find you. That\u2019s not how it works. You need to reach out to people, and the people you reach out to won\u2019t care about your portfolio.\n They care about how much value you add to their life. This could be how you can help them solve a problem, or make them money. They don\u2019t care that 2 years ago you put up a site for Acme Incorporated.\n   As a self taught programmer who didn\u2019t goto university, I missed out on a lot of opportunities to network with peers. So my first tip to you is, if you\u2019re at university right now, you should make a very conscious effort to build up a network of friends who have similar goals as you.\n You might be thinking  \u201cNick, how is my awkward programming wizard buddy going to help me land a freelance client?\u201d.\n You never know what will happen in the future. Maybe you graduate as close friends and 3 months later he calls you because he needs your expertise or is overwhelmed by work. Congrats, you just got a new client.\n But it gets much better. Each person you add to your network expands your overall reach exponentially. I\u2019ve had strings of freelance gigs for years that originated from a single connection.\n Person A may reach out to you to complete a job, and if you do a good job then person A may refer you to his friend for another job. The next thing you know, you\u2019re doing another job for a friend of a friend, all while the original people in your network continue to provide you opportunities.\n This is how real life works, and you often see this happen in other trade skills like plumbing and electricians. I know a few people in this field and they all have a network of friends who fill in skill gaps and cover for each other when they are unable to fulfill work due to time issues or other reasons.\n When they run into a job that requires a skill they don\u2019t have, they are not reaching for Google to find someone. They are going straight to their network of friends.\n I do the same exact thing too. In case you couldn\u2019t tell by my blog post images (I make / arrange almost all of them myself), I\u2019m not an artist, but when I need \u201cserious business\u201d custom graphics made I reach to my inner circle of friends and associates.\n The world outside of my personal network never gets a chance to even see the job opening.\n   Think about it from your POV as someone who works as a freelancer on sites like e-lance or upwork. We just finished talking about networks and how people tend to form circles of trust where they share jobs with each other.\n That typically means only the shitty jobs are available outside of these circles, and even worse they are jobs being managed by someone who might be difficult to work with. Not all people who hire freelancers on these sites are bad but in my experience, more often than not they end up being bad clients.\n They are the type of clients who will lurch over your shoulder, watching every move you make and ensure they pay the absolute minimum while demanding top tier results.\n Hell, even some of these platforms mandate that you keep an app running that randomly takes screenshots of your desktop to make sure you\u2019re working, so that your hourly quotes are \u201caccurate\u201d.\n  Sure, a mechanic has a book that they can reference to for guaranteed prices. They will guarantee that to get your tires rotated it will cost XYZ amount and take XYZ minutes.\n However, a skilled mechanic will be able to do it in half the time, so he\u2019s rewarded due to being able to rotate more tires per day than an unskilled mechanic. It\u2019s a win / win. The mechanic makes more money per day and you get your car back faster.\n This type of cost guarantee proves that the service being done is so well known and discovered that it\u2019s a commodity. It won\u2019t be long until robots can perform those steps exactly, with an efficiency that crushes even the best mechanic.\n However, the skilled mechanic won\u2019t be out of a job. He\u2019ll be first in line to buy one of those robots because the \u201cskill factor\u201d is not so much rotating the tires, but figuring out that they need rotating in the first place.\n Freelance platforms who spy on you by invading your privacy do nothing but punish you for being skilled.\n In what world should you make less money for being an expert at your craft?\n I\u2019ll tell you, it\u2019s the world driven by freelance platforms that exploit workers by putting them into some type of passive fear driven mindset. If you really think about it, it\u2019s insane.\n  \u201cI should spend a large portion of my life to become an expert in my craft, and then I should agree to have my privacy stripped away from me while I race to the bottom and undercut my competition because I will actively place myself into situations where I have the highest competition to ensure I receive the lowest rates. Lastly, I will bust my butt and bend the world to satisfy clients who take advantage of me.\u201d\n Sadly when you sign up to these sites, that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying. To add insult to injury, they also take a chunk of your income. If you ask me, they are comparable to  Dante\u2019s 9 circles of Hell.\n My recommendation is to stay away from these sites at all costs. You\u2019re just going to get jaded early on by crappy clients and think that freelancing is too depressing to get into.\n   Instead of depending on freelance platforms, you should go and explore the world. I know, it\u2019s scary. I\u2019m \u201cintroverted\u201d too (whatever the hell that\u2019s supposed to mean), but you\u2019re allowed to step outside of your comfort zone, and trust me, the reward is worth it.\n Take action and build up your own personal network using any strategy you can think of. It\u2019s ok if you spend all day (or longer) thinking of ways to do this. That sure beats looking at WP themes for 7 hours for your \u201cportfolio site\u201d.\n  If you\u2019re at university, try connecting with as many of your fellow students as possible. Don\u2019t be lazy, because you\u2019re in an excellent position right now (you\u2019re making me jealous). There\u2019s a fuster cluck of like-minded individuals who are one \u201chi\u201d away from joining your networking circle which will lead to freelance gigs and more.\n The next best thing is to goto local meetups. If you have none in your area for what you\u2019re interested in, then start one yourself. Sites like  meetup.com make it really easy to do this.\n Local meetups are awesome. You\u2019ll find people in start-ups looking to hire, other developers looking to build their network and in some cases the venue hosting the event will be recruiting (you can approach them for contract work).\n It\u2019s important to understand that your peers at meetups are your allies, not your competition. It\u2019s counter intuitive because by default you might be thinking  \u201chow can I find freelance work for development in a room full of developers?\u201d, but that\u2019s not how it works.\n First off, not everyone there will be a developer and secondly, you\u2019ll find people with very wide skill sets and agendas. 8 out of 50 people in the room might be there for the sole purpose of finding another developer to work on something with them. You just need to find them.\n You might be thinking  \u201cwhat am I supposed to say?\u201d. It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated. For students, try approaching Bob outside of one of your classes and be like  \u201cHey Bob, I\u2019m Nick. We\u2019re in CS101 together. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, what got you interested in computers?\u201d.\n At meetups, I usually just open with something that\u2019s relevant to the situation, such as:  \u201cHi, what brings you to a Docker meetup?\u201d and go from there.\n Remember, you\u2019re not going to find an answer book for all problems you\u2019ll face in life so you better get used to figuring things out on your own while doing self guided research, especially as a software developer.\n  By the way, I have no idea if the above university script works. Go test it and let me know in the comments.\n The only thing I do know is, as I\u2019ve been  leveling up my communication skills, I have found out that people love talking about themselves. You can\u2019t go wrong.\n Everyone can start calling local businesses to find freelance work too. You will find plenty of opportunities here. Sure you have to pick up a phone, but if it lands you a $2,000 deal that requires 10-20 hours of work, then why are you upset?\n Here\u2019s a story for you. If you\u2019ve been following my blog then you know that I do a lot of walking. Usually I walk 3 miles a day. I find it very relaxing and it helps me think, but it\u2019s also a source of freelance clients.\n Yep, as I walk around town, there are vans and other work vehicles that drive by. They have phone numbers and website URLs plastered on their vehicles. You don\u2019t need to have an eidetic memory like Wesley Crusher on the U.S.S Enterprise to capitalize on this.\n The next time you see one of these vehicles, jot down, take a picture or make a voice recording memo of their phone number and website address. Bam, you have a new lead to contact and at the same time, you\u2019ve strengthened your leg muscles by walking.\n  I know you might be skeptical, and perhaps you were hoping for an article that told you to do 20 hours of research and busy work before you can get started but the reality of the situation is, as long as you have the technical skills to do the job, you can have your first client tomorrow.

Our mission was to build an education platform for the 21st century, with engaging content delivered in bite-size modules that can be consumed anytime, anywhere, and at your own pace.\n I am happy to announce that  Grafana University is now live with our first learning playlist,  Introduction to the three pillars of observability. This playlist has four modules:  Introduction to observability,  Introduction to metrics,  Introduction to logs, and  Introduction to traces. It is aimed at anyone who is new to the world of  observability and the Grafana stack, giving both a solid foundation in the concepts of observability and a chance to get hands-on with Grafana.\n  One of the coolest things about the platform we\u2019ve built is the ability to provide hands-on experiences with the Grafana stack easily and quickly. With a single click of a button, you can spin up a Grafana instance, pre-configured with connections to our sample data sources. The lab environments are temporary sandboxes so they only exist for the duration of the lab, and they are not connected to your Grafana Cloud account. So you can feel free to explore and experiment all you want!\n From this humble beginning with our first learning playlist, Grafana University will grow to include more courses aimed at all the different users of the Grafana stack, from the people viewing and building dashboards to the teams responsible for installing, configuring, and administering the tools. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll be adding more learning playlists on the basics of building Grafana dashboards and working with  LogQL and  PromQL. (Got an idea about what we should cover? Email us at  education@grafana.com.)\n  Class is officially in session!  Grafana University is available for free to anyone in the world \u2014 simply log in with your Grafana Cloud account and get started. (Don\u2019t have a  Grafana Cloud account?\u00a0 Sign up for free today!)\n After taking a course, we\u2019re very interested in hearing any comments or feedback you may have, positive or negative, so if you have something to share, please  email us.\n  I would like to thank Matthew and S\u00e9an for all their work on this, as well as Heds Simons from our Field Engineering team for his assistance in getting the hands-on environments up and running. And of course, a big thank you to all the Grafanistas who supported us with comments, reviews, and contributions!", "posttime": "2022-01-10 18:25:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5927\u5b66,\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3,grafana,\u793e\u533a", "title": "\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3\u7eb3\u5927\u5b66", "title_en": "Grafana University", "transed": 1, "url": "https://grafana.com/blog/2022/01/03/introducing-grafana-university-our-virtual-hands-on-education-platform-thats-free-and-easy-to-use/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u5b66", "\u683c\u62c9\u7eb3", "grafana", "\u793e\u533a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "17b21ee7588eb216fa10bb2456128b02.jpeg", "infoid": 1072599, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u745e\u5178\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7537\u4eba\u4eca\u5929\u6d3b\u7740\uff0c\u611f\u8c22 - \u90e8\u5206 - \u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3002 71\u5c81\u7684\u5b69\u5b50\u572812\u6708\u94f2\u96ea\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u540d\u8fc7\u6e21\u8005\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u4e2d\u98de\u5165\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u9664\u98a4\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u7684\u533b\u751f\u590d\u82cf\uff0c\u5468\u4e8c\u3002", "note_en": "A man in Sweden is alive today thanks to \u2014 in part \u2014 a drone. The 71-year-old had a heart attack while shoveling snow in December and was resuscitated by a nearby doctor after a drone flew in a defibrillator, Everdrone  reported Tuesday.\n Someone having a heart attack needs help within 10 minutes in order to survive. Everdrone\u2019s Emergency Medical Aerial Delivery (EMADE) service is designed to deliver help as quickly as possible \u2014 it allows emergency dispatchers to send a drone carrying the device to a caller\u2019s home, kickstarting the lifesaving process before the ambulance arrives at their home. In this particular patient\u2019s case, it took three minutes for the services to deliver the defibrillator to his home. A bystander, who happened to be a doctor on the way to his job, used the AED on the patient after providing CPR.\n The drone was developed with the Center for Resuscitation Science at Karolinska Institutet, SOS Alarm, and Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland.\n   \u201cThis is an excellent real-world example of how Everdrone\u2019s cutting edge drone technology, fully integrated with emergency dispatch, can minimize the time for access to live-saving AED equipment,\u201d Everdrone CEO Mats S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m said.\n In a four-month  pilot study testing the EMADE program, the service got 14 heart attack alerts that would be eligible for drones. Drones took off in 12 of those cases, and 11 successfully delivered the defibrillators. Seven of those defibrillators were delivered before the ambulance arrived.\n In Europe, about 275,000 patients suffer from cardiac arrest annually with approximately 70 percent of those arrests occurring in a private home without a defibrillator on site, according to Everdrone. The survival rate is  around 10 percent.\n Currently, the EMADE service can reach 200,000 Swedish residents.

This made it difficult to offer cash back and loyalty points to customers .\n Online platforms like ThankUCash present these merchants with an opportunity to delve into rewards and help them retain loyalty and increase revenue.\n CEO  Simeon Ononobi started ThankUCash with Suraj Supekar, Madonna Ononobi and Harshal Gandole, who act as a chief technical officer, chief operating officer and senior vice president of engineering,  respectively .\n  The multi-merchant rewards platform (which means customers can hop on from one merchant to another to earn loyalty points in another) allows customers to earn rewards anytime they shop with thousands of merchants listed on its app.\n The business raised a $320,000 pre-seed after grabbing the  attention of accelerators such as 500 Startups, Google Launchpad and other local investors like  Microtraction and  Ventures Platform.\n Up until this point, ThankUCash said it has recorded over 600,000 users and onboarded over 1,000 stores on its platform . Also, it claims to have processed over $80 million in transaction volume.\n Having matured as a business, Ononobi and his team want to take on a more complicated task: building infrastructure for companies that want to offer akin services.\n \u201cWe are creating solutions that help SMEs succeed while increasing consumer buying power and opportunities.  We want to build an infrastructure for rewards, loyalty, deals, buy now, pay later, cashback,\u201d he said to TechCrunch on a call .\n \u201cCashback was our low hanging fruit and an entry point. We\u2019re still going to go into deals, couponing, gift cards, buy now, pay later, anything that will help the business grow, but at the same time, allowing the consumer increase in opportunities of buying.\u201d\n Ononobi, a serial entrepreneur who previously built a payments company and also apps for Nigerian banks and the government, reckons that ThankUCash will do to rewards the same thing Flutterwave and Paystack did to payments in Africa.\n Some companies such as banks have launched cashback programs via debit cards to users in the past . But most of them have been generally inefficient, from setup down to collections and redeeming of points, and Ononobi argues that their inefficiencies boil down to no technical support.  ThankUCash sees a gold mine to provide plugins banks and fintechs can tap into to offer cashback and rewards .\n  The bit about buy now, pay later is fuzzy now since  only a handful of prominent BNPL services in Africa.  However , the company seems to be positioning itself for the imminent proliferation of such services buoyed by similar happenings globally where buy now, pay later services have seen an uptake as a result of pandemic-induced consumer behaviour.\n \u201cThe technology is such that we have our machines in stores.  So as customers request loans, we generate a code for it, customers input it into the POS machine and the merchant gets credited  directly . The code can only  be used  in the store chosen and only for the loan amount requested, such that at the end of the day the customer is buying straight from the merchants,\u201d explained the founder, who also mentioned that his startup might venture into offering buy now, pay later services itself in the future.\n ThankUCash\u2019s consumer-facing platform will remain operational. But to set the infrastructure play in motion, it has signed a partnership with payments company Interswitch to onboard its merchants.\n The company, which is also  in the process of  making integrations with payments gateways, said a couple of bank partnerships are in its pipeline.\n In terms of how ThankUCash makes money, merchants pay the company a fee on every  purchase  made in their stores.  For instance, ThankUCash gets a 1.5% commission for every customer it brings into the store to redeem a 5% cashback item.\u00a0 The Lagos-based company also takes commissions for deals and plans to charge a \u201cheavy onboarding fee\u201d for businesses that want to use its APIs for its services, including buy now, pay later.\n ThankUCash has perfected one offering: the cashback product where merchants can get more walk-in customers. It\u2019s improving the deals category, allowing merchants to sell products fast  (by hiring  ex-managers of DealDey, a Nigerian defunct deals company).  And while currently building out its buy now pay later infrastructure (which gives businesses a chance to sell products regardless of whether customers have money or not), ThankUCash plans to add a fourth offering soon: a remittance product where merchants can sell  directly  to the diaspora.\n The chief executive doesn\u2019t give details about this product. Meanwhile , its investors, who have doubled down while privy to information like this,  are enthused  about \u201cthe continued evolution of the company\u201d, a remark made by Amit Bhatti, the principal at co-lead investor 500 Global.\n \u201cSince going through 500 Global\u2019s accelerator in 2019, we\u2019ve  been impressed by  Simeon and the ThankUCash team\u2019s progress in implementing a rewards system that works for Nigerian consumers, regardless of cash or credit or online or offline payment,\u201d said the principal. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for businesses and banks, too, as TUC gives them the tools and data they need to grow.\u201d\n The 45-man team has hired Aaron Tindiseega to lead its expansion into Kenya and the eastern Africa region .  The Ugandan professional has experience working for banks and tech companies like Uber, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC . For its expansion into Ghana, Kiki Anku, who has worked at Apple and a couple of startups, will spearhead the task.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 16:33:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "chrenthucash,thankucash,\u5956\u52b1", "title": "\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a\u7684Chrenthucash\u786e\u4fdd5.3\u7c73\u4e3a\u73b0\u91d1\u8fd4\u8fd8\uff0c\u4f18\u60e0\u548cBNPL\u670d\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tNigeria\u2019s ThankUCash secures $5.3M to build infrastructure for cashback, deals and BNPL services\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/nigerias-thankucash-secures-5-3m-to-build-infrastructure-for-cashback-deals-and-bnpl-services/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5956\u52b1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ffc44112c6548ec442935518bfbb229f.jpg", "infoid": 1072596, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u80a1\u7968\u4e8e\u5468\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u20b91,226\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u8dcc5.3\uff05\u3002 PayTM\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u80a1\u7968\u4ef7\u683c\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u81ea\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u5176\u53d1\u884c\u4ef7\u683c\u7565\u9ad84,150\uff0828.9\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u51fa\u7248\u65f6\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u6982\u7387\u4e3a102\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u8fd1\u4e00\u534a\u5728\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e2019\u5e74\u5e95\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86\u878d\u8d44\u7684160\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c\u3002\n\u201c\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8c2d\uff0c\u5370\u5ea6\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u5efa\u7b51\u548c\u89c4\u8303\u652f\u6301\u6027\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u63a8\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u3002\u5370\u5ea6\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u6e17\u900f\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6211\u4eec\u671f\u671b\u5f3a\u52b2\u589e\u957f\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u6570\u5b57\u5206\u914d\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u660e\u663e\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u770b\u5230\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u52a0\u901f - \u8fd9\u5c06\u7531\u5370\u5ea6\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u8def\u8f68\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u4ed8\u6b3e\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u201c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5199\u516512\u670818\u65e5\u7ed9\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "note_en": "The stock, which opened Monday at \u20b91,226, dropped 5.3% at 1.55 pm India standard time. Paytm, which has been struggling to improve its stock price ever since its debut, has slid 45% from its issue price of \u20b92,150 ($28.9). The firm\u2019s market cap, at the time of publishing, was $10.2 billion, nearly half of what it had sought during the debut and below the $16 billion valuation at which it raised a financing round in late 2019.\n The plunge in price follows brokerage house Macquarie\u2019s report on Monday in which it retained its lowest rating on One97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, and cut its target price to \u20b9900 ($12.14), down from \u20b91,200 that it had assigned ahead of the market debut on November 18.\n  Macquarie was the only brokerage firm which had such a grim view on Paytm\u2019s outlook at the time of market debut. Analysts at Bernstein, in comparison, had estimated that Paytm valuation will range between $21 billion to $24 billion. (A Bernstein spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment in November.)\n \u201cPost the various business updates and results, we believe our revenue projections, particularly on the distribution side, is at risk and hence we pare down our revenue CAGR from 26% to 23% for FY21- 26E. We are roughly cutting revenue estimates for FY21-26E on an average by 10% every year due to lower distribution and commerce/cloud revenues offset partially by higher payment revenues,\u201d Macquarie analysts wrote Monday.\n \u201cWe cut our earnings (increase our loss projections) by 16-27% for FY22-25E owing to lower revenues and higher employee and software expenses. We cut our TP sharply by ~25% owing to lower target multiple of 11.5x (Price to Sales ratio) (from 13.5x earlier) and lower sales numbers. Maintain UP with a revised TP of Rs900.\u201d\n The brokerage firm said RBI\u2019s proposed digital payments regulations could cap wallet charges, which would hurt Paytm\u2019s business, where payments side still accounts for 70% of the firm\u2019s overall gross revenue. Macquarie also cited departure of senior Paytm executives and the shrinking ticket size for loans disbursed by Paytm as other factors that could impact the firm\u2019s future outlook.\n  In a report in the second half of December, analysts at Morgan Stanley labeled Paytm\u2019s stock as \u201coverweight,\u201d and assigned a target price of \u20b91,875 ($25.2), saying the firm was \u201cwell positioned to capitalize on upcoming acceleration in digital distribution of financial services/commerce in India.\u201d\n \u201cHuge TAM, India\u2019s distinctive tech architecture and regula- tory supportive partnership approach are key enablers, we believe. India is under-penetrated in financial services, and across segments we expect strong growth. More importantly, the penetration of third party digital distribution of financial services is significantly low and we will see strong acceleration over the next five years \u2013 this will be helped by the distinctive rails in India around identity, payments and data sharing,\u201d they wrote in a report to clients on December 18.\n \u201cAlso, we believe that PAYTM\u2019s cial services is synergistic, in line with the regulatory thought process and scalable. Balance sheet risk is low, and PAYTM\u2019s technology capabilities to leverage alternative data sets as well as design customized products are some key value adds against the above backdrop.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 16:33:32", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e93\u5b58,stock,\u5370\u5ea6", "title": "Paytm\u5e93\u5b58\u6ef4\u4e0b\u964d\u5230\u5386\u53f2\u4f4e", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPaytm stock drops to record low\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/paytm-stock-drops-to-record-low/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e93\u5b58", "stock", "\u5370\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "06af23f627f3a0ef10daa9352c723d19.jpeg", "infoid": 1072595, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Historian Amanda Foreman\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u4e86\u4eca\u5929\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u9605\u8bfb\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5217\u3002", "note_en": "Historian Amanda Foreman searches the past for the origins of today\u2019s world.
