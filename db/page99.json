Thanks to this reconstruction, we can now see that the composition as it was painted by Rembrandt was even more dynamic,&#34; Rijksmuseum director Taco Dibbits said.\n &#34;It is wonderful to be able to now see with our own eyes The Night Watch as Rembrandt intended it to be seen.&#34;\n   The Night Watch is considered Rembrandt&#39;s most ambitious work. It was commissioned by the mayor and leader of the civic guard of Amsterdam, Frans Banninck Cocq, who wanted a group portrait of his militia company.\n Prior to the restoration the painting was nearly 4m tall and 4.5m wide (12.5 x 15 ft) and weighed 337kg (743lb). As well as being famous for its size, the piece is acclaimed for its use of dramatic lighting and movement.\n In 1975, a man armed with a bread knife fought off a museum guard and slashed the painting, telling bystanders that he &#34;did it for the Lord&#34;.\n The piece was also attacked with a knife in 1911 and sprayed with a chemical in 1990, but only minor damage occurred on both occasions that was relatively easy to repair.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:44:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e,helps,\u73b0\u5728", "title":

", "note_en": "Where does your enterprise stand on the AI adoption curve? Take our  AI survey to find out.\n Adobe has launched  Substance 3D tools that take advantage of AI technology for immersive creation.\n The tools are aimed at making more realistic special effects, gaming, and entertainment imagery. They are also targeted at wider industries that similarly require a precision realism in design, said Sebastien Deguy (the vice president of 3D and immersive at Adobe) in an interview with GamesBeat.\n  \u201cTwo-and-a-half years ago, my company [Allegorithmic] was acquired to do 3D and immersive design,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cWe created this new division called 3D immersive. And the goal for this division is to provide a set of\u00a0 ecosystem of applications from Adobe for the 3d community, including game developers. It\u2019s for the studios we currently serve with our software products but also the new designers who are interested in 3D.\u201d\n Adobe acquired  Allegorithmic because of the potential it saw in the future of 3D technology. Since then, Adobe has been working on expanding Substance 3D.\n  \u201cCreators and designers in other industries beyond the game industry are adopting these game technologies,\u201d Deguy said. \u201cThere is a lot of room to grow. Most of the actual 3D tools are really complex and complicated to learn. Our tools are really well defined and easy to get into. We\u2019re trying to make it more accessible.\u201d\n But Adobe isn\u2019t making toys, either. It is targeting a new generation of designers who are just starting to use 3D in their processes. Substance 3D uses artificial intelligence to eliminate much of the technical complexity of 3D design and features the \u201cwhat you see is what you get\u201d interface artists know from  Photoshop\u00a0or\u00a0 Illustrator. And the collection isn\u2019t just about tools \u2014 it also includes thousands of models, textures, lighting systems, and other assets designers can use to jump-start projects.\n One of the main concerns of 3D artists and designers today \u2014 whether in game development, VFX, or product design \u2014 is that the design process is really fragmented. They need to jump between various tools as part of their workflows. The Adobe Substance 3D Collection was designed to connect seamlessly with Adobe Creative Cloud in order to drastically help streamline this process, allowing 3D artists to switch between Substance, Photoshop, InDesign, and more. Also, Adobe says this will help creatives curious about 3D quickly adopt and learn the tools because they are accustomed to the interface and the Creative Cloud, Deguy said.\n   Substance 3D includes four new tools and an expanded ecosystem, including an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets.\n Deguy said that the tool can be used in industries like architecture, fashion, food/beverage, and more. The tool can easily be integrated into design processes, regardless of experience level, he said.\n One of the new tools is Stager, which can assemble 3D models, materials, and lighting in a 3D scene and produce virtual photography. It gets a big boost from machine learning, Deguy said.\n   The third tool is Modeler, which will soon be available for private beta. Modeler connects virtual reality and desktop for a more immersive design process and organic sculpting.\n And the last tool is the 3D Asset Library, an expanded library of thousands of customizable 3D assets to feed creatives\u2019 workflow. The toolkit also provides access to Creative Cloud\u2019s fonts library, storage, and more.\n One example where the tools are useful is virtual photography.\u00a0Due to the pandemic, most brands/companies had to discontinue all photo or video shoots. By generating photorealistic renderings of products, companies like  Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s save time and money while creating lifelike images for marketing, promotion, and other uses.\n  Rival solutions come from Autodesk, Unity, and Unreal. The Substance 3D tools are interoperable with a lot of the competition, though, as standards such as Pixar\u2019s Universal Scene Description (USD) are spreading through simulation tools such as  Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse, Deguy said.\n Guido Quaroni is the director of engineering and 3D immersive at Adobe, but before that, he was at Pixar, where he was responsible for open-sourcing USD.  In a panel at the 2021 GPU Technology Conference (GTC), he said the idea of USD emerged at Pixar in 2010 as the company was dealing with multiple libraries that dealt with large scenes in its movies.\n  \u201cSome of the ideas in USD go back 20 years to  Toy Story 2, but the idea was to formalize it and write it in a way that we could eventually open source it,\u201d Quaroni said on my panel at GTC 2021.\n  Deguy said, \u201cWe want to make sure that we connect our teams and they talk to each other. And one of the things also that will help new designers to get into our offering is the fact that we will connect normally to the Omniverse and the Unity companies of this world, but also Photoshop and Illustrator and all the Create tools. We\u2019re at the same company, so we can connect.\u201d\n GamesBeat&#39;s creed when covering the game industry is &#34;where passion meets business.&#34; What does this mean?

", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  In  mathematical logic and  computer science,  homotopy type theory ( HoTT    /  h \u0252 t/) refers to various lines of development of  intuitionistic type theory, based on the interpretation of types as objects to which the intuition of (abstract)  homotopy theory applies.\n This includes, among other lines of work, the construction of homotopical and  higher-categorical  models for such type theories; the use of type theory as a logic (or  internal language) for abstract homotopy theory and  higher category theory; the development of mathematics within a type-theoretic  foundation (including both previously existing mathematics and new mathematics that homotopical types make possible); and the  formalization of each of these in computer  proof assistants.\n There is a large overlap between the work referred to as homotopy type theory, and as the  univalent foundations project. Although neither is precisely delineated, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, the choice of usage also sometimes corresponds to differences in viewpoint and emphasis.  [1] As such, this article may not represent the views of all researchers in the fields equally. This kind of variability is unavoidable when a field is in rapid flux.\n    At one time the idea that types in  intensional type theory with their identity types could be regarded as  groupoids was  mathematical folklore. It was first made precise semantically in the 1998 paper of Martin Hofmann and  Thomas Streicher called &#34;The groupoid interpretation of type theory&#34;, in which they showed that intensional type theory had a model in the category of  groupoids.  [2] This was the first truly &#34; homotopical&#34; model of type theory, albeit only &#34;1- dimensional&#34; (the traditional models in the  category of sets being homotopically 0-dimensional).\n Their paper also foreshadowed several later developments in homotopy type theory. For instance, they noted that the groupoid model satisfies a rule they called &#34;universe extensionality&#34;, which is none other than the restriction to 1-types of the  univalence axiom that  Vladimir Voevodsky proposed ten years later. (The axiom for 1-types is notably simpler to formulate, however, since a  coherent notion of &#34;equivalence&#34; is not required.) They also defined &#34;categories with isomorphism as equality&#34; and conjectured that in a model using higher-dimensional groupoids, for such categories one would have &#34;equivalence is equality&#34;; this was later proven by Benedikt Ahrens, Krzysztof Kapulkin, and  Michael Shulman.  [3]\n  The first higher-dimensional models of intensional type theory were constructed by  Steve Awodey and his student Michael Warren in 2005 using  Quillen model categories. These results were first presented in public at the conference FMCS 2006  [4] at which Warren gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy models of intensional type theory&#34;, which also served as his thesis prospectus (the dissertation committee present were Awodey, Nicola Gambino and Alex Simpson). A summary is contained in Warren&#39;s thesis prospectus abstract.  [5]\n At a subsequent workshop about identity types at  Uppsala University in 2006  [6] there were two talks about the relation between intensional type theory and factorization systems: one by Richard Garner, &#34;Factorisation systems for type theory&#34;,  [7] and one by Michael Warren, &#34;Model categories and intensional identity types&#34;. Related ideas were discussed in the talks by Steve Awodey, &#34;Type theory of higher-dimensional categories&#34;, and  Thomas Streicher, &#34;Identity types vs. weak omega-groupoids: some ideas, some problems&#34;. At the same conference Benno van den Berg gave a talk titled &#34;Types as weak omega-categories&#34; where he outlined the ideas that later became the subject of a joint paper with Richard Garner.\n All early constructions of higher dimensional models had to deal with the problem of coherence typical of models of dependent type theory, and various solutions were developed. One such was given in 2009 by Voevodsky, another in 2010 by van den Berg and Garner.  [8] A general solution, building on Voevodsky&#39;s construction, was eventually given by Lumsdaine and Warren in 2014.  [9]\n At the PSSL86 in 2007  [10] Awodey gave a talk titled &#34;Homotopy type theory&#34; (this was the first public usage of that term, which was coined by Awodey  [11]). Awodey and Warren summarized their results in the paper &#34;Homotopy theoretic models of identity types&#34;, which was posted on the  ArXiv preprint server in 2007  [12] and published in 2009; a more detailed version appeared in Warren&#39;s thesis &#34;Homotopy theoretic aspects of constructive type theory&#34; in 2008.\n At about the same time, Vladimir Voevodsky was independently investigating type theory in the context of the search of a language for practical formalization of mathematics. In September 2006 he posted to the Types mailing list &#34;A very short note on homotopy  lambda calculus&#34;,  [13] which sketched the outlines of a type theory with dependent products, sums and universes and of a model of this type theory in Kan  simplicial sets. It began by saying &#34;The homotopy \u03bb-calculus is a hypothetical (at the moment) type system&#34; and ended with &#34;At the moment much of what I said above is at the level of conjectures. Even the definition of the model of TS in the homotopy category is non-trivial&#34; referring to the complex coherence issues that were not resolved until 2009. This note included a syntactic definition of &#34;equality types&#34; that were claimed to be interpreted in the model by path-spaces, but did not consider  Per Martin-L\u00f6f&#39;s rules for identity types. It also stratified the universes by homotopy dimension in addition to size, an idea that later was mostly discarded.\n On the syntactic side, Benno van den Berg conjectured in 2006 that the tower of identity types of a type in intensional type theory should have the structure of an \u03c9-category, and indeed a \u03c9-groupoid, in the &#34;globular, algebraic&#34; sense of Michael Batanin. This was later proven independently by van den Berg and Garner in the paper &#34;Types are weak omega-groupoids&#34; (published 2008),  [14] and by Peter Lumsdaine in the paper &#34;Weak \u03c9-Categories from Intensional Type Theory&#34; (published 2009) and as part of his 2010 Ph.D. thesis &#34;Higher Categories from Type Theories&#34;.  [15]\n  The concept of a univalent fibration was introduced by Voevodsky in early 2006.  [16]However, because of the insistence of all presentations of the Martin-L\u00f6f type theory on the property that the identity types, in the empty context, may contain only reflexivity, Voevodsky did not recognize until 2009 that these identity types can be used in combination with the univalent universes. In particular, the idea that univalence can be introduced simply by adding an axiom to the existing Martin-L\u00f6f type theory appeared only in 2009.\n Also in 2009, Voevodsky worked out more of the details of a model of type theory in  Kan complexes, and observed that the existence of a universal  Kan fibration could be used to resolve the coherence problems for categorical models of type theory. He also proved, using an idea of A. K. Bousfield, that this universal fibration was univalent: the associated fibration of pairwise homotopy equivalences between the fibers is equivalent to the paths-space fibration of the base.\n To formulate univalence as an axiom Voevodsky found a way to define &#34;equivalences&#34; syntactically that had the important property that the type representing the statement &#34;f is an equivalence&#34; was (under the assumption of function extensionality) (-1)-truncated (i.e. contractible if inhabited). This enabled him to give a  syntactic statement of univalence, generalizing Hofmann and Streicher&#39;s &#34;universe extensionality&#34; to higher dimensions. He was also able to use these definitions of equivalences and contractibility to start developing significant amounts of &#34;synthetic homotopy theory&#34; in the proof assistant  Coq; this formed the basis of the library later called &#34;Foundations&#34; and eventually &#34;UniMath&#34;.  [17]\n Unification of the various threads began in February 2010 with an informal meeting at  Carnegie Mellon University, where Voevodsky presented his model in Kan complexes and his Coq code to a group including Awodey, Warren, Lumsdaine, and  Robert Harper, Dan Licata,  Michael Shulman, and others. This meeting produced the outlines of a proof (by Warren, Lumsdaine, Licata, and Shulman) that every homotopy equivalence is an equivalence (in Voevodsky&#39;s good coherent sense), based on the idea from category theory of improving equivalences to adjoint equivalences. Soon afterwards, Voevodsky proved that the univalence axiom implies function extensionality.\n The next pivotal event was a mini-workshop at the  Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach in March 2011 organized by Steve Awodey, Richard Garner, Per Martin-L\u00f6f, and Vladimir Voevodsky, titled &#34;The homotopy interpretation of constructive type theory&#34;.  [18] As part of a Coq tutorial for this workshop, Andrej Bauer wrote a small Coq library  [19] based on Voevodsky&#39;s ideas (but not actually using any of his code); this eventually became the kernel of the first version of the &#34;HoTT&#34; Coq library  [20] (the first commit of the latter  [21] by Michael Shulman notes &#34;Development based on Andrej Bauer&#39;s files, with many ideas taken from Vladimir Voevodsky&#39;s files&#34;). One of the most important things to come out of the Oberwolfach meeting was the basic idea of higher inductive types, due to Lumsdaine, Shulman, Bauer, and Warren. The participants also formulated a list of important open questions, such as whether the univalence axiom satisfies canonicity (still open, although some special cases have been resolved positively  [22]  [23]), whether the univalence axiom has nonstandard models (since answered positively by Shulman), and how to define (semi)simplicial types (still open in MLTT, although it can be done in Voevodsky&#39;s Homotopy Type System (HTS), a type theory with two equality types).\n Soon after the Oberwolfach workshop, the  Homotopy Type Theory website and blog  [24] was established, and the subject began to be popularized under that name. An idea of some of the important progress during this period can be obtained from the blog history.  [25]\n  The phrase &#34;univalent foundations&#34; is agreed by all to be closely related to homotopy type theory, but not everyone uses it in the same way. It was originally used by Vladimir Voevodsky to refer to his vision of a foundational system for mathematics in which the basic objects are homotopy types, based on a type theory satisfying the univalence axiom, and formalized in a computer proof assistant.  [26]\n As Voevodsky&#39;s work became integrated with the community of other researchers working on homotopy type theory, &#34;univalent foundations&#34; was sometimes used interchangeably with &#34;homotopy type theory&#34;,  [27] and other times to refer only to its use as a foundational system (excluding, for example, the study of model-categorical semantics or computational metatheory).  [28] For instance, the subject of the IAS special year was officially given as &#34;univalent foundations&#34;, although a lot of the work done there focused on semantics and metatheory in addition to foundations. The book produced by participants in the IAS program was titled &#34;Homotopy type theory: Univalent foundations of mathematics&#34;; although this could refer to either usage, since the book only discusses HoTT as a mathematical foundation.  [27]\n   In 2012\u201313 researchers at the  Institute for Advanced Study held &#34;A Special Year on Univalent Foundations of Mathematics&#34;.  [29] The special year brought together researchers in  topology,  computer science,  category theory, and  mathematical logic. The program was organized by  Steve Awodey,  Thierry Coquand and  Vladimir Voevodsky.\n During the program  Peter Aczel, who was one of the participants, initiated a working group which investigated how to do type theory informally but rigorously, in a style that is analogous to ordinary mathematicians doing set theory. After initial experiments it became clear that this was not only possible but highly beneficial, and that a book (the so-called  HoTT Book)  [27]  [30] could and should be written. Many other participants of the project then joined the effort with technical support, writing, proof reading, and offering ideas. Unusually for a mathematics text, it was developed collaboratively and in the open on  GitHub, is released under a  Creative Commons license that allows people to  fork their own version of the book, and is both purchasable in print and downloadable free of charge.  [31]  [32]  [33]\n  More generally, the special year was a catalyst for the development of the entire subject; the HoTT Book was only one, albeit the most visible, result.\n   ACM Computing Reviews listed the book as a notable 2013 publication in the category &#34;mathematics of computing&#34;.  [34]\n  dependent type            x  :  A  \u00a0  \u22a2  \u00a0  B  (  x  )  \u00a0    {\\displaystyle x:A\\ \\vdash \\ B(x)\\ }\n   \u03b1  :      I  d         I  d     A    (  a  ,  b  )    (  p  ,  q  )    {\\displaystyle \\alpha :\\mathrm {Id} _{\\mathrm {Id} _{A}(a,b)}(p,q)}\n  HoTT uses a modified version of the &#34; propositions as types&#34; interpretation of type theory, according to which types can also represent propositions and terms can then represent proofs. In HoTT, however, unlike in standard &#34;propositions as types&#34;, a special role is played by &#39;mere propositions&#39; which, roughly speaking, are those types having at most one term, up to  propositional equality. These are more like conventional logical propositions than are general types, in that they are proof-irrelevant.\n  The fundamental concept of homotopy type theory is the  path. In HoTT, the type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   is the type of all paths from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  . (Therefore, a proof that a point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   equals a point            b    {\\displaystyle b}   is the same thing as a path from the point            a    {\\displaystyle a}   to the point            b    {\\displaystyle b}  .) For any point            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , there exists a path of type            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}  , corresponding to the reflexive property of equality. A path of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   can be inverted, forming a path of type            b  =  a    {\\displaystyle b=a}  , corresponding to the symmetric property of equality. Two paths of type            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   resp.            b  =  c    {\\displaystyle b=c}   can be concatenated, forming a path of type            a  =  c    {\\displaystyle a=c}  ; this corresponds to the transitive property of equality.\n Most importantly, given a path            p  :  a  =  b    {\\displaystyle p:a=b}  , and a proof of some property            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}  , the proof can be &#34;transported&#34; along the path            p    {\\displaystyle p}   to yield a proof of the property            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  . (Equivalently stated, an object of type            P  (  a  )    {\\displaystyle P(a)}   can be turned into an object of type            P  (  b  )    {\\displaystyle P(b)}  .) This corresponds to  the substitution property of equality. Here, an important difference between HoTT and classical mathematics comes in. In classical mathematics, once the equality of two values            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   has been established,            a    {\\displaystyle a}   and            b    {\\displaystyle b}   may be used interchangeably thereafter, with no regard to any distinction between them. In homotopy type theory, however, there may be multiple different paths            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}  , and transporting an object along two different paths will yield two different results. Therefore, in homotopy type theory, when applying the substitution property, it is necessary to state which path is being used.\n In general, a &#34;proposition&#34; can have multiple different proofs. (For example, the type of all natural numbers, when considered as a proposition, has every natural number as a proof.) Even if a proposition has only one proof            a    {\\displaystyle a}  , the space of paths            a  =  a    {\\displaystyle a=a}   may be non-trivial in some way. A &#34;mere proposition&#34; is any type which either is empty, or contains only one point with a trivial  path space.\n Note that people write            a  =  b    {\\displaystyle a=b}   for            I    d    A    (  a  ,  b  )    {\\displaystyle Id_{A}(a,b)}  , thereby leaving the type            A    {\\displaystyle A}   of            a  ,  b    {\\displaystyle a,b}   implicit. Do not confuse it with            i    d    A    :  A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle id_{A}:A\\to A}  , denoting the identity function on            A    {\\displaystyle A}  .\n  Two types            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}   belonging to some universe            U    {\\displaystyle U}   are defined as being  equivalent if there exists an  equivalence between them. An equivalence is a function\n  which has both a left inverse and a right inverse, in the sense that for suitably chosen            g    {\\displaystyle g}   and            h    {\\displaystyle h}  , the following types are both inhabited:\n I    d    B  \u2192  B    (  f  \u2218  g  ,  i    d    B    )  ,    {\\displaystyle Id_{B\\rightarrow B}(f\\circ g,id_{B}),}\n I    d    A  \u2192  A    (  h  \u2218  f  ,  i    d    A    )  .    {\\displaystyle Id_{A\\rightarrow A}(h\\circ f,id_{A}).}\n  f  \u2218  g    =    B  \u2192  B    i    d    B    ,    {\\displaystyle f\\circ g=_{B\\rightarrow B}id_{B},}\n h  \u2218  f    =    A  \u2192  A    i    d    A    .    {\\displaystyle h\\circ f=_{A\\rightarrow A}id_{A}.}\n This expresses a general notion of &#34;           f    {\\displaystyle f}   has both a left inverse and right inverse&#34;, using equality types. Note that the invertibility conditions above are equality types in the function types            A  \u2192  A    {\\displaystyle A\\rightarrow A}   and            B  \u2192  B    {\\displaystyle B\\rightarrow B}  . One generally assumes the function extensionality axiom, which ensures that these are equivalent to the following types that express invertibility using the equality on the domain and codomain            A    {\\displaystyle A}   and            B    {\\displaystyle B}  :\n \u03a0    y  :  B    .  \u00a0  I    d    B    (  (  f  \u2218  g  )  (  y  )  ,  i    d    B    (  y  )  )  ,    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{y:B}.\\ Id_{B}((f\\circ g)(y),id_{B}(y)),}\n \u03a0    x  :  A    .  \u00a0  I    d    A    (  (  h  \u2218  f  )  (  x  )  ,  i    d    A    (  x  )  )  .    {\\displaystyle \\Pi _{x:A}.\\ Id_{A}((h\\circ f)(x),id_{A}(x)).}\n i.e. for all            x  :  A    {\\displaystyle x:A}   and            y  :  B    {\\displaystyle y:B}  ,\n       Having defined functions that are equivalences as above, one can show that there is a canonical way to turn paths to equivalences.In other words, there is a function of the type\n (  A  =  B  )  \u2192  (  A  \u2243  B  )  ,    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\to (A\\simeq B),}\n which expresses that types            A  ,  B    {\\displaystyle A,B}   that are equal are, in particular, also equivalent.\n  (  A  =  B  )  \u2243  (  A  \u2243  B  )    {\\displaystyle (A=B)\\simeq (A\\simeq B)}\n &#34;In other words, identity is equivalent to equivalence.

Thousands of subscribers depend on LWN for the best news from the Linux and free software communities. If you enjoy this article, please consider  subscribing to LWN. Thank youfor visiting LWN.net!\n There is an ongoing effort to &#34;modernize&#34; the kernel-development process;so far, the focus has been on  providing bettertools that can streamline the usual email-based workflow. But that&#34;email-based&#34; part has proven to be problematic for some potentialcontributors, especially those who might want to simply submit a small bugfix and are not interested in getting set up with that workflow. Theproject-hosting &#34;forge&#34; sites, like GitHub and GitLab, provide a nearlyfrictionless path for these kinds of one-off contributions, but they donot mesh well\u2014at all, really\u2014with most of mainline kernel development.There is some ongoing work that may change all of that, however.\n Konstantin Ryabitsev at the Linux Foundation has been spearheading much of thiswork going back at least as far as his  September\u00a02019draft proposal for better kernel tooling. Those ideas were discussed at the  2019 Kernel Maintainers Summit and at a  meeting at Open Source Summit Europe\u00a02019in October. Throughout, Ryabitsev has been looking at ways to make it easier fornon-email patch submitters; along the way, he has also released the   b4tool for collecting up patches and worked on  patch attestation.\n A recent  postto the kernel workflows mailing list shows some progress toward a bot that can turna GitHub pull request (PR) into a well-formed patch series to send to theproper reviewers and mailing lists. &#34; This would be a one-wayoperation, effectively turning Github into a fancy &#39;git-send-email&#39; replacement.&#34; He also laid out some of thebenefits that this bot could provide both for maintainers and patchsubmitters: submitters would no longer need to navigate their way around git-format-patch, get_maintainer.pl, and git-send-email -- nor would need to have a patch-friendly outgoing mail gateway to properly contribute patches subsystem maintainers can configure whatever CI pre-checks they want before the series is sent to them for review (and we can work on a library of Github actions, so nobody needs to reimplement checkpatch.pl multiple times) the bot should (eventually) be clever enough to automatically track v1..vX on pull request updates, assuming the API makes it straightforward\n He had some questions about whether the bot should be centralized in asingle repository (per forge platform) that would serve as the singlesubmission point, or whether subsystem maintainers would want to configure their ownrepositories. The latter would give maintainers the opportunity to set their owncriteria for checks that would need to pass (e.g.  checkpatch.pl)before the PR was considered valid, but would mean that they might have to rideherd on the repository as well.\n In addition, Ryabitsev wondered when and how PRs would get closed. The botcould potentially monitor the mainline and auto-close PRs once the patch setgets merged, but that won&#39;t be perfect, of course. An easier approach forhim would be &#34; to auto-close the pull request right after it&#39;s sent to the list with a message like &#39;thank you, please monitor your email for the rest of the process&#39;&#34;, but he was unsure if that would be best.\n As might be guessed, reactions from those participating in the thread wereall over the map. While there is a lack of many kinds of diversity withinthe kernel community, opinions on development workflow\u2014opinions, ingeneral, in truth\u2014do not have that problem. Some maintainers have zerointerest in this kind of effort at all. As Christoph Hellwig  put it:&#34; Please opt all subsystems I maintain out of this crap. The lastthing I need is patches from people that can&#39;t deal with a sane workflow.&#34;\n Hellwig&#39;s complaint, which Jiri Kosina  agreedwith, may be more about the expectations of those who use GitHub (andthe like), and less about the possibility of having a web-based interface tokernel development. Dmitry Vyukov  askedwhy Hellwig and Kosina would be unwilling to accept patches from the systemif they cannot really distinguish them from a regular submission. Vyukovsaid that he is currently experiencing a Git email submission problem that heis uninterested in working around, so he can see why others might besimilarly inclined. Meanwhile, though, he sees benefits from thiskind of bot: On the other hand this workflow has the potential to ensure that younever need to remind to run checkpatch.pl, nor spend time on writingcode formatting comments and re-reviewing v2 because code formattingwill be enforced, etc. So I see how this is actually beneficial formaintainers.\n Hellwig is  notopposed to a web-based solution, though he wants nothing to do withGitHub. But Ryabitsev  seemsuninterested in &#34; reimplementing a lot of stuff that we already get &#39;forfree&#39; from Github and other forges&#34;. Both  Mark Brownand  LaurentPinchart suggested that there are mismatches between GitHub-normal practicesand those of the kernel community. Pinchart mentioned the inability tocomment on a patch&#39;s commit message on GitHub as something that generally leadsto poor messages; the platform is training these developers to a certainextent: Developers who have only been exposed to those platforms are very likelyto never have learnt the importance of commit messages, and of propersplit of changes across commits. Those are issues that are inherent tothose platforms and that we will likely need to handle in an automatedway (at least to some extent) or maintainers will become crazy [...]\n But Miguel Ojeda  thinksthat it is really no different from new developers showing up on themailing list with patches. &#34; The same happens in the LKML -- somepeople have sent bad messages, but we correct them and they learn.&#34; He also  notedthat automated checking of patches can help both developers andmaintainers: [...] it is particularly useful to teach newcomers and tosave time for maintainers having to explain things. Even if amaintainer has a set of email templates for the usual things, it takestime vs. not even having to read the email.\n Ojeda is  working on the  Rust for Linux project, which we  looked at backin April; he  saidthat he has also been working on a bot: For Rust for Linux, I have a GitHub bot that reviews PRs and spots theusual mistakes in commit messages (tags, formatting, lkml vs. lorelinks, that sort of thing). It has been very effective so far to teachnewcomers how to follow the kernel development process. I am also extending it to take Acks, Reviewed-by&#39;s, Tested-by&#39;s, etc.,and then performing the merge only if the CI passes (which includesrunning tests under QEMU, code formatting, lints, etc.) after applyingeach patch.\n But Ojeda is taking things in a rather different direction than what Ryabitsev isenvisioning. Ojeda wants to move the main place for patch review and thelike from the mailing lists to GitHub. He is also considering having hisbot pick up patches from the mailing list and turning them into GitHubPRs\u2014the reverse of what Ryabitsev is doing.\n For his part, Ryabitsev  said:&#34; That&#39;s pretty cool, but I&#39;m opposed to this on theologicalgrounds. :)&#34; In particular, he is concerned about the &#34;single pointof failure&#34; problem for the kernel-development infrastructure. If his botis unavailable for any reason, it may be inconvenient for those who use it,but that will not hobble development. He sees GitHub as simply a&#34; developer frontend tool&#34;.\n Somewhat similar to Ojeda&#39;s intentions, Brendan Higgins  hasa tool to pick up patches from a mailinglist (kselftest in this case) and upload them to a  Gerrit instance. He seessome potential synergies between his bot and the one Ryabitsev is working on.Similarly, Drew DeVault  has been workingon the reverse direction, from a mailing list to a project forge, aswell. Patchwork is alongstanding code-review project that also collects up patches from mailing lists topopulate a web application.It would seem that much of the focus is on getting patches out of mailing lists, though, which is not where Ryabitsev is headed.\n While some maintainers want no part of this &#34;GitHub Future&#34;, others areenthusiastic about the possibilities it could bring. Vyukov  thinksthat having a single GitHub repository with multiple branches will helpconsolidate the kernel-development landscape, which is currently fragmentedon subsystem lines. He sees it as an opportunity to apply consistentcoding-style standards; it does not matter which, he said, &#34; as long as it&#39;sconsistent across the project&#34;. It would also allow testingconsistency throughout the tree and the same for the development process: For once: it will be possible to have proper documentation on theprocess (as compared to current per-subsystem rules, which are usuallynot documented again because of low RoI [return on investment] for anything related to asingle subsystem only).\n It is not at all clear that Vyukov&#39;s interest in consistency throughout thetree is shared widely, but there have certainly been complaints along theway about the difficulty of navigating between the different subsystemprocesses and requirements for submissions. There is also interest inmaking things easier for quick, one-off contributions; as Ryabitsev  putit: Our code review process must alsoallow for what is effectively a &#34;report a typo&#34; link. Currently, this isextremely onerous for anyone, as a 15-minute affair suddenly becomes aherculean effort. The goal of this work is to make drive-by patches easierwithout also burying maintainers under a pile of junk submissions.\n Clearly keeping &#34;junk submissions&#34; to a bare minimum is going to beimportant. Linus Torvalds  saidthat he has had to turn off email from GitHub because it is too noisy;people have apparently signed him up as a project member without any kindof opt-in check. Beyond that, any kind of patch submission from PRs wouldneed to have some sanity checks, including size limits, so that PRs like  one pointed out by Ryabitsevdo not end up on the mailing list.\n That kind of PR highlights another problem: repository maintenance. GregKroah-Hartman  saidthat there will be a need to monitor whatever repositories are being usedfor this purpose. It is not a small task: What ever repo you put this on, it&#39;s going to take constant maintenanceto keep it up to date and prune out the PRs that are going to accumulatethere, as well as deal with the obvious spam and abuse issues thatpopular trees always accumulate.\n Torvalds does not want his GitHub tree used for this purpose andKroah-Hartman said the same. However it plays out, someone will have to betasked with keeping the repository tidy, which is &#34; a thankless taskthat will take constant work&#34;. But Ryabitsev is  hopefulthat the Linux Foundation could fund that kind of work if it becomesnecessary.\n In the end, it will likely come down to how seamlessly the GitHub bot fitsin. If maintainers truly cannot really tell the difference in anysubstantive way, it is hard to see many of them rejecting well-formedpatches that fix real problems in their subsystems. That ideal may not bereached right away, however, which might lead to a premature end to theexperiment. It will be interesting to see it all play out over the comingmonths and years.\n         ( Log in to post comments)", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:42:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "github,linux,\u62c9\u5230", "title": "\u5c06github\u62c9\u5230Linux\u5185\u6838\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d ", "title_en": "Pulling GitHub into the Linux kernel process", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/860607/ef7cdf174ccbe54d/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["github", "linux", "\u62c9\u5230"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "00d20856e7333d9861481cdb1112ab31.png", "infoid": 1067863, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u73b0\u5728\u6b63\u5728\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8db3\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002\n \u5e95\u7ebf\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u5373\u5c06\u4f53\u9a8c\u5386\u53f2\u60a0\u4e45\u7684\u533a\u57df\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u6253\u7834\u6bcf\u65e5\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\n \u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u65f6\u673a\u66f4\u52a0\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8fc7\u53bb\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u6e29\u6696\u65f6\u671f\u90fd\u53d1\u751f\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u3002\n \u4f46\u662f\u70ed\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f1a\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u5982\u897f\u5317\u534e\u76db\u987f\u548c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u5c06\u9003\u8131\u6781\u7aef\u3002\n       \u5728\u6211\u63d0\u4f9bTorrid\u9884\u6d4b\u4e4b\u524d -

Much cooler near the water along the coast and Northwest Washington.\n    The much higher resolution UW WRF model (4-km grid spacing compared to about 9 km for the European Model) driven by the U.S. GFS global model is quite similar, but slightly cooler, with the off-white and white colors show where temperatures are forecast above 100F at 5 PM Saturday.\n    But Saturday is just a &#34;warm up&#34; for the extraordinarily threatening temperatures predicted for Sunday and Monday.\n    Just amazing.\u00a0 From Olympia south, temperatures rise to 105F and more, with Portland, reaching 110F-- just smashing the previous all-time record of 107F.\u00a0 Sea Tac gets to 101F.\u00a0 Above 110F in portions of the Columbia Basin.\u00a0 But it is the west-side temperature extremes that really are really insane, leading to many stations breaking their all-time records.\n     And then there is Monday.\u00a0 And quite honestly, it is hard to believe my eyes.\u00a0 Around 105F at SeaTac--breaking the all-time record of 103F.\u00a0 Around 114F in Portland---7F greater than the previous record.\u00a0 110F in Olympia and peaking around 115 near Richland.\u00a0 Folks....this is unparalleled, dangerous meteorological territory.\n     But these are just single forecasts.\u00a0 What about ensembles of many forecasts?\u00a0 A key tool for determining probabilities and confidence estimates in our forecasts.\n  For Saturday and Sunday, most of the European Center and U.S. ensemble members are on the same page, suggesting we should have confidence in the forecasts.\n  The ensemble average tends to be highly skillful and the European Ensemble mean forecasts for Seattle and Portland are shown below: up to 103F in Seattle and 110 in Portland.\n     Monday is far more uncertain than the weekend....it could be nutty warm and perhaps a minor cool down in the West. Stay tuned for that as we get closer.\n In any case,\u00a0 it is essentially certain that the Willamette Valley and western Washington from Seattle southward will have a historical heatwave, one beyond the experience of many residents.\n An important issue is that the minimum temperatures will not fall below 70F during the coolest periods, making it more difficult to cool homes and apartments. For portions of the heatwave, the dew points will rise into the mid-60s, making it seem more humid than normal.\n In a region where air conditioning is not widespread, this event will be potentially dangerous for the elderly and I can glad the City of Seattle Emergency Management folks are working on cooling centers and other approaches to mitigate the heat.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:41:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u70ed\u6d6a,heat,\u6e29\u5ea6", "title": "\u5386\u53f2\u70ed\u6d6a\uff0c\u5728\u897f\u5317\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5f55\u97f3\u6e29\u5ea6 ", "title_en": "An Historical Heat Wave with Record-Breaking Temperatures over the Northwest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2021/06/an-historical-heat-wave-with-record.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u70ed\u6d6a", "heat", "\u6e29\u5ea6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bc76d530f1dba6f42155007141e113d3.jpg", "infoid": 1067862, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u96c5\u864e\u57282013\u5e74\u4ece\u5bb6\u4e2d\u7981\u6b62\u5de5\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u4e2d\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff1a\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u662f\u81ea\u53d1\u5408\u4f5c\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\n \u201c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u201dJacqueline Reses\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u96c5\u864e\u6267\u884c\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u4e2d\u3002 \u201c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u4f73\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6765\u81ea\u8d70\u5eca\u548c\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u5385\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed3\u8bc6\u65b0\u4eba\u548c\u5373\u5174\u56e2\u961f\u4f1a\u8bae\u3002\u201d\n \u4eca\u5929\uff0cReses\u5973\u58eb\u73b0\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u662f\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u90ae\u653f\u4e4b\u5bb6\u8d44\u672c\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u4f1a\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5199\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u5417\uff1f\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u54e6\u8036\u3002\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\uff0c\u5979\u4ecd\u7136\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5408\u4f5c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u878d\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n \u7136\u800c\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8005\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u98ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u8001\u677f\u6b63\u5728\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u4e0e2013\u5e74\u96f7\u65af\u5973\u58eb\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7eb8\u6761\u3002\u201c\u521b\u65b0\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u201d\u82f9\u679c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Tim Cook\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5e16\u5b50 -

It may even hurt innovation, they say, because the demand for doing office work at a prescribed time and place is a big reason that the American workplace has been inhospitable for many people.\n \u201cThat\u2019s led to a lot of the outcomes we see in the modern office environment \u2014 long hours, burnout, the lack of representation \u2014 because that office culture is set up for the advantage of the few, not the many,\u201d said Dan Spaulding, chief people officer at Zillow, a real estate marketplace.\n \u201cThe idea you can only be collaborative face-to-face is a bias,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d ask, how much creativity and innovation have been driven out of the office because you weren\u2019t in the insider group, you weren\u2019t listened to, you didn\u2019t go to the same places as the people in positions of power were gathering?\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 07:41:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f1a\u8bae,meetings,\u529e\u516c\u5ba4", "title": "\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u4f1a\u8bae\u4f1a\u8bae\u63d0\u5347\u521b\u65b0\u5417\uff1f \u6ca1\u6709\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e ", "title_en": "Do chance meetings at the office boost innovation?

First introduced in OpenZFS 0.8, native encryption allows a system administrator to transparently encrypt data at-rest within ZFS itself. This obviates the need for separate tools like  LUKS,  VeraCrypt, or  BitLocker.\n OpenZFS encryption algorithm defaults to either  aes-256-ccm\u00a0(prior to 0.8.4) or  aes-256-gcm\u00a0(&gt;= 0.8.4) when  encryption=on\u00a0is set. But it may also be specified directly. Currently supported algorithms are:\n  There&#39;s more to OpenZFS native encryption than the algorithms used, though\u2014so we&#39;ll try to give you a brief but solid grounding in the sysadmin&#39;s-eye perspective on the &#34;why&#34; and &#34;what&#34; as well as the simple &#34;how.&#34;\n  A clever sysadmin who wants to provide at-rest encryption doesn&#39;t actually need OpenZFS native encryption, obviously. As mentioned in the introduction,  LUKS,  VeraCrypt, and many other schemes are available and can be layered either beneath or atop OpenZFS itself.\n  Putting something like Linux&#39;s  LUKS\u00a0underneath OpenZFS has an advantage\u2014with the\u00a0 entire disk encrypted, an enterprising attacker can no longer see the names, sizes, or properties of ZFS  datasets\u00a0and  zvols\u00a0without access to the key. In fact, the attacker can&#39;t necessarily see that ZFS is in use at all!\n But there are significant disadvantages to putting  LUKS\u00a0(or similar) beneath OpenZFS. One of the gnarliest is that each\u00a0 individual disk which will be part of the pool must be encrypted, with each volume loaded and decrypted prior to the ZFS pool  import\u00a0stage. This can be a noticeable challenge for ZFS systems with many disks\u2014in some cases, many\u00a0 tens of disks.\u00a0Another problem with encryption-beneath-ZFS is that the extra layer is an extra thing to go wrong\u2014and it&#39;s in a position to undo all of ZFS&#39; normal integrity guarantees.\n    Putting  LUKS\u00a0or similar atop OpenZFS gets rid of the aforementioned problems\u2014a  LUKS\u00a0encrypted  zvol\u00a0only needs one key regardless of how many disks are involved, and the  LUKS\u00a0layer cannot undo OpenZFS&#39; integrity guarantees from here. Unfortunately, encryption-atop-ZFS introduces a new problem\u2014it effectively nerfs OpenZFS inline compression, since encrypted data is generally incompressible. This approach also\u00a0 requires the use of one\u00a0 zvol\u00a0per encrypted filesystem, along with a guest filesystem (e.g.,\u00a0 ext4) to format the  LUKS\u00a0volume itself with.\n  OpenZFS native encryption splits the difference: it operates atop the normal ZFS storage layers and therefore doesn&#39;t nerf ZFS&#39; own integrity guarantees. But it also doesn&#39;t interfere with ZFS compression\u2014data is compressed prior to being saved to an encrypted  dataset\u00a0or  zvol.\n  There&#39;s an even more compelling reason to choose OpenZFS native encryption, though\u2014something called &#34;raw send.&#34; ZFS replication is ridiculously fast and efficient\u2014frequently several orders of magnitude faster than filesystem-neutral tools like  rsync\u2014and raw send makes it possible not only to replicate encrypted  datasets and  zvols, but to do so without exposing the key to the remote system. This means that you can use ZFS replication to back up your data to an\u00a0 untrusted location, without concerns about your private data being read. With raw send, your data is replicated without ever being decrypted\u2014and without the backup target ever being able to decrypt it at all. This means you can replicate your offsite backups to a friend&#39;s house or at a commercial service like  rsync.net\u00a0or  zfs.rent\u00a0without compromising your privacy, even if the service (or friend) is itself compromised.\n In the event that you need to recover your offsite backup, you can simply replicate it\u00a0 back to your own location\u2014then, and  only then, loading the decryption key to actually access the data. This works for either full replication (moving every single block across the wire) or asynchronous incremental replication (beginning from a commonly held snapshot and only moving the blocks which have changed since that snapshot).\n     OpenZFS native encryption isn&#39;t a full-disk encryption scheme\u2014it&#39;s enabled or disabled on a per-data set / per-zvol basis, and it cannot be turned on for entire pools as a whole. The contents of encrypted data sets or zvols are protected from at-rest spying\u2014but the metadata describing the data sets/zvols themselves is not.\n Let&#39;s say we create an encrypted data set named  pool/encrypted, and beneath it we create several more child data sets. The  encryption\u00a0property for the children is inherited by default from the parent data set, so we can see the following:\n root@banshee:~# zfs create -o encryption=on -o keylocation=prompt -o keyformat=passphrase banshee/encrypted\rEnter passphrase: \rRe-enter passphrase: \r\rroot@banshee:~# zfs create banshee/encrypted/child1\rroot@banshee:~# zfs create banshee/encrypted/child2\rroot@banshee:~# zfs create banshee/encrypted/child3\r\rroot@banshee:~# zfs list -r banshee/encrypted\rNAME USED AVAIL REFER MOUNTPOINT\rbanshee/encrypted 1.58M 848G 432K /banshee/encrypted\rbanshee/encrypted/child1 320K 848G 320K /banshee/encrypted/child1\rbanshee/encrypted/child2 320K 848G 320K /banshee/encrypted/child2\rbanshee/encrypted/child3 320K 848G 320K /banshee/encrypted/child3\r\rroot@banshee:~# zfs get encryption banshee/encrypted/child1\rNAME PROPERTY VALUE SOURCE\rbanshee/encrypted/child1 encryption aes-256-gcm -\n At the moment, our encrypted data sets are all mounted.

People like to browse but rarely convert and most of these transactions happen offline. So real-estate clients don\u2019t know how to optimize for their real buyers. Tomi uses machine learning to analyze the way real buyers browse the website and optimize ad campaigns towards conversions.\u201d\n The background to all this is that with Apple closing down IDFA, Google planning to remove third-party cookies from its Chrome browser, and the latest iOS 14.5 update allowing users opt out of \u201cpersonalized ads\u201d, the entire ad business is in flux, so new tools are going to be required.

But sometimes it is necessary to protect the superfluous in order to preserve the necessary,&#34; Breyer wrote.\n   Breyer said that the court has made clear that students &#34;do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression even &#39;at the school house gate.&#39;&#34;\n  &#34;But,&#34; he said, &#34;we have also made clear that courts must apply the First Amendment in light of the special characteristics of the school environment.&#34;\n &#34;The school itself has an interest in protecting a student&#39;s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus. America&#39;s public schools are the nurseries of democracy,&#34; the opinion read.\n  &#34;F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything&#34; Brandi Levy, then 14, wrote in 2017. She was reacting to the fact that as a junior varsity cheerleader she had failed to get a spot on the varsity squad at Mahanoy Area High School in Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania.\n When school officials learned of the outburst, Levy was suspended from the JV team for having violated school rules. But her lawyers sued, alleging the school had violated her freedom of speech. Levy is now 18 and a freshman at Bloomsburg University.\n Levy lauded the justices&#39; decision on Wednesday, saying in a statement: &#34;The school went too far, and I&#39;m glad that the Supreme Court agrees.&#34;\n &#34;Young people need to have the ability to express themselves without worrying about being punished when they get to school,&#34; she said. &#34;I never could have imagined that one simple snap would turn into a Supreme Court case, but I&#39;m proud that my family and I advocated for the rights of millions of public school students.&#34;\n  Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, writing that students like the former cheerleader &#34;who are active in extracurricular programs have a greater potential, by virtue of their participation, to harm those programs.&#34;\n &#34;For example, a profanity-laced screed delivered on social media or at the mall has a much different effect on a football program when done by a regular student than when done by the captain of the football team. So, too, here,&#34; Thomas wrote.\n  Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said Wednesday&#39;s ruling is a &#34;rare win&#34; for students in speech cases at the Supreme Court.\n  &#34;Today&#39;s decision may seem obvious to those who have a hard time seeing why public schools should be able to regulate any and all off-campus speech by students, but the fact that the court is identifying circumstances in which they can&#39;t is actually a big deal,&#34; Vladeck said.\n &#34;Although the line between the off-campus speech that schools can and can&#39;t regulate is less than clear, the fact that there is a line will have significant ramifications for just about all public school administrators going forward. It&#39;s a rare win for a student in a speech case before the current court,&#34; he added.\n At oral arguments, several of the justices struggled with where they could draw the line if they allowed schools to discipline students for speech directed at the school that occurs off-campus.\n Breyer, for example, acknowledged that Levy used &#34;unattractive swear words,&#34; but he questioned whether it caused a &#34;material and substantial disruption&#34; to the school.\n &#34;I don&#39;t see much evidence it did,&#34; he said, noting that teenagers, when talking to each other, often swear when they are off-campus.\n &#34;I mean, my goodness, every school in the country would be doing nothing but punishing,&#34; Breyer said.\n David Cole, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer for Levy, said that his client was &#34;merely expressing frustration with a four-letter word to her friends outside of school on a weekend.&#34; She wasn&#39;t sending a threat or an attempt to bully another student.\n &#34;The message may seem trivial, but for young people, the ability to voice their emotions to friends without fear of school censorship may be the most important freedom of all,&#34; he said.\n Lisa Blatt, a lawyer for the Mahanoy Area School District, told the justices that the line should be drawn not based on where the speech occurred, but on whether it caused a substantial disruption to the school.\n &#34;Off-campus speech, particularly on social media can be disruptive,&#34; she said, because of the internet&#39;s &#34;ubiquity, instantaneous and mass dissemination.&#34;\n Levy&#39;s case drew the support of Mary Beth and John Tinker, who won a landmark school speech case in 1969 that allowed them to wear a black armband on campus to protest the Vietnam War.\n  The high court held then that students do not shed &#34;their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,&#34; but said that some speech on school grounds could be could be punished.\n The justices took into consideration the special characteristics of a school environment and said that public school officials could regulate speech that would &#34;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.&#34; The opinion, however, dealt only with speech on school grounds related to the school.\n Levy won in the lower courts. A district court found that the school had not shown that she waived her speech rights as a condition of joining the cheerleading team. A federal appeals court affirmed, relying on the fact that the speech hadn&#39;t occurred in the campus environment which would include school-sponsored events and field trips.\n Breyer disagreed with the reasoning of a lower court opinion that held that a school could never regulate speech that takes place off campus, but at the same time he declined to set forth what he called &#34;a broad, highly general First Amendment rules stating just what counts as &#39;off-campus speech.&#34;\n Instead, he allowed that while the cheerleader&#39;s post were &#34;crude&#34; they &#34;did not amount to fighting words.&#34; He said that while she used &#34;vulgarity&#34; her speech was not &#34;obscene.&#34;\n   In addition, her post appeared &#34;outside of school hours from a location outside of school&#34; and they did not target any member of the school community with &#34;abusive&#34; language. He added that she used her own personal cellphone and her audience consisted of a private circle of Snapchat friends. Breyer said &#34;these features of her speech&#34; diminish the school&#39;s interest in punishing her.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:56:08", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662,court,\u5b66\u6821", "title": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5566\u5566\u961f\u961f\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc5\u5492 ", "title_en": "Supreme Court Sides With High School Cheerleader Who Cursed Online", "transed": 1, "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/23/politics/supreme-court-first-amendment-cheerleader/index.html?ofs=fbia", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662", "court", "\u5b66\u6821"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8685b44ace3aad0821baa41bced41edd.jpg", "infoid": 1067858, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u8d2d\u7269\u8005Aren\uff06\uff0339;\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e9b\u5356\u5bb6\u6240\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8428\u9ed8\u65af\u00b7\u8428\u6602\uff06\uff0339; T\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7d20\u6570\u7684\u8ff9\u8c61\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff08AMZN\uff09\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u661f\u671f\u4e00\u548c\u5468\u4e8c\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9f0e\u76db\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\uff0c\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5356\u5bb6\u9500\u552e\u671f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u9500\u552e\u671f\uff06\uff0339;\u5386\u53f2\u3002\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5546\u4eba\u7684\u9500\u552e\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u3002\n \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8fd8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u8d2d\u4e70\u8d85\u8fc72.5\u4ebf\u7269\u54c1\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u771f\u7a7a\uff0c\u5496\u5561\u58f6\u548c\u5d74\u53f7\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u7545\u9500\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\n     \uff06\uff0334;\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff06\uff0339; ampime\u65e5\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u5458\u6ce8\u518c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6210\u5458\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u5c55\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff0c\uff06\uff0334; Telsey\u54a8\u8be2\u5c0f\u7ec4\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u5206\u6790\u5e08Joseph Feldman\u5728\u4e00\u540d\u7814\u7a76\u7968\u636e\u5468\u4e09\u8868\u793a\u3002\n    \u6bd4\u5c14\u5fb7\u66fc\u8bf4\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5229\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u6807\u7b7e\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\n  \u6c83\u5c14\u739b\uff08WMT\uff09\uff0cTarget\uff08TGT\uff09\uff0cCostco\uff08\u6210\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u8d2d\u4e70\uff08BBY\uff09\uff0cMacy\uff06\uff0339; s\uff08m\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d44\u672c\u5316\u5728\u7ebf\u65e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4ea4\u901a\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\u3002\n   \u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u5929\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u5728\u7ebf\u652f\u51fa\u8d85\u8fc7110\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4e0e\u53bb\u5e74\u76f8\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\u4e866.1\uff05\uff06\uff0339;\u636eAdobe Analytics\u79f0\uff0c\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u96f6\u552e\u7f51\u7ad9\u8d85\u8fc71\u4e07\u4ebf\u8bbf\u95ee18\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u7c7b\u522b\u7684100\u4e07\u9879\u3002 \n\uff06\uff0334;\u5149\u73af\u6548\u5e94\uff06\uff0334; \u7d20\u6570\u65e5\u7ed9\u51fa\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u578b\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u90fd\u5927\u91cf\u6536\u5165\u5347\u964d\u673a\uff0c\uff06\uff0334; Taylor Schreiner\u8bf4\uff0cAdobe\uff06\uff0339;\u6570\u5b57\u89c1\u89e3\u5bfc\u6f14\u3002 ", "note_en": "New York (CNN Business)Shoppers aren&#39;t showing any signs of getting tired of  Amazon Prime Day, even though  some sellers had said they weren&#39;t planning on offering deals this year.\n Amazon  (  AMZN) said that Prime Day, held this past Monday and Tuesday, was the biggest two-day sales period for third-party sellers in the company&#39;s history. Amazon said sales from third-party merchants outpaced its own sales.\n Amazon also said Prime members purchased more than 250 million items worldwide on Prime Day. Robotic vacuums, coffee makers and Crest Whitestrips were some of the top-selling products.\n     &#34;Amazon&#39;s Prime Day was aimed to boost new Prime member signups and enhance its relationship with existing members to grow the ecosystem, a mission we believe Amazon accomplished,&#34; Joseph Feldman, a retail analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a research note Wednesday.\n    Amazon benefited this year from a favorable  economic environment, a wider product assortment \u2014 particularly in its own private-label brands\u2014 and increased participation from third-party sellers, said Feldman.\n  Walmart  (  WMT),  Target  (  TGT),  Costco  (  COST),  Best Buy  (  BBY),  Macy&#39;s  (  M) and others offered up deals of their own to capitalize on the surge in online traffic driven by Prime Day.\n   Overall, online spending during the two-day event surpassed $11 billion, a 6.1% increase compared to last year&#39;s Prime Day held in October, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks more than 1 trillion visits to US retail sites and over 100 million items across 18 product categories.\n The &#34;halo effect&#34;

It\u2019s used for things like spam detection in emails, sentiment analysis for social media posts, or intent detection in chat bots.\n In this series I am going to compare several libraries that can be used to train text classification models.\n  fastText is a tool from Facebook made specifically for efficient text classification. It\u2019s written in C++ and optimized for multi-core training, so it\u2019s very fast, being able to process hundreds of thousands of words per second per core. It\u2019s very straightforward to use, either as a Python library or through a CLI tool.\n Despite using an older machine learning model (a neural network architecture from 2016), fastText is still very competitive and provides an excellent baseline. If you also take into account resource usage, it will be all but impossible to improve on the fastText results, considering that the only models that perform better require powerful GPUs.\n  fastText requires the training data for text classification to be in a special format: each document should be on a single line and the labels should be at the start of the line, with the prefix  __label__, like this:\n  __label__sauce __label__cheese How much does potato starch affect a cheese sauce recipe? __label__food-safety __label__acidity Dangerous pathogens capable of growing in acidic environments __label__cast-iron __label__stove How do I cover up the white spots on my cast iron stove?\n If you use Doccano for  annotating the text data, it has an option to export the data in fastText format. But even if you used another tool for annotation, it\u2019s only a couple of lines of Python code to convert to the appropriate format. Let\u2019s say we have our data in a  JSONL format, with each JSON object having a  labels key and a  text key. To convert to fastText format, we can use the following short snippet:\n   After you have the data in the right format, the simplest way to use fastText is through it\u2019s CLI tool. After you  installed it, you can train a model with the  supervised subcommand:\n &gt; ./fasttext supervised -input fasttext.txt -output modelRead 0M wordsNumber of words: 16568Number of labels: 736Progress: 100.0% words/sec/thread: 47065 lr: 0.000000 avg.loss: 10.027837 ETA: 0h 0m 0s\n You can evaluate the model on a separate dataset with the  test subcommand and you will get the precision and recall for the first candidate label:\n   &gt; ./fasttext predict model.bin -How to make lasagna?__label__bakingBest way to chop meat__label__food-safetyHow to store steak__label__food-safety\n fastText comes with a builtin hyperparameter optimizer, to find the best model on a validation dataset, within the given time (5 minutes by default):\n    A precision of 0.72, compared to 0.16 before. Not bad, for 10 minutes of our time, out of which 5 was waiting for the computer to find us a better model.\n  This library provides a couple of knobs you can use to try to obtain better models, from what kind of n-grams to use, how big the learning rate should be, what should be the loss function, but also what metric are you trying to optimize. Is precision or recall better aligned with your business KPIs? Is it more important to have the top result be a really good one or are you looking for several good results among in the top 5? Are you only interested in high confidence results? All this depends on the problem you are trying to solve and fastText provides ways to optimize for each of those.\n   Not much flexibility \u2013 only one neural network architecture from 2016 implemented with very few parameters to tune\n  fastText is a great library to use when you want to start solving a text classification problem. In less than half an hour, you can get a good baseline going, which will tell you if this is a problem that is worth pursuing or not.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:54:55", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "For years, Rudy North woke up at 9  . . and read the Las Vegas  Review-Journal while eating a piece of toast. Then he read a novel\u2014he liked James Patterson and Clive Cussler\u2014or, if he was feeling more ambitious, Freud. On scraps of paper and legal notepads, he jotted down thoughts sparked by his reading. \u201cDeep below the rational part of our brain is an underground ocean where strange things swim,\u201d he wrote on one notepad. On another, \u201cLife: the longer it cooks, the better it tastes.\u201d\n Rennie, his wife of fifty-seven years, was slower to rise. She was recovering from lymphoma and suffered from neuropathy so severe that her legs felt like sausages. Each morning, she spent nearly an hour in the bathroom applying makeup and lotions, the same brands she\u2019d used for forty years. She always emerged wearing pale-pink lipstick. Rudy, who was prone to grandiosity, liked to refer to her as \u201cmy amour.\u201d\n On the Friday before Labor Day, 2013, the Norths had just finished their toast when a nurse, who visited five times a week to help Rennie bathe and dress, came to their house, in Sun City Aliante, an \u201cactive adult\u201d community in Las Vegas. They had moved there in 2005, when Rudy, a retired consultant for broadcasters, was sixty-eight and Rennie was sixty-six. They took pride in their view of the golf course, though neither of them played golf.\n Rudy chatted with the nurse in the kitchen for twenty minutes, joking about marriage and laundry, until there was a knock at the door. A stocky woman with shiny black hair introduced herself as April Parks, the owner of the company A Private Professional Guardian. She was accompanied by three colleagues, who didn\u2019t give their names. Parks told the Norths that she had an order from the Clark County Family Court to \u201cremove\u201d them from their home. She would be taking them to an assisted-living facility. \u201cGo and gather your things,\u201d she said.\n  One of Parks\u2019s colleagues said that if the Norths didn\u2019t comply he would call the police. Rudy remembers thinking, You\u2019re going to put my wife and me in jail for this? But he felt too confused to argue.\n  Parks drove a Pontiac G-6 convertible with a license plate that read \u201c ,\u201d for \u201ccourt guardian.\u201d In the past twelve years, she had been a guardian for some four hundred wards of the court. Owing to age or disability, they had been deemed incompetent, a legal term that describes those who are unable to make reasoned choices about their lives or their property. As their guardian, Parks had the authority to manage their assets, and to choose where they lived, whom they associated with, and what medical treatment they received. They lost nearly all their civil rights.\n Without realizing it, the Norths had become temporary wards of the court. Parks had filed an emergency ex-parte petition, which provides an exception to the rule that both parties must be notified of any argument before a judge. She had alleged that the Norths posed a \u201csubstantial risk for mismanagement of medications, financial loss and physical harm.\u201d She submitted a brief letter from a physician\u2019s assistant, whom Rennie had seen once, stating that \u201cthe patient\u2019s husband can no longer effectively take care of the patient at home as his dementia is progressing.\u201d She also submitted a letter from one of Rudy\u2019s doctors, who described him as \u201cconfused and agitated.\u201d\n  Rudy and Rennie had not undergone any cognitive assessments. They had never received a diagnosis of dementia. In addition to Freud, Rudy was working his way through Nietzsche and Plato. Rennie read romance novels.\n  Parks told the Norths that if they didn\u2019t come willingly an ambulance would take them to the facility, a place she described as a \u201crespite.\u201d Still crying, Rennie put cosmetics and some clothes into a suitcase. She packed so quickly that she forgot her cell phone and Rudy\u2019s hearing aid. After thirty-five minutes, Parks\u2019s assistant led the Norths to her car. When a neighbor asked what was happening, Rudy told him, \u201cWe\u2019ll just be gone for a little bit.\u201d He was too proud to draw attention to their predicament. \u201cJust think of it as a mini-vacation,\u201d he told Rennie.\n After the Norths left, Parks walked through the house with Cindy Breck, the owner of Caring Transitions, a company that relocates seniors and sells their belongings at estate sales. Breck and Parks had a routine. \u201cWe open drawers,\u201d Parks said at a deposition. \u201cWe look in closets. We pull out boxes, anything that would store\u2014that would keep paperwork, would keep valuables.\u201d She took a pocket watch, birth certificates, insurance policies, and several collectible coins.\n  The Norths\u2019 daughter, Julie Belshe, came to visit later that afternoon. A fifty-three-year-old mother of three sons, she and her husband run a small business designing and constructing pools. She lived ten miles away and visited her parents nearly every day, often taking them to her youngest son\u2019s football games. She was her parents\u2019 only living child; her brother and sister had died.\n She knocked on the front door several times and then tried to push the door open, but it was locked. She was surprised to see the kitchen window closed; her parents always left it slightly open. She drove to the Sun City Aliante clubhouse, where her parents sometimes drank coffee. When she couldn\u2019t find them there, she thought that perhaps they had gone on an errand together\u2014the farthest they usually drove was to Costco. But, when she returned to the house, it was still empty.\n That weekend, she called her parents several times. She also called two hospitals to see if they had been in an accident. She called their landlord, too, and he agreed to visit the house. He reported that there were no signs of them. She told her husband, \u201cI think someone kidnapped my parents.\u201d\n On the Tuesday after Labor Day, she drove to the house again and found a note taped to the door: \u201cIn case of emergency, contact guardian April Parks.\u201d Belshe dialled the number. Parks, who had a brisk, girlish way of speaking, told Belshe that her parents had been taken to Lakeview Terrace, an assisted-living facility in Boulder City, nine miles from the Arizona border. She assured Belshe that the staff there would take care of all their needs.\n  \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk into somebody\u2019s home and take them!\u201d Belshe told her.\n  Guardianship derives from the state\u2019s  parens patriae power, its duty to act as a parent for those considered too vulnerable to care for themselves. \u201cThe King shall have the custody of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits of them without waste or destruction, and shall find them their necessaries,\u201d reads the English statute  De Prerogative Regis, from 1324. The law was imported to the colonies\u2014guardianship is still controlled by state, not federal, law\u2014and has remained largely intact for the past eight hundred years. It establishes a relationship between ward and guardian that is rooted in trust.\n In the United States, a million and a half adults are under the care of guardians, either family members or professionals, who control some two hundred and seventy-three billion dollars in assets, according to an auditor for the guardianship fraud program in Palm Beach County. Little is known about the outcome of these arrangements, because states do not keep complete figures on guardianship cases\u2014statutes vary widely\u2014and, in most jurisdictions, the court records are sealed. A Government Accountability report from 2010 said, \u201cWe could not locate a single Web site, federal agency, state or local entity, or any other organization that compiles comprehensive information on this issue.\u201d A study published this year by the American Bar Association found that \u201can unknown number of adults languish under guardianship\u201d when they no longer need it, or never did. The authors wrote that \u201cguardianship is generally \u201cpermanent, leaving no way out\u2014\u2018until death do us part.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n When the Norths were removed from their home, they joined nearly nine thousand adult wards in the Las Vegas Valley. In the past twenty years, the city has promoted itself as a retirement paradise. Attracted by the state\u2019s low taxes and a dry, sunny climate, elderly people leave their families behind to resettle in newly constructed senior communities. \u201cThe whole town sparkled, pulling older people in with the prospect of the American Dream at a reasonable price,\u201d a former real-estate agent named Terry Williams told me. Roughly thirty per cent of the people who move to Las Vegas are senior citizens, and the number of Nevadans older than eighty-five has risen by nearly eighty per cent in the past decade.\n In Nevada, as in many states, anyone can become a guardian by taking a course, as long as he or she has not been convicted of a felony or recently declared bankruptcy. Elizabeth Brickfield, a Las Vegas lawyer who has worked in guardianship law for twenty years, said that about fifteen years ago, as the state\u2019s elderly population swelled, \u201call these private guardians started arriving, and the docket exploded. The court became a factory.\u201d\n Pamela Teaster, the director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech and one of the few scholars in the country who study guardianship, told me that, though most guardians assume their duties for good reasons, the guardianship system is \u201ca morass, a total mess.\u201d She said, \u201cIt is unconscionable that we don\u2019t have any data, when you think about the vast power given to a guardian. It is one of society\u2019s most drastic interventions.\u201d\n After talking to Parks, Belshe drove forty miles to Lakeview Terrace, a complex of stucco buildings designed to look like a hacienda. She found her parents in a small room with a kitchenette and a window overlooking the parking lot. Rennie was in a wheelchair beside the bed, and Rudy was curled up on a love seat in the fetal position. There was no phone in the room. Medical-alert buttons were strung around their necks. \u201cThey were like two lost children,\u201d Belshe said.\n  She asked her parents who Parks was and where she could find the court order, but, she said, \u201cthey were overwhelmed and humiliated, and they didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d They had no idea how or why Parks had targeted them as wards. Belshe was struck by their passive acceptance. \u201cIt was like they had Stockholm syndrome or something,\u201d she told me.\n Belshe acknowledged that her parents needed a few hours of help each day, but she had never questioned their ability to live alone. \u201cThey always kept their house really nice and clean, like a museum,\u201d she said. Although Rudy\u2019s medical records showed that he occasionally had \u201cstaring spells,\u201d all his medical-progress notes from 2013 described him as alert and oriented. He did most of the couple\u2019s cooking and shopping, because Rennie, though lucid, was in so much pain that she rarely left the house. Belshe sometimes worried that her father inadvertently encouraged her mother to be docile: \u201cShe\u2019s a very smart woman, though she sometimes acts like she\u2019s not. I have to tell her, \u2018That\u2019s not cute, Mom.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  When Belshe called Parks to ask for the court order, Parks told her that she was part of the \u201csandwich generation,\u201d and that it would be too overwhelming for her to continue to care for her children and her parents at the same time. Parks billed her wards\u2019 estates for each hour that she spent on their case; the court placed no limits on guardians\u2019 fees, as long as they appeared \u201creasonable.\u201d Later, when Belshe called again to express her anger, Parks charged the Norths twenty-four dollars for the eight-minute conversation. \u201cI could not understand what the purpose of the call was other than she wanted me to know they had rights,\u201d Parks wrote in a detailed invoice. \u201cI terminated the phone call as she was very hostile and angry.\u201d\n A month after removing the Norths from their house, Parks petitioned to make the guardianship permanent. She was represented by an attorney who was paid four hundred dollars an hour by the Norths\u2019 estate. A hearing was held at Clark County Family Court.\n The Clark County guardianship commissioner, a lawyer named Jon Norheim, has presided over nearly all the guardianship cases in the county since 2005. He works under the supervision of a judge, but his orders have the weight of a formal ruling. Norheim awarded a guardianship to Parks, on average, nearly once a week. She had up to a hundred wards at a time. \u201cI love April Parks,\u201d he said at one hearing, describing her and two other professional guardians, who frequently appeared in his courtroom, as \u201cwonderful, good-hearted, social-worker types.\u201d\n  Norheim\u2019s court perpetuated a cold, unsentimental view of family relations: the ingredients for a good life seemed to have little to do with one\u2019s children and siblings. He often dismissed the objections of relatives, telling them that his only concern was the best interest of the wards, which he seemed to view in a social vacuum. When siblings fought over who would be guardian, Norheim typically ordered a neutral professional to assume control, even when this isolated the wards from their families.\n Rudy had assured Belshe that he would protest the guardianship, but, like most wards in the country, Rudy and Rennie were not represented by counsel. As Rudy stood before the commissioner, he convinced himself that guardianship offered him and Rennie a lifetime of care without being a burden to anyone they loved. He told Norheim, \u201cThe issue really is her longevity\u2014what suits her.\u201d Belshe, who sat in the courtroom, said, \u201cI was shaking my head. No, no, no\u2014don\u2019t do that!\u201d Rennie was silent.\n Norheim ordered that the Norths become permanent wards of the court. \u201cChances are, I\u2019ll probably never see you folks again; you\u2019ll work everything out,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI very rarely see people after the initial time in court.\u201d The hearing lasted ten minutes.\n The following month, Even Tide Life Transitions, a company that Parks often hired, sold most of the Norths\u2019 belongings. \u201cThe general condition of this inventory is good,\u201d an appraiser wrote. Two lithographs by Renoir were priced at thirty-eight hundred dollars, and a glass cocktail table (\u201cClient states that it is a Brancusi design\u201d) was twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The Norths also had several pastel drawings by their son, Randy, who died in a motorcycle accident at the age of thirty-two, as well as Kachina dolls, a Bose radio, a Dyson vacuum cleaner, a Peruvian tapestry, a motion-step exerciser, a LeRoy Neiman sketch of a bar in Dublin, and two dozen pairs of Clarke shoes. According to Parks\u2019s calculations, the Norths had roughly fifty thousand dollars. Parks transferred their savings, held at the Bank of America, to an account in her name.\n Rennie repeatedly asked for her son\u2019s drawings, and for the family photographs on her refrigerator. Rudy pined for his car, a midnight-blue 2010 Chrysler, which came to symbolize the life he had lost. He missed the routine interactions that driving had allowed him. \u201cEverybody at the pharmacy was my buddy,\u201d he said. Now he and Rennie felt like exiles. Rudy said, \u201cThey kept telling me, \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have to worry: your car is fine, and this and that.\u2019\u00a0\u201d A month later, he said, \u201cthey finally told me, \u2018Actually, we sold your car.\u2019 I said, \u2018What in the hell did you sell it for?\u2019\u00a0\u201d It was bought for less than eight thousand dollars, a price that Rudy considered insulting.\n Rudy lingered in the dining room after eating breakfast each morning, chatting with other residents of Lakeview Terrace. He soon discovered that ten other wards of April Parks lived there. His next-door neighbor, Adolfo Gonzalez, a short, bald seventy-one-year-old who had worked as a ma\u00eetre d\u2019 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, had become Parks\u2019s ward at a hearing that lasted a minute and thirty-one seconds.\n Gonzalez, who had roughly three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in assets, urged Rudy not to accept the nurse\u2019s medications. \u201cIf you take the pills, they\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t make it to court,\u201d he said. Gonzalez had been prescribed the antipsychotic medications Risperdal and Depakote, which he hid in the side of his mouth without swallowing. He wanted to remain vigilant. He often spoke of a Salvador Dali painting that had been lost when Parks took over his life. Once, she charged him two hundred and ten dollars for a visit in which, according to her invoice, he expressed that \u201che feels like a prisoner.\u201d\n  Rudy was so distressed by his conversations with Gonzalez that he asked to see a psychologist. \u201cI thought maybe he\u2019d give me some sort of objective learning as to what I was going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to ask basic questions, like What the hell is going on?\u201d Rudy didn\u2019t find the session illuminating, but he felt a little boost to his self-esteem when the psychologist asked that he return for a second appointment. \u201cI guess he found me terribly charming,\u201d he told me.\n Rudy liked to fantasize about an alternative life as a psychoanalyst, and he tried to befriend the wards who seemed especially hopeless. \u201cLoneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over,\u201d he wrote in his notebook. He bought a pharmaceutical encyclopedia and advised the other wards about medications they\u2019d been prescribed. He also ran for president of the residents, promising that under his leadership the kitchen would no longer advertise canned food as homemade. (He lost\u2014he\u2019s not sure if anyone besides Rennie voted for him\u2014but he did win a seat on the residents\u2019 council.)\n He was particularly concerned about a ward of Parks\u2019s named Marlene Homer, a seventy-year-old woman who had been a professor. \u201cNow she was almost hiding behind the pillars,\u201d Rudy said. \u201cShe was so obsequious. She was, like, \u2018Run me over. Run me over.\u2019\u00a0\u201d She\u2019d become a ward in 2012, after Parks told the court, \u201cShe has admitted to strange thoughts, depression, and doing things she can\u2019t explain.\u201d On a certificate submitted to the court, an internist had checked a box indicating that Homer was \u201cunable to attend the guardianship court hearing because______,\u201d but he didn\u2019t fill in a reason.\n  The Norths could guess which residents were Parks\u2019s wards by the way they were dressed. Gonzalez wore the same shirt to dinner nearly every day. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he told the others at his table. When a friend tried to take him shopping, Parks prevented the excursion because she didn\u2019t know the friend. Rennie had also tried to get more clothes. \u201cI reminded ward that she has plenty of clothing in her closet,\u201d Parks wrote. \u201cI let her know that they are on a tight budget.\u201d The Norths\u2019 estate was charged a hundred and eighty dollars for the conversation.\n Another resident, Barbara Neely, a fifty-five-year-old with schizophrenia, repeatedly asked Parks to buy her outfits for job interviews. She was applying for a position with the Department of Education. After Neely\u2019s third week at Lakeview Terrace, Parks\u2019s assistant sent Parks a text. \u201cCan you see Barbara Neely anytime this week?\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe has questions on the guardianship and how she can get out of it.\u201d Parks responded, \u201cI can and she can\u2019t.\u201d Neely had been in the process of selling her house, for a hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars, when Parks became her guardian and took charge of the sale.\n The rationale for the guardianship of Norbert Wilkening, who lived on the bottom floor of the facility, in the memory-care ward, for people with dementia (\u201cthe snake pit,\u201d Rudy called it), was also murky. Parks\u2019s office manager, who advertised himself as a \u201cQualified Dementia Care Specialist\u201d\u2014a credential acquired through video training sessions\u2014had given Wilkening a \u201cMini-Mental State Examination,\u201d a list of eleven questions and tasks, including naming as many animals as possible in a minute. Wilkening had failed. His daughter, Amy, told me, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything that was happening to him other than a regular getting-older process, but when I was informed by all these people that he had all these problems I was, like, Well, maybe I\u2019m just in denial.

", "note_en": "Many a pub crawler has engaged in the time-honored tradition of throwing beer mats\u2014those round cardboard coasters that are ubiquitous in bars\u2014as if the mats were frisbees, often competing to see who can throw one the farthest.\u00a0But unlike frisbees, beer mats tend to flip in the air and fly with a backspin. Now physicists at the University of Bonn have come up with a theoretical model to explain the phenomenon, according to\u00a0 a new paper submitted to the physics arXiv preprint server.\n Thanks to their natural curiosity, physicists are fascinated by the physics of beer, and lead author Johann Ostmeyer is no exception. A couple of years ago, he became intrigued by the physics of so-called &#34;beer tapping&#34;: a common prank where the perpetrator, holding an open bottle of beer, finds a target in the bar holding another open bottle. The prankster strikes the top of the target&#39;s bottle with the bottom of their own, then savors the sight of beer explosively foaming all over the target&#39;s hands and clothes.\n Back in 2013, Javier Rodr\u00edguez-Rodr\u00edguez, a physicist at Carlos III University of Madrid, and several colleagues presented experimental and computer-simulation findings of why beer cans  foam up so much after being shaken. They concluded that the foaming-over stemmed from a series of waves. Apparently the physics is similar to the development of the cloud in an atomic bomb, although the source of the &#34;explosion&#34; is very different.\n  The initial tap creates a shockwave that travels from the top to the bottom of the target&#39;s bottle. That shockwave&#39;s energy is transferred to the beer, sending a second shockwave bouncing back and forth between the bottom of the bottle and the beer&#39;s surface. All that activity releases tiny pockets of gas trapped in small imperfections in the bottle&#39;s glass, creating clouds of smaller bubbles from the beer&#39;s dissolved CO 2. As they rise to the surface, those bubbles get bigger and speed up, eventually creating the shower of foam that makes beer tapping such a popular pub prank.\n    Ostmeyer  submitted his own analysis on the beer tapping issue to the arXiv last year, specifically focusing on why the lower beer bottle foams over and the upper one does not. The initial tap creates a low pressure in the lower bottle, and the CO 2 bubbles expand and collapse into fragments.\n  More gas gets diffused into the cluster of bubbles, rising up to create the foam. Something different happens in the top bottle. There is a higher initial pressure, so there are only moderate oscillations in the bubbles, and the eventual bubble collapse doesn&#39;t happen\u2014or at least not to the same extent. Thus, you don&#39;t get the same rapid growth cloud turning your entire beer into foam. &#34;The prankster leaves the scene dry,&#34; Ostmeyer wrote.\n Now Ostmeyer,\u00a0inspired by a 2017 trip to Munich for a German physics outreach demonstration show, has turned his attention to the pressing question of beer-mat flight trajectories.\u00a0Beer mats (at least the round variety) are basically thin, flat disks with a given radius and mass. A  frisbee is also a thin flat disk, and the physics surrounding its flight is well-known.\n A frisbee&#39;s distinctive curved upper surface is essentially the same shape (when viewed from the side) as an airfoil. Throw it with sufficient force to overcome the downward pull of gravity, and it will generate lift. Of course, there is also air resistance, or drag, acting on the frisbee as it flies through the air. The resistance depends on the angle of attack. If the angle is negative, it pushes the air up and forces the frisbee down, while a positive angle will push the frisbee up. To keep wobbling to a minimum, professional frisbee players know to add a spin when they throw, ensuring their frisbees stay on a single plane as they travel.\n    But beer mats don&#39;t have the frisbee&#39;s distinctive airfoil-like edge, and that affects their aerodynamics. Ostmeyer  et al. began by assuming a horizontal flight and an axis of rotation perpendicular to the direction it is moving. Toss a beer mat like a frisbee, and the rotation will initially stabilize it.\n    However, the pull of gravity will soon cause the mat to drop, which will alter the angle at which it attacks the air. You&#39;ll still get lift, but it will be focused close to the leading edge rather than the mat&#39;s center of mass. So the mat will start to precess, forcing it to flip on its side so that it is traveling vertically. The researchers&#39; model predicted that this should happen at about 0.45 seconds into the flight.\u00a0Furthermore, the model showed that the mat could have either a backspin (which is stable) or a topspin (which is unstable). Thus, the mat will be more likely to have a backspin.\n Every good theoretical prediction must be experimentally tested, of course, and randomly tossing beer mats around in the local pub wouldn&#39;t be scientifically rigorous. Thrown by hand, the timing of the tilt appears to be random, but the model predicts otherwise. So Ostmeyer and his team\u00a0built their own makeshift beer-mat launcher out of two electric motor-powered treadmills. The launcher enabled the researchers to control the horizontal velocity and rate of rotation of each launch.\n The researchers placed the launcher on a table, then placed a beer mat between the treadmills and launched the mats at various speeds, marking where they landed on the floor. The flight trajectories were recorded with high-speed cameras, and the team used a program called Tracker to extract the coordinates of the beer mat at any point along its trajectory. The results of the researchers&#39; subsequent analysis showed very good agreement with the theoretical predictions.\n Ostmeyer  et al.&#39;s theoretical model can also be used to predict the flight trajectories of other kinds of flying discs. For instance, their model predicts that a CD will flip after 0.8 seconds, while a larger and heavier discus will flip after 16 seconds. A flying playing card has the shortest trajectory of all, flipping after just 0.24 seconds. &#34;Even Rick Smith Jr., the world record holder for farthest card thrown, or a playing card machine gun, cannot avoid their cards flying a curve and ending up with backspin after much less than a second,&#34; the authors wrote in a footnote.\n The model&#39;s prediction for a frisbee\u2014without taking into account any aerodynamics due to its curvature\u2014is a surprising 0.8 seconds. &#34;Of course, the wing form of a frisbee allows it to remain stable for a much longer time when thrown professionally,&#34; they wrote. &#34;The reason is that frisbees have their aerodynamic center very near to their center of mass and, thus, experience much less torque.&#34;\n We raise a glass to Ostmeyer and his colleagues for their entertaining and informative work, which was driven purely by scientific curiosity.&#34;Our sincere apologies to everyone hit by a beer mat,&#34; the authors noted in their acknowledgements, &#34;be it through inaccurate aim or due to us instigating others to perform silly experiments.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:17:14", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8868\u660e,show,\u5564\u9152", "title": "\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5564\u9152\u676f\u676f\u5c06\u5728\u98de\u884c\u4e2d\u7ffb\u8f6c0.45\u79d2 ", "title_en": "Physicists show that flying beer coasters will flip 0.45 seconds into flight", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/the-physics-of-why-that-flying-beer-coaster-is-nothing-like-a-frisbee/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8868\u660e", "show", "\u5564\u9152"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0c1cba74492b36e17f2bd1cf61719a2a.jpg", "infoid": 1067854, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaJohn McAfee\u5728McAfee Antivirus\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u6839\u636eReuters\uff0cEl Mundo\uff0cElPa\u00eds\u7b49\u7684\u62a5\u9053\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\u4ed6\u6b63\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u76d1\u72f1\u4e3e\u884c\uff0c\u52a0\u6cf0\u7f57\u5c3c\u4e9a\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u6b7b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u81ea\u6740\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002\u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u7684\u5f8b\u5e08\u5411\u8def\u900f\u793e\u548c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u4e00\u8a00\u8bed\u662f\u201c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b8b\u9177\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7537\u4eba\u5728\u76d1\u72f1\u91cc\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u201d\n  \u81ea2020\u5e7410\u6708\u88ab\u6355\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u5728\u76d1\u72f1\u4e3e\u884c\u76d1\u72f1\uff0c\u5f85\u9001\u5230\u7f8e\u56fd\u3002\u4ed6\u9762\u4e34\u9003\u7a0e\u7684\u6307\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u88ab\u6307\u63a7\u4e0e\u6d89\u5acc\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u8fd0\u6cf5\u548c\u8f6c\u50a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6709\u5173\u7684\u8bc1\u5238\u6b3a\u8bc8\u3002\u6839\u636eReuters\u548cEl Mundo\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u6cd5\u9662\u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a\u7684\u5f15\u6e21\uff0c\u673a\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bc9\u3002\n \u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u6293\u4f4f\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd2\u54c1\u71c3\u6599\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4ed6\u672a\u5b89\u88c5McAfee Antivirus\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u5df2\u7ecf\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u963b\u6b62NSA\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u603b\u7edf\u8fd0\u884c -

He was being held in a Barcelona prison, and the Catalan Department of Justice has stated that his death was likely caused by suicide. Lawyers for McAfee confirmed his death to  Reuters  and  The New York Times, with one saying  it was \u201cthe result of a cruel system that had no reason to keep this man in jail for so long.\u201d\n  McAfee was being held in prison,  pending extradition to the US, since his arrest in October 2020. He faced  charges of tax evasion and had also  been charged with securities fraud relating to an alleged cryptocurrency pump and dump scheme. Spanish courts had approved his extradition this morning with opportunity for appeal, according to   Reuters and   El Mundo .\n McAfee\u2019s story over the past decade has been headline-grabbing. He\u2019s  released a drug-fueled video in which he un-installs McAfee Antivirus, claimed to have made a device  that blocked NSA surveillance, and  run for president \u2014 twice, in 2016 and 2020. He\u2019s also a noted cryptocurrency promoter, who  once claimed to charge $105,000 for each promotional tweet, if you wanted McAfee to boost your cryptocurrency or initial coin offering on Twitter\u2019s platform.\n In 2014,  Intel rebranded the antivirus software that bore McAfee\u2019s name, changing it to \u201cIntel Security.\u201d In response, McAfee told the BBC that he was grateful that \u201cthe worst software on the planet\u201d was no longer associated with his name. McAfee later sued Intel after it warned him that naming a new cybersecurity company after himself would be trademark infringement. McAfee  later agreed to a settlement with Intel, saying that he wouldn\u2019t use his name in connection to any cybersecurity products or services he worked on.\n McAfee has a history of run-ins with law enforcement. He, his family, and members of his security forces  were arrested by the Belize police in 2012, after drug and firearm charges. He  went on the run later that year, after the Belize police declared that he  was wanted for questioning in relation to the murder of his neighbor.\n  The story became one of the  focuses of a 2016 Showtime documentary, which sought to prove that McAfee was involved not only in that murder, but other crimes as well.  As recently as 2019, McAfee called the case against him \u201cfrivolous,\u201d and refused to pay a $25 million judgement against him in a wrongful death suit. He  also claimed that he had over $200 million in judgements against him in other legal cases, but that he could not pay any of them.\n In recent years, McAfee claimed to be on the run from the CIA,  tweeting a picture of himself on a boat holding a gun. McAfee has also  tweeted multiple times, once  after his October arrest, that he wouldn\u2019t kill himself, and those tweets are already leading to conspiracy theories about his death.\n The US Department of Justice tells  The Verge that it has no comment on the matter, referring us to Spanish authorities.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 06:16:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u53d1\u73b0,mcafee", "title": "\u5f53\u5c40\u8bf4\uff0c\u7ea6\u7ff0\u8fc8\u514b\u83f2\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u76d1\u72f1\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1 ", "title_en": "John McAfee found dead in Barcelona prison, authorities say", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547643/john-mcafee-dead-prison-spain-us-extradition", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u73b0", "mcafee"]}]
