Stupid, I thought. Twenty years old and you think you’re invincible, think your life is some romantic story. Ahead of me, terns swerved in and out of my circle of vision, blurring into the fog. I’d left just minutes before, but already I couldn’t see the mainland. My yellow plastic kayak, pink and white flowers tied down where there should have been safety gear, looked cheerful and garish against the gray ocean. I heard a lobster boat grating into gear somewhere ahead and to my right.</p><p>我没有带舱底泵，而是带了羽扇豆花和雏菊。我觉得很蠢。二十岁的你认为自己是不可战胜的，认为你的生活就是一个浪漫的故事。在我前面，燕鸥在我的视线范围内来来回回，模糊地笼罩在雾中。我几分钟前刚离开，但已经看不到大陆了。我的黄色塑料皮划艇，粉色和白色的花被绑在应该有安全装备的地方，在灰色的海洋的映衬下看起来既欢快又艳丽。我听到一艘龙虾船在前方和我右边的某个地方急速开动。</p><p> Scared in my mind but not in my body. I felt like shouting this to the wind, but my grip on the paddle was slipping with sweat, even as my shirt darkened in the cold, wet air. I stroked right, settling the compass near 185 degrees, and glanced at the flowers, stems ragged from where I’d torn them off by the road. If I’m headed to Portugal, I thought grimly, at least I’ve brought flowers for the funeral.  Then I laughed, with relief and something else, because I’d hit the landing of the four-acre island straight on, the metal ramp to the dock glinting under a dark smudge of trees. I freed my bouquet, now wilted, lashed my kayak to the float, and climbed up slippery pink granite to the trail. They’ll be all right, I thought, once I set them in fresh water.</p><p>恐惧在我的脑海里，但不在我的身体里。我想对着风喊这句话，但我握着球拍的手因汗水而滑落，尽管我的衬衫在寒冷潮湿的空气中变黑了。我向右划了划，把指南针放在185度附近，瞥了一眼那些花朵，它们的花茎从我从路边扯下来的地方掉了下来。如果我要去葡萄牙，我冷冷地想，至少我为葬礼带来了鲜花。然后我笑了，松了一口气，还有其他一些东西，因为我直接撞上了这个4英亩的岛屿的平台，通往码头的金属坡道在一片漆黑的树木下闪闪发光。我解开现在枯萎的花束，把皮划艇绑在花车上，爬上光滑的粉色花岗岩，来到小径上。我想，只要我把它们放进淡水里，它们就会好起来的。</p><p> Last summer I lived alone on a tiny island in the easternmost part of coastal  Maine—a region known as Down East—where I worked as  a sternman on a lobster boat. I say “sternman” because nobody says “sternwoman .” I could count the number of female captains in the harbor on my hand—not enough to budge the traditional vernacular. I worked for one of them.</p><p>去年夏天，我独自一人住在缅因州沿海最东端的一个小岛上，这个地区被称为唐东(Down East)，我在那里的一艘龙虾船上当捕龙虾的渔夫。我说“斯特恩曼”是因为没人说“斯特恩曼”我可以用手数一数港口里有多少女船长--不足以改变传统的方言。我为其中一家工作过。</p><p> My family has owned the island since the early 2000s, when my father built a small cabin pinned to rock on the southern end, facing the bell buoy and open sea. The land is 500 feet across at its widest part—it takes me three minutes to run a lap of the narrow perimeter trail. Only a half-mile from the mainland, the little stand of spruce trees, overgrown with lichen and smelling of bitter peat, feels ancient, totally apart. The rest is rocks.</p><p>我的家族从21世纪初就拥有了这个岛，当时我父亲在岛的南端建了一座钉在岩石上的小木屋，面对着钟形浮标和开阔的大海。这片土地最宽处有500英尺--我在这条狭窄的小径上跑一圈需要3分钟。离大陆只有半英里远的地方，这片云杉林长满了地衣，散发着苦味泥炭的味道，给人一种古老的、完全不同的感觉。剩下的都是石头。</p><p> At the cabin, rainwater is collected on a roof tank and pumped by hand to the kitchen sink; a solar panel runs the lights. I had cell service and an old propane stove, lit with a match, that puffed and startled me every time. No internet, but I was used to that—I grew up without TV, and I’ve never had a smartphone. When I arrived, there were newspapers stacked by the woodstove and a chest fridge I filled with produce bruised by the kayak ride. One day I brought a pair of rock crabs home for dinner, only to spend the passage across the channel anxiously listening to them wrestle between my knees.</p><p>在机舱，雨水被收集在屋顶水箱上，然后用手抽到厨房的水槽里；太阳能电池板控制着灯光。我得到了手机服务和一个用火柴点燃的旧丙烷炉，每次都让我喷出一口气，吓了一跳。没有互联网，但我已经习惯了--我从小就没有电视，也从来没有过智能手机。当我到达的时候，有堆在柴炉旁的报纸，还有一个冰箱，里面装满了皮划艇上留下的伤痕累累的农产品。有一天，我带了两只岩蟹回家吃晚饭，结果却在海峡对岸焦急地听着它们在我的膝盖间摔跤。</p><p> “This is not our life on hold,”  I’d texted a friend as  the prospect of returning to school in the fall became increasingly uncertain. “This is our life .”  Over the summer, I was determined not to join my peers for a déjà vu routine of odd jobs and high school friends. Living at home meant being shuttled between two estranged parents who were neighbors and fellow eccentrics but refused to speak to each other. After a while, I’d start to feel eclipsed by their personalities.</p><p>当秋季返校的前景变得越来越不确定时，我给一位朋友发短信说：“这不是我们的生活。”“这是我们的生活。”整个夏天，我决定不再和我的同龄人一起打零工、交高中朋友，这是一种似曾相识的套路。住在家里意味着往返于两个疏远的父母之间，他们是邻居，也是其他古怪的人，但拒绝和对方说话。过了一段时间，我开始觉得他们的性格让我黯然失色。</p><p> If I was going to be lonely, I decided, then let me be lonely.  Six feet required between me and the next person? Make that half a mile of open water that was cold, foggy, and sometimes too windy to cross. I’d lived in Maine my whole life, grown up on a large, populated island off  Portland, and ridden the ferry every morning to school, but I’d never experienced lobstering, a thing that felt essential to Maine identity. The smell of bait was familiar, but I’d never had to wash it off my hands.</p><p>如果我要孤独，我决定，那就让我孤独吧。我和下一个人之间需要六英尺吗？让那半英里的开阔水域变得寒冷、多雾，有时风太大而无法穿越。我在缅因州生活了一辈子，在波特兰附近一个人口稠密的大岛上长大，每天早上乘渡轮上学，但我从未体验过龙虾，这是缅因州身份认同的关键。鱼饵的味道很熟悉，但我从来没有把它从手上洗掉。</p><p> My first day on the island, I broke spiderwebs on the trail and swept the cabin. I opened all the windows in the smaller of two bedrooms and made space for my books on a shelf. “Does 6:30 am work for you?” texted Leigh, captain of  Priceless,  the boat I would start working on the next day. “We’ve only got 45 pair to haul .” In Maine, everyone knows someone who knows a lobsterman; two weeks ago, I’d gotten Leigh’s number and called her to ask for a job. Yesterday I’d taken the earliest ferry into Portland and started the long drive north. I didn’t know what 45 pair meant, but 6:30 worked fine. I set my alarm for 4:30 and climbed into bed before the sun went down.</p><p>我在岛上的第一天，我在小径上折断了蜘蛛网，清扫了小屋。我打开了两间卧室中较小一间的所有窗户，在书架上腾出空间放我的书。“早上6：30你方便吗？”“无价之宝”的船长利给我发短信说，我第二天就要开始工作了。“我们只有45双鞋要拖。”在缅因州，每个人都认识一个认识捕龙虾的人；两周前，我拿到了利的电话，打电话给她找工作。昨天，我搭乘最早的渡轮进入波特兰，开始了向北的长途车程。我不知道45对是什么意思，但6：30很好。我把闹钟调到了4：30，在太阳下山前爬上了床。</p><p> Lobstering is rhythm and speed. The trap comes up on the line of pot warp—the rope that runs through the water from buoy to trap—slick with algae and silt. You break it over the rail, slide it toward you, open it, unhook the old bait bag and sling in a fresh one, measure the lobsters, toss the shorts, drop the keepers in the call box, close the trap, slide it back, spin it perpendicular to the rail, race back to the bait tray, replenish the bait bag, band the claws if you have time, and then the next trap is coming over the rail and you’d better be there to catch it. Always the panic of motion and then, between strings, a reprieve to hose down the deck.</p><p>龙虾是节奏和速度。捕捉器出现在弯曲线上--从浮标到捕捉器穿过水面的绳索--漂浮着藻类和淤泥。你把它从栏杆上拆下来，滑向你，打开它，解开旧的诱饵袋，装进一个新的诱饵袋里，测量龙虾的尺寸，扔掉短裤，把饲养员扔进电话亭，合上陷阱，向后滑，让它垂直于栏杆旋转，跑回诱饵盘，补充诱饵袋，如果有时间的话，把爪子绑起来，然后下一个陷阱就会从栏杆上过来，你最好在那里抓住它。总是有惊慌失措的动作，然后，在琴弦之间，缓缓地冲下甲板。</p><p> We set over 300 traps during the time I worked for Leigh, often in fog and chop. Singles in the bay, pairs outside it, two traps to a buoy. With the gear she’d set by herself in the spring, that made 400 and some traps on a three-day rotation. Leigh’s license allowed her to fish a full 800, but that was too much to juggle with two young sons.</p><p>在我为利工作的那段时间里，我们设置了300多个陷阱，经常是在雾中和碎石中。海湾里的单打，外面成对的，浮标上有两个陷阱。加上她在春天自己设置的渔具，总共有400个陷阱和一些陷阱，每三天轮换一次。利的驾照允许她钓到整整800条鱼，但对于两个年幼的儿子来说，这实在是太多了。</p><p> Sometimes the lines got tangled, and we were forced to spend precious minutes freeing traps ensnared by a more careless fisherman or the tide. My vocabulary of curse words expanded. Over the radio, we heard the complaints, encouragements, and speculations of the boats we passed and raised a blue-gloved hand to. (“We wave to everyone,” Leigh told me. Even the guy who cut your traps last season? Even him.) The voices of other lobstermen were something like companionship on the long days we spent alone on the boat.</p><p>有时钓丝缠绕在一起，我们被迫花宝贵的几分钟来解救被更粗心的渔民或潮汐困住的陷阱。我的咒骂词汇量扩大了。通过收音机，我们听到了我们经过的船只的抱怨、鼓励和猜测，并举起了一只戴着蓝手套的手。(“我们向每个人挥手，”利告诉我。就连上一季帮你剪下陷阱的那个人也是吗？甚至是他。)。在我们独自在船上度过的漫长日子里，其他捕龙虾的人的声音就像是陪伴。</p><p>  “I tell ya, whoever’s messin’ with my traps, I’m gonna fuckin’ kill ya.”</p><p>“我告诉你，不管谁在捣乱我的陷阱，我他妈的都会杀了你。”</p><p>    There was pride in this work that I’d never felt before, in the self-reliance of it, in the wealth of knowledge Leigh held about all things that moved the sea to surge or settle, and in the understanding that every lobster you set your hands to was more money earned for the boat. Leigh herself was sturdy and proud. Five feet tall and a staunch believer in sunscreen, she wore men’s clothing and silver hoops in her ears. Originally from Connecticut, she worked one summer on a whale-watching boat in  Bar Harbor, saw the lobstermen, and thought: I want to do that, that looks real.</p><p>在这份工作中有一种我以前从未感受到的骄傲，在它的自力更生中，在利掌握的关于推动海浪涌动或定居的一切事物的知识财富中，在理解你接触到的每一只龙虾都能为这艘船赚到更多的钱的时候，我感到了前所未有的自豪。利本人也是健壮而自豪的。她身高五英尺，是防晒霜的坚定信徒，穿着男装，耳朵上戴着银色的耳环。她来自康涅狄格州，有一年夏天，她在巴尔港(Bar Harbor)的一艘观鲸船上工作，看到了捕龙虾的人，就想：我也想这么做，那看起来很真实。</p><p>  Besides Leigh, I had no friends, nobody to talk to. When I walked from her boat wharf to the co-op, a sort of lobstermen’s union where members sell their catch and buy bait, a man blocked the door.</p><p>除了利，我没有朋友，没有人可以交谈。当我从她的船码头走到合作社时，一名男子把门堵上了。合作社是一种龙虾渔民工会，会员可以在那里出售渔获物并购买鱼饵。</p><p> “Can I pick up some oil pants and gloves?” I asked. “I’m going sternman for Leigh.”</p><p>“我能买些油裤和手套吗？”我问过了。“我要为利做斯特恩曼。”</p><p> He grunted. I decided to take this as a yes. From the top of the stairs, he watched me, arms crossed, as I made my way to the supply room and rifled nervously through the vinyl gloves, trying to find some that were small enough.</p><p>他咕哝着。我决定把这当作是肯定的。他从楼梯顶端看着我，双臂交叉，看着我走向供应室，紧张地翻看着乙烯基手套，试图找到一些足够小的手套。</p><p>    “I can’t do that, come back later,” he said tersely, so I left and hurried back to Leigh. I was sweating.</p><p>“我不能那样做，晚点再来，”他简短地说，于是我离开了，匆匆回到利那里。我汗流浃背。</p><p>  “Yeah, but the man who was there wouldn’t let me pay.”</p><p>“是的，但当时在场的那个人不让我付钱。”</p><p> “Go back when Claire’s there, she can put it on the account.”</p><p>“克莱尔在的时候回去，她可以把钱记在账上。”</p><p>  “He didn’t give you a hard time, did he? What’d he look like?”</p><p>“他没有让你难堪，是吗？”他长什么样？“。</p><p> Sixties, I guessed, trim, with white hair cut short, a clean, long-sleeved T-shirt under a dirty, short-sleeved one.</p><p>我猜，60多岁，修剪整齐，剪了短发，干净的长袖T恤和肮脏的短袖T恤。</p><p> “Oh, that’s Sam,” she said, frowning. “Total asshole. You let me know if he gives you a hard time.”</p><p>“哦，那是山姆，”她皱着眉头说。“彻头彻尾的混蛋。如果他让你难堪，你要让我知道。“。</p><p> It would be a while before I saw him smile, but when I did, I’d see stained and broken teeth.</p><p>我要过一段时间才能看到他微笑，但当我微笑的时候，我会看到沾满污渍和破碎的牙齿。</p><p> The first three weeks, it was foggy nearly every day, often so thick that I couldn’t see the water from the house. I kayaked from the landing on the north side of the island to the harbor each morning in a sweatshirt hacked off at the elbows, a spray skirt stretched tight over my  Carhartts. It took me about 15 minutes.</p><p>最初的三个星期，几乎每天都有雾，常常很厚，以至于我看不到房子里的水。每天早上，我都会穿着一件肘部剪掉的运动衫，穿着一条喷雾裙子，紧贴在我的Carhartts上，从岛北侧的平台上划着皮划艇去港口。我花了大约15分钟。</p><p> There was a light under the pitch of the co-op roof that shone all night, and in the very early morning I would follow it through the fog until I smelled diesel. Usually, the sun just finished rising as I reached the harbor, where 40-odd lobster boats were moored and wharfs heaped with traps jutted out into the little protected bay. Leigh met me at her wharf, where she’d park her truck and I’d leave my kayak, and we crammed together into the punt, which she paddled standing up. Following an unspoken agreement, we always kept quiet until the boat’s engine was on. Then the mooring pennant splashed, and our day began.</p><p>合作公寓的屋顶下面有一盏灯通宵亮着，一大早我就跟着灯穿过雾气，直到闻到一股柴油味。通常，当我到达港口时，太阳刚刚升起，那里停泊着40多艘龙虾船，码头上堆满了陷阱，伸向受保护的小海湾。利在她的码头接我，她把卡车停在那里，我离开我的皮划艇，我们一起挤进平底船，她站着划着划船。按照一个不成文的协议，我们总是保持沉默，直到船的引擎开动。然后系泊旗帜溅起水花，我们的一天开始了。</p><p> We finished hauling by 1 or 2 P.M., then I’d paddle home. I stripped down to my underwear, hung my clothes outside, and scrubbed my forearms raw with a Scotch-Brite and dish soap, but the smell of bait still followed me everywhere. Nobody ever asked me how my day was. It would have been a hard question to answer anyway. My feet hurt. I never sat down, I hardly had time to eat. My arms weren’t strong enough, so I used my back. I got seasick. I got sun poisoning. Scrapes on my arms became infected from the rusty metal of the traps. Leigh and I peed on the floor and washed it out through the scuppers, along with seaweed, bait grease, and lobster bands. How was my day? I loved it.</p><p>下午1点或2点，我们把车拖完了，然后我就划船回家。我光着身子只穿内裤，把衣服挂在外面，用苏格兰布瑞特香皂和洗碗皂擦洗前臂，但诱饵的气味仍然随处可见。从来没有人问过我今天过得怎么样。无论如何，这都是一个很难回答的问题。我的脚很疼。我从来没有坐下来，几乎没有时间吃饭。我的胳膊不够强壮，所以我用我的背部。我晕船了。我被太阳晒伤了。我手臂上的擦伤被捕捉器生锈的金属感染了。利和我在地板上撒尿，然后通过排水孔把它冲了出来，还有海藻、鱼饵油和龙虾带。我今天过得怎么样？我爱死它了。</p><p> When I wasn’t working, I read. Discovered  Ruth Moore, a Maine islander writing about Maine islanders in the mid-1900s. “That was the place that you were homesick for, even when you were there,” she wrote of Maine in her novel   The Weir . That sentence echoed in my head all day. I gave up on  Moby-Dick and plunged instead into   Ahab’s Wife,  Sena Jeter Naslund’s  novel, built off a brief reference to one of the only women mentioned in Melville’s epic. The reason sailors wore gold, I learned in the book, was to cover the cost of a burial—their own. That way, if they washed up on foreign shores, their debts were paid, even in death. But they chose to carry beauty, adornment, rather than coins. Which would you see first, I wondered, the body or that flash of gold? I thought of the wildflowers on my deck, flimsy and defiant in the fog. Maybe they really would have served me better than a bilge pump if I’d been blown to Portugal.</p><p>当我不工作的时候，我看书。发现了缅因州岛民露丝·摩尔(Ruth Moore)，她在20世纪中期撰写了关于缅因州岛民的文章。她在小说“堰”中提到缅因州时说：“那是你想家的地方，即使你在那里的时候也是如此。”那句话整天回荡在我的脑海里。我放弃了《白鲸》，转而沉浸在亚哈的妻子塞纳·杰特·纳斯伦德的小说中，这部小说简短地提到了梅尔维尔史诗中唯一提到的一个女人。我在书中了解到，水手佩戴黄金的原因是为了支付葬礼的费用--他们自己的。这样，如果他们被冲上外国海岸，他们的债务就会得到偿还，即使是在死亡的情况下也是如此。但他们选择携带美丽、装饰品，而不是硬币。我在想，你首先看到的是身体还是那道金色的闪光？我想起了我甲板上的野花，它们在雾中脆弱而顽强。如果我被吹到葡萄牙，也许它们真的会比舱底泵对我更有用。</p><p>  At the end of each day, we unloaded our catch at the co-op. Sam and two boys my age slid it onto the dock, weighed it, and sent it up to the storage room, where seawater drizzled over the lobster cars—floating crates with slits in the sides and folding tops—and the air smelled of ammonia and the tangy, oily scent of fish. A big man with a beard sped around on a forklift and sent down buckets of bait. He never stopped laughing. (“I think it’s a nervous tick,” Leigh whispered. “That man’s life just isn’t that funny.”) One of the boys, tall, with shaggy dark hair, chattered about the weather. The other boy didn’t talk much, but he’d smile at us around his cigarette. I was curious about them.</p><p>每天结束时，我们都会在合作社卸货。山姆和两个和我同龄的男孩把它滑到码头上，称了重，然后送到储藏室，海水洒在龙虾车上--漂浮的板条箱边上有缝隙，顶部可以折叠--空气中弥漫着氨气和浓烈的鱼腥味。一个留着胡子的大个子骑着叉车飞驰而下，扔下了一桶桶的鱼饵。他笑个不停。(“我想这是紧张的扁虱，”利低声说。“那个人的生活就是没那么好笑。”)。其中一个男孩个子高大，留着蓬乱的黑发，喋喋不休地谈论天气。另一个男孩话不多，但他会围着香烟对我们微笑。我对他们很好奇。</p><p> “Like, where do they live, Leigh? Do they live at home? What about in the winter, aren’t they lonely and bored?” I immediately felt bad for asking. And for being from a place where college was expected, rather than a rare exception. “I wish I knew their names,” I said.</p><p>“比如，他们住在哪里，利？”他们住在家里吗？那冬天呢，他们不是又寂寞又无聊吗？“。当我问起这件事时，我立刻感到难受。也感谢他来自一个应该上大学的地方，而不是一个罕见的例外。“我希望我知道他们的名字，”我说。</p><p> I’d come here, I realized, to keep my loneliness company. Because there was something in me that craved the open horizon, was smoothed by wind and sound and the cold, restless leap of fear. Was my life any different because I woke up each morning alone? Don’t we always wake alone?</p><p>我意识到，我来这里是为了陪伴我的孤独。因为我心中有一种渴望开阔的地平线的东西，被风和声音以及寒冷、不安的恐惧所抚平。因为我每天早上独自一人醒来，我的生活有什么不同吗？我们不是总是独自醒来吗？</p><p> “The cure for loneliness is solitude,” Marianne Moore once wrote . My mind fetched up on that and stuck. At college the first time around, in a city, I felt homeless. There I needed some sort of barrier between me and the world—I couldn’t daydream while crossing the street, I had to look both ways. I met people all day long, but I felt myself receding. Following a need I couldn’t articulate, once that semester I biked 30 miles just to taste salt water. Chest-deep in the ocean, elbows pinched in at the hips, I felt the edge of myself. Thought, Never again will I live someplace where I can’t walk in the middle of the road.</p><p>玛丽安·摩尔(Marianne Moore)曾写道：“孤独是治疗孤独的良方。”我的脑海里浮现出这一点，然后就停住了。第一次上大学的时候，在城市里，我感到无家可归。在那里，我需要某种屏障来隔开我和这个世界--我不能在过马路时做白日梦，我必须向两边看。我整天都在和人打交道，但我觉得自己在退缩。有一次，在那个学期，我骑了30英里的自行车，只是为了品尝咸水，这让我有一次无法用语言表达自己的需求。在齐胸深的大海中，肘部收紧在臀部，我感觉到了自己的边缘。我想，我再也不会住在一个我不能走在马路中央的地方了。</p><p> How close, I wondered, does another person get to us, and how often? Rarely, someone makes it to the shoreline; a few times in a lifetime, maybe they duck branches, scrape the tangled center. And me? I walked the interior trails of my little island quickly, preferred the rocks. I liked their pink foreheads combed over with seaweed, the thorny meadow where I stained my fingers in blackberry juice and blood. Had I made any mark on this place, or would the island close around my absence, complete?</p><p>我想知道，另一个人离我们有多近，多久一次？很少有人能到达海岸线；一生中有几次，他们可能会躲过树枝，刮掉缠绕在一起的中心。那我呢？我很快地沿着我的小岛的内部小径走了一圈，我更喜欢岩石。我喜欢用海藻梳理它们粉红色的额头，在多刺的草地上，我把手指染上了黑莓汁和血。我是否在这个地方留下了什么印记，或者我不在的这座小岛会不会全部关闭？</p><p> For some reason, or no reason at all, Sam started being nicer. Leigh thought he was trying to embarrass me, but I wasn’t sure.</p><p>出于某种原因，或者根本没有原因，山姆开始变得更友善了。雷认为他是想让我难堪，但我不确定。</p><p> “I don’t know anyone to be embarrassed in front of,” I pointed out.</p><p>我指出：“我不知道有谁会在面前难堪。”</p><p>  “Hi, Luna!” he’d yell whenever he saw me, which was often, since I had to kayak past the co-op to go in or out of the harbor.</p><p>“嗨，露娜！”每当他看到我，他就会大叫，这是经常的，因为我必须划着皮划艇经过合作社才能进出港口。</p><p>  Mornings were my favorite part of living on the island, besides fishing. They were also the only time I didn’t smell like bait. I guess my skin absorbed the last of it in my sleep. I liked to wake up with the stars and make breakfast while the sky turned blue. I scattered seed on the granite that was my front yard, and a pair of mourning doves started joining me. I imagined confiding in them. I want to scrub my life clean, to see if, underneath it all, I have anything that shines. But I’m afraid to weigh my worth. The doves wouldn’t understand that, they were light. And lived from dawn to dawn, and mated for life. They’d fly away as the sky turned pink and gray, the colors of their feathers, and I’d follow them down the trail to the dock.</p><p>除了钓鱼，早晨是我在岛上生活中最喜欢的部分。那也是我唯一一次闻起来不像诱饵。我猜我的皮肤在睡梦中吸收了最后一丝。我喜欢在天空变蓝的时候，和星星一起醒来，做早餐。我把种子撒在我前院的花岗岩上，一对哀悼的鸽子开始加入我的行列。我想象着向他们吐露心声。我想把我的生活洗得干干净净，看看在这一切的背后，我有没有什么闪亮的东西。但我不敢衡量我的价值。鸽子不会明白的，它们很轻。从黎明一直活到黎明，终生交配。当天空变成粉色和灰色时，它们会飞走，它们羽毛的颜色，我会跟着它们沿着小径一直到码头。</p><p> “Leigh,” I asked as we cleaned up for the day, “why’d you name your boat  Priceless?”</p><p>“利，”我问道，“为什么你要把你的船命名为无价之宝？”</p><p> She stopped for a moment to wipe her forehead on a shirt sleeve. “Well, it’s like this,” she said. “The price is bad right now, right, but still, the job’s priceless, the boat’s priceless, my kids are priceless. Guess it’s a way of saying my life is priceless, even when it’s priced.”</p><p>她停了一会儿，用衬衫袖子擦了擦额头。“嗯，是这样的，”她说。“现在的价格很低，对吧，但尽管如此，这份工作是无价的，船是无价的，我的孩子是无价的。”我想这是在说我的生命是无价的，即使它是标价的。“。</p><p> “Anyway,” she added, “it’s better than  Whiskey Girl—that was my last boat.”</p><p>“不管怎么说，”她补充道，“这比威士忌女孩好多了--那是我最后一艘船了。”</p><p> Days when the clouds were high and close and the sun warm, I lay on the rocks and read. Time passed strangely that way, in leaps and chunks. Sometimes I fell asleep so long that the tide rose and the ocean sneezed on me. I’d run back in the house then, light a fire and turn the radio on, and the fog would roll in again as I cooked dinner.</p><p>在乌云密布、阳光温暖的日子里，我躺在岩石上看书。时间就是这样过得很奇怪，一飞冲天。有时我睡得太久，以至于潮水上涨，大海向我打喷嚏。然后我跑回屋里，生起一堆火，打开收音机，当我做饭的时候，雾又卷土重来。</p><p> “Life is good,” Leigh told me one day on the boat. “Life is funny.” She paused, reconsidered. “Life is  good. Shit, I shouldn’t say that, something’s gonna break.”</p><p>一天，利在船上对我说：“生活是美好的。”“生活很有趣。”她停顿了一下，重新考虑了一下。“生活是美好的。妈的，我不该这么说，有东西要碎了。“。</p><p> One weekend in July, my mother visited. I made pasta with mussels from the tidepool, and we cracked our teeth on tiny pearls.</p><p>七月的一个周末，我母亲来看我。我用潮汐塘里的贻贝做了意大利面，我们咬着小小的珍珠裂开了牙齿。</p><p>  As the summer waned and we pulled up at the co-op for the last time, it was business as usual. We passed the heavy lobster car onto the dock and got an empty one back. I dumped a new bucket of bait into the tray and winced as brown juice splattered my face. Leigh and I each raised a hand in thanks and shoved off.</p><p>夏天过去了，我们最后一次把车停在合作公寓里，一切照旧。我们经过一辆沉重的龙虾车上了码头，回来的是一辆空龙虾车。我往托盘里倒了一桶新的鱼饵，棕色的果汁溅到了我的脸上，我不由得退缩了。利和我各自举起手表示感谢，然后离开了。</p><p> “I’ll miss you, Luna!” Sam called as we passed. I kept on scrubbing the deck, trying not to smile. Then, suddenly, I turned and shouted back, “I’ll miss you too, Sam!” Because it was true.</p><p>“露娜，我会想你的！”我们经过时，山姆打来电话。我不停地擦洗甲板，尽量不笑。然后，突然，我转过身，大声喊道：“我也会想你的，山姆！”因为这是真的。</p><p> He swung our car onto the scale, pretending not to hear. Leigh caught the mooring, and we rowed to shore.</p><p>他把我们的车摇到磅秤上，假装没听见。利抓住了系泊处，我们划到了岸边。</p><p> I’m home now, and summer is waning, a good book I read and reread and dread reaching the end. Texts from friends: “I got this teapot for the house”, “Jill can we drive to your place and go apple-picking? ” My uncle’s visiting, wants to know about lobstering. I should tell him I’m not afraid anymore. I learned the heft of my heart with the weight of the trap, and I carried that load alone. I want to say that loneliness is better in the morning than a cup of coffee. That it wakes you, makes everything after sweet. That for now, I’ve leveled my debt.</p><p>我现在回家了，夏天就要过去了，一本好书我读了又读，害怕读到最后。朋友发来的短信：“我给家里买了这个茶壶”，“吉尔，我们能开车去你家摘苹果吗？”我叔叔来了，他想知道关于龙虾的事。我应该告诉他我不再害怕了。我明白了陷阱的重量让我的心有多重，我独自一人扛着这重担。我想说，早晨的寂寞比一杯咖啡要好。它唤醒你，让一切变得甜蜜。就目前而言，我已经还清了我的债务。</p><p> But I don’t. “When I think about it,” I tell him, “there’s one day I remember.”</p><p>但我不知道。“当我回想起这件事的时候，”我告诉他，“有一天我记起来了。”</p><p> We were fishing outside the islands, so we started early. I beat the mourning doves to breakfast, and the air was cold and very dark blue when I left. I shut the door softly, even though there was no one to wake. Leigh picked me up at the landing, a treat, and the sun was just rising as we motored past the islands, big green stones skipped from the mouth of the bay. It was, as Leigh would say, a beauty day. The sea shone like one of my mother’s pans after she’d taken steel wool to it, the sun a yellow lump of butter melting out.</p><p>我们在岛外钓鱼，所以很早就出发了。我赶在哀悼的鸽子前面吃早饭，当我离开的时候，空气很冷，而且是非常深蓝色的。尽管没有人叫醒，我还是轻轻地关上了门。雷在平台上接了我，作为款待，太阳刚刚升起，我们骑着摩托车经过这些岛屿，巨大的绿色石头从海湾的入口处跳了出来。正如利所说，这是美丽的一天。大海闪闪发光，就像我母亲把钢丝棉拿到锅里后的一个锅一样，太阳像一块黄油融化了。</p><p> The fishing was good that day, the white plastic tank mostly full and the herring down to dregs in the bait tray. I was tired from pulling pairs and from being two miles offshore, nausea flooding in and out with the low, rolling seas. Near the end of our last string, a tiny silver fish flopped onto the rail. We stopped, amazed. It looked like a herring, like bait, except it was small and perfect, barely the length of my pinky. “An anchovy,” Leigh said. We stared at it too long. By the time we threw it back, it was motionless, maybe dead. It had been so luminous and bright, the prettiest thing. For some reason, I felt sad. Felt like this whole hard thing had been worth it just to see that little fish. I shook myself, stuffed a bait bag hurriedly. Next to me, Leigh was speeding toward the last pair, fish forgotten.</p><p>那天的钓鱼很不错，白色塑料鱼缸里几乎装满了鱼，钓饵盘里的鲱鱼只剩下渣了。我已经厌倦了拖拖拉拉，在离岸两英里远的地方，恶心地随着波涛汹涌的海浪进进出出。最后一根绳子快结束的时候，一条银色的小鱼扑通一声掉到栏杆上。我们停了下来，惊讶不已。它看起来像鲱鱼，像鱼饵，只不过它又小又完美，只有我的小指那么长。“一条凤尾鱼，”利说。我们盯着它看了太久。当我们把它扔回去的时候，它已经一动不动了，可能已经死了。它是如此明亮明亮，是最漂亮的东西。出于某种原因，我感到很难过。我觉得光是为了看那条小鱼这整个艰难的事情都是值得的。我颤抖着，匆匆塞进了一个诱饵袋。在我旁边，利正朝最后一条鱼飞驰而去，鱼都忘了。</p><p> “This is the one we’ve been looking for all day!” she joked, and I smiled, bracing my knees against the gunnel in the swell. Leigh gaffed the buoy and opened the throttle on the hauler, the little anchovy just a glimmer now as it drifted past our stern. In the rumpled green water, the line from the deep ran straight.</p><p>“这就是我们找了一整天的人！”她开玩笑说，我笑了，用膝盖抵住潮水中的枪炮。利出了浮标，打开了拖船上的油门，这条小凤尾鱼漂过我们的船尾时，现在只剩下一丝微光了。在波涛汹涌的绿水中，那条从深水中划出的线是笔直的。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/2418783/my-priceless-summer-maine-lobster-boat">https://www.outsideonline.com/2418783/my-priceless-summer-maine-lobster-boat</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/无价/">#无价</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/summer/">#summer</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/龙虾/">#龙虾</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
