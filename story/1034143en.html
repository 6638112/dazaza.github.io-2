It drives my brothers crazy. My loving friends think I am crazy. They think that I can’t mean what I say; that I haven’t thought clearly about this, because there is so much in the world to see and do. To convince me of my errors, they enumerate the myriad people I know who are over 75 and doing quite well. They are certain that as I get closer to 75, I will push the desired age back to 80, then 85, maybe even 90.</p><p>这种偏好让我的女儿们发疯。这让我的兄弟们都快疯了。我亲爱的朋友们认为我疯了。他们认为我说的不是真心话，我没有想清楚这一点，因为世界上有太多的东西要看，要做的事太多了。为了让我相信我的错误，他们列举了我认识的无数75岁以上的人，他们过得很好。他们确信，当我接近75岁时，我会把理想的年龄推回80岁，然后是85岁，甚至90岁。</p><p> I am sure of my position. Doubtless, death is a loss. It deprives us of experiences and milestones, of time spent with our spouse and children. In short, it deprives us of all the things we value.</p><p>我对我的立场很有把握。毫无疑问，死亡是一种损失。它剥夺了我们的经历和里程碑，剥夺了与配偶和孩子在一起的时间。简而言之，它剥夺了我们所有珍视的东西。</p><p> But here is a simple truth that many of us seem to resist: living too long is also a loss. It renders many of us, if not disabled, then faltering and declining, a state that may not be worse than death but is nonetheless deprived. It robs us of our creativity and ability to contribute to work, society, the world. It transforms how people experience us, relate to us, and, most important, remember us. We are no longer remembered as vibrant and engaged but as feeble, ineffectual, even pathetic.</p><p>但这里有一个我们很多人似乎都抵制的简单事实：活得太久也是一种损失。它使我们中的许多人，即使不是残疾，也会步履蹒跚和衰落，一种可能不会比死亡更糟糕但仍然被剥夺的状态。它剥夺了我们的创造力和为工作、社会、世界做出贡献的能力。它改变了人们对我们的体验，与我们的关系，最重要的是，记住了我们。在人们的记忆中，我们不再是充满活力和投入的人，而是软弱、无能、甚至可悲的人。</p><p>  By the time I reach 75, I will have lived a complete life. I will have loved and been loved. My children will be grown and in the midst of their own rich lives. I will have seen my grandchildren born and beginning their lives. I will have pursued my life’s projects and made whatever contributions, important or not, I am going to make. And hopefully, I will not have too many mental and physical limitations. Dying at 75 will not be a tragedy. Indeed, I plan to have my memorial service before I die. And I don’t want any crying or wailing, but a warm gathering filled with fun reminiscences, stories of my awkwardness, and celebrations of a good life. After I die, my survivors can have their own memorial service if they want—that is not my business.</p><p>到我75岁的时候，我将过上完整的生活。我会一直爱着，也会被爱着。我的孩子们将会长大，在他们自己的富裕生活中。我将看到我的孙子们出生并开始他们的生活。我将追求我一生的事业，做出任何贡献，无论重要与否，我都会做出贡献。希望我不会有太多的精神和身体上的限制。75岁去世不会是悲剧。事实上，我计划在死前举行追悼会。我不想要任何哭泣或哀号，而是一个充满乐趣回忆、尴尬故事和对美好生活的庆祝的温暖聚会，我想要的是一场温暖的聚会，里面充满了有趣的回忆、关于我尴尬的故事和对美好生活的庆祝。在我死后，如果我的幸存者愿意的话，他们可以举行自己的追悼会--这不关我的事。</p><p> Let me be clear about my wish. I’m neither asking for more time than is likely nor foreshortening my life. Today I am, as far as my physician and I know, very healthy, with no chronic illness. I just climbed Kilimanjaro with two of my nephews. So I am not talking about bargaining with God to live to 75 because I have a terminal illness. Nor am I talking about waking up one morning 18 years from now and ending my life through euthanasia or suicide. Since the 1990s, I have actively opposed legalizing euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide. People who want to die in one of these ways tend to suffer not from unremitting pain but from depression, hopelessness, and fear of losing their dignity and control. The people they leave behind inevitably feel they have somehow failed. The answer to these symptoms is not ending a life but getting help. I have long argued that we should focus on giving all terminally ill people a good, compassionate death—not euthanasia or assisted suicide for a tiny minority.</p><p>让我把我的愿望说清楚。我既不会要求更多的时间，也不会缩短我的生命。今天，据我和我的医生所知，我非常健康，没有慢性病。我刚和两个侄子一起爬乞力马扎罗山。所以，我不是在和上帝讨价还价，让我活到75岁，因为我得了绝症。我也不是说18年后的某天早上醒来，然后通过安乐死或自杀结束我的生命。自上世纪90年代以来，我一直积极反对安乐死合法化和医生协助自杀。想要以这种方式死去的人往往不会遭受无休止的痛苦，而是会遭受抑郁、绝望以及对失去尊严和控制力的恐惧。他们留下的人不可避免地会觉得自己不知何故失败了。这些症状的答案不是结束生命，而是寻求帮助。长期以来，我一直主张，我们应该把重点放在给所有身患绝症的人一个美好的、富有同情心的死亡上，而不是给极少数人实施安乐死或协助自杀。</p><p>  I am talking about how long I  want to live and the kind and amount of health care I will consent to after 75. Americans seem to be obsessed with exercising, doing mental puzzles, consuming various juice and protein concoctions, sticking to strict diets, and popping vitamins and supplements, all in a valiant effort to cheat death and prolong life as long as possible. This has become so pervasive that it now defines a cultural type: what I call the American immortal.</p><p>我说的是我想活多久，以及75岁以后我愿意接受的医疗保健的种类和数量。美国人似乎痴迷于锻炼，玩智力游戏，喝各种果汁和蛋白质混合物，坚持严格的饮食，服用维生素和补充剂，所有这些都是为了逃避死亡，尽可能延长寿命。这已经变得如此普遍，以至于现在它定义了一种文化类型：我所说的美国不朽。</p><p> I reject this aspiration. I think this manic desperation to endlessly extend life is misguided and potentially destructive. For many reasons, 75 is a pretty good age to aim to stop.</p><p>我拒绝这个愿望。我认为这种无休止地延长寿命的狂热绝望是被误导的，而且具有潜在的破坏性。出于许多原因，75岁是一个相当好的目标，可以停下来。</p><p>  What are those reasons? Let’s begin with demography. We are growing old, and our older years are not of high quality. Since the mid-19th century, Americans have been living longer. In 1900, the life expectancy of an average American at birth was approximately 47 years. By 1930, it was 59.7; by 1960, 69.7; by 1990, 75.4. Today, a newborn can expect to live about 79 years. (On average, women live longer than men. In the United States, the gap is about five years. According to the National Vital Statistics Report, life expectancy for American males born in 2011 is 76.3, and for females it is 81.1.)</p><p>这些原因是什么？让我们从人口统计学开始。我们正在变老，我们的老年生活质量不高。自19世纪中叶以来，美国人的寿命越来越长。1900年，美国人出生时的平均预期寿命约为47岁。到1930年，这一数字为59.7；到1960年，这一数字为69.7；到1990年，这一数字为75.4。如今，新生儿的预期寿命约为79岁。(平均而言，女性比男性长寿。在美国，这一差距约为五年。根据《国家生命统计报告》，2011年出生的美国男性的预期寿命为76.3岁，女性为81.1岁。)。</p><p> In the early part of the 20th century, life expectancy increased as vaccines, antibiotics, and better medical care saved more children from premature death and effectively treated infections. Once cured, people who had been sick largely returned to their normal, healthy lives without residual disabilities. Since 1960, however, increases in longevity have been achieved mainly by extending the lives of people over 60. Rather than saving more young people, we are stretching out old age.</p><p>在20世纪初，随着疫苗、抗生素和更好的医疗保健使更多的儿童免于过早死亡和有效治疗感染，人们的预期寿命增加了。一旦治愈，患病的人基本上恢复了正常、健康的生活，没有残留的残疾。然而，自1960年以来，寿命的延长主要是通过延长60岁以上的人的寿命来实现的。我们没有拯救更多的年轻人，而是在延年益寿。</p><p>  The American immortal desperately wants to believe in the “compression of morbidity.” Developed in 1980 by James F. Fries, now a professor emeritus of medicine at Stanford, this theory postulates that as we extend our life spans into the 80s and 90s, we will be living healthier lives—more time before we have disabilities, and fewer disabilities overall. The claim is that with longer life, an ever smaller proportion of our lives will be spent in a state of decline.</p><p>这位美国神仙拼命地想要相信“压缩发病率”。这一理论由詹姆斯·F·弗莱斯(James F.Fries)于1980年提出，他现在是斯坦福大学(Stanford)的医学荣休教授。该理论假设，随着我们的寿命延长到80年代和90年代，我们将过上更健康的生活--在我们出现残疾之前有更长的时间，总体上残疾也会更少。这种说法是，随着寿命的延长，我们生命中处于衰退状态的比例将越来越小。</p><p> Compression of morbidity is a quintessentially American idea. It tells us exactly what we want to believe: that we will live longer lives and then abruptly die with hardly any aches, pains, or physical deterioration—the morbidity traditionally associated with growing old. It promises a kind of fountain of youth until the ever-receding time of death. It is this dream—or fantasy—that drives the American immortal and has fueled interest and investment in regenerative medicine and replacement organs.</p><p>压缩发病率是典型的美国思想。它确切地告诉了我们想要相信的东西：我们会活得更长，然后突然死去，几乎没有任何疼痛、疼痛或身体退化--这是传统上与变老相关的发病率。它承诺了一种青春的源泉，直到死亡不断消逝。正是这种梦想--或者说幻想--驱使着美国人长生不老，并激发了人们对再生医学和替代器官的兴趣和投资。</p><p> But as life has gotten longer, has it gotten healthier? Is 70 the new 50?</p><p>但随着寿命的延长，它是否变得更健康了呢？70岁是新的50岁吗？</p><p>  It is true that compared with their counterparts 50 years ago, seniors today are less disabled and more mobile. But over recent decades, increases in longevity seem to have been accompanied by increases in disability—not decreases. For instance, using data from the National Health Interview Survey, Eileen Crimmins, a researcher at the University of Southern California, and a colleague assessed physical functioning in adults, analyzing whether people could walk a quarter of a mile; climb 10 stairs; stand or sit for two hours; and stand up, bend, or kneel without using special equipment. The results show that as people age, there is a progressive erosion of physical functioning. More important, Crimmins found that between 1998 and 2006, the loss of functional mobility in the elderly increased. In 1998, about 28 percent of American men 80 and older had a functional limitation; by 2006, that figure was nearly 42 percent. And for women the result was even worse: more than half of women 80 and older had a functional limitation. Crimmins’s conclusion: There was an “increase in the life expectancy with disease and a decrease in the years without disease. The same is true for functioning loss, an increase in expected years unable to function.”</p><p>诚然，与50年前的同龄人相比，今天的老年人残疾程度更低，流动性更强。但近几十年来，寿命的延长似乎伴随着残疾的增加--而不是减少。例如，南加州大学(University Of Southern California)研究员艾琳·克里明斯(Eileen Crimmins)和她的同事利用国家健康访谈调查(National Health Interview Survey)的数据，评估了成年人的身体功能，分析了人们能否在不使用特殊设备的情况下行走四分之一英里；爬10级楼梯；站立或坐两个小时；以及站立、弯曲或跪下。研究结果表明，随着年龄的增长，身体机能会逐渐衰退。更重要的是，Crimmins发现，在1998年至2006年间，老年人丧失功能活动能力的情况有所增加。1998年，在80岁及以上的美国男性中，约有28%有功能障碍；到2006年，这一数字接近42%。而对于女性来说，结果甚至更糟：超过一半的80岁及以上女性有功能障碍。克里明斯的结论是：“有病的人的预期寿命增加了，而没有病的人的寿命减少了。”功能性损失也是如此，预计无法运作的年数会增加。</p><p>  This was confirmed by a recent worldwide assessment of “healthy life expectancy” conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The researchers included not just physical but also mental disabilities such as depression and dementia. They found not a compression of morbidity but in fact an expansion—an “increase in the absolute number of years lost to disability as life expectancy rises.”</p><p>哈佛大学公共卫生学院和华盛顿大学健康指标与评估研究所最近在全球范围内进行的一项“健康预期寿命”评估证实了这一点。研究人员不仅包括身体残疾，还包括精神残疾，如抑郁症和痴呆症。他们发现不是发病率的压缩，而是实际上的扩张--“随着预期寿命的增加，因残疾而损失的绝对年数也在增加。”</p><p> How can this be? My father illustrates the situation well. About a decade ago, just shy of his 77th birthday, he began having pain in his abdomen. Like every good doctor, he kept denying that it was anything important. But after three weeks with no improvement, he was persuaded to see his physician. He had in fact had a heart attack, which led to a cardiac catheterization and ultimately a bypass. Since then, he has not been the same. Once the prototype of a hyperactive Emanuel, suddenly his walking, his talking, his humor got slower. Today he can swim, read the newspaper, needle his kids on the phone, and still live with my mother in their own house. But everything seems sluggish. Although he didn’t die from the heart attack, no one would say he is living a vibrant life. When he discussed it with me, my father said, “I have slowed down tremendously. That is a fact. I no longer make rounds at the hospital or teach.” Despite this, he also said he was happy.</p><p>这怎么可能？我父亲很好地说明了这种情况。大约十年前，就在他77岁生日的时候，他的腹部开始疼痛。像所有优秀的医生一样，他一直否认这是什么重要的事情。但三周后，病情没有好转，他被说服去看医生。事实上，他心脏病发作，这导致了心脏导管术，并最终接受了搭桥手术。从那时起，他就不再是原来的他了。伊曼纽尔曾经是一个极度活跃的原型，突然间，他的走路、说话和幽默都变慢了。今天，他会游泳，会看报纸，会给孩子们打电话，还会和我妈妈住在自己的房子里。但一切似乎都很迟缓。虽然他没有死于心脏病发作，但没有人会说他过着充满活力的生活。当他和我讨论这个问题时，我父亲说：“我已经慢了很多。这是事实。我不再在医院查房，也不再教书。“。尽管如此，他也表示自己很开心。</p><p>  As Crimmins puts it, over the past 50 years, health care hasn’t slowed the aging process so much as it has slowed the dying process. And, as my father demonstrates, the contemporary dying process has been elongated. Death usually results from the complications of chronic illness—heart disease, cancer, emphysema, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes.</p><p>正如Crimmins所说，在过去的50年里，医疗保健不仅没有减缓衰老过程，反而减缓了死亡过程。而且，正如我父亲所展示的那样，当代的死亡过程已经被拉长了。死亡通常是由慢性病的并发症引起的--心脏病、癌症、肺气肿、中风、阿尔茨海默氏症、糖尿病。</p><p> Take the example of stroke. The good news is that we have made major strides in reducing mortality from strokes. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of deaths from stroke declined by more than 20 percent. The bad news is that many of the roughly 6.8 million Americans who have survived a stroke suffer from paralysis or an inability to speak. And many of the estimated 13 million more Americans who have survived a “silent” stroke suffer from more-subtle brain dysfunction such as aberrations in thought processes, mood regulation, and cognitive functioning. Worse, it is projected that over the next 15 years there will be a 50 percent increase in the number of Americans suffering from stroke-induced disabilities. Unfortunately, the same phenomenon is repeated with many other diseases.</p><p>以中风为例。好消息是，我们在降低中风死亡率方面取得了重大进展。2000年至2010年间，死于中风的人数下降了20%以上。坏消息是，在中风中幸存下来的大约680万美国人中，有许多人瘫痪或无法说话。据估计，在“沉默的”中风中幸存下来的1300万美国人中，有许多人患有更微妙的大脑功能障碍，如思维过程、情绪调节和认知功能的异常。更糟糕的是，据预测，在接下来的15年里，美国中风导致的残疾人数将增加50%。不幸的是，许多其他疾病也出现了同样的现象。</p><p> So American immortals may live longer than their parents, but they are likely to be more incapacitated. Does that sound very desirable? Not to me.</p><p>因此，美国的永生生物可能比他们的父母活得更久，但他们更有可能丧失行为能力。这听起来很可取吗？对我来说不是。</p><p> The situation becomes of even greater concern when we confront the most dreadful of all possibilities: living with dementia and other acquired mental disabilities. Right now approximately 5 million Americans over 65 have Alzheimer’s; one in three Americans 85 and older has Alzheimer’s. And the prospect of that changing in the next few decades is not good. Numerous recent trials of drugs that were supposed to stall Alzheimer’s—much less reverse or prevent it—have failed so miserably that researchers are rethinking the whole disease paradigm that informed much of the research over the past few decades. Instead of predicting a cure in the foreseeable future, many are warning of a tsunami of dementia—a nearly 300 percent increase in the number of older Americans with dementia by 2050.</p><p>当我们面对所有可能性中最可怕的：患有痴呆症和其他后天智力残疾时，这种情况变得更加令人担忧。目前，大约有500万65岁以上的美国人患有阿尔茨海默氏症；每三个85岁及以上的美国人中就有一个患有阿尔茨海默氏症。这种情况在未来几十年内改变的前景并不乐观。最近许多本应延缓阿尔茨海默氏症的药物试验--更不用说逆转或预防了--都以惨败告终，以至于研究人员正在重新思考过去几十年里影响了大部分研究的整个疾病范式。许多人并没有预测在可预见的未来会有治愈的方法，而是警告说，到2050年，美国老年痴呆症患者的数量将增加近300%，这将引发痴呆症的海啸。</p><p>  Half of people 80 and older with functional limitations. A third of people 85 and older with Alzheimer’s. That still leaves many, many elderly people who have escaped physical and mental disability. If we are among the lucky ones, then why stop at 75? Why not live as long as possible?</p><p>80岁及以上的人中有一半有功能障碍。85岁及以上的人中有三分之一患有阿尔茨海默氏症。尽管如此，仍有许许多多的老年人逃脱了身体和精神上的残疾。如果我们是幸运儿之一，为什么要止步于75岁呢？为什么不尽可能长寿呢？</p><p>  Even if we aren’t demented, our mental functioning deteriorates as we grow older. Age-associated declines in mental-processing speed, working and long-term memory, and problem-solving are well established. Conversely, distractibility increases. We cannot focus and stay with a project as well as we could when we were young. As we move slower with age, we also think slower.</p><p>即使我们没有精神错乱，我们的精神功能也会随着年龄的增长而恶化。心理处理速度、工作记忆、长期记忆以及解决问题的能力随着年龄的增长而下降，这一点是确凿无疑的。相反，分心会增加。我们不能像年轻时那样专注并专注于一个项目。随着年龄的增长，我们移动的速度会变慢，我们的思维也会变慢。</p><p> It is not just mental slowing. We literally lose our creativity. About a decade ago, I began working with a prominent health economist who was about to turn 80. Our collaboration was incredibly productive. We published numerous papers that influenced the evolving debates around health-care reform. My colleague is brilliant and continues to be a major contributor, and he celebrated his 90th birthday this year. But he is an outlier—a very rare individual.   American immortals operate on the assumption that they will be precisely such outliers. But the fact is that by 75, creativity, originality, and productivity are pretty much gone for the vast, vast majority of us. Einstein famously said, “A person who has not made his great contribution to science before the age of 30 will never do so.” He was extreme in his assessment. And wrong. Dean Keith Simonton, at the University of California at Davis, a luminary among researchers on age and creativity, synthesized numerous studies to demonstrate a typical age-creativity curve: creativity rises rapidly as a career commences, peaks about 20 years into the career, at about age 40 or 45, and then enters a slow, age-related decline. There are some, but not huge, variations among disciplines. Currently, the average age at which Nobel Prize–winning physicists make their discovery—not get the prize—is 48. Theoretical chemists and physicists make their major contribution slightly earlier than empirical researchers do. Similarly, poets tend to peak earlier than novelists do. Simonton’s own study of classical composers shows that the typical composer writes his first major work at age 26, peaks at about age 40 with both his best work and maximum output, and then declines, writing his last significant musical composition at 52. (All the composers studied were male.)</p><p>这不仅仅是精神减速。我们真的失去了创造力。大约十年前，我开始与一位即将步入80岁的著名健康经济学家共事。我们的合作成果令人难以置信。我们发表了大量论文，影响了围绕医疗改革的不断演变的辩论。我的同事才华横溢，仍然是一位重要的贡献者，他今年庆祝了自己的90岁生日。但他是一个异类--一个非常罕见的个体。美国神仙的运作是基于这样的假设：他们就是这样的异类。但事实是，到了75岁，我们中的绝大多数人的创造力、原创性和生产力几乎都消失了。爱因斯坦曾说过一句名言：“一个在30岁之前没有对科学做出巨大贡献的人永远不会做出这样的贡献。”他的评估是极端的。而且是错的。加州大学戴维斯分校(University Of California At Davis)的院长基思·西蒙顿(Dean Keith Simonton)是年龄和创造力研究中的佼佼者，他综合了大量研究，证明了典型的年龄-创造力曲线：创造力在职业生涯开始时迅速上升，在职业生涯开始后的20年左右达到顶峰，大约在40岁或45岁时达到顶峰，然后进入缓慢的、与年龄相关的衰退。各学科之间存在一些差异，但不是很大。目前，诺贝尔奖获得者物理学家的发现(而非获奖)的平均年龄是48岁。理论化学家和物理学家的主要贡献略早于经验研究人员。同样，诗人往往比小说家更早达到巅峰。西蒙顿自己对古典作曲家的研究表明，典型的作曲家在26岁时创作了他的第一部主要作品，在40岁左右达到顶峰，同时也是他最好的作品和最大的产量，然后下降，在52岁时创作了他最后一部重要的音乐作品。(所有研究的作曲家都是男性。)。</p><p>  This age-creativity relationship is a statistical association, the product of averages; individuals vary from this trajectory. Indeed, everyone in a creative profession thinks they will be, like my collaborator, in the long tail of the curve. There are late bloomers. As my friends who enumerate them do, we hold on to them for hope. It is true, people can continue to be productive past 75—to write and publish, to draw, carve, and sculpt, to compose. But there is no getting around the data. By definition, few of us can be exceptions. Moreover, we need to ask how much of what “Old Thinkers,” as Harvey C. Lehman called them in his 1953  Age and Achievement, produce is novel rather than reiterative and repetitive of previous ideas. The age-creativity curve—especially the decline—endures across cultures and throughout history, suggesting some deep underlying biological determinism probably related to brain plasticity.</p><p>这种年龄与创造力的关系是一种统计关联，是平均值的乘积；个体与此轨迹不同。事实上，从事创意行业的每个人都认为，他们会像我的合作者一样，处于曲线的长尾位置。有一些大器晚成的人。正如我那些列举它们的朋友们所做的那样，我们抓住它们是为了希望。诚然，人们可以在75岁之后继续保持生产力--写作、出版、绘画、卡夫</p><p> We can only speculate about the biology. The connections between neurons are subject to an intense process of natural selection. The neural connections that are most heavily used are reinforced and retained, while those that are rarely, if ever, used atrophy and disappear over time. Although brain plasticity persists throughout life, we do not get totally rewired. As we age, we forge a very extensive network of connections established through a lifetime of experiences, thoughts, feelings, actions, and memories. We are subject to who we have been. It is difficult, if not impossible, to generate new, creative thoughts, because we don’t develop a new set of neural connections that can supersede the existing network. It is much more difficult for older people to learn new languages. All of those mental puzzles are an effort to slow the erosion of the neural connections we have. Once you squeeze the creativity out of the neural networks established over your initial career, they are not likely to develop strong new brain connections to generate innovative ideas—except maybe in those Old Thinkers like my outlier colleague, who happen to be in the minority endowed with superior plasticity.</p><p>我们只能推测生物学。神经元之间的联系受到强烈的自然选择过程的影响。使用最频繁的神经连接会得到加强和保留，而那些很少使用(如果有的话)的神经连接会随着时间的推移而萎缩和消失。虽然大脑的可塑性在一生中持续存在，但我们并没有完全重新连接。随着年龄的增长，我们通过一生的经历、思想、感觉、行动和记忆建立起一个非常广泛的联系网络。我们受制于我们过去的样子。产生新的、创造性的想法即使不是不可能，也是困难的，因为我们不能开发一套新的神经连接来取代现有的网络。对老年人来说，学习新语言要困难得多。所有这些脑筋急转弯都是为了减缓我们已有的神经连接的侵蚀。一旦你从你最初职业生涯中建立的神经网络中挤出创造力，它们就不太可能发展出强大的新大脑连接来产生创新想法--可能除了那些像我的异类同事这样的老思想家，他们恰好是被赋予了卓越可塑性的少数人。</p><p>  —processing, memory, problem-solving—slow at 75. Maybe creating something novel is very rare after that age. But isn’t this a peculiar obsession? Isn’t there more to life than being totally physically fit and continuing to add to one’s creative legacy?</p><p>-处理能力、记忆力、解决问题能力--75岁时反应缓慢。也许在那个时代之后，创作新奇的东西就很少了。但这难道不是一种特殊的痴迷吗？难道生活中没有比完全健康的身体和不断增加创造性遗产更重要的东西了吗？</p><p>  One university professor told me that as he has aged (he is 70) he has published less frequently, but he now contributes in other ways. He mentors students, helping them translate their passions into research projects and advising them on the balance of career and family. And people in other fields can do the same: mentor the next generation.</p><p>一位大学教授告诉我，随着年龄的增长(他70岁了)，他发表文章的频率降低了，但现在他在其他方面做出了贡献。他指导学生，帮助他们将激情转化为研究项目，并就事业和家庭的平衡向他们提供建议。其他领域的人也可以这样做：指导下一代。</p><p> Mentorship is hugely important. It lets us transmit our collective memory and draw on the wisdom of elders. It is too often undervalued, dismissed as a way to occupy seniors who refuse to retire and who keep repeating the same stories. But it also illuminates a key issue with aging: the constricting of our ambitions and expectations.</p><p>导师关系极其重要。它让我们传递集体记忆，汲取长辈的智慧。它经常被低估，被斥为占领拒绝退休和不断重复相同故事的老年人的一种方式。但它也揭示了老龄化的一个关键问题：我们的抱负和期望受到限制。</p><p> We accommodate our physical and mental limitations. Our expectations shrink. Aware of our diminishing capacities, we choose ever more restricted activities and projects, to ensure we can fulfill them. Indeed, this constriction happens almost imperceptibly. Over time, and without our conscious choice, we transform our lives. We don’t notice that we are aspiring to and doing less and less. And so we remain content, but the canvas is now tiny. The American immortal, once a vital figure in his or her profession and community, is happy to cultivate avocational interests, to take up bird watching, bicycle riding, pottery, and the like. And then, as walking becomes harder and the pain of arthritis limits the fingers’ mobility, life comes to center around sitting in the den reading or listening to books on tape and doing crossword puzzles. And then …</p><p>我们适应我们身体和精神上的限制。我们的期望值缩水了。意识到我们的能力正在减弱，我们选择了更多受限的活动和项目，以确保我们能够完成它们。事实上，这种收缩几乎是在潜移默化中发生的。随着时间的推移，在没有我们有意识的选择的情况下，我们改变了我们的生活。我们没有注意到，我们的抱负越来越大，做的越来越少。因此，我们仍然满意，但现在的画布已经很小了。这位美国神仙，曾经是他或她的职业和社区中的重要人物，现在乐于培养业余兴趣，从事观鸟、骑自行车、陶器等活动。然后，随着行走变得更困难，关节炎的疼痛限制了手指的活动能力，生活的中心就是坐在书房里看书或听磁带上的书，做填字游戏。然后是…。</p><p>  Maybe this is too dismissive. There is more to life than youthful passions focused on career and creating. There is posterity: children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p><p>或许这太轻蔑了。除了年轻时专注于事业和创造的激情，生活还有更多的东西。有后代：子孙和曾孙。</p><p> But here, too, living as long as possible has drawbacks we often won’t admit to ourselves. I will leave aside the very real and oppressive financial and caregiving burdens that many, if not most, adults in the so-called sandwich generation are now experiencing, caught between the care of children and parents. Our living too long places real emotional weights on our progeny.</p><p>但在这里，尽可能长寿也有我们常常不愿承认的缺点。我将撇开非常真实和沉重的经济和照看负担，许多(如果不是大多数)所谓的三明治一代的成年人现在正经历着夹在孩子和父母之间的困境。我们的寿命太长，给我们的后代带来了真正的情感负担。</p><p>  Unless there has been terrible abuse, no child wants his or her parents to die. It is a huge loss at any age. It creates a tremendous, unfillable hole. But parents also cast a big shadow for most children. Whether estranged, disengaged, or deeply loving, they set expectations, render judgments, impose their opinions, interfere, and are generally a looming presence for even adult children. This can be wonderful. It can be annoying. It can be destructive. But it is inescapable as long as the parent is alive. Examples abound in life and literature: Lear, the quintessential Jewish mother, the Tiger Mom. And while children can never fully escape this weight even after a parent dies, there is much less pressure to conform to parental expectations and demands after they are gone.</p><p>除非发生过可怕的虐待事件，否则没有孩子希望他或她的父母死去。这对任何年龄的人来说都是一个巨大的损失。它造成了一个巨大的、无法填补的漏洞。但父母也给大多数孩子蒙上了一层阴影。无论是疏远、疏远还是深爱，他们都会设定期望、做出判断、强加自己的观点、进行干涉，甚至对成年子女来说，他们通常也是一个隐约可见的存在。这真是太棒了。这可能会很烦人。这可能是破坏性的。但只要父母还活着，这是不可避免的。生活和文学中的例子比比皆是：典型的犹太母亲李尔，虎妈。虽然孩子们永远无法完全摆脱这种负担，即使父母去世了，但在父母去世后，满足父母的期望和要求的压力要小得多。</p><p>  Living parents also occupy the role of head of the family. They make it hard for grown children to become the patriarch or matriarch. When parents routinely live to 95, children must caretake into their own retirement. That doesn’t leave them much time on their own—and it is all old age. When parents live to 75, children have had the joys of a rich relationship with their parents, but also have enough time for their own lives, out of their parents’ shadows.</p><p>在世的父母也扮演着家长的角色。这使得成年子女很难成为家长或女家长。当父母通常活到95岁时，孩子们必须自己照顾自己的退休生活。这并没有给他们留下太多的独处时间--而且都是老年人。当父母活到75岁时，孩子们已经享受到了与父母建立丰富关系的乐趣，但也有足够的时间过自己的生活，走出父母的阴影。</p><p> But there is something even more important than parental shadowing: memories. How do we want to be remembered by our children and grandchildren? We wish our children to remember us in our prime. Active, vigorous, engaged, animated, astute, enthusiastic, funny, warm, loving. Not stooped and sluggish, forgetful and repetitive, constantly asking “What did she say?” We want to be remembered as independent, not experienced as burdens.</p><p>但还有比父母的影子更重要的东西：记忆。我们想让我们的子孙记住我们吗？我们希望我们的孩子记住我们年富力强的时候。积极、精力充沛、投入、活泼、敏锐、热情、风趣、热情、热情、有爱心。不弯腰懒散，健忘重复，不停地问“她说了什么？”我们希望被铭记为独立，而不是被视为负担。</p><p> At age 75 we reach that unique, albeit somewhat arbitrarily chosen, moment when we have lived a rich and complete life, and have hopefully imparted the right memories to our children. Living the American immortal’s dream dramatically increases the chances that we will not get our wish—that memories of vitality will be crowded out by the agonies of decline. Yes, with effort our children will be able to recall that great family vacation, that funny scene at Thanksgiving, that embarrassing faux pas at a wedding. But the most-recent years—the years with progressing disabilities and the need to make caregiving arrangements—will inevitably become the predominant and salient memories. The old joys have to </p><p>在我们75岁的时候，我们迎来了一个独特的时刻，尽管有些随意选择，我们已经过上了丰富而完整的生活，并希望能给我们的孩子留下正确的记忆。生活在美国不朽的梦想中，极大地增加了我们不能实现愿望的可能性--活力的记忆将被衰落的痛苦挤出。是的，只要努力，我们的孩子就能回忆起那美好的家庭假期，感恩节的搞笑场面，婚礼上的尴尬失态。但最近几年--残疾程度不断加重、需要安排照料的那些年--将不可避免地成为主要和突出的记忆。昔日的欢乐不得不。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/">https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/10/why-i-hope-to-die-at-75/379329/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/岁时/">#岁时</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hope/">#hope</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
