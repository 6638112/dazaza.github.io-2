It also drops support for old Qt/Pythonversions and comes with various other dependency changes.This has been a rather long release cycle - so far, feature releaseshave happened all two months or so, but v1.14.0 was released back inOctober (with a patch release in December). Thus, this release includesa *lot* of new features, bugfixes and other changes as well. It&#39;s a bigmilestone in many ways, and a lot of things changed: $ git --no-pager diff --stat v1.14.1..v2.0.0 [...] 548 files changed, 13186 insertions(+), 10871 deletions(-)Thanks to everyone involved, especially √Årni Dagur for the excellentwork on the adblocking integration!Here&#39;s the full changelog:Major changes~~~~~~~~~~~~~- If the Python `adblock` library is available, it is now used to integrate Brave&#39;s Rust adblocker library for improved adblocking based on ABP-like filter lists (such as EasyList). If it is unavailable, qutebrowser falls back to host-blocking, i.e. the same blocking technique it used before this release. As part of this, various settings got renamed, see &#34;Changed&#34; below. **Note: If the `adblock` dependency is available, qutebrowser will ignore custom host blocking** via the `blocked-hosts` config file or ` file:///` URLs supplied as host blocking lists. You will need to either migrate those to ABP-like lists, or set `content.blocking.method` to `both`.- Various dependency upgrades - a quick checklist for packagers (see &#34;Changed&#34; below for details): * Ensure you&#39;re providing at least Python 3.6.1. * Ensure you&#39;re providing at least Qt 5.12 and PyQt 5.12. * Add a new optional dependency on the Python `adblock` library (if packaged - if not, consider packaging it, albeit optional it&#39;s very useful for users). * Remove the `cssutils` optional dependency (if present). * Remove the `attrs` (`attr`) dependency. * Remove the `pypeg2` dependency (and perhaps consider dropping the package if not used elsewhere - it&#39;s  https://fdik.org/pyPEG2/[inactive upstream] and the repository was removed by Bitbucket). * Move the `pygments` dependency from required to optional. * Move the `setuptools` dependency from runtime (for `pkg_resources`) to build-time. * For Python 3.6, 3.7 or 3.8, add a dependency on the `importlib_resources` backport. * For Python 3.6 only, add a dependency on the `dataclasses` backport.- Dropped support for old OS versions in binary releases: * Support for Windows 7 is dropped in the Windows binaries, the minimum required Windows version is now Windows 8.1. * Support for macOS 10.13 High Sierra is dropped in the macOS binaries, the minimum required macOS version is now macOS 10.14 Mojave.- Various renamed settings and commands, see &#34;Deprecated&#34; and &#34;Changed&#34; below.Removed~~~~~~~- The `--enable-webengine-inspector` flag (which was only needed for Qt 5.10 and below) is now dropped. With Qt 5.11 and newer, the inspector/devtools are enabled unconditionally.- Support for moving qutebrowser data from versions before v1.0.0 has been removed.- The `--old` flag for `:config-diff` has been removed. It used to show customized options for the old pre-v1.0 config files (in order to aid migration to v1.0).- The `:inspector` command which was deprecated in v1.13.0 (in favor of `:devtools`) is now removed.Deprecated~~~~~~~~~~- Several commands have been renamed for consistency and/or easier grouping of related commands. Their old names are still available, but deprecated and will be removed in qutebrowser v2.1.0. * `run-macro` -&gt; `macro-run` * `record-macro` -&gt; `macro-record` * `buffer` -&gt; `tab-select` * `open-editor` -&gt; `edit-text` * `toggle-selection` -&gt; `selection-toggle` * `drop-selection` -&gt; `selection-drop` * `reverse-selection` -&gt; `selection-reverse` * `follow-selected` -&gt; `selection-follow` * `follow-hint` -&gt; `hint-follow` * `enter-mode` -&gt; `mode-enter` * `leave-mode` -&gt; `mode-leave`Added~~~~~- New settings for the ABP-based adblocker: * `content.blocking.method` to decide which blocker(s) should be used. * `content.blocking.adblock.lists` to configure ABP-like lists to use.- New `qt.environ` setting which makes it easier to set/unset environment variables for qutebrowser.- New settings to use an external file picker (such as ranger or vifm): * `fileselect.handler` (`default` or `external`) * `fileselect.multiple_files.command` * `fileselect.single_file.command`- When QtWebEngine has been updated but PyQtWebEngine hasn&#39;t yet, the dark mode settings might stop working. As a (currently undocumented) escape hatch, this version adds a `QUTE_DARKMODE_VARIANT=qt_515_2` environment variable which can be set to get the correct behavior in (transitive) situations like this.- New `--desktop-file-name` commandline argument, which can be used to customize the desktop filename passed to Qt (which is used to set the `app_id` on Wayland).- The `:open` completion now also completes local file paths and ` file://` URLs, via a new `filesystem` entry in `completion.open_categories`. Also, a new `completion.favorite_paths` setting was added which can be used to add paths to show when `:open` is used without any input.- New `QUTE_VERSION` variable for userscripts, which can be used to read qutebrowser&#39;s version.- New &#34;Copy URL&#34; entry in the context menu for downloads.- New `:bookmark-list` command which lists all bookmarks/quickmarks. The corresponding ` qute://bookmarks` URL already existed since v0.8.0, but it was never exposed as a command.- New `qt.workarounds.remove_service_workers` setting which can be used to remove the &#34;Service Workers&#34; directory on every start. Usage of this option is generally discouraged, except in situations where the underlying QtWebEngine bug is a known cause for crashes.- Changelogs are now shown after qutebrowser was upgraded. By default, the changelog is only shown after minor upgrades (feature releases) but not patch releases. This can be adjusted (or disabled entirely) via a new `changelog_after_upgrade` setting.- New userscripts: * `kodi` to play videos in Kodi * `qr` to generate a QR code of the current URL * `add-nextcloud-bookmarks` to create bookmarks in Nextcloud&#39;s Bookmarks app * `add-nextcloud-cookbook` to add recipes to Nextcloud&#39;s Cookbook appChanged~~~~~~~- `config.py` files now are required to have either `config.load_autoconfig(False)` (don&#39;t load `autoconfig.yml`) or `config.load_autoconfig()` (do load `autoconfig.yml`) in them.- Various host-blocking settings have been renamed to accomodate the new ABP-like adblocker: * `content.host_blocking.enabled` -&gt; `content.blocking.enabled` (controlling both blockers) * `content.host_blocking.whitelist` -&gt; `content.blocking.whitelist` (controlling both blockers) * `content.host_blocking.lists` -&gt; `content.blocking.hosts.lists`- Changes to default settings: * `tabs.background` is now `true` by default, so that new tabs get opened in the background. * `input.partial_timeout` is now set to 0 by default, so that partially typed key strings are never cleared. * `hints.leave_on_load` is now `false` by default, so that hint mode doesn&#39;t get left when a page finishes loading. This can lead to stale hints persisting in rare circumstances, but is better than leaving hint mode when the user entered it before loading was completed. * The default for `tabs.width` (tab bar width if vertical) is now 15% of the window width rather than 20%. * The default bindings for moving tabs (`tab-move -` and `tab-move +`) were changed from `gl` and `gr` to `gK` and `gJ`, to be consistent with the tab switching bindings. * The text color for warning messages is now black instead of white, for increased contrast and thus readability. * The default timeout for messages is now raised from 2s to 3s.- On the first start, the history completion database is regenerated to remove a few problematic entries (such as long ` qute://pdfjs` URLs). This might take a couple of minutes, but is a one-time operation. This should result in a performance improvement for the completion for affected users.- qutebrowser now shows an error if its history database version is newer than expected. This currently should never happen, but allows for potentially backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.- At least Python 3.6.1 is now required to run qutebrowser, support for Python 3.5 (and 3.6.0) is dropped. Note that Python 3.5 is  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3510/[no longer supported upstream] since September 2020.- At least Qt/PyQt 5.12 is now required to run qutebrowser, support for 5.7 to 5.11 (inclusive) is dropped. While Debian Buster ships Qt 5.11, it&#39;s based on a Chromium version from 2018 with  https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/amd64/release-notes/ch-information.en.html#browser-security[no Debian security support] and unsupported upstream since May 2019. It also has compatibility issues with various websites (GitHub, Twitch, Android Developer documentation, YouTube, ...). Since no newer Debian Stable is released at the time of writing, it&#39;s recommended to  https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/master/doc/install.asciidoc#installing-qutebrowser-with-virtualenv[install qutebrowser in a virtualenv] with a newer version of Qt/PyQt.- New optional dependency on the Python `adblock` library (see above for details).- The (formerly optional) `cssutils` dependency is now removed. It was only needed for improved behavior in corner cases when using `:download --mhtml` with the (non-default) QtWebKit backend, and as such it&#39;s unlikely anyone is still relying on it. The `cssutils` project is also dead upstream, with its repository being gone after Bitbucket  https://bitbucket.org/blog/sunsetting-mercurial-support-in-bitbucket[removed Mercurial support].- The (formerly required) `pygments` dependency is now optional. It is only used when using `:view-source` with QtWebKit, or when forcing it via `:view-source --pygments` on QtWebEngine. If it is unavailable, an unhighlighted fallback version of the page&#39;s source is shown.- The former runtime dependency on the `pkg_resources` module (part of the `setuptools` project) got dropped. Note that `setuptools` is still required to run `setup.py`.- A new dependency on the `importlib_resources` module got introduced for Python versions up to and including 3.8. Note that the stdlib `importlib.resources` module for Python 3.7 and 3.8 is missing the needed APIs, thus requiring the backports for those versions as well.- The former dependency on the `attrs`/`attr` package is now dropped in favour of `dataclasses` in the Python standard library. On Python 3.6, a new dependency on the `dataclasses` backport is now required.- The former dependency on the `pypeg2` package is now dropped. This might cause some changes for certain corner-cases for suggested filenames when downloading files with the QtWebKit backend.- Windows and macOS releases now ship Python 3.9 rather than 3.7.- The `colors.webpage.darkmode.*` settings are now also supported with older Qt versions (Qt 5.12 and 5.13) rather than just with Qt 5.14 and above.- For regexes in the config (`hints.{prev,next}_regexes`), certain patterns which will change meanings in future Python versions are now disallowed. This is the case for character sets starting with a literal `[` or containing literal character sequences `--`, `&amp;&amp;`, `~~`, or `||`. To avoid a warning, remove the duplicate characters or escape them with a backslash.- If `prompt(..., &#34;default&#34;)` is used via JS, the default text is now pre-selected in the prompt shown by qutebrowser.- URLs such as `::1/foo` are now handled as a search term or local file rather than IPv6. Use `[::1]/foo` to force parsing as IPv6 instead.- The `mkvenv.py` script now runs a &#34;smoke test&#34; after setting up the virtual environment to ensure it&#39;s working as expected. If necessary, the test can be skipped via a new `--skip-smoke-test` flag.- Both qutebrowser userscripts and Greasemonkey scripts are now additionally picked up from qutebrowser&#39;s config directory (the `userscripts` and `greasemonkey` subdirectories of e.g. `~/.config/qutebrowser/`) rather than only the data directory (the same subdirectories of e.g. `~/.local/share/qutebrowser/`).- The `:later` command now understands a time specification like `5m` or `1h5m2s`, rather than just taking milliseconds.- The `importer.py` script doesn&#39;t use a browser argument anymore; instead its `--input-format` switch can be used to configure the input format. The help also was expanded to explain how to use it properly.- If `tabs.tabs_are_windows` is set, the `tabs.last_close` setting is now ignored and the window is always closed when using `:close` (`d`).- With the (default) QtWebEngine backend, if a custom `accept` header is set via `content.headers.custom`, the custom value is now ignored for XHR (`XMLHttpRequest`) requests. Instead, the sent value is now `*/*` or the header set from JavaScript, as it would be if `content.headers.custom` wasn&#39;t set.- The `:tab-select` completion now shows the underlying renderer process PID if doing so is supported (on QtWebEngine 5.15).- If `tabs.favicons.show` is set to `never`, favicons aren&#39;t unnecessarily downloaded anymore. Thus, disabling favicons can help with a possible  https://www.ghacks.net/2021/01/22/favicons-may-be-used-to-track-users/[fingerprinting vector].- &#34;Super&#34; is now understood as a modifier (i.e. as alias to &#34;Meta&#34;).- Initial support for Python 3.10 (currently in Alpha stage).- Various performance improvements, including for the startup time.Fixed~~~~~- With interpolated color settings (`colors.tabs.indicator.*` and `colors.downloads.*`), the alpha channel is now handled correctly.- Fixes to userscripts: * `format_json` now uses `env` in its shebang, making it work correctly on systems where `bash` isn&#39;t located in `/bin`. * `qute-pass` now handles the MIME output format introduced in gopass 1.10.0. * `qute-lastpass` now types multiple `&lt;` or `&gt;` characters correctly.- The `:undo` completion now sorts its entries correctly (by the numerical index rather than lexicographically).- The `completion.web_history.ignore` setting now works properly when set in `config.py` (rather than via `:set`). Additionally, a `:config-source` will not result in a history rebuild if the value wasn&#39;t actually changed.- When downloading a `data:` URL, the suggested filename is now improved and contains a proper extension. Before this fix, qutebrowser would use the URL&#39;s data contents as filename with QtWebEngine; or &#34;binary blob&#34; with the Qt network stack.- When `:tab-only` is run before a tab is available, an error is now shown instead of crashing.- A couple of long URLs (such as ` qute://pdfjs` URLs) are now not added to the history database anymore.- A bug in QtWebEngine 5.15.2 causes &#34;renderer process killed&#34; errors on websites like LinkedIn and TradingView. There is now a workaround in qutebrowser to prevent this from happening.- Nextcloud Calendars started using `String.replaceAll` which was only added to Chromium recently (Chrome 85), so won&#39;t work with current QtWebEngine versions. This release includes a workaround (a polyfill as a site-specific-quirk).Enjoy, and as usual, let me know if there are any issues!Florian--  me at the-compiler.org |  https://www.qutebrowser.org  https://bruhin.software/ |  https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/ GPG: 916E B0C8 FD55 A072 |  https://the-compiler.org/pubkey.asc I love long mails! |  https://email.is-not-s.ms/-------------- next part --------------A non-text attachment was scrubbed...Name: signature.ascType: application/pgp-signatureSize: 833 bytesDesc: not availableURL: &lt; https://lists.schokokeks.org/pipermail/qutebrowser-announce/attachments/20210128/13f323f0/attachment.asc&gt;</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lists.schokokeks.org/pipermail/qutebrowser-announce/2021-January/000090.html">https://lists.schokokeks.org/pipermail/qutebrowser-announce/2021-January/000090.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ËÆæËÆ°/">#ËÆæËÆ°</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂàõÊÑè/">#ÂàõÊÑè</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÊëÑÂΩ±/">#ÊëÑÂΩ±</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂõæÁâá/">#ÂõæÁâá</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/Ê∏∏Êàè/">#Ê∏∏Êàè</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ËΩØ‰ª∂/">#ËΩØ‰ª∂</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ËßÜÈ¢ë/">#ËßÜÈ¢ë</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÊâãÊú∫/">#ÊâãÊú∫</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂπøÂëä/">#ÂπøÂëä</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÁΩëÁ´ô/">#ÁΩëÁ´ô</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂÖçË¥π/">#ÂÖçË¥π</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/‰∏ãËΩΩ/">#‰∏ãËΩΩ</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ËãπÊûú/">#ËãπÊûú</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂæÆËΩØ/">#ÂæÆËΩØ</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/Èü≥‰πê/">#Èü≥‰πê</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂçöÂÆ¢/">#ÂçöÂÆ¢</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÊÅ∂Êêû/">#ÊÅ∂Êêû</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/Ëâ∫ÊúØ/">#Ëâ∫ÊúØ</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/Â∑•ÂÖ∑/">#Â∑•ÂÖ∑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/ÂàÜ‰∫´/">#ÂàÜ‰∫´</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
