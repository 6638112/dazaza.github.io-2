", "note_en": "Porsche is setting up a new factory for battery cells, called Cellforce, in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. The plant will be run as a subsidiary of Porsche in a joint venture with Customcells\u00a0and will develop  cells that use silicon as opposed to graphite for the anode material.\n &#34;We already started within research and pre-development to build up know how and knowledge about cell chemistry, and the company Cellforce Group will have around 60 engineers in development and about 20 in production; the main focus, at least in the beginning, is to take care about the development of the cell and cell chemistry,&#34; said Michael Steiner, member of the executive board, R&amp;D at Porsche.\n But unlike other  recent battery factory announcements, the goal for Cellforce is high performance, not high volume.\n &#34;In terms of production, [it] will be small compared to all the gigafactories you know, so we are looking forward to have around 100 MWh a year as production capacity\u2014it could be slightly more,&#34; Steiner told Ars. &#34;In terms of cars it should fit for, let me say, 1,000 cars a year. The kind of cells we look for are designed for motorsports and for high-performance derivatives of existing cars, so it&#39;s a very tailored cell technology for high-performance solutions,&#34; he said.\n    &#34;If this works, and we see potential to come down with cost if we scale up\u2014and costs of sales have not only to do with the chemistry but also with the scaling\u2014there might be a chance for higher volume, but this is not a task that I gave the team that has to start this new facility,&#34; Steiner said.\n Porsche is looking for gains in both gravimetric and volumetric energy density but also wants cells that can run hotter than current lithium-ion, like the cells found in Porsche&#39;s Taycan. These currently use &#34;low single-digit percentage&#34; of silicon in the anodes, but Cellforce wants to  increase this to 50 percent if possible.\n &#34;Today&#39;s cell chemistry is able to [operate at] 50\u02da C, maybe slightly higher, and we are looking for temperatures above 70\u02da C that support superfast charging but also superfast driving,&#34; Steiner said. (A downside to the new chemistry is that it doesn&#39;t operate well below freezing, which is a problem for road cars but not for race cars.)\n Porsche wasn&#39;t ready to discuss exactly what race car might first use these new Cellforce cells, something that should happen around 2024. By that time, Porsche&#39;s  hybrid endurance racing program will be up and running alongside its Formula E team. But in both of these cases, the regulations don&#39;t allow competitors to develop their own batteries, instead requiring everyone to use a spec battery pack.

said Horn, who lived in Oakland before moving into her van. &#34;I had no reason, nothing, tying me to that specific location or that amount of rent.&#34;\n Horn is not alone. Many workers with jobs that let them work remotely during the pandemic left behind their sedentary housing situations and moved full-time into vans. These remote workers drive from location to location in their homes, working from internet hotspots in their vans and spending their free time in nature and exploring new places.\n As vaccines roll out and states start to open up, some workers are returning to their offices. But many workers who&#39;ve adopted the van life don&#39;t want to give it up.\n &#34;It&#39;s become a lifestyle,&#34; said Smriti Bhadauria, who lives in her van with her husband Kartik Vasan and their dog Everest. Bhadauria and Vasan have been traveling in their 1977 Dodge B200 Tradesman since leaving Toronto in August 2020.\n &#34;We&#39;re extremely happy in this life and the freedom it gives,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;There&#39;s no deadline in sight.&#34;\n Like overseas backpacking, van life appeals to those with a love for travel or the outdoors who have the privilege to work remotely and the budget to spend thousands of dollars buying and setting up their vans. They can shift the money from rent and car payments toward a lifestyle of endless travel.\n &#34;I&#39;ve always been somebody who loves to travel, but I&#39;m definitely a homebody at the same time,&#34; said Cailey Dillon, who works remotely in customer service for Outdoorsy, a van and RV rental company. &#34;I really like that with the van life you can always be traveling but your home is always with you.&#34;\n       For some, working out of a van is less about travel and more of an alternative to leasing an office.\n Kenzo Fong, CEO of tech start-up Rock, began working out of his van in May 2020 after his children began doing their schoolwork at home during the pandemic. Fong still lives in his San Francisco home, but during the days, he gets into his van and picks a new location in the city. Fong spends his day working out of the desk he&#39;s set up in his van, and takes walking breaks to enjoy the variety of locations and gather his thoughts.\n Fong prefers this to having an hour-long commute each way from San Francisco to Mountain View, California, as he did for his previous job at Google.\n &#34;I just can&#39;t imagine myself doing that again because there&#39;s so much flexibility working from anywhere,&#34; said Fong, whose company builds software for remote workers.\n        Buying and setting up a van can be a quick process. But people who really get into it can spend months or years getting set up.\n Fong, for example, bought an already-converted van and financed it, and pays a couple hundred dollars each month.\n  In contrast, Horn spent months working on her van with her dad and a contractor, setting up the van to the specifications that she wanted. By the end of the project, she had spent about $60,000 -- $25,000 for a used van and another approximate $35,000 on the build.\n Van life vehicles need a few basics: A place to sleep, a desk or table space, kitchen equipment and some sort of bathroom setup.\n But perhaps most important is the computer and internet equipment. Some van lifers only need a laptop. Others have more elaborate set ups complete with multiple monitors. But most carry at least two hot spots from different network providers so they can catch signal from at least one of the services as they hit new locations.\n &#34;Internet is the most important thing,&#34; said Fong, who has a hotspot for AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile. &#34;I basically have all the major carriers in case I need it.&#34;\n These internet requirements sometimes necessitate innovative solutions. Horn recounts finding a great campsite in Sedona, Arizona, but not finding a good signal. So every morning she drove 30 minutes to a nearby town and parked in front of a Staples store where she could finally get a strong connection.\n  Working a nine-to-five job can also be a nuisance for van life workers. For full-timers like Horn, a typical work schedule means they might be parked somewhere gorgeous without being able to enjoy it until the weekend.\n This is why many in the van lifestyle are freelance workers, said Jess Shisler, the founder of Sekr, an app that helps people who live in vans find campsites or wi-fi locations.\n &#34;A nine-to-five is hard but doable,&#34; said Shisler, who also lives in a van. &#34;The type of remote careers that allow you more flexibility of your schedule are easier to do in this lifestyle.&#34;\n  Vasan works in information technology while Bhadauria has a digital marketing job. The two spend the early hours of their days outdoors and then get straight to work. In the afternoon, they&#39;ll take a break from work and explore their area or drive to their next location. No matter what, they prioritize catching the sunset every evening. Ironically, much of their actual work gets done on Saturday and Sunday.\n &#34;We almost never do activities on the weekends because it&#39;s usually crowded, so weekends end up being work days for us,&#34; Vasan said.\n   Dillon said she was surprised at how dirty her van gets. She spent the first four months of 2021 living on the road, and she is now home in Platte City, Missouri, working and preparing to purchase an upgraded van so she can return to her travels sometime this summer. While living in her van, she would clean and clean, but the van would get dirty again as soon as the wind blew. Eventually, Dillon said, you just learn to live a little bit dirtier.\n Another big challenge is dealing with the loneliness that comes with living on the road. Dillon said she felt very lonely during her first three weeks on the road, and it wasn&#39;t until she got her dog Koda that she began to overcome that.\n &#34;I like to be a loner, but it does sometimes get a little too lonely,&#34; she said. &#34;Getting my dog really helped a lot with that loneliness.&#34;\n       Horn said she spends parts of her days doing van chores, such as cleaning and making her bed each day. She also has to empty the van&#39;s grey water tank and portable toilet and refill her fresh water and propane.\n &#34;Most of the moments are not those epic sleeping in the most amazing place and waking up to the most amazing view, it&#39;s very little of that in the grand majority, especially if you&#39;re working,&#34; Horn said. &#34;However, those moments make it worth it.&#34;\n Bhadauria, who travels with her husband and dog, says she doesn&#39;t get lonely, but there are times when she misses the friends that come with living in one location. For example, Bhadauria said, she would have wanted to throw a big party for her husband&#39;s 30th birthday, which happened during their time on the road.\n &#34;Things like that you miss, when you want a big gathering or a sense of community,&#34; Bhadauria said.\n Although she and Vasan love life on the road and plan to continue it for the foreseeable future, they understand the lifestyle is not sustainable indefinitely.\n &#34;With everything you get to a point where things start feeling boring or there&#39;s a burn out at some point,&#34; Bhadauria said. &#34;If we get to that stage, we&#39;ll be happy to go back to a home base somewhere.&#34;\n Despite the challenges of life on the road, those who spoke with CNBC said they plan to continue their nomadic lifestyle until their companies stop allowing remote work or until they get burnt out. Horn said she originally planned to live on the road for at least a year, but that&#39;s now changed.\n &#34;At six months, I still feel like I&#39;m just learning this, just getting the hang of it and just getting started,&#34;

", "note_en": "The British have suffered for their fashion for centuries according to a new study suggesting that a vogue for shoes with a pointed tip led to a sharp increase in hallux valgus of the big toe - often called bunions - in the late medieval period.\n    Researchers investigating remains in Cambridge, UK, found that those buried in the town centre, particularly in plots for wealthier citizens and clergy, were much more likely to have had bunions - suggesting rich urbanites paid a higher price for their footwear in more ways than one.   A University of Cambridge team also discovered that older medieval people with hallux valgus were significantly more likely to have sustained a broken bone from a probable fall compared to those of a similar age with normal feet.\n  Hallux valgus is a minor deformity in which the largest toe becomes angled outward and a bony protrusion forms at its base, on the inside of the foot.\n     While various factors can predispose someone to bunions, from genetics to muscle imbalance, by far the most common contemporary cause is constrictive boots and shoes. The condition is often associated with wearing high heels.\n  Archaeologists analysed 177 skeletons from cemeteries in and around the city of Cambridge and found that only 6% of individuals buried between 11th and 13th centuries had evidence of the affliction. However, 27% of those dating from the 14th and 15th centuries had been hobbled by longstanding hallux valgus.\n  Researchers point out that shoe style changed significantly during the 14th century: shifting from a functional rounded toe box to a lengthy and more elegant pointed tip.\n   In a paper published today in the\u00a0   International Journal of Paleopathology, the team from Cambridge University&#39;s After the Plague project argues that these &#34;poulaine&#34; shoes drove the rise of bunions in medieval Britain.\n  &#34;The 14th century brought an abundance of new styles of dress and footwear in a wide range of fabrics and colours. Among these fashion trends were pointed long-toed shoes called poulaines,&#34; said study co-author Dr Piers Mitchell from Cambridge&#39;s Department of Archaeology.\n  &#34;The remains of shoes excavated in places like London and Cambridge suggest that by the late 14th century almost every type of shoe was at least slightly pointed - a style common among both adults and children alike.&#34;\n     &#34;We investigated the changes that occurred between the high and late medieval periods, and realized that the increase in hallux valgus over time must have been due to the introduction of these new footwear styles,&#34; said Mitchell.\n  First author Dr Jenna Dittmar, who conducted the work while at Cambridge, said: &#34;We think of bunions as being a modern problem but this work shows it was actually one of the more common conditions to have affected medieval adults.&#34;\n  The remains came from four separate sites around Cambridge: a charitable hospital (now part of St John&#39;s College); the grounds of a former Augustinian friary, where clergy and wealthy benefactors were buried; a local parish graveyard on what was the edge of town; and a rural burial site by a village 6km south of Cambridge.\n    Researchers conducted &#34;paleopathological assessments&#34;, including inspecting foot bones for the bump by the big toe that is the hallmark of hallux valgus.   They found a sliding scale of bunion prevalence linked to the wealth of those interred on each site. Only 3% of the rural cemetery showed signs, 10% of the parish graveyard (which mainly held the working poor), creeping up to 23% of those on the hospital site.\n  Yet almost half those buried in the friary - some 43% - including five of the eleven individuals identified as clergy by their belt buckles, carried the mark of the bunion.\n     &#34;Rules for the attire of Augustinian friars included footwear that was &#39;black and fastened by a thong at the ankle&#39;, commensurate with a lifestyle of worship and poverty,&#34; said Mitchell.\n  &#34;However, in the 13th and 14th centuries it was increasingly common for those in clerical orders in Britain to wear stylish clothes - a cause for concern among high-ranking church officials.&#34;\n  In 1215, the church forbade clergy from wearing pointed-toed shoes. This may have done little to curb the trend, as numerous further decrees on indiscretions in clerical dress had to be passed, most notably in 1281 and 1342.\n    &#34;The adoption of fashionable garments by the clergy was so common it spurred criticism in contemporary literature, as seen in Chaucer&#39;s depiction of the monk in the Canterbury Tales,&#34; said Mitchell.   Across late medieval society the pointiness of shoes became so extreme that in 1463 King Edward IV passed a law limiting toe-point length to less than two inches within London.   The majority of remains with signs of hallux valgus across all sites and eras within the study were men (20 of the 31 total bunion sufferers). The research also suggests that health costs of foot fashion were not limited to bunions.\n     Dr Jenna Dittmar found that skeletal remains with hallux valgus were also more likely to show signs of fractures that usually result from a fall e.g. those to upper limbs indicating an individual tumbled forward onto outstretched arms.\n  This association was only found to be significant among those who died over 45 year old, suggesting youthful fashion choices came back to haunt the middle-aged even in medieval times.\n  &#34;Modern clinical research on patients with hallux valgus has shown that the deformity makes it harder to balance, and increases the risk of falls in older people,&#34; said Dittmar. &#34;This would explain the higher number of healed broken bones we found in medieval skeletons with this condition.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:14:19", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65f6\u5c1a,pointy,\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa", "title": "\u5c16\u978b\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u91ca\u653e\u4e86\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u670b\u514b\u7684\u6591\u70b9 ", "title_en": "Fashion for pointy shoes unleashed plague of bunions in medieval Britain", "transed": 1, "url": "https://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.com/2021/06/fashion-for-pointy-shoes-unleashed.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u5c1a", "pointy", "\u4e2d\u4e16\u7eaa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "34c6c0d84b62f8ecd2ac7c588b1e9775.jpg", "infoid": 1067095, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nChua\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5979\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u5979\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u5979\u7684\u58f0\u8a89\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002 \u201c\u5728\u5361\u74e6\u4e07\u5d29\u6e83\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u4f60\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u6211\u7136\u540e\u7ad9\u5728\u522b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u201d\n \u57282021\u5e74\u6625\u5929\uff0c\u695a\u90a3\u65f6\u51e0\u5468\u51fa\u7248\u4e86\u5979\u5173\u4e8e\u665a\u5bb4 - \u95e8\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u9898\u4e3a\u201c\u6d3b\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u201d\u7684PDF\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u8036\u9c81\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5468\u56f4\u6d41\u4f20\u3002\u8be5\u6587\u4ef6\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba3\u8a93\u4e66\u7684\u98ce\u683c;\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u9ed1\u8272\u51fa\u6c34\u6bb5\u548c\u9644\u5f55\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u77ed\u4fe1\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u622a\u56fe\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u4e00\u540d\u8036\u9c81\u5f8b\u5e08\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u8c01\u662f\u4e0e\u695a\u90a3\u7684\u4e24\u4f4d\u7684\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fdc\u65b9\u7684\u89c2\u770b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6559\u6388\u4f3c\u4e4e\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\uff1a\n John Doe\u53d1\u77ed\u4fe1\u7ed9\u6211\uff08\u6587\u4ef61\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chua\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4f1a\u5728\u7b2c\u4e5d\u6761\u7535\u8def\u4e0a\u4e3a\u7ade\u4e89\u6cd5\u5b98\u505a\u597d\u804c\u5458\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u5979\u201c\u4e3a\u4ed6\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u51e0\u4f4d\u6cd5\u5b98\u201d\u3002\n  \u6211\u8fce\u6765\u4e86\u7ea6\u7ff0\u00b7\u6bcd\u9e7f\u53bb\u6d17\u8863\u670d\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\uff0c\u6211\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3aJane Doe\uff0c\u4ed6\u5411\u4ed6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Chua\u521a\u521a\u9080\u8bf7\u660e\u5929\u665a\u9910\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6234\u4ec0\u4e48\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u6240\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u4ec0\u4e48\uff08\u6700\u7ec8\u51b3\u5b9a\u5e26\u4e00\u74f6\u8461\u8404\u9152\uff09\u3002 \u3002 \u3002 \u3002\n \u540e\u6765\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f20\u8a00\u79f0\uff0c\u201cChua\u4e00\u76f4\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u6cd5\u5b98\u7684\u665a\u5bb4\u201d\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u7b14\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u4e24\u4f4d\u670b\u53cb\u90fd\u53bb\u8fc7\u4ed6\u4eec\uff0c\u62a5\u9053\u4e86Chua\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5211\u4e8b\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u201c\u6863\u6848\u201d\u662f\u6781\u70b9\n...... ", "note_en": "A decade ago, back when we talked about things besides new coronavirus strains and vaccination rates, there was a weeks-long media frenzy over a parenting memoir called \u201c Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother .\u201d In  that book, Amy Chua, an American daughter of Chinese immigrants, described her efforts to raise her children the \u201cChinese\u201d way. For her, that meant dispensing with squishy Western conventions like \u201cchild-led learning\u201d and participation trophies, and ruthlessly driving her two young daughters to master their classical instruments and maintain perfect grades. The book provoked a fierce backlash, much of which centered on Chua\u2019s tactics, which ranged from threatening to burn her older daughter\u2019s stuffed animals to rejecting a hand-scrawled birthday card that demonstrated insufficient effort. Chua\u2019s younger daughter \u201crebelled\u201d at the age of thirteen, choosing competitive tennis over concert-level violin, but, for the most part, Chua\u2019s system worked. Her daughters became musical prodigies and successful athletes, who attended Harvard and Yale. The phrase \u201ctiger mom\u201d entered the cultural lexicon and spawned a Singaporean TV show, \u201cTiger Mum,\u201d and a show in Hong Kong, \u201cTiger Mom Blues.\u201d\n That was the last time many of us heard about Amy Chua\u2014unless you\u2019ve been following the news out of Yale Law School, where Chua is a professor. If so, you know that the  discussion  kept going. Over the past few months, Chua has been at the center of a campus-wide fracas that, nominally, concerns the question of whether she hosted drunken dinner parties at her home this past winter. The controversy began in April, when the  Yale Daily News  reported that the law-school administration was punishing Chua for the alleged offense by removing her from the list of professors leading a special first-year law class called a \u201csmall group.\u201d\n Normally, drinking with students wouldn\u2019t be out of bounds. Yale Law is known for being a cozy place, as far as law schools go, and students are typically in their mid-twenties\u2014well past the legal drinking age. But, last winter, when Chua\u2019s parties supposedly took place, there was a pandemic going on. And Chua\u2019s husband, her fellow Yale Law professor Jed Rubenfeld, was serving a two-year  suspension from the faculty for sexual harassment. And, as the  Yale Daily News article revealed, Chua technically wasn\u2019t supposed to be having students over to her home or serving them alcohol. Three years ago, when the law school investigated Rubenfeld for harassment, the investigator also looked into allegations that Chua had engaged in \u201cexcessive drinking\u201d with students and had said offensive things to them. Chua denies that this is exactly what happened. But, at any rate, in 2019, she was issued a financial penalty, and she wrote a letter to the law school\u2019s administration agreeing \u201cnot to invite students to my home or out to drinks for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n Everyone on campus knew about Rubenfeld\u2019s situation, but Chua\u2019s had not been made public\u2014only the dean\u2019s office and the student complainants knew about it. Chua was outraged that the student newspaper had divulged a private disciplinary matter. She told me that her Gen Z daughter Lulu, the former violin prodigy, encouraged her to come out swinging. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, \u2018You have to fight the narrative,\u2019 so I just did something shocking,\u201d Chua said. She wrote an open letter saying that she\u2019d been falsely accused and described a Zoom call with the Yale Law dean in which she\u2019d been treated \u201cdegradingly, like a criminal.\u201d She also claimed that she had been barred from teaching a small-group class without receiving an explanation from the dean\u2019s office. \u201cI sent it to my entire faculty, and I tweeted it,\u201d Chua said. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s been kind of an escalating nightmare.\u201d  Slate,  Fox News, and the   Post picked up the story. Earlier this month, the   Times published an investigation into what has become known as \u201cDinner Party-gate.\u201d\n The question has arisen, in online comments sections and on Twitter, why anyone is even talking about Amy Chua. Who cares about a parenting memoirist\u2019s removal from a law-school teaching roster? The answer is, in part, because this story manages to touch on seemingly every single cultural flashpoint of the past few years. Chua\u2019s critics see a story about #MeToo\u2014because of her husband, but also because Chua supported the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, even after he was accused of sexual assault. Meanwhile, Chua\u2019s defenders see a morality tale about liberal cancel culture. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done to you is SOP\u201d\u2014standard operating procedure\u2014\u201cfor conservative allies but chills me to the bone nonetheless,\u201d a supporter tweeted at her, earlier this month.  Megyn Kelly weighed in, tweeting, \u201cMake no mistake: this is retribution for her support of Brett Kavanaugh, &amp; it is disgusting.\u201d Chua\u2019s allies have also suggested that anti-Asian bias is involved. \u201cThe woke academy reserves a special vitriol for minority faculty who don\u2019t toe the line politically,\u201d Niall Ferguson, a historian,  tweeted.\n Chua and her husband aren\u2019t politically conservative\u2014she says that Rubenfeld has historically been \u201cvery left-leaning,\u201d whereas she is a \u201csolid independent\u201d\u2014but they are provocateurs. Both husband and wife have a knack for finding subjects that get people talking, or, rather, screaming at one another around the dinner table. In a 2013 legal article, Rubenfeld pontificated on how we define rape. (See: \u201c The Riddle of Rape-by-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy,\u201d Part V, Section 3: \u201cNo Means No \u2013 but It May Not Mean Rape.\u201d) Chua often writes about ethnicity. In 2014, the couple co-wrote a book, called \u201c The Triple Package,\u201d about why some cultural groups are more successful in America than others, inspired by the authors\u2019 own Chinese and Jewish heritage. In a New York  Times review of Chua\u2019s latest book, \u201c Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations,\u201d published in 2018, David Frum described the professor as \u201can uncomfortable presence in American intellectual life.\u201d He went on, \u201cChua approaches the no-go areas around which others usually tiptoe. The warning alarms burst into \u2018WAH-OH, WAH-OH\u2019\u2014and Chua greets the custodians with a mild, \u2019Oh sorry, was that a taboo?\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n On the Yale Law campus, in New Haven, the Chua-Rubenfelds are local celebrities. Until recently, their home was something of a salon: a place where you could meet a federal judge, a published author, or a television producer. \u201cNew Haven craves a little bit of glamour,\u201d an alum from the late nineties told me. \u201cAmy was friends with Wendi Murdoch. She\u2019d go to Davos. They have a super-nice apartment in New York, and they\u2019d throw parties there.\u201d Once Chua became known as the Tiger Mom, she even began dressing accordingly. A current Yale Law student told me that, this past semester, the professor wore a tiger-print mask in every class.\n  One must understand the social dynamics at Yale Law to truly grasp the significance of Dinner Party-gate. The top-ranked law school in the country, Yale is known for being the spot where Bill and Hillary Clinton met, as well as the alma mater of four current Supreme Court Justices. It\u2019s supposed to be more philosophical and progressive than its counterpart at Harvard, which has more than twice as many students, many of whom tend to go on to more boring, lucrative careers in corporate law. This makes for an intense social environment at Yale. \u201cThe law school is quite small, but it\u2019s quite riven,\u201d a woman who graduated earlier this year told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a very vocal minority of social-justice-oriented students,\u201d who are there to pursue their passions for criminal-justice reform or women\u2019s rights. There are also plenty of hyper-diligent strivers, sometimes referred to as \u201cgunners.\u201d Frequently, these groups overlap.\n Every gunner shares the same dream: to kick off their careers with a clerkship for a big-name judge\u2014ideally one of the \u201cfeeder judges\u201d (usually those serving on the Court of Appeals), whose clerks often end up clerking on the Supreme Court. A Supreme Court clerkship is the ultimate gold star. \u201cIf you get that, it\u2019s like the key that unlocks all the other doors in the legal profession,\u201d a Yale Law graduate from 2019 told me. \u201cIf you want to be in the Solicitor General\u2019s office, a Supreme Court clerkship will open that door. Same goes for a top law firm with a huge signing bonus.\u201d (According to lore, the Supreme Court-clerk sweetener clocks in at four hundred thousand dollars.)\n The best clerkships go to the very best law students. But the first semester at Yale is pass-fail\u2014after that, the marks range from \u201chonors\u201d to \u201cfailure\u201d\u2014so it can be hard to distinguish one brilliant applicant from the next. In this context, a professor\u2019s recommendation counts for a lot. A recommendation from Amy Chua, even more so. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of seen as a golden ticket to clerkships,\u201d the woman who graduated earlier this year told me. She explained that when she began the process of applying for clerkships, she reached out to other students for advice. \u201cEvery person I called to ask \u2018How did you get this job?\u2019 told me, \u2018Amy Chua made a phone call.\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Chua\u2019s path to becoming a kingmaker has been unorthodox. Rubenfeld, a constitutional-law expert, was hired by Yale in 1990. According to Chua, she bungled her initial interview, instead landing at Duke\u2019s law school, and didn\u2019t join her husband until the spring of 2001, when Yale brought her on as a visiting professor. Later that semester, she was offered a tenured position. \u201cMy perception when I came to Yale Law School was that my husband was a superstar, and all these people were so articulate, and I was the only Asian-American woman on the academic faculty,\u201d Chua recalled. \u201cI could barely speak at faculty meetings, and I was always so on the outs\u2014just a kind of marginal figure.\u201d It took a few years for the tide to shift. By the early twenty-tens, though, \u201cAmy was the most popular teacher at the school, with the possible exception of Heather Gerken,\u201d a professor told me.\n  At Yale, Gerken and Chua represent two different kinds of figures. Gerken is one of the nation\u2019s leading specialists in election law and constitutional law, and served as a senior adviser to Barack Obama during both of his Presidential campaigns. (In 2017, she was named the dean of Yale Law, becoming the first woman ever to hold that position.) Chua, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have much standing as a legal scholar. While many of her colleagues\u2014Rubenfeld included\u2014built up their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with law-review articles, Chua threw herself into teaching and mentorship with the same vigor that she once applied to parenting.\n As a mentor, Chua is known to have a type: immigrants or students of color, usually those who have come from impoverished backgrounds. But she also takes an interest in conservative students\u2014an arguably marginalized group at Yale\u2014and those pursuing nontraditional careers, like business or journalism. (One of her most notable mentees was  J. D. Vance, the author of the 2016 best-seller \u201c Hillbilly Elegy,\u201d who ticked several of those boxes.) \u201cI think she likes people who are a little bit of an outsider or underdog for whatever reason,\u201d the 2019 graduate told me. One group of mentees even began calling themselves \u201cChuaPets.\u201d \u201cA lot of people adore Amy Chua,\u201d the woman who graduated earlier this year said. \u201cThey take a class with her, and she takes a shine to them, and then their lives get better. And it\u2019s not just the gunners. She\u2019s also supposed to be very caring and supportive even with weirdos who can\u2019t get clerkships.\u201d\n In the wake of Dinner Party-gate, Chua posted sixty-seven pages of e-mails, from student mentees past and present, on her personal Web site. The stories have a similar arc. The mentees describe their backgrounds: one came from a tiny fishing village in China that did not have indoor plumbing; another writes, \u201cI grew up a poor Black bastard raised by a single-mother of two.\u201d I spoke to one of the letter writers, a recent graduate, who is also a first-generation immigrant. The graduate had found many faculty mentors, but those relationships were \u201cmore or less purely academic,\u201d she said. Chua was different. \u201cShe was interested in knowing who I am, where I came from, about my family back home.\u201d Chua gave her detailed feedback on her papers and insidery advice on how to apply for clerkships. For example, she advised the student to keep quiet about her passion for international law, warning that it might make her a less attractive candidate. \u201cNo other professor had told me that,\u201d the graduate said. \u201cIt was something I wouldn\u2019t have known unless I had a dad or a mom who was a lawyer in this country.\u201d On graduation day, she recalled, \u201cI was reflecting on what I would have done differently if I had another chance at the law school. Basically, I wish I\u2019d gotten to know Professor Chua earlier. That\u2019s my biggest regret.\u201d\n In 2017, the legal world, like everyone else, started to feel the effects of the #MeToo movement. The first domino to fall was Alex Kozinski, a prominent conservative judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, who, in late 2017, resigned after multiple women, including clerks, accused him of sexual misconduct. Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, was probably one of the most influential judges in America, apart from the nine Supreme Court Justices.\n In 2018, Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, a former Kozinski clerk, to the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh had attended Yale Law and was known for hiring clerks from the school. Chua, whose oldest daughter, Sophia\u2014also a Yale Law alum\u2014had been chosen to clerk for Kavanaugh, endorsed him in an op-ed titled \u201c Kavanaugh Is a Mentor to Women.\u201d Later that month,  Christine Blasey Ford accused the nominee of sexual assault. Chua didn\u2019t withdraw her endorsement. Then, days before Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing,  the  Guardian reported that Chua had made suggestive comments to students in her small-group class about Kavanaugh\u2019s preferences regarding the appearance of his female law clerks.\n  In some ways, this wasn\u2019t surprising. Chua often describes herself as \u201cunfiltered.\u201d A lawyer who has interacted with her told me that it\u2019s more than that: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like she has verbal Tourette\u2019s.\u201d I spoke with one alum who took a small-group class that Chua was teaching in the fall of 2017. At first, she loved Chua\u2019s candor. \u201cShe was, like, \u2018I\u2019m going to be straightforward and give you the real deal about clerkships and jobs,\u2019\u00a0\u201d the alum recalled. But, sometimes, things got weird. There was a lot of drinking, and Chua would share details about professors\u2019 personal lives or the internal politics of who was getting tenure. During one gathering, at Chua\u2019s home, Chua \u201cbrought up some weird sexual kinks of a friend she used to spend time with in her twenties,\u201d the alum said. \u201cIt was a non sequitur.\u201d The alum wasn\u2019t offended; it was just too much information. \u201cIt read to me like social anxiety,\u201d she said. \u201cShe seemed kind of desperate to impress people and be liked.\u201d (Chua wrote to me, in response to that story, that \u201cI have a lot of regrets, and that I know it\u2019s one of my faults to be unfiltered or over-the-top or too spontaneous\u2014sometimes saying something stupid just to fill up an awkward silence. I\u2019ve really tried to change\u2014in fact, I think definitely  have changed.\u201d)\n  Another student from that small-group class recently wrote a kind of open letter to Chua, in which she told her version of the Kavanaugh story. She claims that Chua was hanging out with a group of female students at a bar, when she started talking about the #MeToo movement and the federal judiciary. \u201cYou went on to mention that a judge named Kavanaugh\u201d\u2014then a Circuit Court judge\u2014\u201chad a predilection for good-looking clerks.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. You said, however, that you weren\u2019t concerned for your daughter, his future clerk, because she would never put up with that sort of behavior.\u201d The student adds that Chua later said that Kozinski\u2019s harassment \u201cwas an open secret,\u201d but that she did her best to combat it \u201cby steering female candidates in another direction.\u201d (Chua claims that her statements have been distorted.)\n At the time of the Kavanaugh debate, Chua was off campus, undergoing surgery for a medical issue. When she returned, in 2019, both she and her husband were under a cloud. At the time, Rubenfeld was dealing with his own sexual-misconduct scandal; in the spring of 2018, following complaints of Rubenfeld\u2019s attempting to kiss or touch students and making suggestive comments to them\u2014for example, joking about \u201ctickling\u201d female students, and asking about their sex lives\u2014Dean Gerken hired an outside investigator to look into his behavior. Rubenfeld denied sexually harassing anyone, but, in 2020, he was suspended for two years without pay, which is among the most severe punishments that a tenured professor can receive. Some student activists were not satisfied. A campus group called Yale Law Women released a  statement demanding that he be permanently removed from campus. \u201cWe do not want Jed Rubenfeld to prey on a new generation of students,\u201d they wrote.\n Chua\u2019s connection to the matter was ambiguous. She hadn\u2019t been accused of harassment herself. But some of Rubenfeld\u2019s critics saw her as an enabler of her husband. \u201cShe kind of provides muscle for him, because of her clerkship connections,\u201d one Yale alum said. \u201c \u2019Cause it\u2019s like, you\u2019re one of Jed\u2019s acolytes? If you put up with his shit, she\u2019ll help you get a clerkship.\u201d Her relationships with judges could also make her seem scary.  Slate reported that, after a student publicly condemned a  Times Op-Ed that Rubenfeld wrote about campus rape, Chua threatened to \u201ccall every justice on the Supreme Court\u201d to tell them not to hire the student. Chua has denied making such threats. She told me, \u201cMany people have suggested that the way I\u2019m being depicted\u2014as this ruthless, cunning, intimidating, manipulative, domineering person\u2014that\u2019s exactly the stereotype of the dragon lady.\u201d\n But the perception stuck. A man who recently graduated from Yale Law recounted a conversation that he\u2019d had with two female friends while selecting his courses for the spring 2020 semester. \u201cI mentioned I was thinking about taking International Business Transactions\u201d\u2014Chua\u2019s class\u2014\u201cand it was like I\u2019d said, \u2018I\u2019m signing up for Holocaust studies with Hitler,\u2019\u00a0\u201d he said. \u201cThe mood changed immediately. They started talking about her husband, and Brett Kavanaugh, and rape culture.\u201d He decided to take the course anyway, although he eventually stopped mentioning it to people.\n Chua told me that even though her classes remained popular, she could feel the shift in her reputation. \u201cEverything changed after the Kavanaugh debacle,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, I then stood for something else.\u201d\n In the spring of 2021, a few weeks after Chua published her open letter about Dinner Party-gate, a PDF titled \u201cTimeline of Events\u201d began circulating around Yale Law. The document was written loosely in the style of a legal affidavit; it includes blacked-out passages and an appendix with screenshots of text messages. Its author, a Yale Law student who is friends with two of Chua\u2019s mentees, describes watching from afar as the professor appears to advance friends\u2019 careers:\n John Doe texts me (  Document 1) explaining that Chua thinks hewould make a good clerk to a competitive judge on the Ninth Circuitand that she \u201chas picked several judges\u201d for him.\n  I go over to John Doe\u2019s to do my laundry. While at his apartment, Ihear him call Jane Doe, who explains to him that Chua has just invitedthem over for dinner tomorrow. They discuss what to wear and what theyshould bring (ultimately deciding to bring a bottle of wine).\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\n Later on, the author hears a rumor that \u201cChua has been hosting dinner parties with judges.\u201d Concluding that both friends have been going to them, the author reported Chua.

easy to take flying for granted. We hop on-board a comfy airliner and fly high in the stratosphere without giving  breathing a second thought. The aircraft\u2019s pressurization system makes it possible. Here\u2019s how the magic works\u2026\n    Hypothetical experiment: If you place a scale in a vacuum chamber and compare the weight of a filled balloon with an empty one, you\u2019ll see that air has mass.\n Earth\u2019s atmosphere is about 300 miles thick. At sea level, our bodies are subjected to about 14.7 pounds of pressure from this tall column of air. I\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t even notice!\u00a0For animals roaming the earth\u2019s surface, a 14.7 psi atmosphere provides the perfect amount of oxygen.\n As we climb in altitude, the amount of air pressure acting on\u00a0us decreases rapidly. You notice the decrease when your ears pop while driving up a mountain or riding\u00a0a fast elevator. Although the atmosphere is 300 miles thick, most of the air molecules are squashed down to within a few thousand feet of the earth\u2019s surface.\n  As we climb higher, air molecules are spread farther apart. When we breathe, our lungs take in less air, and less oxygen. Folks living in Denver, Colorado (5600 ft) are quite happy breathing the lower, 12 psi atmosphere. Climbing to a higher altitude, though, and the pressure drops really fast.\n At 18,000 feet, the atmospheric pressure is down to 7.3 psi, about  half the sea-level pressure. There just isn\u2019t enough oxygen in a breath of air to adequately supply the brain. At this pressure, a healthy adult has only 20-30 minutes of useful consciousness.\n Airliners fly between 30,000 and 43,000 feet. At those altitudes the atmosphere provides less than 4 psi of pressure. If you tried breathing at that altitude, your useful consciousness would be less than a minute (followed soon after by death).\n To survive high altitudes, occupants of an aircraft need help breathing. The solution is to pump air into the airplane so the interior pressure is high enough to keep the humans happy.\n  Airplanes can certainly fly below 10,000 feet where the atmospheric pressure is a comfy 10 psi or higher, but it has some drawbacks:\n  If you want a fast, smooth ride in a fuel efficient airplane that can fly over a mountain range, we need to pressurize!\n  The airplane body (fuselage) is a long tube capable of withstanding a fair amount of differential\u00a0air pressure; think of it like a big plastic soda bottle. In theory, we could seal the bottle so, as the airplane climbs, the interior air pressure would stay the same. We can\u2019t do that because it\u2019s hard to perfectly seal a huge airplane fuselage. Even if we could, the passengers would quickly use up\u00a0the available oxygen. And just imagine the smell inside a perfectly sealed tube on a long flight! Clearly, a big sealed soda bottle won\u2019t work for us without some modification.\n  To solve the problems, pressurization systems constantly pump fresh, outside air into the fuselage. To control the interior pressure, and allow old, stinky air to exit, there is a motorized door called an  outflow valve\u00a0located near the tail of the aircraft. It\u2019s about the size of a briefcase and located on the side or bottom of the fuselage. Larger aircraft often have two outflow valves. The valves are\u00a0automatically controlled by the aircraft\u2019s pressurization system. If higher pressure is needed inside the cabin, the door closes. To reduce cabin pressure, the door slowly opens, allowing more air to escape. It\u2019s one of the simplest systems on an aircraft.\n  One of the benefits of a pressurization system is the constant flow of clean, fresh air moving through the aircraft. The air inside the airplane is completely changed every two or three minutes making it far cleaner than the air in your home or office.\n Pressurization systems are designed to keep the interior cabin pressure between 12 and 11 psi at cruise altitude. On a typical flight, as the aircraft climbs to 36,000 feet, the interior of the plane \u201cclimbs\u201d to between 6000-8000 feet.\n  Why not keep the cabin at 14.7 psi to simulate sea-level pressure and maximize comfort? The aircraft must be designed to withstand  differential pressure, that\u2019s the difference between the air pressure inside and outside the aircraft. Exceeding the differential pressure limit is what makes a balloon pop when it\u2019s over inflated. The greater the differential pressure, the stronger (and heavier) the airplane must be built. It\u2019s possible to build an aircraft that can withstand sea-level pressure during cruise, but it would require a significant increase in strength and weight. A 12 psi cabin is a good trade-off.\n If you look at pictures of airliners taken prior to 1990, you might see brown stains around the outflow valve. The stains are from  tobacco smoke. Airlines were thrilled when the industry banned smoking. Tar and nicotine\u00a0gummed up valves, instruments, and sensors causing thousands of dollars a year in damage. Tobacco is  really nasty stuff.\n  Two types of mechanical devices are installed on the fuselage to protect the pressurized section of the aircraft against excessive pressure differential.\n  Every pressurized aircraft has a maximum pressure differential limit. Exceeding this limit (pumping too much air pressure into the fuselage) can cause damage \u2013 even blow out doors and windows. To protect the aircraft from over pressurizing,  positive pressure relief valves are installed. The devices (sometimes called butterfly valves) are spring-loaded to vent excess air pressure when cabin pressure exceeds the maximum limit.\n   Negative pressure differential means the pressure outside the cabin is greater than the pressure inside the cabin. This situation could occur during a rapid descent. Negative pressure is bad because it pushes inward on doors and windows. These components are not designed for this type of force.\n Again, spring-loaded devices are used to protect the fuselage from damage. Air pressure of less than 1.0 psi against the outside of the doors causes them to open inward against the spring load, venting air into the fuselage to equalize the pressure.\n     Electric Compressors Old piston powered airliners, like the Boeing Stratocruiser, used electric air compressors to pump fresh, outside air into the cabin. This system worked well, but the compressors added a lot of weight to the aircraft.\n    Turbocompressors Early jetliners, like the Douglas DC-8 and Boeing 707 used bleed air from the engines to spin turbocompressors. The turbocompressors then pumped fresh outside air into the cabin.\n    Engine Bleed Air Most modern airliners use bleed air from the compressor section of the engines to pressurize the cabin. This very hot air must be cooled to a comfortable temperature before it\u2019s directed into\u00a0the cabin.\n    Electric Compressors (Again!) The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner brings back the electric compressor. The 787\u2019s electrical system powers compressors, just like on the old Stratocruiser. Advances in technology make this system far more efficient than it\u2019s predecessor from the 1950\u2019s.\n A jet engine has three main sections: compressor, combustion, and turbine/exhaust. The compressor is at the front of the engine. A series of spinning blades draws in fresh, outside air. As the air is compressed, it becomes very hot. Remember high school physics? As a gas is compressed, its temperature rises. The hot, compressed air then enters the combustion\u00a0chamber where it is mixed with fuel and burned. The expanded gasses continue through turbine blades which power the compressor blades before exiting the engine producing thrust.\n   Bleed air is  fresh, clean, hot air taken from the compressor section of the engine  before\u00a0it is mixed with fuel or exhaust gasses. Common uses for hot bleed air are wing\u00a0and engine ice protection, cabin pressurization, engine starter motors, and air driven hydraulic pumps.\n    It\u2019s really,  really easy. The cabin altitude\u00a0control panel on the 757 and 767 is super simple. During preflight checks, pilots turn the \u201cLDG ALT\u201d knob to display the altitude of the landing airport. That\u2019s it! We don\u2019t touch it for the remainder\u00a0of the flight. The automatic mode takes care of the outflow valve for us.\n The remaining\u00a0indicators and knobs are for redundancy in case of a malfunction. There are two separate automatic modes. A\u00a0manual mode allows us to adjust the position of the outflow valve should both auto systems fail. Pressurization systems work great and rarely cause any trouble.\n  The air inside an aircraft cabin\u00a0is\u00a0 very low in humidity. On a long flight it\u2019s important to drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. When the flight attendant offers you a bottle of water, drink it. You may not notice that you\u2019re dehydrated.\n Alcohol consumption: Dehydration increases the effects of alcohol on your body. To make matters worse, alcohol increases dehydration; it\u2019s a double-whammy.\u00a0If you choose to drink alcohol on a flight, be sure to drink plenty of water and have something to eat while enjoying your cocktail.\u00a0Don\u2019t be  that guy. Drink   extra-responsibly when flying.\n Does this food taste bland?\u00a0Yes! There\u2019s a good chance your in-flight meal really does taste bland. The aircraft cabin\u2019s low humidity and lower air pressure reduce\u00a0your sense of taste and smell by as much as 30% according to a  Lufthansa commissioned\u00a0study.

The culprit is the WindowServer process: a core part of macOS responsible for drawing on the screen.\n  This seems to be a commonly reported bug (?) that started happening in Big Sur, where the WindowServer CPU usage scales with the polling rate of the input device:    I did some tests out of curiosity, and I can confirm that the CPU spike does scale with the polling rate.\n The mouse I\u2019m using daily (the one used in the recording above) is a  Logitech Pro X Superlight, a gaming mouse with a 1000 Hz polling rate (I use a gaming mouse even if I don\u2019t play videogames because I\u2019m very sensitive to input delay). After a fresh start, with a 1000Hz polling, rate WindowServer goes from ~2% to ~50% CPU usage. Lowering the polling rate to 125Hz (the lowest polling rate I can choose) makes the WindowServer process reach ~20% CPU usage. Doing so also  makes my MacBook more silent because the fans don\u2019t start as often as when using a higher polling rate (I can\u2019t provide \u201cscientific\u201d proof, though, so please take it with a grain of salt).\n Then, I tried with two other mice: a  Logitech G203 (wired) that produced the same results, and an Amazon Basics wireless mouse (no idea what its polling rate is), which made WindowServer reach ~25% CPU usage.\n Finally, I tried and with a Magic Trackpad 2 (which should have a polling rate of ~90Hz) and with the built-in MacBook trackpad, and  there were almost no changes to the WindowServer CPU usage.\n I\u2019d love to learn why and how Big Sur introduced this issue in macOS\u2026 but I feel I\u2019ll never know the answer :)\n I did my test on two different MacBooks with Big Sure (both producing similar results):\n MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019), 2,3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 4 GB\n MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), 2,8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7, 16 GB 2133 MHz DDR3, Intel HD Graphics 630 1536 MB", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:12:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9f20\u6807,mouse,windowserver", "title": "\u79fb\u52a8\u9f20\u6807\u5149\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6469\u6258\u65af\u4e0a\u7684CPU\u5c16\u5cf0 ", "title_en": "Moving the mouse cursor can cause CPU spikes on macOS", "transed": 1, "url": "https://mmazzarolo.com/blog/2021-06-18-macos-windowserver-cpu-spike-mouse/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9f20\u6807", "mouse"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067091, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

Meanwhile tech companies are taking a far more flexible approach.\n As for workers themselves, more than half of those surveyed in a recent Pew Research Center survey said that, given the choice, they would want to keep working from home even after the pandemic subsides.\n Here&#39;s how some of the biggest names in tech and finance are handling the return to office life.\n  Apple expects employees to return to their offices three days a week come September, CEO Tim Cook wrote in an email to employees earlier this month, according to The Verge.\n &#34;For all that we&#39;ve been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,&#34; Cook said in the email. &#34;Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.&#34;\n Employees are expected to be in the office Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, but those with roles that allow for remote work will have the option to work from home Wednesdays and Fridays. The company is also offering up to two weeks of remote work annually and encouraging, but not requiring, vaccination.\n  Facebook announced earlier this month that employees can apply for remote work if their role allows. Any worker who wants to return to the office may do so on a flexible basis but is encouraged to spend at least half of their time in the office. Employees will also be granted 20 days each year to work from a remote location.\n Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees in a memo that he plans to continue working remotely for at least half of the next year, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNN Business.\n  Until September, Google workers around the world can continue to work remotely before deciding between coming back to their office, working out of a different Google office or applying for full-time remote work.\n &#34;The future of work is flexibility,&#34; CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a May memo to employees.\n Pichai said he expects about 60% of employees to return to their pre-pandemic offices while 20% move to a different office and 20% work from home.\n  Twitter has yet to set an exact start date for welcoming employees back to the office, but it plans to start with a 20% capacity limit.\n Early in the pandemic, the company said it plans to let some of its workforce continue working remotely &#34;forever&#34; if they choose.\n &#34;If our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen,&#34; said Twitter&#39;s vice president of people, Jennifer Christie, in a statement to CNN Business. &#34;If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it&#39;s safe to return.&#34;\n The company has stressed that it wants employees to have the choice to return to the office, but it anticipates that most workers will opt for a hybrid model, spending some time in the office and some time at home.\n  Uber will shift to a hybrid model in September, according to an April blog post from Nikki Krishnamurthy, the company&#39;s chief people officer.\n Employees at the ride-hailing company are expected in the office three days a week, but they will have the option to work remotely the other two days.\n &#34;We feel that this combination of in-person and remote work will give people the freedom to do their best work while staying connected to their colleagues,&#34; Krishnamurthy said in the blog post.\n  Bank of America is encouraging, and expecting, all vaccinated employees to return to the office after Labor Day, CEO Brian Moynihan said this week.\n &#34;Our view is all the vaccinated teammates will be back,&#34; Moynihan said in a Bloomberg Television interview this week. &#34;We&#39;ll be able to operate fairly normally and will then start to make provisions for the other teammates as we move through the fall.&#34;\n The bank is not mandating employees to report their vaccination status, but it is expecting them to input their status in the company portal.\n  Citi said in March that it recognized how people have benefited from aspects of working remotely, and that it would embrace some flexibility in the return-to-office process.\n The bank said it expects up to 30% of US staff to return to the office in July. The majority of Citi workers globally will be designated as &#34;hybrid,&#34; working in the office at least three days a week and from home up to two days per week.\n  Goldman Sachs welcomed employees back to the office on Monday. The company is expecting 5,400 newly hired interns, analysts and associates in the office in addition to its returning employees.\n &#34;We are focused on progressing on our journey to gradually bring our people back together again, where it is safe to do so, and are now in a position to activate the next steps in our return to office strategy,&#34; the bank&#39;s leadership wrote in a May staff memo.\n Leading up to the return to in-person work, Goldman Sachs also mandated that its employees report their vaccination status. While vaccination is not required, the company is encouraging all staff to get vaccinated if possible.\n  Last month, JPMorgan opened all of its US offices to employees with a 50% occupancy cap. Executives at the bank informed staff that it expects all US-based employees back in the office by early July on a consistent rotational schedule, subject to the same 50% cap.\n &#34;We firmly believe that working together in person is important for our culture, clients, businesses and teams,&#34; JPMorgan executives said.\n  Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman took a hard line earlier this week, saying he expects the bank&#39;s New York employees back in the office by Labor Day.\n &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said at an investing conference.\n The company has not mandated vaccination, but Gorman noted that &#34;well over 90%&#34; of employees had already received their Covid-19 vaccination. That number is expected to hit 98% to 99%, according to Gorman.\n The bank will continue to consider returning to the office on a case-by-case basis, Gorman said, recognizing that some employees may not be able to be vaccinated, or may be in a different situation if their office is outside of New York.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 06:11:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u4eba,rushing,\u5458\u5de5", "title": "\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5de5\u4eba\u8d76\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4 ", "title_en": "The companies rushing workers back to the office", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_63f084b70df88bccd604e9b93404fcf9", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u4eba", "rushing", "\u5458\u5de5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9ec701e64dee3acc626b9f967e34ee5b.jpg", "infoid": 1067090, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Ryan Reynolds\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4ed6\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u5229\u57fa - \u4e00\u79cd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4ed6\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u770b\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u8d2c\u4f4e\u7684\u53ef\u6cbb\u8d28\uff0c\u806a\u660e\u5730\u8bbd\u523a\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\u611f\u3002\u4ed6\u57282016\u5e74\u7eaf\u7cb9\u5b8c\u7f8e\uff0c\uff06\uff0339;

He was sheer perfection in 2016&#39;s raunchy, R-rated blockbuster,   Deadpool. Reynolds is at his best when he has a strong co-star to play off of as a foil, and he has that in Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek, his co-stars in\u00a0  The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard, Yes, it&#39;s an awkward title for this sequel to 2017&#39;s action/comedy,   The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard. But if you liked that movie (I thought it was a blast), chances are you&#39;ll enjoy this latest flawed-but-fun outing.\n  In the first film, Reynolds&#39; ambitious, tightly controlled, triple-A rated &#34;executive protection agent,&#34; Michael Bryce, finds his professional life in shambles after one of this clients is assassinated on his watch. Two years later, his ex-girlfriend (an Interpol agent) reluctantly hires him to protect hitman Darius Kinkaid (Jackson). Darius is a key witness in the trial of the ruthless dictator of Belarus (Gary Oldman), agreeing to testify in exchange for the release of his con-artist wide, Sonia (Hayek) from prison. Michael has to get Darius from London to the International Criminal Court while being pursued by all the crack assassins and firepower the Belarus dictator can muster. Do they ultimately succeed and save the day against nigh-impossible odds? Do you really need to ask?\n The Hitman&#39;s Bodyguard grossed $176.6 million globally\u2014not a bad showing\u2014but it received decidedly mixed reviews. Although almost everyone praised the onscreen comic chemistry between Reynolds and Jackson, much of the criticism targeted the fairly generic, cliche-ridden script. Audiences were more forgiving. One person&#39;s tired cliche is another&#39;s time-honored trope, after all, and raunchy, entertaining, R-rated comedy/action flicks are in short supply these days.\n    The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard\u00a0brings us more of the same. We find Michael still in bodyguard exile, despite his successful mission with Kinkaid. Even his therapist can&#39;t wait to get rid of him, suggesting he take a sabbatical to Capri. He just wants to lounge poolside and read  The Secret in peace, but fate (in the form of Sonia) intervenes. Per the official premise:\n    The world\u2019s most lethal odd couple\u2014bodyguard Michael Bryce and hitman Darius Kincaid\u2014are back on another life-threatening mission. Still unlicensed and under scrutiny, Bryce is forced into action by Darius\u2019s even more volatile wife, the infamous international con artist Sonia Kincaid. As Bryce is driven over the edge by his two most dangerous protectees, the trio get in over their heads in a global plot and soon find that they are all that stand between Europe and a vengeful and powerful madman (Antonio Banderas). Joining in the fun and deadly mayhem is Morgan Freeman as...well, you\u2019ll have to see.\n The screwball/slapstick comedy aspects are more pronounced this time around, as is the cheese factor. \u00a0Once again, it&#39;s the on-screen chemistry between the three leads that makes the movie work. Reynolds and Jackson settle smoothly into their usual bickering interplay, and having Michael insist upon not carrying a gun\u2014relying on pepper spray and his trusty Swiss Army knife (&#34;they never see it coming&#34;) because his therapist advised against it\u2014makes for a solid running gag. Hayek once again shows a real gift for physical comedy, as well as impressively long, profane rants in Spanish (often left untranslated).\n Among the supporting cast, Tom Hopper\u2014best known as Luther in Netflix&#39;s   The Umbrella Academy\u2014steals his scenes as Magnusson, a superstar bodyguard who is Michael&#39;s arch-rival. Banderas gleefully camps it up as villainous Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Papadopoulos, and Richard E. Grant is back for a brief cameo as the flamboyant, drug-addicted corporate executive Mr. Seifert.\u00a0(It&#39;s always nice to see Frank Grillo, but he is wasted as Interpol agent Bobby O&#39;Neill.)\n You could level many of the same criticisms against  The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard as its predecessor;\u00a0many reviewers already have. Is it ridiculously over the top at times? Sure, although director Patrick Hughes leans into the sillier aspects with tongue firmly in cheek. Does it follow a familiar action/buddy comedy formula? Yes, complete with car chases, explosions, a spot of torture, and double-crossing twists. The first act is kind of clumsy\u2014although the film finds its footing by the second\u2014and it&#39;s not that difficult to predict how (almost) everything plays out.\u00a0None of that matters, because ultimately the movie is just a fun, wild ride with three terrific, hugely charismatic leads carrying it through any rough spots.\n The Hitman&#39;s Wife&#39;s Bodyguard is now playing in theaters. We strongly recommend only returning to theaters after being fully vaccinated.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 05:36:11", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

dominant force in web and mobile search won\u2019t surprise you. What might, though, is that roughly two thirds of the searches on Google never leave the search results page. That is, the searchers get what they are looking for without leaving Google. These are called \u201cno-click\u201d or \u201czero-click\u201d searches.\n    The percentages vary a bit depending on device, geography, and the precise definition of \u201cno-click,\u201d but it\u2019s clear that Google is retaining a large share of searchers within its domain. Search expert Rand Fishkin, who  compiled much of this data, thinks that the percentage of no-click searches will continue to rise.\n  In their early years, search engines were expected to produce a set of links to the most relevant web pages. \u201cTen blue links\u201d were the norm. Over time, that evolved\u2014ads appeared, often looking much like the natural, or \u201corganic,\u201d results. Links to images, videos, and other content types also began to appear.\n    Even then, to get the information you wanted, you still clicked through to another site. That was good news for both entrepreneurs and large brands: if you created content that people wanted, Google would send them to you\u2014for free!\n      When Google launched, there were already popular search engines\u2014AltaVista, Yahoo, Excite, Lycos and others. These competitors had a lot in common. First, their search functionality was a small text entry box on a page cluttered with ads, news, content, directory links, and other distracting elements. They all saw being a \u201cportal,\u201d a monetized doorway to everything on the Web, as their path to success.\n    Second, their search results weren\u2019t very good. Because their rankings were highly dependent on page content, those rankings could be manipulated by optimizers. Even when there was no aggressive optimization, often the results were not good answers to the search because so many pages were designed in a way that confused the search engine algorithms.\n    Google is an early case study in my book  Friction, where I show how they focused on minimizing user effort. Their home page was essentially white space with a search box in the middle\u2014no confusion or distraction. This focus on the user\u2019s intent stood in stark contrast to their competition.\n  The big difference, though, was in the quality of Google\u2019s results. Their PageRank algorithm created a map of the Web as a giant recommendation engine. On competing search engines, a user might go through pages of results, clicking on many links, before finding what they wanted. With Google, the desired result was likely the top one, or at least in the top few.\n    Over time, Google continued to deliver ever more relevant links while also making manipulating results more difficult. But no detail missed their attention. For example, the user who goes to Google.com finds the cursor already positioned in the search box. A small thing, perhaps but it saves every user a click or tap. Even today, I constantly encounter web pages where entering something is to sole purpose of the page but the cursor isn\u2019t pre-positioned for me.\n  Another major keystroke saver was  predictive search. Start typing in the search box, and Google immediately begins to offer guesses for your search term. Type \u201cw\u201d and the first two suggestions will be \u201cweather\u201d and \u201cWalmart,\u201d no doubt the two most common searches starting with that letter. Additional characters spawn new high-probability guesses.\n    In my own experience, it\u2019s rare that I have to type in a complete search phrase. In fact, Google\u2019s suggestions are often a better way of phrasing what I wanted and likely yield more relevant results.\n  Here\u2019s the dilemma for Google: once all the user has to do is type a character or two to search, how does further reduce user effort? The answer is simple: if Google understands what the user wants, why not just  deliver the information instead of a  link to the information?\n    Increasingly, Google tries to provide the information the searcher wants on the search results page. For example, if one clicks \u201cweather\u201d after typing \u201cw,\u201d Google provides a large amount of weather data for the user\u2019s location at the top of the results: current conditions, plus hourly and daily forecasts. Most users probably find what they need without having to click through to weather.com, where the data is sourced.\n    Delivering the desired information in a simple, standard format saves more than the initial click. If the user navigates to a new site, they may have to expend additional effort to acclimate to the new site\u2019s design and to search the page for the desired information.\n  In some cases, the effort differential could be quite high. Imagine, for example, scrolling through a lengthy FAQ page vs. Google delivering only the necessary answer. Even weather.com offers only a five-day forecast on its home page - if you want to know what\u2019s predicted for a week from the current day, you\u2019ll have to click to a different page.\n  User experience can suffer, too. More than once I\u2019ve clicked through to the site from where Google obtained an answer and been assaulted by cookie warnings, pop-ups, and slow-loading pages packed with advertising.\n  A no-click result seems like a win for users, and it almost always is. The loser, if there is one, is the website where Google found the information. Users who might have lingered, consumed other content, subscribed, bought something, or created ad impressions now never get to the website.\n    Google is being assailed on all sides from regulators trying to rein in their power. Ohio wants them to be  regulated like a public utility. U.S. politicians are  drafting antitrust legislation.\n  What\u2019s different about the current anti-trust sentiment affecting not just Google but other big tech companies is that consumers may not agree they are being harmed. Historically, with no competition, monopolies charged higher prices and frequently offered poor service. If you live an an area with only one high speed internet provider, you may still experience this.\n  The big tech companies aren\u2019t monopolies in the classic sense, but dominate because of their scale and integration. No company, large or small, has the logistics infrastructure that Amazon does. Amazon\u2019s customers, though, aren\u2019t complaining. They love free, next-day delivery for almost anything. Facebook has billions of daily users, and none of them pay Facebook to use their services.\n  Similarly, few users feel they are harmed by Google\u2019s dominance. Users prefer Google despite very credible alternatives like Microsoft\u2019s Bing. A key factor in keeping Google users loyal is that they can find what they need with lower effort. As long as using Google is faster and easier, searchers will gravitate to it.\n  In fact,  Google itself disputes that third party websites are being harmed as described by Fishkin. They note that many searches don\u2019t result in a click because the searcher refines their query or uses a link like \u201crelated searches.\u201d They also point out that users can interact with a business directly without having to click. For example, a customer who viewed the address and operating hours of a local business could visit that business despite the lack of a click.\n  Beyond effort-saving, an additional factor that ensures no-click searches are here to stay is the explosion in smart speaker use. If you ask your Google Assistant or Alexa a question, you don\u2019t want multiple options to get the information. You want the answer.\n  I predict that Google will continue to use and expand its no-click results. Absent legislative or regulatory intervention, they have no reason to impair their user experience.

The reality was entirely different. Financial insecurity, increased parental responsibilities and anxiety about the future, along with other difficulties, prompted many to delay or forego having a baby. Economists are now projecting 300,000 fewer births in the United States this year than would have been expected before the pandemic.\n Demographic changes can have economic ramifications. Falling birthrates mean smaller generations of taxpayers will eventually be responsible for supporting larger generations of retirees. Historically, therefore, governments have viewed a declining birthrate as an existential threat, raising the spectre of decline or extinction. The question of how direct government action might encourage a higher birthrate is not new; European governments have been grappling with this question for decades, France foremost among them.\n France was the first country in Europe to undergo demographic transition, a sustained drop in both mortality and birth rates. Most European states experienced the transition gradually; mortality rates fell during the 18th and 19th centuries, yet birthrates remained high until roughly the early 20th century. In 18th-century France, they happened almost simultaneously. As a result, 19th-century demographers warned that France\u2019s population was increasing only marginally, in contrast to the rapid growth of its neighbours. Experts and reformers interpreted the country\u2019s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 as a warning of what could happen to a \u2018decadent\u2019 country heading towards depopulation.\n The urgency of the crisis intensified in the last decade of the century, when the \u2018Russian influenza\u2019 briefly increased mortality rates. This pandemic, which began in autumn 1889 and continued into early 1894, killed at least one million people globally. In France, which had registered only modest annual population gains even before the pandemic (due to the country\u2019s low birthrate), the outbreak had a sobering effect. Deaths had actually exceeded births in the years 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1895.  As coffins outnumbered cradles, France\u2019s fledgling pro-natalist movement stepped up its campaign, urging the public to have more babies and lobbying for government action. It contrasted France\u2019s modest population gains with those of its neighbours, using powerful images that, for example, represented France as a small, frail man standing next to a tall, muscular Germany.\n Historians generally see the years following the First World War as the moment when French elected officials began systematically trying to influence population trends. After sustaining devastating numbers of casualties during the conflict, France\u2019s prospects for demographic recovery seemed poor. While there was some population growth in the interwar years (1919-39), this was due mostly to immigration, rather than an excess of births over deaths. The sluggish growth gave pro-natalist rhetoric a convincing sense of urgency. As the pro-natalist leader Jacques Bertillon wrote in 1919, France\u2019s victory in 1918 would be meaningless if its low birthrate continued to leave the country vulnerable to invasion.\n As French policy makers and reformers tried to encourage more births, they had to grapple with the question of why the birthrate was low to begin with. Pro-natalists offered explanations for the trend towards small families, including the modern desire for social mobility, migration to cities from country villages, tax and inheritance laws and the high cost of housing and education. Beyond financial and logistical obstacles, they saw a much more insidious cause. Many people, women specifically, simply did not want large families.\n Gender had everything to do with this assessment. Pro-natalists asserted that women\u2019s declining fertility rates were symptomatic of the breakdown of the family and gender roles. Propaganda conjured up images of a vast epidemic of modern women lacking a maternal instinct and choosing a life of voluntary sterility as they cared more about maintaining a fashionable figure than devoting themselves to a family. These images were more rhetoric than reality, however. Data indicates that most women of this generation did become mothers; they may have preferred smaller families, but they were not choosing a child-free existence.\n Some government action in this period aimed to make it harder for women to choose smaller families. This included two laws passed in 1920: one making it illegal to sell or distribute contraceptive devices or information; the other strengthening the existing law punishing illegal abortions. There was also a strong push to offer an array of financial benefits and rewards, such as allowances, to families with children. This was in part to incentivise more births and make it easier to support larger families. It was also about encouraging the population to see the process of producing and raising the next generation of soldiers, workers and mothers as a collective responsibility. Such propaganda made it clear that those who chose to have few or no children \u2013 and it was usually presented as a choice \u2013 would have to help support the children of more prolific households. It depicted exhausted parents raising large families in squalid conditions, while childless couples lived in luxury, an injustice that could only be corrected through family benefits.\n In the decades that followed, the French government expanded many of these pro-natalist benefits, and introduced new ones. Naturally, France\u2019s history of demographic policies raises the question of just how effective such measures can be. After the Second World War, for example, family allowances were generous, sometimes even representing an entire second income for low-income families with many children. This benefit was lauded as a success and credited with contributing to France\u2019s postwar baby boom. In one 1950 survey, for example, 97 per cent of respondents agreed that family allowances encouraged a higher birthrate. Yet scholars are unconvinced that these benefits actually explain France\u2019s postwar baby boom. Similar demographic phenomena were recorded in most western countries after the war, including in countries such as the US that did not deploy a pro-natalist strategy. Significantly, too, while relatively generous family benefits continued beyond the 1960s, France\u2019s postwar baby boom did not.\n As in the US, in France the pandemic has now accelerated what was already a downward trend.

you&#39;re wondering, you&#39;d need about 2000 feature-length movies to occupy that many waking hours.\n Sit back and relax. Jupiter is more than 3 times as far as we just traveled.\n   This is where we might at least see some asteroids to wake us up.  \u00a0 Too bad they&#39;re all too small to appear on this map.\n  If you were on a road trip, driving at 75mi/hr, it would have taken you over 500 years to get here from earth.\n All these distances are just averages, mind you.  \u00a0 The distance between planets really depends on where the two planets are in their orbits around the sun. \u00a0 So if you&#39;re planning on taking a trip to Jupiter, you might want to use a different map.\n If you plan it right, you can actually move relatively quickly between planets. \u00a0 The New Horizons space craft that launched in 2006 only took 13 months to get to Jupiter. \u00a0 Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;ll take a lot less than 13 months to scroll there.\n     I guess this is why most maps of the solar system aren&#39;t drawn to scale. \u00a0  It&#39;s not hard to draw the planets.  \u00a0 It&#39;s the empty space that&#39;s a problem.\n   When it comes to things like the age of the earth, the number of snowflakes in Siberia, the national debt... \u00a0 Those things are too much for our brains to handle.\n We need to reduce things down to something we can see or experience directly in order to understand them.\n We&#39;re always trying to come up with metaphors for big numbers. Even so, they never seem to work.\n  You would need    of these screens lined up side-by-side to show this whole map at once.\n If this map was printed from a quality printer (300 pixels per inch) the earth would be invisible, and the width of the paper would need to be 475 feet. \u00a0 475 feet is about 1 and 1/2 football fields.\n Even though we don\u2019t really understand them, a lot can happen within these massive lengths of time and space. \u00a0  A drop of water can carve out a canyon. \u00a0 An amoeba can become a dolphin. \u00a0 A star can collapse on itself.\n It\u2019s easy to disregard nothingness because there\u2019s no thought available to encapsulate it. There\u2019s no metaphor that fits because, by definition, once the nothingness becomes tangible, it ceases to exist.\n It\u2019s a good thing we have these tiny stars and planets, otherwise we\u2019d have no point of reference at all. \u00a0 We\u2019d be surrounded by this stuff that our minds weren\u2019t built to understand.\n All this emptiness really could drive you nuts. For instance, if you\u2019re in a sensory deprivation tank for too long, your brain starts to make things up. You see and hear things that aren\u2019t there.\n  &#34;Sorry, Humanity,&#34; says Evolution. &#34;What with all the jaguars trying to eat you, the parasites in your fur, and the never-ending need for a decent steak, I was a little busy. I didn\u2019t exactly have time to come up with a way to conceive of vast stretches of nothingness.&#34;\n Neurologically speaking, we really only deal with matter of a certain size, and energy of a few select wavelengths. For everything else, we have to make up mental models and see if they match up to the tiny shreds of hard evidence that actually feel real.\n The mental models provided by mathematics are extremely helpful when trying to make sense of these vast distances, but still... \u00a0 Abstraction is pretty unsatisfying.\n When you hear people talk about how, &#34;there\u2019s more to this universe than our minds can conceive of&#34; it&#39;s usually a way to get you to go along with a half-baked plot point about UFOs or super-powers in a sci-fi series that you&#39;re watching late at night when you can\u2019t get to sleep.\n Even when Shakespeare wrote: &#34;There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy\u201d \u2013 he&#39;s basically trying to give us a loophole to make the ghost in the story more believable.\n But all this empty space, these things of a massive scale, really are more than our minds can conceive of. The maps and metaphors fail to do them justice.\n You look at one tiny dot, then you look for the next tiny dot. Everything in between is inconsequential and fairly boring.\n   If the proton of a hydrogen atom was the size of the sun on this map, we would need 11 more of these maps to show the average distance to the electron.\n Some theories say all this emptiness is actually full of energy or dark matter and that nothing can truly be empty... \u00a0 but come on, only ordinary matter has any meaning for us.\n  If so much of the universe is made up of emptiness, what does that mean to people like us, living on a tiny speck in the middle of all of it?\n  With so much emptiness, aren&#39;t stars, planets, and people just glitches in an otherwise elegant and uniform nothingness, like pieces of lint on a black sweater?\n But without the tiny dots for it to stretch between, there would be no emptiness to measure, and for that matter, no one around to measure it.\n You might say that so much emptiness makes the tiny bits of matter that much more meaningful - simply by the fact that, against all odds, they  aren&#39;t empty. \u00a0 If you&#39;re drowning in the middle of the ocean, a floating piece of driftwood is a pretty big deal.\n What if trillions of stars and planets were crammed right next to each other? They wouldn&#39;t be special at all.\n It seems like we are both pathetically insignificant, and miraculously important at the same time.\n Whether you more strongly feel the monumental significance of tiny things or the massive void between them depends on who you are, and how your brain chemistry is balanced at a particular moment.  We walk around with miniature, emotional versions of the universe inside of us.\n It&#39;s reassuring to know that no matter how depressingly bleak or ridiculously momentous we feel, the universe, judging by its current structure, seems well aware of both extremes.\n The fact that you&#39;re here, in the midst of all this nothing, is pretty amazing when you stop and think about it.\n  Might as well stop now. We&#39;ll need to scroll through 6,771 more maps like this before we see anything else.

The effects of inflation not only are greater, but disproportionately greater, for poorer people. Those with higher incomes often offset price increases (goods, services) with increased income. Furthermore, prices often increase more for basic needs than for luxury items, a phenomenon economists call \u201cinflation inequality.\u201d Simply put, low-income families\u2019 budgets will stress and strain as they confront the coming rising costs of the essentials they need (food, energy, transport, child care).\n  The economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable Americans too often tends to be discussed as a matter of the latest Washington program or policy. Those acting in the name of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d need to pay more attention to basic economic indicators such as employment rates by demographic group, incomes and, yes, inflation, if we want to truly understand what\u2019s happening not just to the economy in a general sense but specifically to the most vulnerable within it.\n  As coming waves of inflation will demonstrate, the fundamentals\u2014and not the latest federal government initiative\u2014will most directly characterize and affect the economic well-being of the most economically vulnerable in our country.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.
