Given the current economic climate and the increased reliance jobseekers and professionals everywhere are placing on LinkedIn, our responsibility is to help create safe experiences for our members. We couldn\u2019t be clearer that hate speech is not tolerated on our platform. LinkedIn is a strong part of our members\u2019 professional identities for the entirety of their career \u2014 it can be seen by their employer, colleagues and potential business partners.\u201d\n In the EU \u2018illegal hate speech\u2019 can mean content that espouses racist or xenophobic views, or which seeks to incite violence or hatred against groups of people because of their race, skin color, religion or ethnic origin etc.\n A number of Member States have national laws on the issue \u2014 and some have  passed their own legislation specifically targeted at the digital sphere. So the EU Code is supplementary to any actual hate speech legislation. It is also non-legally binding.\n The initiative kicked off  back in 2016 \u2014 when a handful of tech giants (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Microsoft) agreed to accelerate takedowns of illegal speech (or well, attach their brand names to the PR opportunity associated with saying they would).\n Since the Code became operational, a handful of other tech platforms have joined \u2014 with video sharing platform  TikTok signing up last October, for example.\n But plenty of digital services (notably messaging platforms) still aren\u2019t participating. Hence the Commission\u2019s call for more digital services companies to get on board.\n At the same time, the EU is in the process of firming up hard rules in the area of illegal content.\n L ast year the Commission proposed broad updates (aka the  Digital Services Act) to existing ecommerce rules  to set operational ground rules that they said are intended to bring online laws in line with offline legal requirements \u2014 in areas such as illegal content, and indeed illegal goods.  So, in the coming years, the bloc will get a legal framework that tackles \u2014 at least at a high level \u2014 the hate speech issue, not merely a voluntary Code.\n The EU also recently adopted legislation on terrorist content takedowns ( this April) \u2014 which is set to start applying to online platforms from next year.\n But it\u2019s interesting to note that, on the perhaps more controversial issue of hate speech (which can deeply intersect with freedom of expression), the Commission wants to maintain a self-regulatory channel alongside incoming legislation \u2014 as Reynders\u2019 remarks underline.\n Brussels evidently sees value in having a mixture of \u2018carrots and sticks\u2019 where hot button digital regulation issues are concerned. Especially in the controversial \u2018danger zone\u2019 of speech regulation.\n So, while the DSA is set to bake in standardized \u2018notice and response\u2019 procedures to help digital players swiftly respond to illegal content, by keeping the hate speech Code around it means there\u2019s a parallel conduit where key platforms could be encouraged by the Commission to commit to going further than the letter of the law (and thereby enable lawmakers to sidestep any controversy if they were to try to push more expansive speech moderation measures into legislation).\n  The EU has \u2014 for several years \u2014 had a  voluntary a Code of Practice on Online Disinformation too. (And a spokeswoman for LinkedIn confirmed it has been signed up to that since its inception, also through its parent company Microsoft.)\n And while lawmakers recently  announced a plan to beef that Code up \u2014 to make it \u201cmore binding\u201d, as they oxymoronically put it \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t planning to legislate on that (even fuzzier) speech issue.\n In further public remarks today on the hate speech Code, the Commission said that a fifth monitoring exercise in June 2020 showed that on average companies reviewed 90% of reported content within 24 hours and removed 71% of content that was considered to be illegal hate speech.\n It added that it welcomed the results \u2014 but also called for signatories to redouble their efforts, especially around providing feedback to users and in how they approach transparency around reporting and removals.\n The Commission has also repeatedly calls for platforms signed up to the disinformation Code to do more to tackle the tsunami of \u2018fake news\u2019 being fenced on their platforms, including \u2014 on the public health front \u2014 what they last year dubbed a  coronavirus infodemic.\n The COVID-19 crisis has undoubtedly contributed to concentrating lawmakers\u2019 minds on the complex issue of how to effectively regulate the digital sphere and likely accelerated a number of EU efforts.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "The leader of the Vlog Squad built an empire on goofy pranks and wild stunts. Now he\u2019s under fire for turning trauma into content. Can he make a comeback in a culture driven by clicks?\n         The YouTuber David Dobrik is driving his white Tesla through the verdant hills of suburban Los Angeles, explaining the challenges of selling thin-crust-style pizza in L.A., his assistant Natalie texting in the back seat and Billy Joel on pause on the stereo, when he abruptly stops talking. \u201cI got this,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, guys.\u201d He leaps out of the driver\u2019s seat to help an elderly lady with a walker cross the street.\n Just a few short hours ago, on the tail end of several controversies surrounding Dobrik and his   collective, the Vlog Squad, squad member Jeff Wittek had released a video alleging that Dobrik permanently maimed him in an elaborate stunt gone wrong. All over social media, people were calling Dobrik a sociopath and accusing him of mining his friends\u2019 trauma for content. And here he was, blithely chatting about his new pizza franchise and helping an old lady cross the street.\n  After a few seconds, Dobrik jumps back into the car, giggling. \u201cWe did that on purpose for you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to have a grandma crossing the street, but I couldn\u2019t keep my composure.\u201d As we drive away, the woman, who Natalie and David tell me was an actor paid $200 simply to walk in front of our car, waves and grins.\n When I ask Dobrik if this scene was staged as a way to distract from or counteract the effects of the Wittek video, he looks at me, confused and maybe a little bit wounded that I would so grossly misinterpret the intention behind a fun prank. \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were just trying to do something stupid and silly.\u201d And I laugh, partially because it  is stupid and silly, but also because I\u2019m in a $150,000 car in the Hollywood Hills with an extremely wealthy and charismatic stranger and his assistant, and I don\u2019t want to seem like I can\u2019t take a joke, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure what the joke is.\n Such is my initiation into David Dobrik\u2019s world: where the lines are constantly blurred between fantasy and reality, what\u2019s genuine and what\u2019s content; where everyone is having fun, no one could possibly get hurt, and the rehabilitation of one\u2019s reputation is just $200 and a call to a casting agency away.\n Calling Dobrik a YouTuber is sort of like calling Batman a morose vigilante with a trust fund: While technically true, it\u2019s far from the whole story. Dobrik is the leader of the Vlog Squad, a motley crew of aspiring comedians, Instagram sexpots, and other sundry influencers and creators who zip around Los Angeles filming gross-out pranks, stunts, and lavish giveaways, resulting in an aesthetic that\u2019s a cross of  Jackass,  Entourage, and  The Oprah Winfrey Show. Dobrik has racked up more than 18 million followers on his main channel alone and, in 2020, was estimated by  Forbes to have earned $15.5 million. His white Tesla has been a fixture on the streets of L.A., portending for unsuspecting passersby free iPads or cash or cars, or, if nothing else, the tantalizing promise of 36 million eyeballs on them.\n  Those who follow Dobrik\u2019s slickly edited, four-minute-and-20-second vlogs are intimately familiar with the members of his crew: Jason Nash, a 48-year-old former comic turned co-host of Dobrik\u2019s podcast  Views; aspiring musician and straight man Scotty Sire; reformed bad boy Wittek; Corinna Kopf, a former Hooters waitress and tinder for dumb-blonde jokes; and Natalie Mariduena, Dobrik\u2019s comely 24-year-old assistant and high school best friend, who\u2019s perpetually rumored to be dating him. (Mariduena is actually dating fellow Vlog Squad member Todd Smith, but that doesn\u2019t stop her and Dobrik from playing up a flirtation whenever possible, as she acknowledges: \u201cPeople love seeing us together. They love us interacting with each other and doing funny stuff. Relationship stuff on the internet always is like good clickbait. It gets good views and whatnot.\u201d)\n Functionally, the Vlog Squad primarily serve as yes-men; when they\u2019re not confronting one of their deep-seated phobias or performing some daredevil stunt, they\u2019re on the sidelines, laughing uproariously at the action. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like the modern-day  Friends, with a laugh track,\u201d says Wittek of squad members\u2019 roles. \u201cIt tells someone that this is a joke, that it\u2019s OK to laugh at it here.\u201d Many of the more popular recurring characters in Dobrik\u2019s videos are his childhood friends, which helps to foster the gang-of-goofballs dynamic. His housemate Ilya, Mariduena, and Mariduena\u2019s own assistant Reggie are all from Dobrik\u2019s Illinois hometown. \u201cHe\u2019s so attached to his childhood and his youth and his inner being as a kid,\u201d says Mariduena.\n In the center of it all is Dobrik with his camera, affable, puppy-eyed, and perpetually amused by everything and everybody. In person, he is just as unfailingly enthusiastic. \u201cEverybody that has money, everybody that has success, hides all of it. It\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t talk about, or like a secret,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I like sharing all of it. I love showing people things. I\u2019m obsessed with it.\u201d\n  The moment I step into his $9.5 million Sherman Oaks mansion, he does just that. First, he brings me over to his Hawaiian Punch water fountain, inspired by the Adam Sandler film  Mr. Deeds. Next, he shows me his office, where he records his podcast, and which I recognize from one of his recent apology videos, where he was flanked by a Kids\u2019 Choice Award and a potted Baby Groot. We end in the living room, which looks as if it\u2019s been decorated by a 12-year-old with an unlimited budget: There\u2019s a life-size R2D2 animatronic he bought via his friend John Stamos; a Buzz Lightyear portrait made of Rubik\u2019s cubes; a framed photo of a text exchange referencing his losing $288,000 on GameStop stocks (\u201cI wanted something out of that negative situation, like some kind of art piece,\u201d he says. \u201cI told the internet I only lost 80K, so if you could tell them I didn\u2019t lose that much, that\u2019d be great\u201d); rows upon rows of hard candy. Mariduena and Dobrik\u2019s other assistant, an amiable young blond woman named Taylor Hudson who also regularly appears in his videos, stay anchored to the kitchen island on their phones and laptops, the adults in the room, even though both are also in their mid-twenties.\n Shaggy-haired and casually dressed in a Dodgers cap, track pants, and a T-shirt from the restaurant Jon and Vinny\u2019s, Dobrik reminds me of Tom Hanks\u2019 character at the end of  Big, after he finds the Zoltar machine \u2014 a child cosplaying in an adult man\u2019s body. At one point, his attention wavers and he starts casually roaming around his kitchen on a penny board. I half expect someone to come out and yell at him to stop doing that in the house; but, of course, he is 24, and it is his $9.5 million house, so no one does. In all, he comes off as someone who is constantly in awe of the cosmic ridiculousness of his own good fortune. \u201cDavid hasn\u2019t really experienced much pain in his life,\u201d notes Wittek. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty smooth upbringing for him. His life has kind of been just straight up and not really many downs.\u201d\n  Dobrik moved to this new home in January, but he has not yet sold his old house nearby, allowing friends to use it for shoots. The next day I\u2019ll get a tour of that one, too, with Dobrik pointing out the detritus of old stunts, videos, and branding campaigns: a Chipotle-burrito claw machine the company gave him after releasing a burrito in his honor; a miniature Tesla; a ceiling damaged by an elephant toothpaste prank. As we walk through the garage, he tells me about a time a few years ago when he found a homeless person asleep on his couch at 2 a.m., wearing his merch; the man had defecated all over his couch. I ask if he posted it to YouTube, and he says yes.\n  \u201cBecause I\u2019ll never remember it better than if it was on film,\u201d he says. \u201cI just love filming things. I don\u2019t get why people don\u2019t film everything. Everything should be filmed.\u201d\n  At the start of 2020, Dobrik was uniquely positioned for crossover success, something he is not shy about admitting he has always craved. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s almost like a caste system in the entertainment world, where if you\u2019re a YouTuber or a TikToker, you\u2019re just branded as that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with accepting myself because I\u2019ve always wanted the respect of the traditional world. But I\u2019ve always known that at one point, the traditional world is going to meet up with being here, and it\u2019s all going to be the same.\u201d\n With the 2019 launch of his photo app Dispo, which mimics the look and the experience of developing disposable-camera pictures, Dobrik had crossed over into the tech space. Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian was a lead investor, and at one point, the app had a nearly $200 million valuation. Also in the works were a TV series and a pizza franchise called Doughbrik\u2019s, as well as brand deals with corporate giants like HelloFresh, DoorDash, and SeatGeek. \u201cHe\u2019s inherently entrepreneurial,\u201d says Joe Gagliese, CEO of influencer marketing firm Viral Nation, who\u2019s known Dobrik since he was getting started on the now-defunct platform Vine in 2013. \u201cHe was knocking on the door of being the face of major brands across the U.S. He was right there.\u201d\n  And then, he wasn\u2019t. In the spring of 2021, former Vlog Squad members like Seth Francois and Nik Keswani, a.k.a. Big Nik, started to accuse Dobrik of building a culture of bullying, cultural insensitivity, and consent violations. In March,  Insider published the account of a woman named \u201cHannah,\u201d who accused Dobrik\u2019s longtime friend and Vlog Squad member \u201cDurte\u201d Dom Zeglaitis of sexually assaulting her in a 2018 incident that was partially captured by Dobrik on video. Major brands started to distance themselves from Dobrik, and he resigned from the board of Dispo. His fans, primarily zoomers who had come of age watching his energetic vlogs, also started to turn on him. He lost a total of 400,000 followers during March and April, according to SocialBlade data.\n Then came the revelation, the day of our first meeting in April, that he had grievously injured Wittek in a stunt involving an excavator on a lake in Utah, inspired by an extreme-sports YouTuber named Devin Super Tramp. The footage reignited an outcry from people accusing Dobrik of exploiting Vlog Squad members and endangering them for views. And even though this is far from a rare phenomenon in the beef-driven, controversy-fueled, caps-lock-titled world of YouTube, the fact that Dobrik had amassed a reputation as something of a wholesome boy next door (despite the bulk of his content being fairly profane and fratty) made his fall from grace even more precipitous. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on such a pedestal anymore,\u201d says Trisha Paytas, a YouTuber who was briefly in the Vlog Squad. Paytas, who goes by they/them pronouns, has frequently criticized the group on their podcast  Frenemies.\n During my visit, Dobrik was on a self-imposed social media hiatus; though he\u2019d previously spent most of his time shooting, editing, or ideating content, now his days consisted of little more than the occasional pizza-franchise meeting. (He resumed posting on June 15th, with a video titled \u201cSURPRISING MY FRIENDS!!!\u201d which showed his squad on vacation in Hawaii and made no mention of the controversies.) Our meeting had been in the works for a while, before the  Insider story broke, and in the days leading up to it, as his sponsors fell away and the social media mobs swarmed, I became more and more sure that he was going to cancel. But he didn\u2019t, and as we sat by his infinity pool on a sunny Friday afternoon, it was clear why: He was still struggling to make sense of what he had done to warrant such ire.\n  \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that what we were making had such power. I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he says, looking smaller than his five-foot-10 frame in an oversize sweatshirt. \u201cSo when [the  Insider story came out], I was like, \u2018What? I\u2019m responsible for someone making a bad decision?\u2019 I didn\u2019t get it. But it was all because of this environment of wanting to put on this show.\u201d\n As a child growing up in Ko\u0161ice, Slovakia, Dobrik was reserved and \u201chighly sensitive,\u201d his mother, Kristina, says. He\u2019d slept in his parents\u2019 bedroom until he was five, and would cry every morning before he went to preschool. Once, she recalls, she brought him toys to play with in the sandbox, and some bigger kids came over and took them. But David didn\u2019t get upset. \u201cHe just sat down and was just very happy watching how they played with his toys,\u201d she says. \u201cI was happy he didn\u2019t make any fuss about it, though I didn\u2019t want him to be a pushover. But he was just so happy he could share his toys.\u201d\n When he was five years old, Dobrik\u2019s parents moved to Toledo, Ohio, where Kristina had previously lived for a year with an elderly relative after graduating from high school. Kristina had learned some English from watching  Full House reruns and loved how friendly people were in America. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea to go overseas, to make a better life for David,\u201d she says. When the family relocated to Skokie, Illinois, outside of Chicago, David followed them there, flying on a plane from Slovakia all by himself. They later moved to nearby Vernon Hills, an upper-middle-class suburb, where Dobrik\u2019s father started a real-estate-photography company, while Kristina stayed at home with David.\n Kristina says David underwent something of a metamorphosis in America, blossoming from a shy kid to a gregarious class clown; his first words in English, she says, were \u201cgood boy,\u201d which is what his kindergarten teachers called him. At his home, Dobrik shows me an essay he wrote in high school, in which he recounts his journey from Slovakia and expresses his joy at having left the country. Because of his DACA status, he has not been back to the country of his birth since he was seven years old, but he has little interest. \u201cI was obsessed with America. I thought it was like the coolest fucking place in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom how I remember it, Slovakia is very much like if you were to watch a documentary about the Soviet Union or Russia that shows kids in a line with trays and an old lunch lady putting beans on a tray. I almost see it, like, in a different filter, like in sepia. It\u2019s so clich\u00e9, but here is like the land of opportunity, and you can become anything you want.\u201d\n   Dobrik didn\u2019t have a girlfriend in high school \u2014 he was \u201ctoo squirrel-brained\u201d for that, says his former tennis coach Shannon Etnyre \u2014 but he was friendly and generally well-liked, the type of kid who\u2019d randomly offer hugs to students in the halls. \u201cHe was perfectly right in the middle and friends with everybody,\u201d says Mariduena. He was also a mediocre student, putting in just enough effort to pass his classes. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why it mattered,\u201d says Dobrik.\n Yet even though he spent the majority of his time arguing with teachers over doing work, many of them, like his English teacher Jeff Killinger, couldn\u2019t help but like him. \u201cHis philosophy was, \u2018If I can cheat or in some way get this work done in a way that doesn\u2019t require effort, then that\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d says Killinger, who became a mentor to Dobrik after graduation, fielding FaceTime calls and requests to help with Dobrik\u2019s taxes. \u201c[Every day] I\u2019d say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna let this kid do this to me tomorrow,\u2019 and every day he would. He was just that charming and funny.\u201d\n Dobrik took an equally laissez-faire approach to tennis, which he started playing as a young child and continued throughout high school. Etnyre remembers him as an \u201cawkward-looking freshman with a Justin Bieber haircut\u201d who was nonetheless \u201cjust destroying on the tennis court.\u201d Ultimately, Dobrik was good enough to become all-state and be scouted by various universities. \u201cI liked that if you fuck up, that you\u2019re to blame,\u201d he says of his attraction to the sport. \u201cI hated the pressure of letting the team down. It\u2019s so much easier when you\u2019re just playing by yourself and then you fuck up. It\u2019s just on you.\u201d (Despite this aversion to pressure, Dobrik has an indisputably competitive side: When I watch him play at Mulholland Tennis Club a few hours later, he is intensely focused, chiding his doubles partner Mariduena for missing shots. \u201cWe\u2019re just having fun right now,\u201d Jason Nash, who was in recovery from hip surgery, calls from the sidelines. \u201cNothing fun about this,\u201d Dobrik retorts.)\n  Though Dobrik had murky aspirations of joining the entertainment business in some capacity, he was always fascinated by the idea of making money. \u201cA lot of people that come from overseas that are immigrants and first generation are really, really hungry to be successful, and that was definitely his case,\u201d says Dobrik\u2019s best friend and housemate Ilya Fedorovich, who was born in Belarus. \u201cHis family and my family, we\u2019re not the richest. We survive by our means. I think that one of the reasons that he\u2019s supersuccessful now is that he didn\u2019t have much when he was growing up, but he wanted a lot.\u201d In high school, when Dobrik was working as a waiter, he and his friends would discuss their incomes with one another in the school cafeteria. \u201cPeople say money doesn\u2019t buy happiness. And I completely get that,\u201d Dobrik says. \u201cBut I think you can alleviate so much stress and so much burden from money, so it helps you to the road of happiness.\u201d\n When Dobrik was 16, Mariduena introduced him to the social media outlet that would change his life forever: the short-form video platform Vine. At the time he joined, Vine was starting to become a launching pad for creators like King Bach, Nash Grier, and Dobrik\u2019s future girlfriend Liza Koshy. Even though he only had a few thousand followers early on, Dobrik saw the potential. \u201cI saw the people making money on Vine and actually getting brand deals and moving out to L.A., and I was like, \u2018Holy fuck, I think I could turn this into a career,\u2019\u201d he says. He won his first brand deal, $50 for a to-do-list app called Do!, in high school, and celebrated with his friends at Buffalo Wild Wings.\n What\u2019s notable about Dobrik\u2019s early Vines is not just how young he looks \u2014 he has braces, wears rubber bracelets, and mugs for the camera with his trademark puppyish enthusiasm \u2014 but how much darker they are than his more aw-shucks YouTube presence. In one Vine, he pretends to be a disabled person in a wheelchair; in another, he chides a friend for making an Asian joke, saying, \u201cThey have enough on their plate. Like cats and dogs\u201d; and in another, he says the n-word. He issued a vague apology for these offenses last summer.\n  In speaking about his earlier content, Dobrik blames a combination of the freewheeling climate on Vine and his youth. \u201cI was a fucking 16-year-old idiot,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was just chaos. And it was just the way Vine was. It was so much darker, and no one batted an eye when you did stuff like that.\u201d But even though he pivoted away from explicit edgelord humor once he started blowing up, there is an element of his vlog persona that has remained consistent. Much of the humor is contingent on knowing the identities of the people in his videos: the skeevy older man (Nash), the slutty girl (Kopf), the heartthrob (Smith), the fat kid (Nick Antonyan, a.k.a. Jonah), the bad boy (Wittek). Even though it\u2019s his channel, Dobrik is rarely the butt of the joke.\n A semester into his first year at College of Lake County in Illinois, Dobrik visited Los Angeles to network with other Viners as a trial period for potentially moving out West. On the plane ride back to Chicago, he says, he had the distinct sense that L.A. was his home. \u201cIt was a dramatic, Troy Bolton,  High School Musical-type scene. Like, \u2018This is my dream, I have to pursue it,\u2019\u201d he says. With two of his high school friends, including Dom, and a third friend he\u2019d met on Vine, he moved into a small apartment in West Hollywood. His father was a guara\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-26 00:28:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "youtube,2020,dobrik,turning", "title": "David Dobrik\u7684\u6982\u51b5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u611a\u8822\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\u81ed\u540d\u662d\u7740\u7684\u611a\u8822\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u57282020\u5e74\u8d5a\u53d6\u4e861550\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5728\u706b\u707e\u4e2d\u906d\u5230\u9020\u6210\u521b\u4f24 ", "title_en": "Profile of David Dobrik, a YouTuber notorious for goofy pranks who earned an estimated $15.5M in 2020, and is now under fire for turning trauma into content", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/david-dobrik-youtube-vlog-squad-profile-1185706/amp/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["youtube", "2020", "dobrik", "turning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "3bc79af79f487823f46ad624d21a285b.jpg", "infoid": 1068266, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Rust\u88ab\u6392\u540d\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002 \u5728\u672c\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60Rust\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9762\u3002 \u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u8981\u505a...

In a department store, shoes are a subcategory of clothing, while your favorite thermos is probably in the travel department.\n In any Github organization, there are teams within teams within teams. In any large department store there are categories deeply nested. In any recipe book, there are many ways to classify food.\n   Jake (my boyfriend) and I have been exploring relational database concepts out of interest and pure geekery. This was a fun problem that I gave him and we got to work it out together. It was so fun we wanted to share! We won&#39;t beat the bush around with PostgreSQL installation, security, setup, blah blah at this time, let&#39;s just have some pure database fun for a few minutes!\n  Handle a high amount of reads and a small amount of writes over a small to medium amount of keys (in this case, a text field), each of which  possibly has a reference to a parent key.\n In this concrete example, we will replicate team structures. Start with the teams existing inside some small organization, each with a  name and possibly a  parent:\n    For this exercise, the exact format of the  path is not important. An HTML string, a comma separated list, or any ordered collection is acceptable.\n   For the first solution, ensure you&#39;re familiar with the ideas of    NULL,   Primary Keys, and   Foreign Keys. We&#39;ll need these for building safe, efficient linking between teams and their parents.\n We&#39;ll then use a   Materialized View to create a sort of  cache of the point-in-time team structure.

As a Panasonic spokesperson  confirmed on Friday, \u201cour relationship with Tesla as a business partner will not change going forward.\u201d\n Panasonic\u2019s share price increased 4.53% in the morning session after Nikkei reported the stock sale.\n    Panasonic invested in Tesla in 2010, shortly after its initial public offering on the Nasdaq exchange, after negotiating its first supply deal with the manufacturer in 2009. The move provided Tesla with crucial financial backing while also advancing Panasonic\u2019s vehicle battery business.\n The Japanese firm paid $21.15 per share for around 1.4 million shares. Its investment was valued at 81 billion yen, or $730 million, according to its annual securities filing for the fiscal year ending March 2020.\n Later Tesla\u2019s stock price began to rise in the spring of 2020, hitting $900 per share at one point \u2013 nine times its worth at the end of March of that year after accounting for variables such as a stock split.\n  The sale contributes to Panasonic\u2019s growing need for finance. In April, the Japanese multinational electronic giant announced a $7.1 billion acquisition of Blue Yonder, a U.S. supply chain software supplier, as the company looks to expand its car battery operations.\n Panasonic had sold all of its Tesla stock by the end of March. As a result, the gain accounted for a large portion of the company\u2019s 429.9 billion yen ($3.88 billion) in \u201cproceeds from sale and redemption of investments\u201d in its consolidated statements of cash flows for that fiscal year, which was up approximately 380 billion yen from the previous year.\n  Despite the 2021 correction, investors have seen a good return on investment (ROI) due to the outstanding 2020 growth.\n According to our  previous research, Tesla shares returned 224.93% between June 2020 and June 2021, outperforming some of its key competitors.\n   The worldwide semiconductor scarcity is to blame for the fall in the stock price. However, for Tesla to maintain its outstanding return on equity investment, the firm must guarantee that elements such as deliveries remain on track.\n As per our  statistics, the anticipated Cybertruck pre-orders for the 2019 model were 1.08 million as of May 25, 2021, outpacing Tesla\u2019s previous two years of delivery, making the Cybertruck launch potentially the most anticipated event for the firm within the next year.\n   It would seem from all of this that Panasonic wishes to lessen its dependency and reliance on Tesla in order to raise funds to invest in growth opportunities.", "posttime": "2021-06-26 00:27:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7279\u65af\u62c9,\u677e\u4e0b,dumps,tesla", "title": "\u677e\u4e0b\u503e\u5012\u5176\u6574\u4e2a3.6\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u80a1\u6743 ", "title_en": "Panasonic dumps its entire $3.6B Tesla stake", "transed": 1, "url": "https://finbold.com/panasonic-dumps-its-entire-3-6-billion-tesla-stake/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7279\u65af\u62c9", "\u677e\u4e0b", "dumps", "tesla"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068262, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u8bfb\u8005\u8ba2\u9605FT  \u9009\u62e9\u8d2d\u4e70\u5ba1\u5224\u8ba2\u9605$ 1\u6301\u7eed4\u5468\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u5ba1\u5224\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u6bcf\u6708\u6536\u8d3991\u7f8e\u5143  4\u5468\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95eeFT\uff06\uff0339;

It wasn&#39;t because of poor staff recommendations. Nor did he just plain hate leaving the house.\n Bezos wanted to take over online retailing, and he used the skills he gained as a quant trader to do it. He looked at the top twenty retail products sold via catalogue, and figured out why each product worked or didn&#39;t work. He looked at storage space, shipping costs, turnaround time, market demand, etc.\n Amazon sold books not because Bezos was dissatisfied with the qualitative experience of bookstores, but because his analysis identified books as an arbitrage opportunity.\n And it worked. And others noticed, and the programmer/quant combination became the backbone of the dotcom revolution.\n But that opportunity is gone. It&#39;s been arbitraged out. Whereas ten years ago there was widespread temporary economic disequilibrium ready to be exploited, we&#39;ve now reached a state of balance. It&#39;s not that rigorous quant analysis isn&#39;t important anymore; it&#39;s just as important now as ever. It&#39;s just that supply has caught up with demand, and so being a brilliant programmer and mathematical thinker is no longer enough to guarantee retirement by age 25.\n  Back in 1995 the biggest websites were all tools: Amazon, eBay, Yahoo!, Hotmail, etc. As tools, these websites did something for the user or enabled them to do something. The way to get rich was to build the tool that did the most stuff for the most people.\n Today, all the good tools already been taken. That&#39;s why the hottest web startups today are not tools, but spaces: MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Digg, Reddit, Squidoo, etc. If eBay is a single paintbrush, then MySpace is more like an art studio: a nice place to hang out with friends while working on similar projects and sharing a common toolset.\n And in order of importance, what each tool does is less important than the social interaction that goes on around them.\n Don&#39;t believe me? Remember oFoto and Shutterfly and Webshots? Remember what happened to all these sites? Flickr.\n As tools, all of these predecessors worked as well or better than Flickr. (Remember Flickr&#39;s early flash uploader?). Flickr&#39;s innovation was to transform photos from an object of art into an object of sociability, and to transform photosharing from a set of tools into a community.\n So, what does it all mean? To quote Howard Rheingold, &#34;The &#39;killer app&#39; of tomorrow won&#39;t be software or hardware devices, but the social practices they make possible.&#34; In the past, the key to creating the next blockbuster was having the best understanding of how people used technology. Today&#39;s big hits are coming not from those who have the best understanding of how people actively use technology, but rather from those who have the best understanding of how design decisions tacitly shape\u00a0 social interactions between users.\n For example, understanding the effect that Reddit&#39;s karma system has on the quality of discussion.\u00a0  Using social psychology to motivate user contribution to online communities.Grokking the difference between the bond between a user and the group and the bond between multiple users, and being able to make intelligent design decisions accordingly.\n We&#39;ve reached the point where there is a growing body of academic research into online communities, but very little of it is making its way back into practice. That&#39;s partially understandable, since much of it is tentative or inconclusive. But what this early research is telling us is that, by and large, human behavior is human behavior. That is, the Internet is at best only a mediating variable, and a fairly predictable one at that. What this means is that we can apply to the ideas of traditional sociology, organization behavior, psychology, educational theory, etc. to online community design.\n  By understanding the Internet&#39;s role as a mediating variable in social interaction, we can apply the knowledge of traditional social science to actively designing online communities. They don&#39;t teach courses on this in college. You can&#39;t buy a book on it on Amazon. But by combining the research with a little intuition and some good old fashioned mucking around, we can go a long way.\n Look around and you&#39;ll see a lot of mistakes being made. And mostly it&#39;s the same mistakes being made over and over again. It&#39;s as if we&#39;re in another bubble.\n During the first dotcom bubble, we had lots of startups run by MBAs that were getting trounced by the competition run by hackers.

Chidi founded it in 2017 alongside Quinn Lundberg, a women\u2019s healthcare policy advocate. After the duo  raised $3 million in seed financing last year, Loom is now officially launching its first course to the public: a Pregnancy and Postpartum program.\n   The program, which costs $90 for 12 months of access, includes asynchronous and synchronous learning components.\n The video repository, which Chidi describes as a \u201cMasterclass, but for sexual reproductive health,\u201d includes videos about medicated, unmedicated, and cesarean birth, as well as advice on choosing a care provider. The live components include weekly small pods, led by mostly by clinicians, going into specific issues and concerns that mothers might be facing, such as postpartum care or trimester tips. There\u2019s also a monthly talk hosted by Chidi, in which the entire community is invited to dive into a singular topic within the pregnancy and postpartum world. For now, these sessions are held over Zoom, but Loom is in the process of developing its own video platform.\n Chidi said that the company is more interested in giving users instantaneous and actionable value from content, instead of getting them to view or complete all of the content. However, that\u2019s easier said than done. The company needs to balance engaging material with nuanced, clinician-approved medical advice. Right now, Chidi teaches much of the content, and despite her upbringing and experience, Doulas are not considered medical professionals. Loom is working with research institutions, community organizations, and the Reproductive Justice Framework \u2013 an anti-racist movement about reproductive rights and social justice \u2013 to develop its content.\n Expectful, a company similar in mission to Loom, raised $3 million this year.

\n\u7814\u7a76IPFS Evereum\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fWeb ", "note_en": "The Domain Name System (DNS) matches names to resources. Instead of typing 104.18.26.46 to access the Cloudflare Blog, you type blog.cloudflare.com and, using DNS, the domain name resolves to 104.18.26.46, the Cloudflare Blog IP address.\n Similarly, distributed systems such as Ethereum and IPFS rely on a naming system to be usable. DNS could be used, but its resolvers\u2019 attributes run contrary to properties valued in distributed Web (dWeb) systems. Namely, dWeb resolvers ideally provide (i) locally verifiable data, (ii) built-in history, and (iii) have no single trust anchor.\n At Cloudflare Research, we have been exploring alternative ways to resolve queries to responses that align with these attributes. We are proud to announce a new resolver for the Distributed Web, where IPFS content indexed by the  Ethereum Name Service (ENS) can be accessed.\n To discover how it has been built, and how you can use it today, read on.\n   The InterPlanetary FileSystem (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer network for storing content on a distributed file system. It is composed of a set of computers called nodes that store and relay content using a common addressing system.\n This addressing system relies on the use of  Content IDentifiers (CID). CIDs are self-describing identifiers, because the identifier is derived from the content itself. For example, QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco is the CID version 0 (CIDv0) of the  wikipedia-on ipfs homepage.\n To understand why a CID is defined as self-describing, we can look at its binary representation. For QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco, the CID looks like the following:\n  The first is the algorithm used to generate the CID (sha2-256 in this case); then comes the length of the encoded content (32 for a sha2-256 hash), and finally the content itself. When referring to the  multicodec table, it is possible to understand how the content is encoded.\n  This encoding mechanism is useful, because it creates a unique and upgradable content-addressing system across multiple protocols.\n   Ethereum is an account-based blockchain with smart contract capabilities. Being account-based, each account is associated with addresses and these can be modified by operations grouped in blocks and sealed by Ethereum\u2019s consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Work.\n There are two categories of accounts: user accounts and contract accounts. User accounts are controlled by a private key, which is used to sign transactions from the account. Contract accounts hold bytecode, which is executed by the network when a transaction is sent to their account. A transaction can include both funds and data, allowing for rich interaction between accounts.\n When a transaction is created, it gets verified by each node on the network. For a transaction between two user accounts, the verification consists of checking the origin account signature. When the transaction is between a user and a smart contract, every node runs the smart contract bytecode on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Therefore, all nodes perform the same suite of operations and end up in the same state. If one actor is malicious, nodes will not add its contribution. Since nodes have diverse ownership, they have an incentive to not cheat.\n  As you may have noticed, while a CID describes a piece of content, it doesn&#39;t describe where to find it. In fact, the CID describes the content, but not its location on the network. The location of the file would be retrieved by a query made to an IPFS node.\n An IPFS URL (Unified Resource Locator) looks like this:  ipfs://QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco. Accessing this URL means retrieving  QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco using the IPFS protocol, denoted by ipfs://. However, typing such a URL is quite error-prone. Also, these URLs are not very human-friendly, because there is no good way to remember such long strings. To get around this issue, you can use DNSLink. DNSLink is a way of specifying IPFS CIDs within a DNS TXT record. For instance,  wikipedia on ipfs has the following TXT record\n   In addition, its A record points to an IPFS gateway. This means that, when you access en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org, your request is directed to an IPFS HTTP Gateway, which then looks out for the CID using your domain TXT record, and returns the content associated to this CID using the IPFS network.\n This is trading ease-of-access against security. The web browser of the user doesn&#39;t verify the integrity of the content served. This could be because the browser does not implement IPFS or because it has no way of validating domain signature \u2014  DNSSEC. We wrote about this issue in our previous blog post on  End-to-End Integrity.\n  DNS simplifies referring to IP addresses, in the same way that postal addresses are a way of referring to geolocation data, and contacts in your mobile phone abstract phone numbers. All these systems provide a human-readable format and reduce the error rate of an operation.\n To verify these data, the trusted anchors, or \u201csources of truth\u201d, are:\n The government registry for postal addresses. In the UK, addresses  are handled by cities, boroughs and local councils.\n  An account is identified by its address. An address starts with &#34;0x&#34; and is followed by 20 bytes ( ref 4.1 Ethereum yellow paper), for example: 0xf10326c1c6884b094e03d616cc8c7b920e3f73e0. This is not very readable, and can be pretty scary when transactions are not reversible and one can easily mistype a single \u00a0character.\n A first mitigation strategy was to introduce a new notation to capitalise some letters based on the hash of the address 0xF10326C1c6884b094E03d616Cc8c7b920E3F73E0. This can help detect mistype, but it is still not readable. If I have to send a transaction to a friend, I have no way of confirming she hasn&#39;t mistyped the address.\n The  Ethereum Name Service (ENS) was created to tackle this issue. It is a system capable of turning human-readable names, referred to as domains, to blockchain addresses. For instance, the domain  privacy-pass.eth points to the Ethereum address 0xF10326C1c6884b094E03d616Cc8c7b920E3F73E0.\n  A registry is a smart contract that maintains a list of domains and some information about each domain: the domain owner and the domain resolver. The owner is the account allowed to manage the domain. They can create subdomains and change ownership of their domain, as well as modify the resolver associated with their domain.\n Resolvers are responsible for keeping records. For instance, Public Resolver is a smart contract capable of associating not only a name to blockchain addresses, but also a name to an IPFS content identifier. The resolver address is stored in a registry. Users then contact the registry to retrieve the resolver associated with the name.\n Consider a user, Alice, who has direct access to the Ethereum state. The flow goes as follows: Alice would like to get Privacy Pass\u2019s Ethereum address, for which the domain is privacy-pass.eth. She looks for privacy-pass.eth in the ENS Registry and figures out the resolver for privacy-pass.eth is at 0x1234... . She now looks for the address of privacy-pass.eth at the resolver address, which turns out to be 0xf10326c....\n  Accessing the IPFS content identifier for privacy-pass.eth works in a similar way. The resolver is the same, only the accessed data is different \u2014 Alice calls a different method from the smart contract.\n   The goal was to be able to use this new way of indexing IPFS content directly from your web browser. However, accessing the ENS registry requires access to the Ethereum state. To get access to IPFS, you would also need to access the IPFS network.\n To tackle this, we are going to use Cloudflare\u2019s Distributed Web Gateway. Cloudflare operates both an Ethereum Gateway and an IPFS Gateway, respectively available at cloudflare-eth.com and cloudflare-ipfs.com.\n  The  first version of EthLink was built by Jim McDonald and is operated by True Name LTD at eth.link. Starting from next week, eth.link will transition to use the Cloudflare Distributed Web Resolver. To that end, we have built EthLink on top of Cloudflare Workers. This is a proxy to IPFS. It proxies all ENS registered domains when .link is appended. For instance, privacy-pass.eth should render the Privacy Pass homepage. From your web browser,  https://privacy-pass.eth.link does it.\n The resolution is done at the Cloudflare edge using a Cloudflare Worker. Cloudflare Workers allows JavaScript code to be run on Cloudflare infrastructure, eliminating the need to maintain a server and increasing the reliability of the service. In addition, it follows Service Workers API, so results returned from the resolver can be checked by end users if needed.\n To do this, we setup a wildcard DNS record for *.eth.link to be proxied through Cloudflare and handled by a Cloudflare Worker. \u00a0When a user Alice accesses  privacy-pass.eth.link, the worker first gets the CID of the CID to be retrieved from Ethereum. Then, it requests the content matching this CID to IPFS, and returns it to Alice.\n  All parts can be run locally. The worker can be run in a service Worker, and the Ethereum Gateway can point to both a local Ethereum node and the IPFS gateway provided by IPFS Companion. It means that while Cloudflare provides resolution-as-a-service, none of the components has to be trusted.\n  So  are we distributed yet? No, but we are getting closer, building bridges between emerging technologies and current web infrastructure.

Four people were confirmed killed and eleven more were injured or hospitalized as a result of the collapse.  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4] At least 35 people were rescued from being trapped in the building,  [5] while at least 159 people remain missing, as rescue operations are underway.  [6]  [7]  [8]\n   The residential building, Champlain Towers South at 8777  Collins Avenue, was built in 1981 by developer Nathan Reiber and is part of a complex along with two other separate buildings nearby, Champlain Towers North and Champlain Towers East. The Champlain Towers South building was an L-shaped structure comprising 136 units made up of one- to four-bedroom plans ranging in size from 1,200 to 4,500 square feet (110 to 420\u00a0m 2).  [9]  [10] The buildings are just north of North Beach Oceanside Park in  Miami Beach&#39;s North Beach neighborhood. According to Surfside  town commissioner Eliana Salzhauer, the building was undergoing inspection for its 40-year recertification at the time of the disaster, which typically takes one year to complete.  [11] According to Surfside  mayor Charles Burkett, roof repairs were underway.  [12]\n    The Champlain Towers South building suffered a partial  pancake collapse.  [6] Surveillance footage indicates that a large north-central section of the building collapsed first, which left the mostly isolated northeast corner standing but unstable; it collapsed approximately nine seconds later.  [13]\n   At least four people died during the collapse, and eleven more were injured.  [14] In addition, at least 159 people remain unaccounted for.  [6]  [7]  [15]\n A total of 30 people from  South America who resided or were believed to be in the building at the time of the collapse are among the missing.  [14]  Paraguay&#39;s Ministry of External Relations stated that the  First Lady  Silvana L\u00f3pez Moreira&#39;s sister, her sister&#39;s husband, and their three children were missing.  [16] Another Paraguayan citizen is also missing.  [17] The other missing people were identified as nine citizens from  Argentina, six from  Venezuela, six from  Colombia  [18], three  Uruguayan citizens  [19] and one  Lithuanian citizen, geographer and singer  Edwin Symonowicz.  [20]\n    More than 80 rescue units responded to the collapse, according to the  Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department.  [21] Surfside mayor Charles Burkett said in a news conference that ten people were treated at the scene of the collapse and that two people were taken to the hospital, with one later dying.  [22] At least 35 people have been rescued from the building  [5] and at least 159 people are unaccounted for.  [6]  [7]  Miami-Dade County mayor  Daniella Levine Cava called a state of emergency and called for Florida governor  Ron DeSantis to do the same.  [23] Governor DeSantis viewed the site on the same day,  [24] and he issued a state of emergency.  [25]\n  The  White House and  Federal Emergency Management Agency stated that they were in contact with local officials and providing assistance after the collapse.  [26] President  Joe Biden was briefed on the event, and spoke with Miami-Dade County mayor Cava.  [27]  [28]\n  The  National Basketball Association&#39;s  Miami Heat team helped state emergency workers at the site of the collapse, including player  Tyler Herro, assistant coaches  Chris Quinn and Eric Glass, basketball administration director Scott Gurka, and vice president/executive director of the Heat&#39;s charitable fund Steve Stowe.  World Central Kitchen and  Direct Relief, both of whom are recipients of the Heat&#39;s charitable arm, were also lending help.  [29]\n   According to a  Florida International University researcher who analyzed publicly available  European Remote-Sensing Satellite data, the building had been sinking during the 1990s at a significant rate of about 2\u00a0mm/year. While 97% of Miami Beach had been stable, 1,555 of 18,949 points in Miami Beach had been sinking, at a rate of less than 1\u00a0mm/year.  [31] Yet to the researcher who conducted the study, the collapse came as a surprise: A building collapse due to sinking is only likely if one part of a building sinks faster than another, which creates tensions that, in turn, weaken the building&#39;s structure. The researcher also noted overbuilt areas which were sinking at a significantly faster rate, such as on the artificial islands in  Biscayne Bay \u2013 up to 3.8\u00a0mm/year.

Its philosophy was simple: reward customers with free storage space for referring other customers. In 2008, it was an absolute revelation. A golden ticket.\n  In 2021, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a company without a formal  referral program. It\u2019s a standard growth marketing trick. If you study other companies\u2019 tactics, you\u2019re going to be able to shortcut growth \u2014 it\u2019s as simple as that.\n The race to grow faster is more pressing than ever before. When you consider the speed with which venture capital funds need to return dollars to their investors and that consumer acquisition costs have increased by  55% over the last three years, forward-thinking entrepreneurs and growth marketers simply must make time to study their competition, learn best practices and apply them to their own business growth.\n Of course, you should still run your own experiments, but it\u2019s just more capital-efficient to emulate than to trial-and-error from scratch.

Google  began rolling out a two-week core algorithm update on June 2, and it\u2019s unleashing a page experience update through August. These updates usually come with significant volatility that makes organic Google rankings jump all over the place.\n However, one clear winner of the 2021 SEO footrace is  Flo, a women\u2019s ovulation calendar, period tracker and pregnancy app. According to  GrowthBar, a SEO tool I co-founded, Flo\u2019s organic traffic has soared 192% over the past two months and it ranks on page one for some staggeringly competitive women\u2019s health keywords.\n If SEO is a strategy you\u2019re pursuing, there are two key growth lessons to take away from Flo\u2019s recent success.\n 1. Authority matters now more than ever. Healthcare websites fall into a category of sensitive sites that Google classifies as Your Money, Your Life (YMYL). Because of oodles of fake news and suspect web content, Google has rightfully raised its bar for expertise and factuality. Go to any one of Flo\u2019s more than 1,000 blog posts (yes, content is still king) and you\u2019ll see that nearly all of them are reviewed by gynecologists, primary care physicians or some other type of women\u2019s health expert. Its site also has pages devoted to its writers and medical reviewers, content guidelines and peer-review specifications. Flo takes its information seriously. From the 2020 election to QAnon to vaccination side effects, Google is on high alert. Whatever your niche, you need to establish credibility to win Google searches.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 23:04:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "growth,\u589e\u957f", "title": "5\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u957f\u8425\u9500\u6743 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t5 companies doing growth marketing right\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/25/5-companies-doing-growth-marketing-right/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["growth", "\u589e\u957f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068251, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "LOLA\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8eJavaScript\u548c\u5b83\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u719f\u6089\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u975e\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u5411\u5757\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c11\u4e8e20\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5b57\u548c\u4ec520\u4e2a\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u3002\n    \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u5757\u4e2d\u5207\u5272\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\uff0cLOLA\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u5272\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e3b\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u514d\u53d7\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7aef\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u65e0\u5c3d\u7684\u73af\u8def\u6700\u7ec8\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u4e3b\u673a\uff01\u4f7f\u7528\u5bbf\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u914d\u5668\u5c06\u6355\u83b7\u5185\u5b58up-measure\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n    while\uff08true\uff09{var\u8f93\u5165= waitForkey\uff08\uff09; if\uff08\u8f93\u5165==\uff06\uff0334;\uff06\uff0334;\uff09{print\uff08\uff06\uff0334;\u7a7a\u95f4\u88ab\u6309\u4e0b\uff01\uff06\uff0334;\uff09; }}\n  LOLA\u4ee3\u7801\u65e8\u5728\u968f\u65f6\u6682\u505c\u5e76\u5c06\u63a7\u4ef6\u8fd4\u56de\u7ed9\u4e3b\u673a\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cWAITFOREY\u5c06\u7acb\u5373\u5c06\u63a7\u4ef6\u8fd4\u56de\u5230\u4e3b\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u673a\u51b3\u5b9a\u811a\u672c\u5e94\u7ee7\u7eed\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bf9\u6b64\u8fdb\u884cCPU\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5176\u4ed6\u811a\u672c\u8bed\u8a00Don\uff06\uff0339; t\u5141\u8bb8\u90a3\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\n    LOLA\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u672a\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u70b9\u4fdd\u5b58\u5230\u78c1\u76d8\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u60a8\u7684\u811a\u672c\u6267\u884c1000\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u4fdd\u5b58\u5230\u78c1\u76d8\u5e76\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u53f0\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u540e\u4e00\u5468\u6062\u590d\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u811a\u672c\u6062\u590d\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u901a\u5e38\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u5176\u811a\u672c\u72b6\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4fdd\u5b58\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u7528\u3002\n  05 04 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 | ........ | 00 00 00 00 F0 3F 01 00 | .....\uff1f.. 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 04 | ...... @\u3002| 05 00 00 00 48 65 6C 6C | ......\u5730\u72f1| 6F 01 1F 85 EB 51 B8 1E | o ....

Non-programmers can easily learn the block-oriented syntax with less than 20 keywords and only 20 operators.\n    The LoLa runtime protects the host application from misbehaving user code by slicing code execution in controllable chunks.   Even endless loops will eventually return to the host! Out-of-memory problems will be catched by the use of host-controlled allocators.\n    while( true) {  var input = WaitForKey();  if(input ==  &#34; &#34;) { Print( &#34;Space was pressed!&#34;); }}\n  LoLa code is designed to suspend at any time and return control back to the host. In this example,  WaitForKey will immediately return control to the host, eating no CPU time until the host decides that the script should continue.   Most other scripting languages don&#39;t allow that behaviour, enforcing multithreading or other workarounds.\n    The LoLa runtime is designed to be saved to disk at any point not executing any code. This means that you can let your script execute for 1000 instructions, save the runtime state to disk and resume execution a week later on another computer, not having any problems with script resumption. This is especially useful for games which often want to embed the state of their scripts into the save files.\n  05 04 00 00 00 01 00 00 |........| 00 00 00 00 f0 3f 01 00 |.....?..| 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 04 |......@.| 05 00 00 00 48 65 6c 6c |....Hell| 6f 01 1f 85 eb 51 b8 1e |o....Q..| 09 40  |.@|", "posttime": "2021-06-25 22:57:04", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "programming,\u7f16\u7a0b,\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00,\u811a\u672c", "title": "\u841d\u62c9\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00 ", "title_en": "The Lola Programming Language", "transed": 1, "url": "https://lola.random-projects.net/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f16\u7a0b", "\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00", "\u811a\u672c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c94cb44bac0b155cad9e923137017c79.png", "infoid": 1068250, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5730\u5ba3\u5e03AWS Bugbust\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3aJava\u548cPython\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u5168\u7403\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u96c6\u4f53\u4fee\u590d100\u4e07\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6d88\u9664\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aCodeguRu\u8282\u7701\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e74\u5ea6AWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u8d62\u5f97\u5956\u54c1\u548c\u8363\u8000\u3002\u8ba9\u81ed\u866b\u6253\u5f00\uff01\n    AWS Bugbust\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8f6c\u6362Bug Bashes\uff0cFoster Team Building\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u53cb\u597d\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u67e5\u627e\u548c\u6d88\u706d\u9519\u8bef\uff0cAWS Bugbust\u5229\u7528ML\u4f9b\u7535\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5de5\u5177 -  Amazon Codegure Reviewer\u548cAmazon Codegure Profiler  - \u81ea\u52a8\u626b\u63cf\u4ee3\u7801\u5230\u6742\u8349\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u548c\u8d4c\u535a\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6d88\u9664\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n  \u53ea\u9700\u70b9\u51fb\u51e0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728AWS\u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u8bbe\u7f6e\u79c1\u4ebaAWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u865a\u62df\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u6392\u884c\u699c\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff08\u6216\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u79c1\u4eba\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u591a\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728AWS\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u9020\u6210100\u4e07\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u840c\u82bd\u5458\u5728\u6500\u767b\u6392\u884c\u699c\u65f6\u8d5a\u53d6\u5fbd\u7ae0\u548c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u524d10\u540d\u7206\u53d1\u8005\u8d62\u5f97\u4e86\u652f\u4ed8\u7ed9AWS Re\u7684\u8d39\u7528\uff1a\u53d1\u660e2021.\u52a0\u5165\u4f7f\u547d\u4eca\u5929\u6d88\u9664100\u4e07\u866b\u3002\n  AWS Bugbust\u4eca\u5929\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e1c\uff08N.
