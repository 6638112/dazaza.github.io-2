REvil, which stands for Ransomware Evil, is known as a “ransomware as a service” organization, meaning it leases its ransomware to other criminals, even the technically inept. One of its previous affiliates was a group called  DarkSide, which was responsible for  the ransomware attack last month on Colonial Pipeline, a conduit for nearly half the gas and jet fuel to the East Coast. DarkSide is believed to have split off from REvil last year.</p><p> 本集团是在俄罗斯享受安全港的数十个赎金瓶组中，在那里他们很少被逮捕或引渡他们的罪行。 Revil代表赎金软件邪恶，被称为“作为服务”组织的“赎金软件”，这意味着它甚至在技术上无能为力地租用其赎金软件。其中一个隶属子是一个名为Darkside的团体，该组织负责上个月在殖民地管道上的赎金软件攻击，这是一个近一半的气体和喷射到东海岸的燃料。暗暗被认为去年从瑞尔分裂了。</p><p> REvil is considered one of the most sophisticated ransomware groups and has demanded as much as $50 million to recover data belonging to companies as prominent as Apple. Its attack on JBS, a Brazilian company that accounts for roughly a fifth of cattle and hog slaughter in the United States, temporarily shut down some operations at a time when prices were already surging for beef, poultry and pork.</p><p> Revil被认为是最复杂的赎金软件集团之一，并且要求多达5000万美元，以恢复属于苹果突出的公司的数据。它对杰布斯的攻击是一个巴西公司，该公司在美国占据了大约五分之一的牛和猪屠宰，在价格已经在牛肉，家禽和猪肉的价格飙升时暂时关闭了一些行动。</p><p> Some JBS employees arriving to work over the weekend were greeted with a digital ransom note that had been used in previous REvil attacks, people briefed on the attack said. REvil has targeted some 237 organizations since 2020, according to Recorded Future, a cybersecurity firm. The number of victims could be much higher given that many quietly pay their extortionists to spare their reputations and avoid the cost of having to rebuild their data from scratch.</p><p> 一些JBS员工在周末抵达的员工被打击了一个数字赎金票据，这是在以前的革命袭击中使用的，人们向袭击事件说。 Revil已经针对了2020年以来的一些237个组织，根据网络安全公司的记录未来。鉴于许多人悄悄地支付他们的排斥主义者避免他们的声誉并避免必须从划痕重建数据的成本，因此受害者的数量要高得多。</p><p> Like the Colonial Pipeline incident before it, the ransomware attack on JBS demonstrates how a single breach of an American business can have wide-ranging impact. It also drew further awareness to ransomware invasions, which have become a digital scourge over the past year. Just days after the attack on Colonial Pipeline triggered jet fuel shortages and panic buying, a different group of  cybercriminals held the Irish national health system hostage with ransomware. In just the past week, dozens more organizations have been hit, ranging from the City University of New York, to the Massachusetts Steamship Authority, which runs ferries to Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, to the Birmingham Barons, a minor-league baseball team.</p><p> 就像在它之前发生的殖民地管道一样，JB上的赎金软件攻击演示了美国商业的单一违约可能具有广泛的影响。它还利用了对勒索软件入侵的进一步意识，这已成为过去一年的数字祸害。只有几天攻击殖民地管道触发喷气式燃料短缺和恐慌购买，一个不同组的网络犯罪分子持有了爱尔兰国家卫生系统人质的赎金软件。在过去的一周里，几十个组织被击中，从纽约城市大学，到马萨诸塞斯运会权威，距离玛莎的葡萄园和楠塔基特队的佛罗里达州的佛罗里尼亚州小队棒球队。</p><p> “We’re only going to see these ransomware attacks on major, international businesses continue,” said Allan Liska, an intelligence analyst at Recorded Future who is tracking some 38 ransomware groups, the vast majority of which are based in Russia, with a few in Iran and one in North Korea.</p><p> “我们只能看到这些赎金软件攻击主要的国际企业继续，”录制未来的智力分析师艾伦丽思·斯蒂西斯·斯蒂安州智商·斯科斯·谁追踪了大约38个赎金软件集团，这是俄罗斯的绝大多数基础，有一些在伊朗和朝鲜的一个。 </p><p> Production began to resume at nine JBS beef plants in the United States on Wednesday. Thousands of workers at JBS’s beef, pork and poultry plants in Australia, Canada and the United States were affected as shifts were altered or canceled on Monday and Tuesday. Many of JBS’s pork and poultry plants and a beef plant in Canada were at least partially operational on Tuesday.</p><p>生产开始于周三在美国九兆牛肉植物恢复。澳大利亚，加拿大和美国澳大利亚牛肉，猪肉和家禽厂的数千名工人受到影响，因为班次在周一和周二取消了转变。许多JBS的猪肉和家禽植物和加拿大的牛肉厂在周二至少部分地运作。</p><p> Union officials said Wednesday that beef plants were operational but were not at full capacity yet. JBS had said late Tuesday that the “vast majority” of its plants would reopen the next day.</p><p> 联盟官员周三表示，牛肉厂正在运作，但尚未充分容量。 JBS周二曾曾表示，其植物的“绝大多数”将重新打开第二天。</p><p> About 400 workers were back on the job at the JBS beef plant in Souderton, Pa., versus about 1,500 who would work in a typical day, said Wendell Young IV, the president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776, which represents workers at the plant. A JBS beef plant in Cactus, Texas, canceled work for many employees scheduled for one of its shifts on Wednesday, according to a Facebook post meant for workers.</p><p> 大约400名工人在帕德顿州Souderton的JBS牛肉植物的工作中回到了大约1,500名典型的一天中，该事务员1776年联合食品和商业工人总裁Wendell Young IV表示，这是一个典型的一天，它代表工人在植物。据Facebook Post根据工人，德克萨斯州仙人掌牛肉植物在周三举办了许多员工的许多雇员，这是一名员工，这是一名员工。</p><p> Mr. Young added that the company had told the union that the plant would be running essentially as normal by Thursday, although workers’ start times would be delayed by a few hours.</p><p> 杨先生补充说，该公司已告诉联盟，该工厂将在周四以前的正常运行，尽管工人的开始时间将被推迟几个小时。</p><p> JBS has not said whether it has paid its attackers and did not return requests for comment.</p><p> JBS尚未说它是否已支付其攻击者并没有退回评论请求。</p><p> The disruptions come at a time when prices for beef as well as chicken and pork have been skyrocketing. Meatpacking plants are struggling to meet high demand, largely because of the same labor-shortage issues that restaurants and other industries have struggled with in the pandemic.</p><p> 牛肉价格和鸡肉和猪肉的价格一直在飙升时发生了干扰。肉类包装厂正在努力满足高需求，主要是因为劳动力短缺问题，餐馆和其他行业在大流行中挣扎。</p><p> “We’ve got this logjam happening at the slaughterhouses, and that’s happening when demand, both domestic and export, has been exceptional,” said Don Close, a senior animal protein analyst at RaboResearch.</p><p> “我们已经在屠宰场发生了这个Logjam，这就是在国内和出口的需求时发生的，”RaboSearch的高级动物蛋白分析师唐关门说。 </p><p>  In recent months, reopened restaurants began putting in orders for beef, pork and poultry again and people began gathering and grilling outside as vaccination levels rose and the weather became warmer. The increase in demand, combined with the hiring challenges, has caused wholesale beef prices to shoot up 49 percent since mid-March and prices of steak cuts to skyrocket 64 percent, according to the Department of Agriculture.</p><p>最近几个月，重新开放的餐厅再次开始为牛肉，猪肉和家禽的订单，人们开始在外面收集和烧烤，因为疫苗接种水平上升，天气变暖。根据农业部的说法，需求增加，促进了招聘挑战，使得批发牛肉价格造成批发牛肉价格以自3月中旬开始投篮49％，并根据农业部飙升到飙升64％的牛排。</p><p> “Everyone suddenly woke up to the reality that we didn’t have enough product around,” said Altin Kalo, the head economist at Steiner Consulting Group, which analyzes and creates forecasts about the protein industry.</p><p> “施泰纳咨询集团总部经济学家Altin Kalo表示，”每个人都突然醒来的现实，“Steiner咨询小组的总部经济学家Altin Kalo表示，分析和创造了关于蛋白质产业的预测。</p><p> Mark Lauritsen, the international vice president who oversees meatpacking for the food workers union, said that many meatpacking plants in the United States have been about 10 to 20 percent below full staffing levels but that the situation was gradually improving as the union negotiated wage increases with companies like JBS.</p><p> 国际副总裁Mark Lauritsen监督为食品工会赚钱的副总裁表示，美国的许多肉类植物在全面的人员配置水平以下大约10％至20％，但随着工会谈判工资增加，情况逐渐改善像杰布斯这样的公司。</p><p> In the wake of the closure of JBS plants on Monday and Tuesday, the Department of Agriculture estimated a drop-off in the number of cattle and hogs slaughtered across the country that Mr. Kalo said roughly correlated with JBS’s market share.</p><p> 在周一和周二的JBS植物关闭后，农业部估计在全国屠宰的牛和猪的数量下降，卡洛先生与JBS的市场份额大致相关。</p><p> A big chunk of beef produced by a meatpacker like JBS on any given day is earmarked for standing orders for large, national grocery store chains like Kroger or restaurants like McDonald’s, Mr. Kalo said. A smaller portion is available each day for purchase in the “spot market” by smaller grocery store or restaurant chains, he said.</p><p> 卡罗先生说，任何一天都是在任何给定的一天这样的肉类包装商生产的大量牛肉制作的肉类包裹，如JBS在任何特定的一天都被指定为麦克唐勒或餐馆等大型国家杂货店连锁店。他说，每天可以在较小的杂货店或餐厅链购买较小的部分。</p><p> The shutdown at JBS could cause that supply to further tighten, with the meatpacker likely to fulfill the big, standing orders first, leaving less for the smaller buyers.</p><p> JBS的停机可能导致供应进一步拧紧，肉类包装商可能首先实现大型，常规订单，较少的买家少留下。</p><p> “That supply is where you’ll see a spike — a spike in wholesale beef prices over the next few days or even through the end of the week,” Mr. Kalo said.</p><p> “那种供应是你会在接下来的几天甚至在本周末批发牛肉价格中看到飙升的尖峰，”卡罗先生说。 </p><p> Higher wholesale beef prices are often being passed along to consumers, albeit at smaller price increases. So far this year, the price of beef in the grocery store is 6 percent above what it was at this time last year, according to NielsenIQ.</p><p>较高的批发牛肉价格通常被传递给消费者，尽管价格上涨较小。据Nielseniq称，今年到目前为止，杂货店中牛肉价格的价格是去年这一时期的6％。</p><p> The attack highlighted concerns about the vulnerability of critical American businesses. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, urged companies on Wednesday to increase their cybersecurity measures, saying it was “up to a number of these private-sector sector entities to protect themselves.”</p><p> 该袭击突出了关于批判美国企业脆弱性的担忧。白宫新闻秘书局局局长局长敦促公司在周三提高网络安全措施，称为“达到一些保护自己的私营部门部门实体”。</p><p> Ms. Psaki declined to say whether the U.S. government was planning to retaliate. “We’re not taking any options off the table in terms of how we may respond, but of course there is an internal policy review process to consider that,” she said.</p><p> Psaki女士拒绝说美国政府是否计划报复。 “在我们可能如何回应的方面，我们没有从桌面上取出任何选择，但当然还有一个内部政策审查进程来考虑这一点，”她说。</p><p> Among REvil’s other victims are E. &amp; J. Gallo, the winemaker, which was hit this year, and Quanta Computer, an Apple supplier. In April, REvil held Quanta Computer hostage, then demanded $50 million from Apple in exchange for not releasing proprietary product plans. REvil eventually dumped confidential schematics for Apple laptops and a new Apple watch online on April 20, the day of a major Apple product announcement, but later scrubbed them from its site. The group also hit 23 cities in Texas in a coordinated ransomware attack in 2019 that froze up courts, law enforcement, real estate transactions and water bill payments.</p><p> 在Revil的其他受害者中是E.＆amp; J. Gallo，Winemaker，这是苹果供应商今年击中的酿酒师和Quanta Computer。 4月份，Revil举行了Quanta计算机人质，然后要求Apple要求5000万美元以换取未释放专有产品计划。 Revil最终倾倒了Apple笔记本电脑的机密原理和4月20日的新Apple Watch在线，一个主要的Apple产品公告，但后来将它们从其网站擦洗。本集团于2019年在2019年在德克萨斯州的德克萨斯州的23个城市遭到了一项协调的赎金软件攻击，将法院冻结，执法，房地产交易和水费支付。</p><p> REvil’s ransomware, like DarkSide’s, screens victims based on what languages they speak and goes out of its way to avoid infecting computers that belong to Russians, Syrians and those in post-Soviet states.</p><p> Revil的赎金软件，就像Darkside的版本，根据他们所说的语言，避免感染属于俄罗斯州，叙利亚人和苏联后州的计算机的途径。</p><p> Typically, the group publishes stolen data on a website it calls its “Happy Blog,” but as of late afternoon Wednesday none of JBS’s data had appeared online. That suggested that perhaps REvil had not stolen the data it had held hostage, or that the company was still in negotiation with the group, said Mr. Liska of Recorded Future. JBS has said it believes none of its data had been stolen.</p><p> 通常，本集团在其调用其“快乐博客”的网站上发布被盗数据，但截至下午晚些时候星期三，JBS的数据没有出现在线。这表明，也许瑞罗并没有窃取它所持有人质的数据，或者公司仍然与本集团签订谈判，表示，记录未来的丽思先生。 JBS表示，它认为其数据都没有被盗。</p><p> Ms. Psaki said Wednesday that the administration was in direct contact with the Russians and that President Biden would bring up the issue of cyberattacks with President Vladimir Putin of Russia when they meet in two weeks.</p><p> Psaki女士周三表示，政府当局与俄罗斯人直接接触，拜登总统将在两周内举行俄罗斯·弗拉基米尔·普京总统弗拉基米尔·普京时提出了网络问题。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/business/jbs-beef-cyberattack.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/02/business/jbs-beef-cyberattack.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/俄罗斯/">#俄罗斯</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/植物/">#植物</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/赎金/">#赎金</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
