But Rhodes said there were some good things to come from the proposal. He said “cross-device tracking” of users should be easier through a browser-based solution, “because if you’re in Chrome you’ll be signed in to Chrome across all your devices I would assume. “So if you watch an ad on Youtube, click through on your phone, and then buy that holiday later on your desktop, at the moment it’s actually quite tricky for us to know that that [ad] has had any impact, or have data which suggests that’s had an impact, whereas with browser-based tracking you can at least do that.” He added: “It should be easier to track what people do, so from Google’s perspective it’s easier for them to have a better understanding of who you are, which ultimately leads to a better ability to buy advertising. But all of that’s wrapped up in the fact that it’s provided by Google. “It is moving the supply, the buy and the tracking and analytics to the same organisation. I don’t think anyone’s really sure how that’s going to play out.” A group calling themselves Marketers for an Open Web (MOW) has highlighted concerns that by denying news publishers access to the cookies they use to sell advertising, Google’s Privacy Sandbox could cut their revenues by around two-thirds. MOW warned that smaller regional publishers would be hardest hit, that journalist jobs would be lost and the changes would put “reliable, fact-checked online news under greater threat than ever”,  Press Gazette reported last month. A Google spokesperson said: “The ad-supported web is at risk if digital advertising practices don’t evolve to reflect people’s changing expectations around how data is collected and used. That’s why Google introduced the Privacy Sandbox, an  open initiative built in collaboration with the industry, to provide strong privacy for users while also supporting publishers.”  Google’s is not the only “cookie-less” proposal out there. Ad tech firm The Trade Desk’s  Unified ID 2.0 bills itself as a “new industry-wide approach to internet identity that preserves the value of relevant advertising, while putting user control and privacy at the forefront”.  It has already received support from media data firm Nielsen. The open-source framework can operate across ad channels: TV, mobile, audio and online. It is also collaborating with data connectivity platform Liveramp’s Authenticated Identity Infrastructure. Scott Howe, Liveramp chief executive,  said: “The combined demand from The Trade Desk, the largest independent demand-side platform, and the 400+ global brands using Liveramp, enables publishers and advertisers to thrive in a post-cookie environment.” The Interactive Advertising Bureau Tech Lab’s  Project Rearc is not a product but rather a “global call-to-action for stakeholders across the digital supply chain to rethink and re-architect digital marketing to support core industry use cases, while balancing consumer privacy and personalisation”. The industry body said the loss of third-party cookies would mean the “default state of digital media will be 100% anonymous, non-addressable to third-party vendors that support advertising-funded media and services today”.  Non-addressable advertising is where the people being advertised at are not directly identified, such as TV, radio or print ads. The IAB added: “The feasibility of direct addressability going forward, for any advertising-related use case, rests on trusted relationships between consumers and first parties: brands and publishers.” Project Rearc fits in with a general shift in the online ad market towards greater transparency and privacy, and away from large-scale automated advertising. A change being shaped by public discourse around privacy.

He said the Google Privacy Sandbox comes from the tech giants “genuine, pragmatic desire to provide a solution” and they are not the “bad guys”. “I don’t believe they’re just doing this to follow Apple or to be awkward. “This is a conversation that Google and others, including ourselves, have been having with the ICO and everybody since GDPR came in: how do you allow an ecosystem to continue to grow and thrive whilst recognising your responsibilities and your legal obligations to protect data? That’s on one side, and then: is the data that is being applied for the types of advertising behaviour that are currently being undertaken entirely necessary? And the answer is no.” He added: “Our industry has alienated its biggest asset for a very long time… the consumer is our biggest asset and behaviours and practices genuinely are at risk of alienating us from those consumers. He told publishers to take the opportunity presented by changes to online privacy laws, such as GDPR, to sort themselves out. “It lends itself to recognising the real value of environments and quality audiences and quality content and moves us away from the commoditisation that advertising has become.” The Google Privacy Sandbox will create a new online ecosystem for the web’s most popular browser that has been built by its biggest gatekeeper. It’s surely not a question of if, but when.</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div
