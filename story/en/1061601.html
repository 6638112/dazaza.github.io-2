You might recognize all of them, or be surprised (or, perhaps, even horrified) by some; these images may include anything from wedding or vacation snapshots to pornographic images.</p><p> 如果您将脸部上传到Pimeyes＆＃39;网站，它将立即向您展示该公司在互联网上发现的任何图片。你可能会认识到所有这些，或者感到惊讶（或者，也许，也许，甚至吓坏了）;这些图像可以包括婚礼或假期快照到色情图像的任何东西。</p><p> PimEyes is open to anyone with internet access. It&#39;s a stark contrast from Clearview AI, which became well-known for building its enormous stash of faces with images of people from social networks and limits its use to law enforcement (Clearview  has said it has hundreds of such customers).</p><p> Pimeyes对互联网接入的任何人都开放。它＆＃39;从Clearview Ai中呈现出令人着迷的对比，这对于建立其巨大的面孔，通过来自社交网络的人们的图像并限制其对执法的限制（ClearView表示拥有数百名这些客户）。</p><p> PimEyes&#39; decision to make facial-recognition software available to the general public crosses a line that technology companies are typically unwilling to traverse, and opens up endless possibilities for how it can be used and abused.</p><p> Pimeyes＆＃39;决定使普通公众可用的面部识别软件穿过技术公司通常不愿意遍历的线路，并为如何使用和滥用开辟了无穷无尽的可能性。</p><p> Imagine a potential employer digging into your past, an abusive ex tracking you, or a random stranger snapping a photo of you in public and then finding you online. This is all possible through PimEyes: Though the website instructs users to search for themselves, it doesn&#39;t stop them from uploading photos of anyone. At the same time, it doesn&#39;t explicitly identify anyone by name, but as CNN Business discovered by using the site, that information may be just clicks away from images PimEyes pulls up.</p><p> 想象一下潜在的雇主挖掘你的过去，一个辱骂的前任跟踪你，或者随意陌生人在公共场合拍摄你的照片，然后在线找到你。这一切都可以通过定义：虽然网站指示用户自己搜索，但它不会阻止他们从上传任何人的照片。与此同时，它不会通过名称明确识别任何人，而是通过使用该网站发现的CNN业务，该信息可能只需点击图片PIMeyes撤销。</p><p>  &#34;Using the latest technologies, artificial intelligence and machine learning, we help you find your pictures on the Internet and defend yourself from scammers, identity thieves, or people who use your image illegally,&#34; the website declares.</p><p>  ＆＃34;使用最新的技术，人工智能和机器学习，我们帮助您在互联网上找到您的照片并从诈骗者，身份盗贼或非法使用图像的人辩护，＆＃34;网站声明。</p><p> It&#39;s precisely this ease of access that concerns Clare Garvie, a senior associate at Georgetown Law&#39;s Center on Privacy and Technology, who has extensively researched police use of facial-recognition technology.</p><p> 它恰好这种易于获取乔治城法律和技术中心高级助理伙伴克莱拉维的易于访问权限，他们已经广泛研究了警察使用面部认可技术。 </p><p> &#34;Face recognition at its foundation is a tool of identification,&#34; Garvie told CNN Business. &#34;Think of any reason a person would want to conduct an identification — positive and negative — and that&#39;s what this tool makes possible.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;在其基础上的人脸识别是识别的工具，＆＃34; Garvie告诉CNN业务。 ＆＃34;想到任何一个人想要进行识别的原因 - 积极和消极 - 而且这个工具可以做到这一点。＆＃34;</p><p>  PimEyes lets users see a limited number of small, somewhat pixelated search results at no cost, or you can  pay a monthly fee, which starts at $29.99, for more extensive search results and features (such as to click through to see full-size images on the websites where PimEyes found them and to set up alerts for when PimEyes finds new pictures of faces online that its software believes match an uploaded face).</p><p>  PIMeyes让用户看到有限数量的小型，有点像素化的搜索结果，或者您可以支付每月费用，从$ 29.99开始，以获得更广泛的搜索结果和功能（例如单击查看全尺寸图像在Pimeyes发现它们的网站上并为Pimeyes查找在线的新图片时，它的软件认为与上传的面部相匹配）。</p><p> The company offers a  paid plan for businesses, too: $299.99 per month lets companies conduct unlimited searches and set up 500 alerts.</p><p> 该公司为企业提供了付费计划，也是每月299.99美元，让公司进行无限制的搜索并设置500个警报。</p><p> The images come from a range of websites, including company, media and pornography sites — the last of which PimEyes told CNN Business that it includes so people can search online for any revenge porn in which they may unknowingly appear.</p><p> 图像来自一系列网站，包括公司，媒体和色情网站 - 首选的最后一个商业，其中包括所包括的人，所以人们可以在线搜索任何复仇色情，他们可能在不知不觉中出现。</p><p>  But while Clearview AI built its massive stockpile of faces in part by scraping images from major social networks (it was subsequently served with cease-and-desist notices by Facebook, Google, and Twitter,  sued by several civil rights groups, and  declared illegal in Canada), PimEyes said it does not scrape images from social media. (A Clearview AI spokesperson would not confirm whether the company currently grabs photos from social sites such as Facebook and Twitter, just saying that the company &#34;collects only public data from the open internet.&#34;  The company&#39;s CEO has said in the past that it has a first-amendment right in the United States to collect publicly available information.)</p><p>  但是，虽然ClearView Ai部分地通过从主要社交网络刮擦图像（随后由Facebook，Google和Twitter提供的Suite-And-Desist通知，所以由几个公民组织起诉，而宣布违法行为加拿大），Pimeyes表示，它没有从社交媒体刮擦图像。 （ClearView Ai Shokesperson不确定该公司目前是否抓住来自Facebook和Twitter等社交网站的照片，只是说公司＆＃34;仅收集来自开放互联网的公共数据。＆＃34;公司＆＃39;首席执行官在过去表示，它在美国有一项修正案，以收集公开的信息。）</p><p> Although PimEyes instructs visitors to only search for their own face, there&#39;s no mechanism on the site to ensure it&#39;s used this way. Several Twitter users claim to have used it  in an effort to identify US Capitol rioters, for example — efforts that PimEyes told CNN Business it is aware of but that are unavoidable, despite being a violation of the site&#39;s terms and conditions, since PimEyes can&#39;t verify who is performing a search for a given face. The site, PimEyes noted, doesn&#39;t identify by name those who search for faces nor those whose faces show up in search results.</p><p> 虽然PIMeyes指示游客只搜索自己的脸，但网站上没有机制，以确保它＆＃39; s用这种方式。一些Twitter用户声称旨在识别美国国会大厦骚乱者，例如 -  Pimeyes告诉CNN业务的努力，它意识到但这是不可避免的，尽管违反了网站＆＃39;术语和条件，由于PIMeyes可以＆＃39; t验证谁正在对给定面部进行搜索。该网站，定义，并指出，并不识别那些搜索面孔的人，也不是那些在搜索结果中出现的那些。</p><p>  There&#39;s also no way to ensure this facial-recognition technology isn&#39;t used to misidentify people. There are a handful of US state laws restricting the use of facial-recognition systems and  city-wide bans on it, yet these rules tend to target how government and businesses might use such software, not individuals.</p><p>  ＆＃39;也没有办法确保这个面部识别技术是＆＃39; t曾经误诊人。有少数美国国家法律限制了使用面部识别系统和城市范围的禁令，但这些规则倾向于定位政府和企业如何使用这种软件，而不是个人。 </p><p> PimEyes&#39; ease of access and the lack of enforcement of its own search rules makes it a tool primed for online stalking and surveillance, said Lucie Audibert, legal officer with London-based human rights group Privacy International.</p><p>Pimeyes＆＃39; Lucie Audibert，伦敦人权集团隐私国际的法律官员表示，易于访问和缺乏执行自己的搜索规则的工具，使其成为在线跟踪和监督。</p><p> &#34;In the hands of random citizens, like you or me, it becomes a creepy stalking tool where you can identify anyone on the streets or in any public space,&#34; Audibert said.</p><p> ＆＃34;在随机公民的手中，就像你或我一样，它成为一个令人毛骨悚然的跟踪工具，您可以在街道上或任何公共空间中识别任何人，＆＃34; Audibert说。</p><p>  To get a sense for what PimEyes can do and how well it works, CNN Business paid for the $29.99-per-month individual subscription, which gave me the ability to conduct 25 &#34;premium&#34; searches per day, see all the search results PimEyes dredged up from around the internet, and the ability to set up alerts for any new images that PimEyes comes across.</p><p>  为了理解精髓可以做到什么以及它的工作程度如何，CNN业务为每月29.99美元的个人订阅支付，这使我能够进行25＆＃34; premium＆＃34;每天搜索，查看从互联网上疏浚的所有搜索结果的Pimeyes，以及为Pimeyes遇到的任何新图像设置警报的能力。</p><p> I conducted multiple searches for my face online, using new and old photos featuring different hairstyles. In some I wore glasses; in others I did not. Sometimes, before PimEyes would conduct a search, a pop-up forced me to check two boxes saying I accepted the site&#39;s terms of service and that I agreed to use a photo of my face to conduct the search.</p><p> 我在线对我的脸进行了多次搜索，使用具有不同发型的新款和旧照片。在一些我穿眼镜;在别人我没有。有时候，在Pimeyes会进行搜索之前，一个弹出窗口迫使我检查两个盒子，说我接受了该网站和第39条的服务条款，并同意使用我脸部的照片来进行搜索。</p><p> The results that were actually pictures of me (and not, say, pornographic images of similar-looking women, of which there were plenty) were mostly familiar. These included work-related headshots, still images from videos I recorded while testing gadgets years ago, and a picture of me smiling with my high school journalism teacher.</p><p> 实际上是我的结果（而不是，说，类似看起来的女性的色情图像，其中有很多）大多熟悉。这些包括与工作相关的爆头，仍然来自我在测试小工具时录制的视频的图像，以及我与我的高中新闻老师微笑的照片。</p><p>  There was one surprise:  a photo of me dancing at a friend&#39;s wedding in 2013. I hadn&#39;t realized the picture was taken at the time, but that&#39;s not what was startling. Rather, it was the fact that I&#39;m hardly in the picture at all. On the right side of the frame, you can see part of my face, in profile.</p><p>  有一个惊喜：我在朋友跳舞的照片＆＃39; 2013年的婚礼。我曾经意识到这张照片是当时拍摄的，但它不是什么是惊人的。相反，这是我＆＃39;几乎没有在图片中的情况。在框架的右侧，您可以看到我的脸部的一部分，在概况中。</p><p> My eyes appear closed and I&#39;m wearing black glasses. It&#39;s a blurry image, but it&#39;s definitely me.</p><p> 我的眼睛看起来关闭了，我戴着黑眼镜戴着黑眼镜。它＆＃39;模糊图像，但它绝对是我。 </p><p>  With PimEyes, I could trace a selfie to my identity with just a few clicks. As a journalist with headshots and biographies at multiple publications&#39; websites, it&#39;s pretty easy to connect my face to my name online. So I tried again with the image of a friend (after first getting his consent) who works in another field and has a smaller online presence; one of the first results was from his website, which has his name in the URL.</p><p>使用Pimeyes，只需点击几下，我可以追溯到我的身份中的自拍照。作为一个带有爆头和传记的记者，在多个出版物上＆＃39;网站，它＆＃39;很容易在线将我的脸部连接到我的名字。所以我再次尝试了一个朋友的形象（首次获得他的同意之后），他在另一个领域工作，在线存在较小;第一个结果来自他的网站，它在URL中有他的名字。</p><p> With their permission, I also ran several co-workers&#39; selfies through PimEyes to see what popped up. It revealed photos documenting bits and pieces of my colleagues&#39; pasts: my boss&#39;s wedding, the  adoption of another manager&#39;s dog, the time a fellow reporter&#39;s funny facial expression  was turned into a meme when he was in college (he knew this, fortunately). In multiple cases, it only took a click or two to connect faces to names.</p><p> 凭借他们的许可，我也跑了几名同事＆＃39;通过PIMEYES来看看突然出现了什么。它揭示了照片记录的位和我的同事们的部分＆＃39;过去：我的老板＆＃39;婚礼，采用另一个经理＆＃39; S＆＃39;当他在大学时，他有趣的面部表情被转变为一个模因（他知道这个，幸运的是） 。在多种情况下，只需点击或两个即可将面部连接到名称。</p><p>  I wanted to learn more about how PimEyes works, and why it&#39;s open to anyone, as well as who&#39;s behind it. This was much trickier than uploading my own face to the website. The website currently lists no information about who owns or runs the search engine, or how to reach them, and users must submit a form to get answers to questions or help with accounts.</p><p>  我想了解有关Pimeyes如何工作的更多信息，为什么它与任何人开放，以及谁＆＃39;在它后面。这比上传自己的脸庞到网站。该网站目前列出了有关谁拥有或运行搜索引擎的信息，或者如何访问它们，用户必须提交表单以获得问题或帮助帐户的帮助。</p><p> Poring over archived images of the website via the Internet Archive&#39;s Wayback Machine, as well as other online sources, yielded some details about the company&#39;s past and how it has changed over time.</p><p> 通过Internet Archive＆＃39; Wayback机器以及其他在线消息来源，以及其他有关公司的详细信息，以及过去以及如何随着时间的推移而改变了一些关于该网站的存档图像。</p><p> The Pimeyes.com website was initially registered in March 2017, according to a domain name registration lookup conducted through ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).  An &#34;about&#34; page on the Pimeyes website, as well as some news stories, shows it began as a Polish startup.</p><p> 根据ICANN（Internet Corporation用于分配的名称和数字）的域名注册查找，Pimeyes.com网站最初在2017年3月注册。一个＆＃34;关于＆＃34; Pimeyes网站以及一些新闻报道的页面显示它开始作为波兰的创业公司。</p><p> An  archived image of the website&#39;s privacy policy indicated that it was registered as a business in Wroclaw, Poland, as of August 2020. This changed soon after: The website&#39;s  privacy policy currently states that PimEyes&#39; administrator, known as Face Recognition Solutions Ltd., is registered at an address in the Seychelles. An online search of the address — House of Francis, Room 303, Ile Du Port, Mahe, Seychelles — indicated a number of businesses appear to use the same exact address. This suggests that, while it may be registered in the archipelago nation (which is on the  European Union list of tax havens), it may be operating elsewhere.</p><p> 该网站的归档形象＆＃39; S隐私政策表明，它被注册为波兰弗罗茨瓦夫的一家业务，截至2020年8月。此后很快就改变了：该网站＆＃39; S隐私政策目前指出了PIMEYES＆＃39;作为面部识别解决方案有限公司的管理员在塞舌尔的地址注册。在线搜索地址 - 弗朗西斯的房子，303室，Iledout，Mahe，Mahe，Seychelles  - 表示许多企业似乎使用相同的完全地址。这表明，虽然它可能在群岛国家（税前避税避难所列表）中注册，但它可能在其他地方进行运营。</p><p> PimEyes positions itself as a tool for finding pictures of yourself online, yet this was not always its focus. An  image of the website from October 2018, for instance, indicates it instructed users to upload a photo of whomever they wanted to look for. It showed pictures of celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Rihanna, and Donald Trump as examples.</p><p> Pimeyes将自己定位为在线查找自己的照片的工具，但这并不总是它的重点。例如，2018年10月的网站的图像表示它指示用户上传他们想要寻找的任何人的照片。它展示了名人的照片，如Angelina Jolie，Rihanna和Donald Trump为例。 </p><p>  In June 2020,  some  news articles noted how PimEyes may be used by stalkers. In one piece, PimEyes told the BBC that the website&#39;s aim was to help individuals &#34;fight for their own online privacy,&#34; including finding fake profiles, leaked images, and unauthorized photo usage. At the time, it also told the BBC that it worked with police forces via a software investigation tool called Paliscope (and  an archived version of the PimEyes&#39; website&#39;s &#34;Frequently Asked Questions&#34; indicated that PimEyes marketed to law enforcement as recently as that month; though that reference  was gone a few days later, a  company blog post suggests PimEye&#39;s technology can be used to &#34;look for criminals or missing persons.&#34;)</p><p>6月2020年6月，一些新闻文章指出了追踪者可以使用精髓。在一件中，Pimeyes告诉BBC网站＆＃39;宗旨是帮助个人＆＃34;为自己的在线隐私而战;包括查找假型材，泄露的图像和未经授权的照片使用情况。当时，它还告诉英国广播公司，它通过呼吁Paliscope的软件调查工具与警察部队合作（以及一个归档版的Pimeyes＆＃39;网站＆＃39; s＆＃34;常见问题＆＃34;表示本月最近销售到执法部门;虽然参考几天后，一家公司博客帖子表明Pimeye＆＃39; S技术可以用于＆＃34;寻找犯罪分子或失踪人员。＆＃34 ;）</p><p> In early July, the website suddenly emphasized personal privacy. &#34;Upload your photo and find where your face image appears online. Start protecting your privacy,&#34; PimEyes&#39;  site said at the time.</p><p> 7月初，该网站突然强调了个人隐私。 ＆＃34;上传您的照片并找到您的脸部图像在线出现的位置。开始保护您的隐私，＆＃34; Pimeyes＆＃39;网站当时说。</p><p> The shift makes sense to Garvie, who pointed out that, initially, Clearview AI was more widely available than it is now (she knows someone, she said, outside of law enforcement, who had the app on his phone).</p><p> 转变对Garvie有意义，谁指出，最初，ClearView Ai比现在更广泛（她认识某人，她说，在执法之外，他在手机上有了应用程序）。</p><p> She thinks PimEyes more strongly resembles Russian facial-recognition software FindFace than Clearview; FindFace, which was available to consumers in Russia,  gained prominence in 2016 for its ability to match up faces in user-submitted images to pictures on Russian social network Vkontakte. (The software, which was also used  to identify and badger Russian sex workers, is currently available just to business and government customers.)</p><p> 她认为Pimeyes更强烈地类似于俄罗斯面部识别软件FindFace而不是ClearView; FindFace，可供俄罗斯的消费者使用，从2016年获得突出，因为它能够将面向用户提交的图像与俄罗斯社交网络VKontakte上的图片匹配。 （该软件还用于识别和獾俄国性工作者，目前仅适用于商业和政府客户。）</p><p>  To learn more about how the site works, CNN Business sent a note to a generic-sounding PimEyes email address, which was listed on an old version of the website&#39;s privacy policy. It yielded an anonymous response from someone who referred to themselves as &#34;PimEyes Team&#34;; they said the site had been purchased from its previous owners in 2020 (the website  did indicate new owners, along with a new look, in September, but CNN Business could not verify whether or how the change in ownership occurred).</p><p>  要了解有关网站工作原理的更多信息，CNN Business将一个注释发出一份通用声音的Pimeyes电子邮件地址，这些电子邮件地址列于网站的旧版本＆＃39; S隐私政策上。它产生了一个将自己称为＆＃34的人的匿名响应; Pimeyes团队＆＃34 ;;他们表示，该网站已于2020年从其先前的所有者购买（该网站确实表示新所有者，以及9月份的新外观，但CNN业务无法验证是否发生了所有权的变化是如何发生的。</p><p> They refused to conduct a formal interview, saying they &#34;don&#39;t take part in live interviews or direct interviews,&#34; but that they would answer questions sent via email. Over multiple messages they answered a number of questions, but ignored or sidestepped others, such as why the company had switched its focus from suggesting users search for anyone to searching just for yourself.</p><p> 他们拒绝进行正式的面试，说他们＆＃34;唐＆＃39; t参加了直播或直接访谈，＆＃34;但他们会回答通过电子邮件发送的问题。在多个消息中，他们回答了许多问题，但忽略了或忽视了其他人，例如该公司为什么转向用户侧重于用户的焦点，以便为自己搜索任何人搜索。</p><p>  They would not say how much they paid to purchase PimEyes from its prior owners, nor why they bought it, though they did write the company is currently based in the Seychelles due to the country&#39;s &#34;good incorporation environment.&#34;</p><p>  他们不会说他们从先前的所有者购买单金属的费用，也不是为什么他们买了它，虽然他们所做的公司目前是由于国家＆＃39; S＆＃34;良好的融合环境。 ＆＃34; </p><p> When asked where employees are actually based, they answered that PimEyes has an &#34;international team, but we don&#39;t want to disclose details.&#34;</p><p>当被问及员工实际基于的地方时，他们回答了PIMeyes有一个＆＃34;国际团队，但我们不想透露细节。＆＃34;</p><p> Our emails back and forth did reveal a potential clue about their location, however, due to timestamps. The first note I sent them was timestamped at 11:58 am, PDT, on Thursday, April 8; their response, which I got the next day at 2:31 am my time, included my note, but this time the timestamp above my words read 20:58, or 8:58 pm. When it&#39;s 11:58 am in California, it&#39;s 8:58 pm  in a number of places, including Poland. This same nine-hour time difference was evident across numerous emails.</p><p> 我们来回我们的电子邮件确实揭示了他们所在地的潜在线索，然而，由于时间戳。我发给他们的第一个注释是在4月8日星期四的11:58 AM的时间戳;他们的回答，我在第二天在2:31到我的时间，包括我的注意事项，但这次我的单词上方的时间戳读了20:58，或8:58 pm。当它＆＃39;上午11:58在加利福尼亚州，它＆＃39; s 8:58在包括波兰，包括波兰。在众多电子邮件中，相同的九小时时间差异是显而易见的。</p><p> They confirmed that the facial-recognition search engine works similarly to other such systems, by comparing measurements between different facial features in one image (the one you upload) to those in others (in this case, ones it has found online). In order to match up the faces that users submit, PimEyes must scour the internet for images of people. PimEyes doesn&#39;t save images from around the internet, they explained, but it does keep an index of facial-feature measurements from photos it has spotted on the web.</p><p> 他们确认，面部识别搜索引擎通过将不同面部特征的测量（在您上传的一个）与其他人（在这种情况下，它在线找到的那些）来与其他这样的系统类似地运行到其他这样的系统。为了匹配用户提交的面孔，PIMEYES必须为人们进行互联网进行互联网。他们解释说，Pimeyes并不保存来自Internet的图像，但它确实可以从网上所发现的照片中保留面部特征测量的索引。</p><p>  This kind of AI-driven image-matching is different from what happens when you upload a picture of yourself to a site such as Google Images and conduct a search: There, the results will include pictures of similar people (for me, that means lots of dark-haired women in glasses), but Google isn&#39;t using facial measurements in the hopes of finding you, specifically, in other pictures online.</p><p>  这种AI驱动的图像匹配与当您将自己的图片上传到诸如Google Image等网站的网站时会发生不同：在那里，结果将包括类似人的图片（对我而言，这意味着很多戴着眼镜的黑发女性，但谷歌不是＃39; t使用面部测量的希望，特别是在线的其他照片中找到你。</p><p> The person behind the PimEyes Team email would not provide a current figure for how many faces it has indexed. But according to archived images of PimEyes.com, as of August 2018, PimEyes said it had analyzed  &#34;over 30 million websites&#34;, and in November 2019, the company  claimed to have analyzed 900 million faces (Clearview AI, by comparison,  claimed to have scraped over 3 billion photos from the internet as of February 2020).</p><p> Pimeyes团队电子邮件后面的人不会为其索引有多少面孔提供当前数字。但根据2018年8月的Pimeyes.com归档图像，Pimeyes表示已经分析了＆＃34;超过3000万个网站＆＃34;以及2019年11月，该公司声称已经分析了900百万个面孔（ClearView Ai，相比之下，截至2020年2月，声称从互联网上刮了超过3亿张照片）。</p><p> When PimEyes&#39; search engine finds a match between the photo a user uploads and one PimEyes has previously seen online, it can pair the measurements of the previously analyzed photo with the web address where that photo is located. The website shows you an array of all the pictures it thinks look most like your own photo.</p><p> 点心＆＃39;搜索引擎在照片之间找到一个匹配的匹配，用户上传和一个定制先前在线看到的一个定色，它可以将先前分析的照片的测量与该照片所在的Web地址配对。该网站向您展示了一系列的所有图片，它认为最像是您自己的照片。</p><p> The search accuracy, the company claimed, is about 90%; in general, the accuracy of facial-recognition technology depends on many factors, such as the quality of face images that are fed into a system.</p><p> 公司声称的搜索准确性约为90％;通常，面部识别技术的准确性取决于许多因素，例如馈送到系统中的面部图像的质量。 </p><p>  The person behind the PimEyes Team email claimed the company doesn&#39;t use photos that are uploaded by users to improve its software. PimEyes  claims to delete images that are uploaded to the site after two days.</p><p>Pimeyes团队电子邮件背后的人声称公司不使用用户上传的照片来改进其软件。 PIMeyes声称在两天后删除上传到网站的图像。</p><p> They would not name any paying business customers, only saying that &#34;there are no law enforcement agencies among them&#34;.</p><p> 他们不会说出任何支付的商业客户，只说＆＃34;他们中没有执法机构＆＃34;</p><p> And while they confirmed there is no way to enforce the site&#39;s policy of making users search only for themselves (a policy that seems contradicted, at the least, by offering its facial-recognition product to businesses), they pointed out that &#34;any tool or service can be used against the purpose it was created for or its terms of use.&#34;</p><p> 虽然他们确认，但没有办法执行该网站＆＃39;只有让用户搜索的政策＆＃34;任何工具或服务都可以针对它的目的使用，它为其使用条款而创建。＆＃34;</p><p> &#34;It is naive to think that if our search engine didn&#39;t exist, harassers wouldn&#39;t break the law,&#34; they wrote. &#34;On the other hand — we are available to everyone, so any victim of harassment or other internet crime can check themselves using our search engine.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;认为如果我们的搜索引擎没有存在，骚扰者会不会违法，讨论法律，＆＃34;他们写。 ＆＃34;另一方面 - 我们可以为每个人提供，所以任何骚扰或其他互联网犯罪的受害者可以使用我们的搜索引擎来检查自己。＆＃34;</p><p>  This accessibility is precisely what concerns Audibert, of Privacy International, and Garvie, of Georgetown. One of Audibert&#39;s biggest concerns about PimEyes, she said, maybe even more so than with Clearview, is whose hands it could fall into. People could use it to identify others in public places, she points out, while private companies could use it to track people.</p><p>  这种可访问性正是涉及乔治城的隐私国际和Garvie的疑虑。她说，有一个关于Pimeyes的最大担忧之一，她说，也许比明确观点更多，这是谁可以落入的手。她可以使用它来识别公共场所的其他人，而且私营公司可以用它来跟踪人们。</p><p> It could also result in plenty of users misidentifying the faces that the search engine thinks closely resemble the person they&#39;re trying to find, the consequences of which could be enormous. Police already use facial-recognition systems to track down potential suspects, even though the technology  has been shown to be less accurate when identifying people of color.  Several Black men, at least, have been  wrongfully arrested due to this use of facial recognition.</p><p> 它也可能导致大量的用户在搜索引擎认为搜索引擎认为与他们＆＃39的人密切相关的面孔;重新试图找到，这可能是巨大的。警方已经使用面部识别系统来追踪潜在的嫌疑人，尽管在识别颜色人时，技术已被证明是不太准确的。几个黑人，至少由于这种面部认可而被错误地被捕。</p><p> Garvie, who used PimEyes on an image of her own face, noticed that most of the results that were not her were of similar-looking White women in their 30s. This type of misidentification is common across facial-recognition algorithms, she said, and also makes it more likely that a person who sees those results will then make a misidentification.</p><p> Garvie，在她自己脸上的形象上使用了Pimeyes，注意到了大多数结果，这不是她的30多岁的白人女性。她说，这种类型的错误识别在面部识别算法上是常见的，并且还使得一位看到这些结果的人更有可能进行错误识别。 </p><p>  PimEyes&#39; technology could hurt people in other ways, too, such as by outing people who are transgender — intentionally or not. When Rachel Thorn, a professor at Kyoto Seika University, uploaded a recent photo of herself to PimEyes, she encountered other recent images of herself. There were also older images, she said, where she presented as masculine. She looks very different today, she said, but guessed that PimEyes may have picked up on similarities between facial features in a recent photo and old photos.</p><p>Pimeyes＆＃39;技术可能也可以以其他方式伤害别人，例如通过突破变性的人 - 故意与否。当京都Seika大学教授Rachel Thorn，上传了最近给定梅西的照片，她遇到了其他最近的自己。她说，还有较旧的图像，在那里她呈现为男性化。她说，她看起来非常不同，但猜测着定子可以在最近的照片和旧照片中挑选面部特征之间的相似之处。</p><p> &#34;As a transgender person it was not a great feeling to see old photos of myself show up. I&#39;m pretty sure almost any transgender person would feel the same way,&#34; she said.</p><p> ＆＃34;作为一个变性人，看到自己的旧照片出现并不是一种伟大的感觉。我很确定几乎任何跨性别人都会有同感＆＃34;她说。</p><p> Thorn, who studies Japanese graphic novels, known as manga, was impressed by the technology but also worried about how it could be abused. And since the site didn&#39;t stop her from uploading anyone else&#39;s image, she did: She looked up an acquaintance who had worked in pornography by uploading a selfie that person sent her. Sure enough, pornographic images of her friend popped up.</p><p> 研究日本图形小说的荆棘被称为漫画，这项技术印象深刻，但也担心它是如何滥用的。由于该网站并没有阻止她从上传其他任何人和＃39; S形象，她做到了果然，她的朋友的色情图像弹出。</p><p>     &#34;I thought, &#39;Oh my gosh&#39;,&#34; she said. &#34;If you wanted to find out if someone had ever done work in porn, this would do it.&#34;</p><p>     ＆＃34;我想，＆＃39;哦，我的天堂＆＃39;，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;如果你想知道有人在色情工作中做过工作，这会这样做。＆＃34; </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/tech/pimeyes-facial-recognition/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/04/tech/pimeyes-facial-recognition/index.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/clearview/">#clearview</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ai/">#ai</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/pimeyes/">#pimeyes</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
