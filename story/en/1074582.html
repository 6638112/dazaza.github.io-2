Engineers don’t work for you; they work with you.</p><p>与工程团队有效沟通的第一步是了解产品经理的职位。工程师不为你工作；他们和你一起工作。</p><p> Engineering is not there to blindly comply with your demands. They are there to conceive and implement the best possible solutions to the problems and opportunities that you present to them.</p><p>工程不是盲目地满足你的要求。他们在那里构思并实施最好的解决方案，以解决您向他们提出的问题和机遇。</p><p>    Your engineers have their own problems, aspirations, and fears. Sit down with them, together and individually, and make an effort to get to know and bond with them.</p><p>你们的工程师有他们自己的问题、抱负和恐惧。和他们一起坐下来，一起或单独坐下来，努力了解他们并与他们建立联系。</p><p> The information you get from that relationship will help you understand the team’s level of maturity, which will help you find the best way to interact with them and show where you will probably have to focus your time.</p><p>你从这种关系中获得的信息将帮助你了解团队的成熟度，这将帮助你找到与他们互动的最佳方式，并表明你可能需要把时间集中在哪里。</p><p> For example, with a junior product team, you may have to spend more time than desirable on the execution side. In contrast, a senior team can perfectly organize itself, which should free you up to focus on the more strategic part.</p><p>例如，对于初级产品团队，您可能需要在执行方面花费比预期更多的时间。相比之下，一个高级团队可以完美地组织自己，这将使你能够专注于更具战略性的部分。</p><p>  This point may be the most important one in the whole article. You don’t present a solution to an engineering team; you bring them a problem to solve.</p><p>这一点可能是整篇文章中最重要的一点。你没有向工程团队提出解决方案；你给他们带来了一个需要解决的问题。</p><p> The best engineers won’t willingly accept implementing a solution if they have not participated in defining it. The engineers who do it are usually in consulting firms, not in product companies. And if you treat them like in a consulting firm, they will soon stop being your engineers.</p><p>如果最好的工程师没有参与定义解决方案，他们就不会愿意接受实施该解决方案。从事这项工作的工程师通常在咨询公司，而不是产品公司。如果你像在咨询公司一样对待他们，他们很快就会不再是你的工程师。</p><p>  Your mission as a Product Manager is to understand the problem so profoundly that you can introduce it to the team as clearly as if you suffer from it.</p><p>作为一名产品经理，你的任务是深刻地理解问题，以便将其清晰地介绍给团队，就好像你遭受了问题的折磨一样。</p><p> Do your homework. Get loaded with qualitative and quantitative information.  Engineers have a sixth sense for detecting  bullshit. If they feel that you don’t understand the problem, you will lose their confidence and involvement in the initiative.</p><p>做你的家庭作业。获取大量定性和定量信息。工程师们有第六感来发现废话。如果他们觉得你不理解这个问题，你就会失去他们的信心，失去他们对这个计划的参与。</p><p>  At the beginning of the 20th century, Carl Braun was a successful engineer running a 6000 people company.</p><p>20世纪初，卡尔·布劳恩是一位成功的工程师，经营着一家6000人的公司。</p><p> In a Farnam Street post,   Carl Braun on communicating like a grown-up, we read how he  could fire you on the spot if he found out you had given an order without explaining why.</p><p>在Farnam Street的一篇帖子中，卡尔·布劳恩（Carl Braun）讲述了如何像成年人一样沟通。我们读到，如果他发现你下了命令却没有解释原因，他会当场解雇你。</p><p> Starting with the problem is not enough. You have to demonstrate how solving this problem fits with the vision and strategy of the company. Your team also has to understand why you want to solve this particular problem and not any other.</p><p>仅仅从问题开始是不够的。你必须证明解决这个问题如何符合公司的愿景和战略。你的团队还必须理解为什么你想解决这个问题，而不是其他任何问题。</p><p> Your team will do a better job the more they believe in it. Make sure you can argue your decision and create an inspiring narrative.</p><p>你的团队越相信这一点，他们就会做得更好。确保你能为自己的决定进行辩论，并创造一个鼓舞人心的故事。</p><p>  Your engineers want to know if their work impacts the organization. A huge smell that they are working in a feature factory rather than as product engineers is when you don’t define how to measure the success of an initiative.</p><p>你的工程师想知道他们的工作是否会影响组织。当你不确定如何衡量一项计划的成功时，他们会有一种强烈的感觉，那就是他们是在功能工厂工作，而不是作为产品工程师。</p><p> We don’t measure success by the number of story points that the team manages to get each sprint or the number of functionalities that go out the door. We measure success by moving the needle on the metrics that matter to the business.</p><p>我们并不是通过团队在每次冲刺中获得的故事点的数量或推出的功能的数量来衡量成功。我们衡量成功的方法是根据对业务至关重要的指标来衡量。</p><p> If you don’t obsessively communicate the importance of these and can’t get your team interested in them, you’re losing much of their value.</p><p>如果你不执着地传达这些东西的重要性，也不能让你的团队对它们感兴趣，你就失去了它们的价值。</p><p>   Invite your engineers to phases of  discovery that can be useful to understand the problem we want to solve. Keep them abreast of your ideas and listen to their opinions about them.</p><p>邀请您的工程师参加发现阶段，这些阶段对理解我们想要解决的问题非常有用。让他们了解你的想法，倾听他们的意见。</p><p> If your engineers hear first about an initiative when it is 100% defined, you are not doing a good job. The sooner you involve them in the problem, the easier for them to build the best possible solution.</p><p>如果你的工程师第一次听到一个100%确定的计划，你就做得不好。你越早让他们参与问题，他们就越容易找到最好的解决方案。</p><p>  We may think that part of our job as Product Managers is to protect the team from outside influences. It is not.</p><p>我们可能认为，作为产品经理，我们的部分工作是保护团队免受外部影响。事实并非如此。</p><p> Facilitate meetings with the  stakeholders involved in the initiative so that the team can do the best job possible.  Avoid becoming the bottleneck that everything has to go through.</p><p>促进与参与该计划的利益相关者的会议，以便团队尽可能做好工作。避免成为一切都必须经历的瓶颈。</p><p> If an engineer needs to speak to  User Research, let her do so. If a member of the organization interested in the initiative wants to talk directly with an engineer working on it, let her do so.</p><p>如果工程师需要与用户研究人员交谈，让她这样做。如果对该计划感兴趣的组织成员想直接与从事该计划的工程师交谈，就让她这样做。</p><p> If you’ve done your job explaining the problem and why it’s important to solve it, your team should be able to manage itself and decide which meetings are essential and which are not. Only intervene if they ask you to do it.</p><p>如果你已经完成了解释问题以及为什么解决问题很重要的工作，你的团队应该能够自我管理，决定哪些会议是必要的，哪些不是。只有在他们要求你做的时候才进行干预。</p><p>  Like you, engineers need long periods of uninterrupted work to be effective. Don’t interrupt them if it’s not strictly necessary.</p><p>和你一样，工程师需要长时间不间断的工作才能有效工作。如果没有必要，不要打断他们。</p><p> If you work in an  Agile environment, you probably have a  daily meeting to meet and catch up. It will be strange that something is so urgent that it can’t wait until the next day.</p><p>如果你在一个敏捷的环境中工作，你可能会有一个每天的会议来会面和跟进。奇怪的是，事情如此紧急，以至于不能等到第二天。</p><p> In the same way, don’t create meetings from one hour to another unless it is to attack a fire. It is a strong smell of improvisation and not knowing what you are doing very well.</p><p>同样，除非是为了扑火，否则不要在一个小时到另一个小时之间召开会议。这是一种强烈的即兴创作的味道，不知道你在做什么。</p><p> Take the time to think about whether it makes sense to bother the team. Many times these types of meetings come because someone above your rank has had a happy idea, and you want to be proactive in responding to it.</p><p>花点时间想想打扰团队是否有意义。很多时候，这种类型的会议是因为级别高于你的人有了一个好主意，而你想积极主动地回应它。</p><p> Your job is not to make managers happy. It is to make the team’s work impact the business.</p><p>你的工作不是让经理们高兴。这是为了让团队的工作影响业务。</p><p>  Sometimes plans go awry and don’t go as we would like.

Well, let&#39;s get to it! The first step in communicating effectively with your engineering team is understanding your position as a Product Manager.  Engineers don&#39;t work for you; they work with you. Engineering is not there to blindly comply with your demands. They are there to conceive and implement the best possible solutions to the problems and opportunities that you present to them.You are a guide, not a foreman.   Your engineers have their own problems, aspirations, and fears. Sit down with them, together and individually, and make an effort to get to know and bond with them.The information you get from that relationship will help you understand the team&#39;s level of maturity, which will help you find the best way to interact with them and show where you will probably have to focus your time.For example, with a junior product team, you may have to spend more time than desirable on the execution side.

We can apply any tips we discussed here to engage with other organization members.From here on, it is up to you.
