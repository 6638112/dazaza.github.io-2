Something about buying a laptop with poor thermals, a restrictive operating system, and a $1400 price tag just didn’t sit right with me. I was more content using my beat-up Thinkpad with Linux installed.</p><p>据我所记得，我一直对苹果产品不屑一顾。购买一些散热不良，操作系统受限且售价1400美元的笔记本电脑的事情对我来说并不正确。使用安装了Linux的破旧的Thinkpad，我感到更加满足。</p><p> But 2020 has been an interesting year. So it would be fitting that 2020 would be the first year that I would venture out to buy a new laptop and somehow settle on choosing the new M1 Macbook Air. After using it for the past few weeks, I could not be happier. However, this got me thinking. How did Apple convince me (a staunch critic of Apple products) to buy a Mac?</p><p> 但是2020年是有趣的一年。因此，将2020年成为我冒险冒险购买新笔记本电脑并以某种方式选择购买新的M1 Macbook Air的第一年很合适。在过去几周内使用它后，我再也无法快乐了。但是，这让我开始思考。苹果如何说服我（对苹果产品的坚定批评者）购买Mac？</p><p> After retracing my steps, I realized it was primarily due to their copywriting. As an engineer, I’ve only recently started to realize how important copywriting is when selling anything. Apple’s recent campaign around the new M1 Macs has been nothing short of spectacular and as engineers, I feel like there 2 key takeaways we all can learn from them.</p><p> 回顾我的步骤后，我意识到这主要是由于他们的文案撰写。作为工程师，我直到最近才开始意识到出售任何东西时文案写作的重要性。苹果公司最近针对新型M1 Mac所做的宣传活动引人注目，作为工程师，我觉得我们可以从中学到两个要点。</p><p>  Two years ago I had just started my own startup that was highly technical. We were building computer vision algorithms to empower minimally trained medical professionals to do oral disease screenings. Our team was filled with engineers who were always striving to grow our accuracy so we could improve the value of our product.</p><p>  两年前，我刚刚启动了自己的高科技公司。我们正在构建计算机视觉算法，以授权受过最少培训的医学专业人员进行口腔疾病筛查。我们的团队充满了工程师，他们一直在努力提高我们的准确性，以便我们可以提高产品的价值。</p><p> This mentality carried over to our marketing materials, from our website to our sales deck. We had an accuracy of 85% which was about 15% more effective than the current incumbent, and we let everybody know. The number 85 was plastered over everything and we were proud of it. We even showed people how great our F1 Score was in relation to other medical AI companies. Our marketing was heavy on the numbers which we felt accurately demonstrated our product’s value.</p><p> 从我们的网站到销售平台，这种心态一直延续到我们的营销材料中。我们的准确率达到了85％，比目前的现有系统高出约15％，我们让所有人都知道。数字85贴在所有东西上，我们为此感到自豪。我们甚至向人们展示了我们的F1得分与其他医疗AI公司相比有多么出色。我们的营销工作集中在我们认为能准确证明我们产品价值的数字上。</p><p> However, it never really resonated with customers. Most doctors we were pitching to didn’t even know what an F1 score was. To see how to do numbers correctly we should look at the following marketing material:</p><p> 但是，它从未真正引起客户的共鸣。我们招募的大多数医生甚至都不知道F1​​分数是多少。要查看如何正确进行数字处理，我们应该查看以下营销材料：</p><p>  Apple showed this graph at a recent event but notice how there are only 2 numbers on the screen. Even the graph has no clearly visible indicators on the y and x-axis (you really have to pay attention to what each axis represents). Instead, it shows the improvement in relation to other chips without blasting the crowd with a series of numbers. Now, this is how Apple communicates this improvement on their website when focusing on potential customers:</p><p>  苹果公司在最近的一次活动中显示了这张图表，但是注意到屏幕上只有2个数字。即使图形在y和x轴上也没有清晰可见的指示器（您确实必须注意每个轴代表什么）。取而代之的是，它显示了相对于其他芯片的改进，而没有用一系列的数字吸引人群。现在，当关注潜在客户时，这就是Apple在其网站上传达此改进的方式： </p><p>  Now the Apple marketing team could have used this space to go into the specifics about the power draw of this new M1 chip and how it’s better than the old Intel chips. In fact, this move was wildly criticized by technical reviewers. Most notably Linus Tech Tips said that Apple’s unwillingness to release these specific numbers could be their downfall on this new Mac ( video link). Yet this Mac has had a great reception and great sales.</p><p>现在，苹果营销团队可以利用这个空间来详细介绍这种新型M1芯片的功耗以及它比旧的英特尔芯片更好的方面。实际上，此举遭到了技术评论家的广泛批评。最著名的Linus Tech Tips表示，苹果不愿发布这些具体数字的原因可能是他们对这款新Mac（视频链接）的失望。然而，这款Mac机拥有很高的知名度和销量。</p><p> So why did this marketing move work? Because Apple focused on how this better power consumption was going to solve the deeper emotional problems of their consumers. In one swift sentence, they were able to communicate 3 very key points.</p><p> 那么，为什么这种营销方式起作用呢？因为苹果专注于这种更好的功耗将如何解决消费者的更深层的情感问题。很快，他们就可以传达3个非常关键的观点。</p><p> With “Up to 18 hours of battery life. That’s 6 more hours, free of charge”, the Apple marketing team is able to show how this better battery consumption will increase the overall time you (as the consumer) have during a single charge but also clearly draws the competitive advantage by saying that is 6 hours more than their previous models/competitors. Finally, ending with “free of charge” lets us know that we aren’t going to paying more for this increased efficiency. It’s a powerful sentence that clearly conveys a technical topic like the M1 chip’s power consumption into something more digestible to your everyday consumer.</p><p> 具有“长达18小时的电池寿命。苹果的销售团队将再免费提供6个小时的服务”，苹果营销团队能够证明这种更好的电池消耗将如何增加您（作为消费者）在单次充电期间的总时间，同时通过以下方式明显地吸引竞争优势：比以前的型号/竞争对手多6个小时。最后，以“免费”结尾，我们知道我们不会为提高效率而付出更多。这句话有力，清楚地传达了M1芯片功耗等技术主题，使您的日常消费者更容易理解。</p><p>   This new Mac has great thermals to the point where there is no fan in the Macbook air. However, even without a fan, there is no tradeoff with performance. Again, the Apple team could have used this time to speak about how hot the Macbook actually gets. They could have pulled an MKBHD and used a temperature gun to compare the temperature under different workloads and put this video on their site. Instead, they recognized the real problem is that most people hate the sound of their laptop’s fan cranking away while they are trying to get work done. So rather than getting into the weeds, Apple decided to step back and focus on what pain point they are solving.</p><p>   这款新Mac的散热效果非常好，以至于Macbook空气中没有风扇。但是，即使没有风扇，也无法在性能上进行权衡。再一次，苹果团队本来可以利用这段时间来谈论Macbook的实际发热量。他们本可以拉出MKBHD，然后使用温度枪比较不同工作负载下的温度，然后将此视频放到他们的站点上。相反，他们认识到真正的问题是，大多数人都讨厌在尝试完成工作时笔记本电脑风扇发出的声音。因此，苹果决定不退缩，而是退后一步，专注于他们正在解决的痛苦点上。</p><p> How I’ve decided to apply this was taking a step back and every time I saw that we were using too many numbers, I thought critically about what issue we were solving with that number and replaced it with that.</p><p> 我决定采用此方法的方法要退后一步，每次我看到我们使用过多的数字时，我都会认真思考要用该数字解决什么问题，然后换成那个。</p><p> For example, why did health systems care about our device having 85% accuracy? With higher accuracy, doctors were able to refer their patients with more confidence and improve health outcomes. We quickly changed our copywriting to reflect this sentiment.</p><p> 例如，为什么卫生系统关心我们的设备具有85％的准确性？通过更高的准确性，医生可以更自信地为患者推荐病人并改善健康状况。我们迅速更改了广告文案，以反映这一观点。</p><p>  This is something that took me a long time to get past. After going through university, most of my writing became extremely formal. But the truth is no one speaks like that. However, when writing marketing materials, I feel like most engineers default to writing like they are trying to pass a university final rather than talk to a customer.</p><p>  这让我花了很长时间才能过去。大学毕业后，我的大部分写作变得非常正式。但事实是，没有人这么说。但是，在编写营销材料时，我觉得大多数工程师都默认不写，就像他们试图通过大学期末考试而不是与客户交谈一样。 </p><p> When you scroll down Apple’s website, it seems like someone is speaking to you. For example:</p><p>当您向下滚动Apple网站时，似乎有人在与您说话。例如：</p><p>  Now this is actually a pretty technical point that Apple is trying to get across. However, they are speaking to us, the consumer, in a super casual tone. They start out with a pretty number centric pitch. However, they quickly pivot to speaking about how this extra speed will help you with your day to day activities. During this part of the pitch, they sound like a normal person.</p><p>  现在，这实际上是Apple试图克服的技术问题。但是，他们以一种非常随意的语调与我们的消费者交谈。他们以漂亮的以数字为中心的音高开始。但是，他们很快转向谈论这种额外的速度将如何帮助您进行日常活动。在音调的这一部分，他们听起来像个普通人。</p><p> The light gray paragraph is filled with shortened words (like pro vs. professional) and run-on sentences. They use casual language like “That’s” and casual terminology like “brain power”. If I wrote like this while doing my undergrad ethics class I’m sure I wouldn’t have passed. However, when you see any company writing like this it humanizes them.</p><p> 浅灰色段填充有缩短的单词（如专业版与专业版）和连词。他们使用随意的语言（例如“ That’s”）和随意的术语（例如“ brain power”）。如果我在读本科道德课时这样写，那我肯定不会通过。但是，当您看到任何一家公司这样写作时，它们就会人性化。</p><p> This gave me flashbacks to 2 related moments during my freshman year during school. The first moment came when I was walking into my engineering library and saw a desk set up in the entryway. Two students stood in front of it hawking a new app that lets you get discounts on food within Green Street (the most popular street at UIUC). Since they were near the staircase, I had to listen briefly to their spiel before grabbing a brochure and leaving. I never downloaded that app and it soon went under so I’m assuming most people also didn’t download the app. The second moment came my junior year where during a party, a friend of a friend mentioned how he was using this brand new app on campus which let him see food deals. I had built up enough rapport with this stranger where I thought it would be worth checking out this app so I downloaded it that night. I later came to find out that guy was a campus ambassador for that app and it was his job to get students on the app. Even after finding that out, I still kept the app.</p><p> 这使我在大学一年级时回想起2个相关时刻。当我走进工程图书馆，看到入口处摆放了一张桌子时，第一刻就来到了。两名学生站在它前面摆着一个新应用程序，该应用程序使您可以在Green Street（UIUC最受欢迎的街道）内获得食品折扣。因为他们在楼梯附近，所以我不得不简短地听取他们的谈话，然后拿起小册子并离开。我从未下载过该应用程序，但很快就破产了，因此我认为大多数人也没有下载该应用程序。第二个时刻是我三年级的时候，在一次聚会上，一个朋友的朋友提到了他如何在校园中使用这个全新的应用程序，这使他可以看到食物交易。我已经与这个陌生人建立了足够的融洽关系，我认为值得一试这个应用程序，所以那天晚上我下载了它。后来我发现那个家伙是那个应用程序的校园大使，让学生使用这个应用程序是他的工作。即使找到了答案，我仍然保留了该应用程序。</p><p> So why did I download the app the second time and not the first? Because the first time, I was in a situation where I felt like I was being sold something. Those campus ambassadors had a script and they stuck to it. The second time, I wasn’t actually being sold anything but rather listening to a guy talk about his experience on the app. The difference was very noticeable. In the first case, they were rattling off numbers about how much money I could save while in the second case, the ambassador told me stories about how he got 30 chicken nuggets for 6 dollars or how he was able to get a free meal for his date after finding a buy 1 get 1 free offer at a local burrito joint.</p><p> 那么，为什么我第二次而不是第一次下载该应用程序？因为这是我第一次感到自己被卖了东西。那些校园大使有一个剧本，他们坚持了下来。第二次，我实际上没有被出售任何东西，而是听一个家伙谈论他在应用程序上的经历。差异非常明显。在第一种情况下，他们正在核算我可以节省多少钱的数字，而在第二种情况下，大使告诉我有关他如何以6美元买下30块鸡块或如何能够免费获得餐点的故事。在当地的墨西哥卷饼联合会找到买一送一的免费优惠后的日期。</p><p> This can be applied to copywriting. The difference between bad and good copywriting is the ability to make it not sound like a sales pitch. If people feel like they are trying to be sold something, they are more likely to put up a wall and not buy anything. As an engineer, I try to write about what I’m working on like I’m telling my friend about it. That way it’s always more personable. Remember, people don’t like being sold to.</p><p> 这可以应用于文案写作。好的文案与不好的文案之间的区别在于能够使其听起来不像是销售宣传。如果人们觉得自己想卖东西，那么他们更有可能盖墙而不买东西。作为工程师，我试图写自己正在做的事情，就像我告诉我的朋友一样。这样一来，总是更有风度。请记住，人们不喜欢被出售给。</p><p>  Apple does a great job of technical copywriting. Their teams are great at taking complex technical advantages and condensing them down into something more understandable. I think we can all learn from them and apply some of their methods to our own side projects. As the saying goes –  “Good artists make, great artists steal”</p><p>  苹果在技术文案撰写方面做得很好。他们的团队擅长利用复杂的技术优势，并将其凝聚成更容易理解的东西。我认为我们都可以向他们学习，并将他们的一些方法应用于我们自己的副项目中。俗话说“好艺术家造，好艺术家偷” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://quixoticnomad.blog/technical-copywriting-what-engineers-can-learn-from-apples-m1-macbook-marketing-campaign/">https://quixoticnomad.blog/technical-copywriting-what-engineers-can-learn-from-apples-m1-macbook-marketing-campaign/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/macbook/">#macbook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/文案/">#文案</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/数字/">#数字</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
