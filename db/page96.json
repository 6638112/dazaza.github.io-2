federal court proceedings on camera has cleared the Senate committee.\n  On Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee   approved two bills aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in the nation\u2019s highest courts. The   Cameras in the Courtroom Act \u201crequires the Supreme Court to permit television coverage of all open sessions of the court,\u201d although the justices can still vote to deny broadcasts if they believe such coverage could directly impact the proceedings. The second bill, the   Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, grants judges in all federal courts the discretion to allow cameras in the courtroom provided that the identities of witnesses and jurors are protected when necessary.\n First introduced in March, the bills have secured bipartisan support, including an endorsement from both the panel\u2019s chair, Senator Richard Durbin of Illinois, and the committee\u2019s ranking Republican member, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa,   Politico reports. This marks the first time such legislation has cleared the Senate committee in more than a decade, according to the judicial system watchdog Fix the Court. Several members spoke strongly in favor of the bills on Thursday.\n    \u201cI have been introducing legislation to open up our courtrooms to the American people for over 25 years now,\u201d said Grassley in   a statement. \u201cI think if the American people can see how justice is done, they\u2019ll have a better appreciation for it. Right now the working of the courts is a remote process that most people don\u2019t really know about unless they\u2019re lawyers or criminals. These bills would help change that.\u201d\n  Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a former prosecutor herself, pointed to the recent trial of former Minneapolis cop and convicted murderer Derek Chauvin as an example of how the transparency that broadcasts provide can improve the public\u2019s trust in the judicial system as a whole.\n   \u201cIt was a moment of redemption in part because people could see their fellow citizens talk about what happened,\u201d Klobuchar said   Thursday. \u201cIf that hadn\u2019t been televised, the verdict could probably have been the same, but people wouldn\u2019t have been able to see that and share in that moment.\u201d\n Of course, not everyone on the Judiciary Committee was singing the bills\u2019 praises. Several Republican lawmakers opposed the transparency measures or attempted to water them down, Politico reports. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas called the legislation \u201cill-advised\u201d and argued that the nation\u2019s court system is transparent enough as it stands. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas warned that opening federal courts to cameras could also open them up to the kind of showboating and theatrics endemic to reality TV.\n  \u201cI think it is better for our country if the Supreme Court is a little more boring and doesn\u2019t have Judge Judy as the dynamic in the courtroom,\u201d he said.\n In pre-pandemic times, the Supreme Court made audio recordings of its proceedings public at the end of each week. Widespread lockdowns related to the spread of covid-19 led the court to provide live audio broadcasts of oral arguments for the first time in its history beginning in May 2020, something many federal appeals courts had already been doing even before the pandemic.\n  However, video recordings have always been a strict no-no in the nation\u2019s highest court, though, in the last year, federal courts have been taking advantage of a provision of the   CARES Act allowing hearings in criminal cases to be held by video conference or teleconference due to the pandemic.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 14:18:31", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662,approves,\u6cd5\u9662", "title": "\u53c2\u8bae\u9662\u6279\u51c6\u7acb\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5e7f\u64ad\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a ", "title_en": "Senate Approves Legislation to Broadcast Supreme Court Hearings", "transed": 1, "url": "https://gizmodo.com/senate-committee-approves-legislation-to-broadcast-supr-1847169696", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662", "approves", "\u6cd5\u9662"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "334bc482fdbfff236756e7c4c8913e10.jpg", "infoid": 1068187, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u6b63\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u65f6\u901a\u77e5\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e3e\u63aa\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u4e3a\u6253\u7834\u5728\u7ebf\u7684\u8fdd\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u80cc\u666f -

The move is a notable step by the world\u2019s most popular search engine to give people more context about breaking information that\u2019s popular online \u2014 like suspected UFO sightings or developing news stories \u2014 that are actively evolving.\n The new prompt warns users that the results they are seeing are changing quickly, and reads, in part, \u201cIf this topic is new, it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources.\u201d Google confirmed to Recode that it started testing the feature about a week ago. Currently, the company says the notice is only showing up in a small percentage of searches, which tend to be about developing trending topics.\n Companies like  Google,  Twitter, and  Facebook have often  struggled to handle the  high volume of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and unverified news stories that run rampant on the internet. In the past, they have largely stayed away from taking content down in all but the most extreme cases, citing a commitment to free speech values. During the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 US elections, some companies took the unprecedented action of taking down  popular accounts perpetuating misinformation. But the kind of label Google is rolling out \u2014 which simply warns users without blocking content \u2014 reflects a more long-term incremental approach to educating users about questionable or incomplete information.\n \u201cWhen anybody does a search on Google, we\u2019re trying to show you the most relevant, reliable information we can,\u201d said Danny Sullivan, a public liaison for Google Search. \u201cBut we get a lot of things that are entirely new,\u201d\n    Sullivan said the notice isn\u2019t saying that what you\u2019re seeing in search results is right or wrong \u2014 but that it\u2019s a changing situation, and more information may come out later.\n As an example, Sullivan cited a report about a suspected UFO sighting in the UK.\n \u201cSomeone had gotten this police report video released out in Wales, and it\u2019s had a little bit bit of press coverage. But there\u2019s still not a lot about it,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cBut people are probably searching for it, they may be going around on social media \u2014 so we can tell it\u2019s starting to trend. And we can also tell that there\u2019s not a lot of necessarily great stuff that\u2019s out there. And we also think that maybe new stuff will come along,\u201d\n Other examples of trending search queries that could currently prompt the notice are \u201cwhy is britney on lithium\u201d and \u201cblack triangle ufo ocean\u201d\n The feature builds on Google\u2019s recent efforts to help users with \u201csearch literacy,\u201d or to better understand context about what they\u2019re looking up. In April 2020, the company  released a feature telling people when there aren\u2019t enough good matches for their search, and in February 2021, it  added an \u201cabout\u201d button next to most search results showing people a brief Wikipedia description of the site they\u2019re seeing, when available.\n Google told Recode it ran user research on the notice that showed people found it helpful.\n The new prompt is also part of a larger trend by major tech companies to give people more context about new information that could turn out to be be wrong. Twitter, for example,  released a slew of features ahead of the 2020 US elections cautioning users if information they were seeing was not yet verified.\n Some social media researchers welcome the types of added context like the one Google rolled out today, including Renee DiResta at the Stanford Internet Observatory who  tweeted about the feature. It\u2019s a welcome alternative, they say, to the debates around whether or not to ban a certain account or post.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a great way of making people pause before they act on or spread information further,\u201d said Evelyn Douek, a researcher at Harvard who studies online speech. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t involve anyone making judgments about the truth or falsity of any story but just gives the readers more context. \u2026 In almost all breaking news contexts, the first stories are not the complete ones, and so it\u2019s good to remind people of that.\u201d\n There are still some questions about how this all will work, though. For example, it\u2019s not clear exactly what sources Google finds to be reliable on a given search result, and how many reliable sources need to weigh in before a questionable trending news topic loses the label. As the feature rolls out more broadly, we can likely expect to see more discussion about how it\u2019s implemented.\n  Millions turn to Vox to understand what\u2019s happening in the news.

Broadly construed, logic, therefore, is that specific branch of philosophy that studies the processes of correct thinking.\n Etymologically speaking, the term \u201clogic\u201d is derived from the Greek word logos, which is often translated in English as \u201cword\u201d, \u201cdiscourse\u201d or \u201creason\u201d. In the Greek tradition of understanding the nature of reality, the term \u201creason\u201d was commonly appropriated. And for the ancient Greek thinkers, logos as \u201creason\u201d could mean two things, namely: 1) that which refers to \u201chuman reason\u201d, which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality, and 2) that which refers to \u201cuniversal intelligence\u201d or \u201crational divine intelligence\u201d\u2015indeed, that universal ruling force that governs the cosmos.\n   When understood in the  second sense, logos then means (as the ancient Greek thinkers would have us believe) the \u201clight-giving principle\u201d, which enables human persons to understand the nature, dynamics, and mysteries of the universe. When understood in the  first sense, that is, as \u201chuman reason\u201d, logos connotes \u201cstudy\u201d, that is, the rationality of the human mind which seeks to attain an objective or universal understanding of the nature of reality. Thus, when we employ the term logos in our attempt to make sense of or study something, then we are dealing with the term logos in the first sense. For example, when we define the term \u201cpsychology\u201d from the vantage point of its etymology, then we say that psychology comes from the two Greek words, namely,  psyche, which means \u201cmind\u201d, and  logos, which means \u201cstudy\u201d. Thus, etymologically speaking, psychology is defined as the study of the mind. Indeed, it is in this context that \u201clogic\u201d is, again, defined as the study (or science or reason) of the correct processes of thinking or reasoning.\n More specifically, when we study the correct processes of thinking or reasoning, we are necessarily dealing with arguments. Hence,  in logic, we will be primarily dealing with the principles that govern the validity of arguments, that is, whether a certain conclusion follows from the given premises or assumptions. Let us consider the examples below.\n If it rains today, then the road is wet.  It rains today.  Therefore, the road is wet.\n  The professor will be absent if and only if she is sick.  The professor is sick.  Therefore, she will be absent.\n  The arguments above are obviously valid arguments because their conclusions necessarily follow from the premises. Again, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true for the argument to be valid. However, there are more complicated arguments whose validity cannot be determined by simply looking at them. These arguments require a thorough analysis before we can say that they are indeed valid or not. This is precisely what concerns us in logic, and this is what the rest of the discussions in logic would like to address.

Introduction A QR-code is used to encode text as a graphical image. Depending on the characters used in the text various encoding options for a QR- code exists, e.g. Numeric, Alphanumeric and Byte mode. Even in Byte mode a typical QR-code reader tries to interpret a byte sequence as an UTF-8 or ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded text. Thus QR-codes cannot be used to encode arbitrary binary data directly. Such data has to be converted into an appropriate text before that text could be encoded as a QR-code. Compared to already established Base64, Base32 and Base16 encoding schemes, that are described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648], the Base45 scheme described in this document offer a more compact QR- code encoding. One important difference from those and Base45 is the key table and that the padding with &#39;=&#39; is not required.2. Conventions Used in This Document The key words &#34;MUST&#34;, &#34;MUST NOT&#34;, &#34;REQUIRED&#34;, &#34;SHALL&#34;, &#34;SHALL NOT&#34;, &#34;SHOULD&#34;, &#34;SHOULD NOT&#34;, &#34;RECOMMENDED&#34;, &#34;MAY&#34;, and &#34;OPTIONAL&#34; in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].3. Interpretation of Encoded Data Encoded data is to be interpreted as described in RFC 4648 [RFC4648] with the exception that a different alphabet is selected. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 2] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214. The Base45 Encoding A 45-character subset of US-ASCII is used; the 45 characters usable in a QR code in Alphanumeric mode. Base45 encodes 2 bytes in 3 characters, compared to Base64, which encodes 3 bytes in 4 characters. For encoding two bytes [a, b] MUST be interpreted as a number n in base 256, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 16 bits so that the number n = (a*256) + b. This number n is converted to base 45 [c, d, e] so that n = c + (d*45) + (e*45*45). Note the order of c, d an e which are chosen so that the left-most [c] is the least significant. The values c, d and e are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a three character string. The process is reversed when decoding. For encoding a single byte [a], it MUST be interpreted as a base 256 number, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 8 bit. That integer MUST be converted to base 45 [c d] so that a = c + (45*d). The values c and d are then looked up in Table 1 to produce a two character string. A byte string [a b c d ... x y z] with arbitrary content and arbitrary length MUST be encoded as follows: From left to right pairs of bytes are encoded as described above. If the number of bytes is even, then the encoded form is a string with a length which is evenly divisible by 3. If the number of bytes is odd, then the last (rightmost) byte is encoded on two characters as described above. For decoding a Base45 encoded string the inverse operations are performed.4.1. When to use Base45 If binary data is to be stored in a QR-Code one possible way is to use the Alphanumeric mode that uses 11 bits for 2 characters as defined in section 7.3.4 in ISO/IEC 18004:2015 [ISO18004]. The ECI mode indicator for this encoding is 0010. If the data is to be sent via some other transport, a transport encoding suitable for that transport should be used instead of Base45. It is not recommended to first encode data in Base45 and then encode the resulting string in for example Base64 if the data is to be sent via email. Instead the Base45 encoding should be removed, and the data itself should be encoded in Base64. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 3] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.2. The alphabet used in Base45 The Alphanumeric mode is defined to use 45 characters as specified in this alphabet. Table 1: The Base45 Alphabet Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding Value Encoding 00 0 12 C 24 O 36 Space 01 1 13 D 25 P 37 $ 02 2 14 E 26 Q 38 % 03 3 15 F 27 R 39 * 04 4 16 G 28 S 40 + 05 5 17 H 29 T 41 - 06 6 18 I 30 U 42 . 07 7 19 J 31 V 43 / 08 8 20 K 32 W 44 : 09 9 21 L 33 X 10 A 22 M 34 Y 11 B 23 N 35 Z4.3. Encoding examples It should be noted that although the examples are all text, Base45 is an encoding for binary data where each octet can have any value 0-255. Encoding example 1: The string &#34;AB&#34; is the byte sequence [65 66]. The 16 bit value is 65 * 256 + 66 = 16706. 16706 equals 11 + 45 * 11 + 45 * 45 * 8 so the sequence in base 45 is [11 11 8]. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;BB8&#34;. Encoding example 2: The string &#34;Hello!!&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [72 101 108 108 111 33 33]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [18533 27756 28449 33]. Note the 33 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[38 6 9] [36 31 13] [9 2 14] [33 0]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;%69 VD92EX0&#34;. Encoding example 3: The string &#34;base-45&#34; as ASCII is the byte sequence [98 97 115 101 45 52 53]. If we look at each 16 bit value, it is [25185 29541 11572 53]. Note the 53 for the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get [[30 19 12] [21 26 14] [7 32 5] [8 1]] where the last byte is represented by two. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the encoded string &#34;UJCLQE7W581&#34;. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 4] Internet-Draft Base45 June 20214.4. Decoding examples Decoding example 1: The string &#34;QED8WEX0&#34; represents, when looked up in Table 1, the values [26 14 13 8 32 14 33 0]. We arrange at the numbers in chunks of three, except last which can be two, and get [[26 14 13] [8 32 14] [33 0]]. In base 45 we get [26981 29798 33] where the bytes are [[105 101] [116 102] [33]]. If we look at the ascii values we get the string &#34;ietf!&#34;.5. IANA Considerations There are no considerations for IANA in this document.6. Security Considerations When implementing encoding and decoding it is important to be very careful so that buffer overflow or similar does not occur. This of course includes the calculations for modulo 45 and lookup in the table of characters (Table 1). A decoder also must be robust regarding input, including proper handling of any octet value 0-255, including the NUL character (ASCII 0). It should be noted that Base64 and some other encodings pad the string so that the encoding starts with an aligned number of characters, Base45 specifically avoids padding. Because of this, special care has to be taken when odd number of octets are to be encoded, which results not in N*3 characters, but (N-1)*3+2 characters in the encoded string and similarly, at decoding, when the number of encoded characters are not evenly divisible by 3. Base encodings use a specific, reduced alphabet to encode binary data. Non-alphabet characters could exist within base-encoded data, caused by data corruption or by design. Non-alphabet characters may be exploited as a &#34;covert channel&#34;, where non-protocol data can be sent for nefarious purposes. Non-alphabet characters might also be sent in order to exploit implementation errors leading to, e.g., buffer overflow attacks. Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains characters outside the base alphabet (in Table 1) when interpreting base-encoded data. Even though a Base45 encoded string contains only characters from the alphabet in Table 1 the following case has to be considered: The string &#34;FGW&#34; represents 65535 (FFFF in base 16), which is a valid encoding. The string &#34;GGW&#34; would represent 65536 (10000 in base 16), which is represented by more than 16 bit. Faltstrom, et al. Expires December 16, 2021 [Page 5] Internet-Draft Base45 June 2021 Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains a triplet of characters which, when decoded, result in an unsigned integer which is greater then 65535 (ffff in base 16). It should be noted that the resulting string after encoding to Base45 might include non-URL-safe characters so if the URL including the Base45 encoded data have to be URL safe, one have to use %-encoding.7.

Between hunts, raucous groups \u201chaul out\u201d onto sea ice to rest. In recent decades, the withering of Arctic ice floes has forced such gatherings onto land, where thousands of walruses lie two or three deep\u2014the weak and the young can die from suffocation or stampedes. In 2019, the Russian photographer Evgenia Arbugaeva spent two weeks, with a scientist, stuck in the middle of a haul-out in the far eastern Chukotka region. The animals stank so badly that her eyes watered. At night, they fought, or made noises, she says, like orcs in \u201c The Lord of the Rings.\u201d In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s more haunting images, a walrus looks in toward her camera through the rough wooden doorway of a gloomy hut. Behind the creature was a floundering mass of its fellows, all leathery flesh and raised tusks. The transfixing thing is the walrus\u2019s eye, which appears to regard the hut\u2019s interior the way an albatross seemingly did  Melville\u2019s Ishmael: \u201cThrough its inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God.\u201d\n   Arbugaeva was born in the port town of Tiksi, in Siberia. A graduate of the photojournalism program at the International Center of Photography and a contributing photographer to  National Geographic, Arbugaeva made the \u201cChukotka\u201d series between 2018 and 2019, over the course of four trips. The image of the walrus in the doorway sits alongside photos of more or less austere interiors and scenes of traditional hunting life. A dead whale lies at the water\u2019s edge, stars winking overhead. In a small boat, four men\u2014one of them, cigarette in mouth, raising his rifle\u2014approach a walrus in a ritual that looks (firearm aside) ancient and still, violence as bated breath. As Arbugaeva tells it, Chukchi hunters speak silently to their prey after the hunt is over, asking for forgiveness and explaining how they will use the whale\u2019s body. In these photographs, and frequently in Arbugaeva\u2019s work, the scenes have a subdued underwater look, as if recovered from the deep past or icebound legend.\n   The darkling aesthetic is already present in \u201c Weather Man,\u201d the earliest of the four stories (as Arbugaeva prefers to say) in the project, begun in 2013. Arbugaeva told me that it takes weeks to reach each of her Arctic destinations\u2014by plane, boat, and dogsled. Once there, detached from news and ordinary life, the mind behaves strangely, filling the blankness of a daylight landscape, then losing itself in darkness and distance. \u201cWeather Man\u201d is a study of a meteorologist, Vyacheslav Korotki, who lives amid this emptiness, in Khodovarikha, in northern Russia. Arbugaeva uses digital cameras robust enough for Arctic weather; nonetheless, in some respects, her photographs of Korotki\u2014attending to his paper records, visiting an old lighthouse for firewood, making matchstick houses to pass the time\u2014look as though they could have been made at any point in the past century.\n  This atmosphere is not just a matter of style. Some of the places that Arbugaeva photographs really do hover on the edge of history, threatening to blink out. The island of Dikson, in the Kara Sea, is one of the fastest-warming spots in all of Russia, one half of a settlement\u2014the other half is on the mainland\u2014whose population greatly declined after the end of the Soviet Union, from five thousand to around three hundred today. The island portion is populated only by meteorologists. Arbugaeva travelled there with her brother, a filmmaker; she visited all the vacant buildings but struggled to find a way to photograph them. Pictures of ruins from the Soviet era have become a clich\u00e9 in recent decades, but those taken by Arbugaeva conjure something other than the  frisson of  Ostalgie. Her project was saved by, of all things, the fantastical arrival of the aurora borealis; for a matter of hours, confectionary spirals of jade light transformed the island. Arbugaeva raced, sweating, between scenes she had already scouted: a piano clogged with snow, a button-eyed toy by a frosted window, sharp-edged green shadows advancing on the town.\n   An exhibition of Arbugaeva\u2019s work, which recently concluded at the Photographers\u2019 Gallery in London, is called \u201c Hyperborea\u201d\u2014an allusion to a tribe in Greek mythology that lived beyond the north wind. Arbugaeva has long been fascinated by speculative maps of this territory, \u201cthe way the Arctic was alive in people\u2019s imagination before they even set foot there.\u201d Though she calls herself a documentarian, imagination and even magic play parts in her work. Her photographs, she says, may seem too detached from history, \u201ctoo sweet\u201d in their auroral spectacle or still-life hush. The unreality is deliberate. Her work is meant to invoke the folktales attached to Arctic landscapes, the sense of a world subtended by spirits that must be thanked or placated. It is also meant to reflect a modern, magic-realist attitude, with which the facts of the Arctic\u2014the harshness of traditional life, the exploitation of natural resources,  the depredations of global warming\u2014may be expressed in all their complexity. Arbugaeva\u2019s series \u201cKanin Nos\u201d is a portrait of a couple, Ivan and Evgenia, who are lighthouse keepers and meteorologists at a remote station on the Kanin Peninsula, between the White and Barents Seas. In one of Arbugaeva\u2019s images, the couple hardly register amid a snowy haze as they approach the lighthouse. (Evgenia avoids going outside alone, for fear of polar bears.) When Arbugaeva travelled to photograph Ivan and Evgenia, they asked her to bring some apples, and she photographed those, too. Wrapped in newspaper, to protect against the cold, they appear as treasures from a world left behind.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.",

With two dots for eyes and a slight hint of a smile, the 7,000-year-old figurine could be a ritual object, perhaps an amulet, or even a simple doll. The thumb-sized face is one of several dozen figures \u2014 mostly of goats and sheep \u2014 unearthed during an archaeological exploration lasting almost three years at En Esur in Israel  1, about 52 kilometres north of Tel Aviv.\n The excavation at En Esur, also known by its Arabic name of Ein Asawir, \u201cis an extraordinary project\u201d, says Dina Shalem, an archaeologist employed by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), who co-directed the dig with IAA archaeologists Yitzhak Paz and Itai Elad. By the Early Bronze Age, 5,000 years ago, Paz says that En Esur was a \u201cmega-city, the largest so far known in the Southern Levant\u201d, a region spanning modern Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan. Excavating En Esur was, he says, \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime experience\u201d.\n Built over the remains of an earlier, smaller village (from which the stone face was unearthed), the metropolis spanned an estimated 65 hectares and was home to between 5,000 and 6,000 people; more than 20 times the typical size of villages in that area at the time. Thanks to a year-round flowing spring, the townspeople of En Esur thrived, growing wheat, barley, lentils, grapes and olives, and raising cows, pigs, sheep and goats.\n A visit to the site in November 2019 during an excavation showed how enormous the place once was. Stretching into the distance were the remains of house foundations and alleyways. A grand, 600-square-metre temple enclosed two massive stone basins \u2014 the larger of which was 3.3 metres long and was filled with burnt animal bones, possibly from sacrifices. \u201cWe were really amazed at how densely built the city was,\u201d Shalem says, \u201cthe planning, the streets\u201d. A gigantic pile of approximately 5 million pottery shards, excavated from the site, attests to the domestic life of this bustling town. \u201cPottery, flint, figurines, burials \u2014 we can tell that it\u2019s a complex society,\u201d she says.\n There\u2019s a lot for the archaeologists and labourers to label and store for shipment. But they were not the only ones working at the site. Engineers were also taking measurements for Netivei Israel, the country\u2019s transport infrastructure company, which funded the archaeological excavation in preparation for the building of a road intersection on part of the site. This vanished world, briefly uncovered, disappeared again from view when it was covered with earth and cement over the winter.\n En Esur is a huge site, so most of it is still underground and untouched. But the massive temple and the other excavated parts will remain buried under the road intersection for decades \u2014 possibly longer. Critics charge that this important evidence will never be seen again.\n  This year, hundreds of other archaeological sites might also be buried or destroyed. That\u2019s because most excavations in the country are salvage digs, authorized by the IAA, the government body that oversees antiquities and archaeological sites within the state of Israel. Salvage digs are conducted to document archaeological remains in danger of destruction because of development plans. But the IAA very rarely blocks construction on top of an important archaeological site or takes steps to preserve some portion of the site from being destroyed, says Yonathan Mizrachi, chief executive of Emek Shaveh, an Israeli non-governmental organization based in Jerusalem that works to protect ancient sites as public assets.\n In 2019, salvage digs accounted for more than half of the 424 licences issued by the IAA for archaeological excavations and surveys, according to the agency. In almost all cases, after the archaeologists excavated the sites and removed valuable artefacts, construction projects were allowed to proceed, says Mizrachi.\n  Paving over archaeologically valuable sites isn\u2019t unique to Israel, Mizrachi says. In Turkey, for example, the 12,000-year-old town of Hasankeyf, a monumental site on the Tigris river, has slowly been submerged beneath the new Il\u0131su dam. But some archaeologists say that the situation is particularly problematic in Israel compared with many other countries. One big issue is that the majority of the IAA\u2019s budget comes from the salvage digs before construction projects \u2014 and the government itself is the biggest developer in Israel, says archaeologist Uzi Dahari, a former deputy director of the IAA. The country is also building rapidly to keep up with a surging population. Archaeologists also argue that the Israeli government favours saving ancient Jewish sites, especially in Jerusalem, over ones linked to other religions.\n In Israel, says Mizrachi, \u201cthere are no red lines, or any understanding or rules [for] what should be kept and should be destroyed\u201d.\n Gideon Avni, head of the archaeology division at the IAA, says that rather than block construction after a salvage dig, the IAA tries to prevent development projects in advance if a site is known to be important. The agency, he says, follows strict criteria established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization when deciding whether or not a site should be permanently saved, or covered and built on. He adds that \u201cevery act that we are doing is subject to public monitoring, professional monitoring, our internal system, which tries to prevent this conflict of interest.\u201d\n And some archaeologists in Israel say that many sites would not be excavated at all if it weren\u2019t for the construction projects that provide funding and an impetus for digs. Given Israel\u2019s fast-growing population, they say, the country can\u2019t preserve as many archaeological sites as supporters would like. \u201cI would like the whole country to be covered in archaeology,\u201d says Avni. \u201cBut my children need a place to live.\u201d\n   Compared with other countries around the Mediterranean, Israel has a much higher concentration of archaeological sites in a smaller area, Dahari says. There are about 35,000 sites in a country of 22,145 square kilometres.\n An average of 200\u2013300 archaeological sites are excavated each year as rescue or salvage digs before development. But in evaluating whether construction at the sites can go ahead, the IAA has a conflict of interest because it is heavily funded by the construction industry, says Dahari.\n In 2019, construction-funded salvage digs accounted for 83% of the IAA\u2019s budget of 426 million shekels (US$122.7 million). \u201cOn the one hand, their responsibility is to restore and to protect archaeological sites, but on the other hand, if you will tell the constructor, \u2018don\u2019t build, because this is an archaeological site\u2019, where will the money come from for the IAA? That\u2019s a big contradiction,\u201d Dahari says. \u201cI don\u2019t blame the Israel Antiquities Authority,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I blame the government, because of the budgetary system of salvage excavations.\u201d\n Yorke Rowan, an anthropological archaeologist at the University of Chicago, Illinois, agrees. \u201cThat is one contradictory aspect of the way the IAA works: a major bureaucracy depends on funding from the construction industry to fund itself.\u201d Rowan, who has studied stone bowls, mortars and grinders dating to 5000\u20133000   from previous digs at En Esur, says the difficulty is that the IAA is \u201cmandated to preserve and protect archaeological sites and heritage, but that funding is tied to positive outcomes for development projects\u201d.\n Adding to the pressure is Israel\u2019s rapidly growing population. The nation had a fertility rate of 3.1 children per woman in 2018, compared with 1.7 for the United States and an average of 1.6 in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to which Israel belongs (see \u2018Population boom\u2019). Israel\u2019s current population is more than 9 million; by 2065, according to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the population is predicted to swell to 20 million, which would make the country  one of the most densely populated on the planet.\n  The effects of this population boom are obvious across the country. New neighbourhoods crammed with high-rise apartment blocks are springing up on the outskirts of many towns; multi-lane highways criss-cross the country; gleaming malls and industrial zones mark the landscape. Between 2014 and 2017, according to HaMaarag, a consortium of environmental agencies based in Jerusalem, Israel lost 107 square kilometres of undeveloped land to construction and farming.\n With population growth driving so much construction, says Dahari, \u201cthe IAA cannot say, \u2018this is an archaeological site, don\u2019t build anything\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s impossible\u201d. He says the authority \u201cis not finding the middle way between the needs of development and the protection of the archaeological site\u201d. Dahari says that during his tenure at the IAA, the agency classified about 700 of the 35,000 sites in Israel as unique archaeological sites and therefore off-limits for development. But some of these 700 sites \u201care only partially protected\u201d, he says.\n  The list includes a site called Tel Beit Shemesh, which dates back at least to the seventh century  . The settlement was possibly a large-scale centre for olive-oil production  2. Archaeologists regard this site as important because it was located between two rival population centres more than two and a half millennia ago. It would take archaeologists decades to study this kind of site, but a four-lane highway will soon run through it. That is, says Dahari, \u201cin my point of view, a crime against archaeology\u201d. Avni acknowledges that the construction at Tel Beit Shemesh, \u201cwas a very, very painful compromise for us\u201d, balancing the need to preserve the site and building a highway that would serve up to 250,000 people. He said the current plan is to recreate the site in a park on a bridge over the highway.\n  Time is also running out for an ancient hill village called Nebi Zechariah that is at least 2,000 years old. The excavations of the village lie in an industrial zone on the outskirts of Modiin, a city about 26 kilometres northwest of Jerusalem. The excavated buildings have a forsaken air. The stone walls, doorways and mosaic-tiled floors are overgrown with brambles and weeds; a nearby billboard trumpeting a new industrial and logistics centre is pasted with a red sign saying \u201csales closed\u201d. In the distance, the high-rise blocks of the expanding city of Modiin can be glimpsed. By 2040, according to the city plan, the addition of 43,000 housing units will enable the population to more than double, from 93,000 to 240,000. And those plans call for construction in the city\u2019s industrial zone, including over Nebi Zechariah.\n  The ancient site was clearly once a bustling place. Originally founded as a Jewish village during the Roman period, beginning in 63  , it was occupied continuously for about 1,000 years by waves of polytheists, Byzantine Christians and Muslims, living together until it was abandoned in the eleventh century during a period of climate-change-induced drought. Its inhabitants built luxurious houses paved with mosaics, chiselled Christian crosses and Greek inscriptions into their olive presses, and produced glass weights inscribed with Arabic script for weighing coins.\n \u201cThere is a very interesting story in this type of site, because it consists of a kind of continuity of the rural population of ancient Palestine from Roman until Crusader times,\u201d says Avni. \u201cIt also shows a kind of living together of different communities in a settled place at the same time.\u201d\n But that does not mean the decision to build on it was wrong, according to Avni. He says that the settlement is just one out of 400 similar sites of the period in Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s not unique when you look at the whole country,\u201d he says. And population pressures inevitably lead to compromises that enable modern development. Even so, \u201cit\u2019s really a pity, when you look at it as a citizen, to destroy it\u201d, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful site, and could have been preserved as a park.\u201d\n That\u2019s unlikely to happen. Eyal Malul, a spokesperson for the municipality of Modiin, says part of the land is designated for building.\n  Nebi Zechariah and sites like it might have a better chance of being preserved if they dovetailed with Israel\u2019s national narrative, Mizrachi suggests. \u201cIn general, the Israeli government, for generations, is dealing with Jewish history,\u201d he says. As an example of the government\u2019s interest in preserving Jewish history through archaeology, Mizrachi and other researchers point to a site called the City of David, located in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. An organization called the Ir David Foundation (El-Ad) is authorized by the government to sponsor excavations there and run the City of David National Park. El-Ad claims that the biblical King David built a palace in the City of David 3,000 years ago and says it is \u201cdedicated to the preservation and development of the Biblical City of David\u201d.\n But there is serious disagreement among archaeologists as to whether the large structure that El-Ad identified as King David\u2019s palace was actually from the era in which the biblical king supposedly lived, and whether this ancient stone structure can be linked to him. \u201cEl-Ad\u2019s narrative is based on biblical history, not archaeology. They are content as long as archaeology doesn\u2019t contradict their reading,\u201d says Raphael Greenberg, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University. He argues that El-Ad is \u201csupported by the Israeli administration, that uses archaeology selectively to market its ideology\u201d.\n El-Ad rejects that argument. Doron Spielman, a spokesperson for the organization, says that there have been 20 excavations of the site over 150 years and they have found numerous carved inscriptions and clay stamps with the names of biblical figures. \u201cThere is no other place on Earth that has found more corroborative evidence of the biblical story than the City of David.\u201d\n When it comes to saving or excavating ruins, Avni says, \u201cwe have been accused many times of giving preference to Jewish sites or synagogues. When you look at the history of archaeology in this country, it\u2019s not baseless.\u201d But he says that those criticisms applied to the early years of the country\u2019s modern history, and that now, \u201cmost of the sites we are excavating are Byzantine Christian, early Muslim, medieval Muslim and Ottoman.\u201d Avni\u2019s own speciality is early Islamic archaeology.\n Yet some researchers say that when archaeological sites involve religions other than Judaism, they sometimes get less protection. And many Israelis aren\u2019t aware that people of different religions coexisted in the region after Islam arrived in the seventh century  , says Mizrachi. He adds that sites from the early Islamic period \u201care extremely important to be preserved and Nebi Zechariah is a very good example of that\u201d.\n  Without financing, however, the likelihood of preserving such sites is slim. Unlike the excavations funded by El-Ad, very few of the digs that the IAA conducts are financed independently. There would be no excavation at En Esur had a road junction not been planned there, and laboratory research on material collected at the site will continue for years, say the IAA archaeologists who work there. \u201cWhat we rescue is the knowledge, not necessarily the site,\u201d says Paz. He and the other IAA archaeologists who excavated En Esur declined to say whether the site itself should have been preserved.\n But others aren\u2019t so guarded. Greenberg, an expert on the Bronze Age in the Levant and a former IAA employee, questions the speed at which the salvage dig at En Esur was conducted, although he emphasizes that this is not the fault of the archaeologists but of the system that forces rapid excavations. \u201cBecause the site was excavated under severe time constraints, and because of the unprecedented quantity of finds that must be processed, it will be years before we have a detailed understanding of the results,\u201d he says.\n Less-destructive alternatives exist, Greenberg contends. For example, he suggests that 5% of the threatened site could have been set aside and excavated thoroughly, with the road project covering the rest of it.\n  Greenberg has general concerns about speedy salvage excavations. Academic excavations typically take many years. Researchers alternate time in the field with longer stretches in the lab to study findings and adjust their plans for later stages of the dig. That\u2019s not possible during a salvage operation, he says.\n The kind of alternative that Greenberg envisaged for En Esur is sometimes possible in other countries, such as the United States and France, even if excavations do get paved over there, too. Archaeologist Morag Kersel at DePaul University in Chicago, points to the Miami Circle in Florida, a round structure linked to the Native American Tequesta people that was scheduled to be destroyed, but was preserved after protests. Sometimes, she says, \u201cwhen it is feasible, projects are redesigned to avoid the destruction of the site\u201d.\n One difference in the United States, explains Rowan, is that \u201cthere is an extra level of oversight at the state level\u201d. Each US state has a State Historic Preservation Office that oversees surveys and excavations. If nothing important is found during a salvage survey, the office will approve the site for development, but it can mandate extra testing, including remote sensing and excavation, if significant evidence is found.\n \u201cSomething like En Esur, if it was in the United States, that would be stunning. There\u2019s not a chance you would pave it over,\u201d says Rowan. \u201cI have great faith that they did a good job, because I know the archaeologists. It does seem a shame to pave over a site like that.\u201d\n Archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji, former director of research at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Nanterre, calls En Esur \u201ca great discovery\u201d. In France, he says, \u201cit has happened many times that the line of a highway had to be changed because an important discovery was made\u201d.\n Even so, his approach is pragmatic: \u201cWe have to look for an equilibrium, for balance, between the necessity of modern life and the necessity of preserving the heritage.\u201d\n      1.

goal is to make our Camera the fastest way to share a moment. We do not want Snapchatters to face any delays when they are in the moment and want to share with their real friends.\n Network requests are on the critical path of using Snapchat. Compared to a UI update or disk write that takes milliseconds, network latency can take seconds with high error rate and device constraints. To reduce network latency and error, we make requests and responses smaller, reduce unnecessary sync, utilize global content distribution partners to bring media close to the people who use it, and use an efficient, next generation network protocol called Quick UDP Internet Connections, or   QUIC for short.\n   Let\u2019s first take a quick look at the network stack before QUIC. Take a Snap send as an example: on the application layer, we put the Snap media into the   HTTP2 request payload. Then we use   TLS to ensure the connection safety on the security layer and leverage   TCP to split the request into chunks and upload the Snap to the server. However the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 stack is suboptimal for the mobile network environment. For example, TCP requests will fail if a Snapchatter\u00a0switches between WiFi and WWAN. For a user chatting with friends, failure to send a message due to a connection drop can lead to a degraded experience.\n   QUIC is a transport protocol for the internet, developed by engineers at Google. QUIC is the foundation of   HTTP3 that replaces the TCP+TLS+HTTP2 and is built on top of UDP. QUIC solves a number of transport-layer and application-layer problems while requiring little or no change from application developers. As the above diagram depicts, QUIC does not alter the low-level operating system network protocols nor does it alter high-level HTTP.\n  Faster connection establishment: QUIC handshakes support   zero roundtrips before sending payload, compared to   1-3 round trips for TCP+TLS.\n Improved congestion control: QUIC has pluggable congestion control, and provides richer information to the congestion control algorithm than TCP. For example   QUIC BBR v1 and   QUIC BBR v2.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: For HTTP2 connections, when a TCP packet is lost, no streams on that connection can make forward progress until the packet is retransmitted and received by the far side. This leads to increased latency and a potentially degraded user experience on mobile network connections. QUIC eliminates this stalling for other streams multiplexed over the same connection.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: A TCP request will fail if the IP changes. However, QUIC connections are recognized by a QUIC protocol layer randomly generated 64 bit identifier, so a client using QUIC can continue in-flight requests, uninterrupted across a change in IP address, allowing for an undisturbed user experience.\n   Faster connection establishment: At Snapchat, before QUIC, p90 connection setup took up to 300ms. This connection setup latency translates to user waiting latency, and blocks the user from receiving Snaps and viewing Stories. Faster connection on QUIC directly reduces user waiting latency and improves the user experience.\n Improved congestion control: At Snap, the size of upload media can be as large as 10MB. A better congestion control algorithm improves throughput, reduces latency and error rate especially for large media.\n Multiplexing without head-of-line blocking: Snapchat has rich use cases with short content, including Snaps, Stories, Discover content, etc. Normally there are multiple download streams using the same connection. QUIC eliminates the HTTP2 head of blocking issues, such as avoiding the send message requests blocking spotlight requests.\n Connection migration across IP addresses: When with friends, failure to send a message due to a drop in their wifi connection can lead to a degraded experience. Connection migration solves this pain point.\n Detection of lost connection: A long loading spinner due to a lost connection is disturbing, especially when a Snapchatter is in full screen mode enjoying content. With QUIC, when requests fail due to a lost connection, we can detect and retry while providing a user-friendly UI.\n  Snapchat\u2019s client network stack is built on top of the open-source mobile network library   Cronet. Snap leverages Cronet not only for QUIC but also for improved observability through rich metrics and logs. We are able to build a cohesive view of client and server network performance.\n  We chose different protocols based on the network performance across countries and platforms. In general, we observed that enabling QUIC improved p90/P99 network latency by 6-20% and network errors by 3%-8%. There are even more improvements on the low network connectivity user cohort. Here we showcase three examples.\n In the first example, we enabled QUIC on our ads service in Oct 2019. We observed latency improvements across P90/P99 and error rate.\n   We observed error rate improvements across all error codes, including connection timeout, connection lost, request timeout. In further breakdowns of the latency improvements by country and region, we observed higher latency improvement for countries and regions with relatively worse network quality and further geo distance to our services.\n In the second example, on top of QUIC, enabling BBR congestion control on the client to server path also brought significant latency improvements. And there are more improvements with larger request payload.\n   In the last example, by enabling connection migration on Android, the network request success rate when losing a wifi connection increased by 20%.\n  With the success story on QUIC integration, moving forward, we will double down on QUIC, including:", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:45:58", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "quick,quic", "title": "quick.

The vast majority are unknown to science and researchers suggest understanding the novel interactions between bacteria and viruses in our microbiome could help develop future therapeutic treatments for disease.\n Over the last few years most  microbiome research has focused on how the bacteria living in our gut influence our health. But our microbiome consists of much more than bacteria. Unique populations of parasites, viruses and  fungi also live inside us.\n Last year a team of researchers published one of the first catalogs of gut viral populations, called the  Gut Virome Database. That study detailed more than 33,000 unique viral populations.\n Now an international team of researchers has created an even larger gut virome database, analyzing nearly 12,000 fecal samples from subjects spanning 24 countries. The research identified 54,118 unique viral species.\n \u201cRemarkably (but perhaps predictably), more than 90 percent of these viral species are new to science,\u201d write Philip Hugenholtz and Soo Jen Low, two University of Queensland (UQ) researchers working on the project. \u201cThey collectively encode more than 450,000 distinct proteins \u2013 a huge reservoir of functional potential that may either be beneficial or detrimental to their microbial, and in turn human, hosts.\u201d\n Around 75 percent of the viral DNA detected in the study can be linked to bacteriophages, a particular type of virus that only infect bacteria and are harmless to humans.\n In the first half of the 20th century bacteriophage therapy was seen as a promising way to fight bacterial infections, but the rise of effective antibiotics led to a wane in research. That was until antibiotic-resistant bacteria caused a resurgence of interest. Now researchers are investigating phage therapy as an option for everything from  diabetic foot ulcers to  obesity.\n A potential outcome from cataloging these novel gut bacteriophages could be a form of precision microbiome modification. In the future if there are certain populations of gut bacteria doctors need to reduce or amplify, releasing viruses known to target those specific bacterial species could be a treatment solution.\n \u201cThere has been discussion of potentially customizing people\u2019s gut microbiomes using dietary interventions, probiotics, prebiotics or even &#39;transpoosions&#39; (faecal microbiota transplants), to improve an individual\u2019s health,\u201d explain the UQ researchers. \u201cPhage therapy may be a useful addition to this objective, by adding species or even subspecies-level precision to microbiome manipulation. For example, the bacterial pathogen  Clostridioides difficile (or  C. diff for short) is a leading cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea that could be specifically targeted by phages.\u201d\n Of course, if we are only just starting to understand how gut bacteria influences our health then the study of gut viruses is positively embryonic. The researchers behind this new study indicate their findings most likely comprise just a fraction of the total diversity of viruses living inside us, with plenty more new species left to discover.", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:45:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u75c5\u6bd2,\u80a0\u9053,unknown,\u7ec6\u83cc", "title": "\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u80a0\u9053\u5fae\u751f\u7269\u7ec4\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc740K\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u75c5\u6bd2 ", "title_en": "Over 40k previously unknown viruses found in the human gut microbiome", "transed": 1, "url": "https://newatlas.com/science/virus-gut-virome-microbiome-unknown-species-discovered/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u75c5\u6bd2", "\u80a0\u9053", "unknown", "\u7ec6\u83cc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "204841039ab2b20050059d5d47396a44.jpg", "infoid": 1068179, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5927\u91cf\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bbe\u65bd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e1c\u5317\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u3002  \u62df\u8bae\u7684\u690d\u7269\u6bcf\u5e74\u5c06\u5220\u9664\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u4e07\u5428\u4e8c\u6c27\u5316\u78b3 - \u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea6\u4e3a40\u4e07\u68f5\u6811\u3002  \u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u6c14\u4f53\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u82cf\u683c\u5170\u6d77\u5cb8\u7684\u6d77\u5e95\u4e0a\u6c38\u4e45\u5730\u50a8\u5b58\u3002  \u8fd9\u9879\u76f4\u63a5\u822a\u7a7a\u6355\u83b7\uff08DAC\uff09\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u82f1\u56fd\u516c\u53f8\u697c\u540d\u548c\u52a0\u62ff\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u78b3\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u5408\u9879\u76ee\u3002  \u5b83\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "A large facility capable of extracting significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the air is being planned for north east Scotland.\n The proposed plant would remove up to one million tonnes of CO2 every year - the same amount taken up by around 40 million trees.\n The extracted gas could be stored permanently deep under the seabed off the Scottish coast.\n    This Direct Air Capture (DAC) plan is a joint project between UK firm  Storegga and Canadian company  Carbon Engineering.\n It&#39;s at a very early stage of development - today&#39;s announcement is the beginning of the engineering and design of the plant.\n  A feasibility study has already been carried out and if everything goes well, the facility would be operational by 2026.\n  However there are many hurdles, including planning and finance - and a site for the plant won&#39;t be selected until next year.\n If it does go ahead it would be the biggest DAC facility in Europe and depending on the final configuration, could be the biggest in the world.\n  According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), if the world wants to stay safe, then the rise in global temperatures needs to be kept below 1.5C by the end of this century.\n There&#39;s not much wiggle room left: in 2020  temperatures were already 1.2C above the historical level.\n  To keep the mercury down, we need to curb the emissions of the warming gases that are driving them up.\n  The IPCC says that rapid cuts in carbon from cars, home heating and almost every aspect of our lives will be needed over the next decade.\n Even then, say the scientists, the world will still need to suck significant amounts of greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere to stay below the 1.5C threshold.\n While planting trees is one important approach to this problem, technology is also being used to capture CO2 directly from the air.\n &#34;Even if all the other measures that we&#39;re taking to avoid emissions, electric cars, renewable energy, those types of things, even if those succeed, you still need carbon removal,&#34; said Steve Oldham, CEO of Carbon Engineering.\n &#34;Direct air capture I think is going to be a significant part of the UK is net zero plan.&#34;\n  &#34;For us a typical facility is about a million tonnes of CO2 removal per year. That&#39;s the equivalent of 40 million trees.&#34;\n   At their pilot plant in Squamish, British Columbia, they&#39;ve been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015, pulling down around 1 tonne of CO2 every day.\n Their system involves a fan to suck in air, which is then exposed to a liquid mixture that binds the carbon dioxide.\n   When these are treated at temperature of about 900C, the pellets decompose into a CO2 stream and calcium oxide.\n  At that point it can be pumped underground and buried permanently, sold for commercial use or even turned into liquid fuel.\n Right now the plan is for Carbon Engineering licence their technology to UK firm Storegga, who will be responsible for choosing the site and building the facility.\n  According to both companies involved, north east Scotland has significant advantages for this type of technology.\n  They point to the fact that there is abundant renewable energy sources, there&#39;s a skilled workforce from the North Sea oil industry that have the type of skills needed to build and operate a DAC facility.\n But a key advantage are pipelines going out under the sea to allow the permanent burial of the captured carbon.\n &#34;We&#39;re keen to locate the plant as close as possible to transport and storage infrastructure so we don&#39;t actually have to suffer more and more costs to move captured carbon offshore and then underground,&#34; said Alan James from Storegga.\n  Carbon Engineering has received significant investment from fossil fuel companies in the past and is working closely with one firm on the development of a DAC plant in Texas.\n Oil companies are keen on good quality CO2 because they can use it to flush out extra oil from depleted wells.\n  &#34;I came out of the oil industry in 2007, largely because I was getting concerned about what the impact was,&#34; he told BBC News.\n &#34;None of the emissions that we take out here will be used for extracting more hydrocarbons. That&#39;s not what our business now is about. We have nothing to do with producing hydrocarbons, period.&#34;\n  Scientists say that DAC, if deployed widely, will have major impacts on energy, water and land use.\n By 2050,  according to this report from last year, food crop prices could rise more than five-fold in some parts of the world.\n Some people are also worried that if direct air capture becomes economically viable, then governments might start to go easy on cutting emissions.\n  However, supporters of DAC say that&#39;s not the case - they argue that for sectors that are hard to cut, including shipping, aviation and the oil and gas industry, then DAC is a good option for limiting their impact on the climate.\n Researchers who&#39;ve studied these emerging technologies say it would be foolish to rely fully on them and neglect the basic steps of decarbonising power, transport and industry.\n &#34;It&#39;s a much more sensible strategy to treat these technologies as a really nice addition, we should work hard on them and make sure that they can become cost competitive, and economic in the 2020s,&#34; said Dr Ajay Gambhir, a senior research fellow at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.\n &#34;But at the same time, we need to just make sure we reduce emissions as fast as possible as far as possible.

 Boxabl\uff08@_boxabl\uff094\u670822\u65e5\uff0c2021 ", "note_en": "The world\u2019s richest people are known to live the most extravagant lives. Any one of us would probably do the same: work your way to a considerable fortune, and you\u2019d splurge on  luxury accommodation, luxury cars, luxury vacations, luxury everything. As far as Musk is concerned, billionaire or not, he can do very well without a couple of items on that list\u2014including luxury accommodation.    \rA while back, Musk caused a lot of buzz online by announcing plans to sell his entire real estate portfolio, which was predictably impressive. He went ahead with the plans, and, as far of the world knows, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is now homeless, more or less. According to one of his tweets from earlier this month, he now lives on SpaceX property in a house that\u2019s worth some $50,000.     \r\u201cMy primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It\u2019s kinda awesome though,\u201d Musk wrote.  \u201cOnly house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.\u201d     The fact that Musk doesn\u2019t even  own the cheap house he lives in when in Texas is just the icing on the cake. According to  Teslarati, that house is actually a prefabricated, towable tiny home called Boxabl Casita\u2014the cheapest model (and the only one available for preorder as of the moment of press).  Boxabl actually hinted at this back in November 2020, when they revealed they had delivered a unit to Boca Chica for a then-mysterious A-list client.    \rThe Casita is as adorable as the name suggests. It\u2019s a 20x20 foot ( 6x6 meter) home-made of concrete panels, steel and EPS foam that can be shipped or towed (even by  a Model X, as one of the tweets available at the bottom of the page shows) directly to the buyer. Setting it up takes between one hour and one day, depending on the setup the owner wants: the Casita can be made for off-grid living or hooked up to utilities. Also depending on this, the setup can imply a variety of additional costs.    \rStill, the Casita itself starts at $50,000 and is made to  \u201clast a lifetime.\u201d The walls, floor, and roof are structurally laminated panels rated higher for insulation and durability than everything else on the traditional home-building market. The Casita is hurricane and storm resistant, fire-resistant, flood-resistant, and 90% rated for snow. It\u2019s cheap to maintain and can be made even cheaper by means of solar panels, backup batteries, and  smart tech.    \rThe base model is perfect for a small family, being more of a studio apartment: it\u2019s basically a square space divided into four living areas. You have a master bedroom area, a kitchen area, a bathroom, and a living slash dining area. That said, it\u2019s well organized, quite good looking and airy due to the high ceiling. More importantly, it&#39;s well equipped: you have a large fridge, a washer-dryer unit, a dishwasher, a double sink, an ironing board, and an oven and microwave in the kitchen; the bathroom has a deep shower tub, and a sizable counter; you get heating and AC as part of the standard package.     The idea is for Boxabl to start offering larger models soon, variations on this tiny Casita, while also including this one as  a module for larger constructions. Boxabl believes that the housing industry needs to evolve and head into mass production to be more efficient and more affordable. The only way out of the housing crisis, the company CEO says in one of the videos below, is by offering units that are more durable, more affordable, and with shorter delivery dates.    \rClearly, the Boxabl Casita unit is awesome enough to have caught the eye of  Elon Musk. But Boxabl likes to dream of a future well beyond building on Earth: they recently unveiled a concept for a Mars unit, based on the idea that the Casita can also serve for medical or military use in disaster or conflict areas. Why not think ahead into the not-too-distant future in which  Musk leads humanity on a mission to colonize Mars?      My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It\u2019s kinda awesome though.   \rOnly house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day.\n\r\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk)  June 9, 2021\n      Eagerly awaiting the Cybertruck, need 12,000 pound tow capacity  @elonmusk. #tech  #startup  #housing  #construction  \rDisclaimer: Model X not rated to tow Casita.

The signed overflow UB exploitation is an attempt to work around this.\n    To be more precise: the #1 transform that compilers really want to get out of this is to replace int32\n  loop counters with int64 loop counters in 64-bit code whenever possible, because int32s are bad news\n                                                    That MOVSXD (marked *) is indicative of the issue: we&#39;re on a 64-bit machine trying to use a 32-bit index to\n  refer to an array, and because addresses are 64-bit (and we could absolutely have an array larger than 4GB but\n  with less than 2 billion entries), we need to sign-extend that index to 64-bit before we can do our addressing\n      That sign-extend is extra work in the inner loop that would not exist in the 32-bit version of this snippet.\n  It also causes other problems. For example, the 32-bit equivalent of the code above always accesses memory at\n        and ebx is what&#39;s called an &#34;induction variable&#34; - it changes by a constant value in every loop iteration\n  (incrementing by 1 in this case). A 32-bit compiler can realize this and replace it with pointer arithmetic\n  (incrementing esi by 4 every iter, say). &#34;esi&#34; and &#34;ebx&#34; are both 32-bit values subject to 32-bit wraparound,\n              with a sign extend in the middle (that &#34;sext32to64(ebx)&#34; is what the &#34;movsxd rbx, edx&#34; does). And in\n    dramatically, by (4 - 2^(32+2)). In 32-bit mode (all addresses modulo 2^32), this is just an increase by 4\n  as usual; the &#34;wraparound&#34; part is a multiple of 2^32 and hence invisible. In 64-bit mode, it isn&#39;t; if the\n            Option a) is relatively straightforward in this particular example, but it can get hairy, and my point is\n  that 32-bit compilers never need to worry about any of this to begin with (and neither do 64-bit compilers\n      And if the compiler *isn&#39;t* able to do these proofs, it can get pretty bad. For example, the loop above\n  is basically all loop overhead, and most compilers will end up unrolling (or vectorizing, but I&#39;ll\n  ignore that) it. Now we&#39;d prefer to see an inner loop like: (I won&#39;t show the setup or tail loop here):\n                      (only showing the adressing parts here, in practice there&#39;s other transforms we&#39;d like to see too, but\n      If the compiler can&#39;t (for whatever reason) prove that the index expressions are not going to overflow\n                                      This is a silly example, but all you need to do is look at some assembly listings for\n    &#34;movsxd&#34;; usually you&#39;ll be able to find actual addressing code that does stuff like this\n      Anyway, as said, compilers use the signed-overflow UB as a free ticket to promote int32\n            to int etc.) work pretty well when &#34;int&#34; is the width of machine registers and pretty\n  badly when it&#39;s not. Newer languages (e.g. Go and Rust) solve this problem by just making\n  &#34;int&#34; be 64-bit on 64-bit platforms, which removes most of the motivation for this kind\n          Eating the sign extends (and resulting extra work) on cold code is not *that* bad if\n  there&#39;s a way for the compiler to tell the programmer about the hot loops that really\n        often as much (or more) of a problem than the extra instructions. On x64, it is in\n          or similar. The top 32 bits of &#34;rbx&#34; will get zero-cleared the next time a 32-bit ALU\n  op writes to ebx, but that&#39;s fine. At least we didn&#39;t use an extra register.\n    e.g. show when overflows can&#39;t happen in a loop such as the example loop (in this\n  case: if we can prove &#34;count&#34; stays fixed throughout the loop, we only enter the loop\n  if &#34;0 &lt; count&#34;, and we only stay in the loop until &#34;i &gt;= count&#34;; with i increasing at\n  a rate of 1 per iteration, this is guaranteed to happen before i overflows). This is\n      programmer, and it can be really hard to understand what the compiler can or cannot\n  prove at any given point in time. So it&#39;s tricky. Better analysis catches more and\n      If in doubt, it&#39;s almost always preferable to have semantics defined in such a way\n                                    of many arithmetic operations, and your life sucks no matter what. You really want to\n      On most of the machines you&#39;re likely to use, &#34;size_t&#34; for loop counters is a good idea", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:02:08", "source_domain":

"An FBI agent applied for a federal warrant in 2018 to seize a fabled cache of U.S. government gold he said was \u201cstolen during the Civil War\u201d and hidden in a Pennsylvania cave, saying the state might take the gold for itself if the feds asked for permission, according to court documents unsealed Thursday.\n The newly unsealed affidavit  confirms previous reporting by The Associated Press  that the government had been looking for a legendary cache of gold at the site, which federal authorities had long refused to confirm. In any case, the FBI said, the dig came up empty.\n The AP and The Philadelphia Inquirer petitioned a federal judge to unseal the case. Federal prosecutors did not oppose the request, and the judge agreed, paving the way for Thursday\u2019s release of documents.\n  \u201cI have probable cause to believe that a significant cache of gold is secreted in the underground cave\u201d in Dent\u2019s Run, holding \u201cone or more tons\u201d belonging to the U.S. government, wrote Jacob Archer of the FBI\u2019s art crime team in Philadelphia.\n Archer told the judge he needed a seizure warrant because he feared that if the federal government sought permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to excavate the site, the state would claim the gold for itself, setting up a costly legal battle.\n \u201cI am concerned that, even if DCNR gave initial consent for the FBI to excavate the cache of gold secreted at the Dent\u2019s Run Site, that consent could be revoked before the FBI recovered the United States property, with the result of DCNR unlawfully claiming that that cache of gold is abandoned property and, thus, belongs to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\u201d the affidavit said.\n Archer also revealed allegations against a legislative staffer who, he wrote, tried to get some of the loot for himself.\n In 2013, the affidavit said, the legislative staffer contacted a pair of treasure hunters who had identified the likely site of the gold. The staffer \u201ccorruptly\u201d offered to get the treasure hunters a state permit to dig \u201cin return for three bars of gold or ten percent\u201d of whatever they recovered. The staffer said he was acting on behalf of others in state government, according to Archer, including \u201csomeone who controlled money going to DCNR and someone working in the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s office.\u201d\n No one has been charged in connection with the case, and federal prosecutors say they consider the matter closed. A spokesperson for the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources declined comment.\n  The FBI had long refused to explain exactly why it went digging on state-owned land in Elk County in March 2018, saying only in written statements over the years that agents were there for a court-authorized excavation of \u201cwhat evidence suggested may have been a cultural heritage site.\u201d\n According to the affidavit, the FBI based its request for a seizure warrant partly on the work done by the treasure hunters, who had made hundreds of trips to the area. The  father-son duo  told authorities they believed they had found the location of the fabled Union gold, which, according to legend, was either lost or stolen on its way to the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia in 1863.\n After meeting with the treasure hunters in early 2018, the FBI brought in a contractor with more sophisticated instruments. The contractor detected an underground mass that weighed up to nine tons and had the density of gold, the affidavit said.\n  Archer wrote that he also spoke with a journalist, identified as \u201cPerson 3,\u201d who had done extensive research on a Civil War-era group called the Knights of the Golden Circle. The KGC, Archer wrote, was a secret society of Confederate sympathizers that had purportedly \u201cburied secret caches of weapons, coins, and gold and silver bullion, much of which was stolen from robberies of banks, trains carrying payroll of the Union Army during the Civil War and from northern army military posts, in southern, western and northern states.\u201d\n Archer said that a turtle carving found on a rock near the proposed dig site was \u201cvery likely ... a KGC marker for that site.\u201d\n Archer wasn\u2019t able to confirm the U.S. Mint had actually missed any expected shipments of gold because the Mint did not have records for the Civil War period, the affidavit said.\n The FBI apparently did not indicate to the judge, in writing, what it found at the site, according to the documents unsealed Thursday. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Philadelphia said that no such document was filed with the court because the dig came up empty.\n Dennis and Kem Parada, co-owners of the treasure-hunting outfit Finders Keepers, have said they believe the FBI found gold at the site. They are seeking thousands of pages of FBI documents about the investigation as well as video files of the dig.\n  He noted the warrant granted by U.S. Magistrate Judge Richard Lloret gave FBI agents permission to dig from 6 a.m to 10 p.m. But residents have  told of hearing a backhoe and jackhammer overnight \u2014 when the excavation was supposed to have been paused \u2014 and seeing a convoy of FBI vehicles, including large armored trucks.\n In addition, it is telling that the FBI never checked back with the contractor whose sensitive instruments had indicated the possible presence of gold to ask what went wrong, said Warren Getler, the journalist identified as \u201cPerson 3\u201d in the affidavit.\n \u201cDid the science really go wrong? I am not so sure about that,\u201d said Getler, author of \u201cRebel Gold,\u201d a book exploring the possibility of buried Civil War-era caches of gold and silver.\n \u201cWhy did they send four or five armored cars after the fact?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy did they work under cover of darkness? Why did they kick us off the mountain at 3 p.m. that day when we were supposed to be working as partners?\u201d\n The FBI assertion of an empty hole is \u201cinsulting all the credible people who did this kind of work,\u201d Dennis Parada previously told the AP. \u201cIt was a slap in the face, really, to think all these people could make that kind of mistake.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-25 12:01:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53ef\u80fd,possibly,\u6316\u6398", "title": "FBI\u53ef\u80fd\u6316\u4e86400\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f20\u8bf4\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u6218\u65f6\u4ee3\u9ec4\u91d1 ", "title_en": "FBI Possibly Dug up $400M of fabled Civil War era gold", "transed": 1, "url": "https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-oddities-technology-lifestyle-government-and-politics-2c2d2a064fa7f8b3835648821ca3ecbc", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u80fd", "possibly", "\u6316\u6398"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2e57ee55fbf5658540cd2c4e40d84922.png", "infoid": 1068172, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60a8\u4e0d\u5fc5\u6210\u4e3a\u5fae\u8f6f\u5386\u53f2\u5b66\u5bb6\u6765\u770bping-pong\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\n  Windows XP  - \u547d\u4e2d\uff01 Windows Vista  -  FLOP\u3002 Windows 7  - \u70b9\u51fb\uff01 Windows 8  - \u7ffb\u8f6c\u3002 Windows 10  - \u70b9\u51fb\uff01\n  \u5982\u679c\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u64ad\u653e\u8d54\u7387\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u6253\u8d4cWindows 11\uff0c\u661f\u671f\u56db\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u7ffb\u8f6c\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u6240\u770b\u5230\u7684\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u7684Windows 11\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u806a\u660e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMicrosoft\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Satya Nadella\u5728\u72ec\u5bb6\u91c7\u8bbf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u73a9\u7b11\u8bf411\u662f\u5e78\u8fd0\u53f7\u7801\u3002\n  \u867d\u7136Windows 11\u63a5\u53e3\u5df2\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u66f4\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u6cb9\u6f06\u3002\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u5df2\u5c06\u542f\u52a8\u6309\u94ae\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5e95\u90e8\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u4e0d\u62c5\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u603b\u662f\u628a\u5b83\u653e\u56de\u5de6\u89d2\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u9898\u529f\u80fd\uff1aAndroid\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff01\n  \u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff08\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\uff09\u5c06\u5176Android\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u5e26\u5230\u65b0\u7684Microsoft Store\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14Windows 11 PC\u672c\u8eab\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u8fd0\u884c\u8be5\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u82af\u7247\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u90fd\u80fd\u3002\n  \u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\uff08\u5982\u679c\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u7387\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002 ", "note_en": "You don\u2019t have to be a Microsoft historian to see the ping-pong pattern:\n  Windows XP \u2014 Hit!\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWindows Vista \u2014 Flop.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWindows 7 \u2014 Hit!\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWindows 8 \u2014 Flop.\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\tWindows 10 \u2014 Hit!\n  If you were playing the odds, you\u2019d bet  Windows 11, announced Thursday, would flop.

Plus, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, in an exclusive interview, joked that 11 is a lucky number.\n  While the Windows 11 interface has been redesigned, it\u2019s more a fresh coat of paint than a complete remodel. Yes, Microsoft has moved the Start button to the bottom center, but, don\u2019t you worry, you can always put it back in the left corner. There are loads of new productivity features, too, and the headline feature: Android apps!\n  Amazon (yes, that Amazon) is bringing its Android app store to the new Microsoft Store, and Windows 11 PCs themselves will be able to run the software, regardless of the chip that powers them.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.
