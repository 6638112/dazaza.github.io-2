When he finally got the offer to become a recruiter for highly paid engineers, he says he jumped at the chance to help the social network push for greater employee diversity in its ranks.</p><p>Rhett Lindsey非常渴望在Facebook上工作，他在那里申请工作三次。当他终于获得了高薪工程师成为招聘人员的提议时，他说他有机会帮助社会网络推动其在其等级中的更大员工多样性。</p><p> Eight months later, in August 2020, Lindsey attended a virtual meeting to discuss the company’s goal of hiring more Black engineers. In the meeting, a White manager played a Drake song in the background whose chorus repeats the phrase “Where the [n-word]s be at?,&#34; five times, according to videos of the incident reviewed by The Washington Post.</p><p> 八个月后，2020年8月，Lindsey参加了一个虚拟会议，讨论了公司雇用更多黑色工程师的目标。在会议上，一个白色经理在背景中播放了德雷克歌曲，其合唱团重复了“[n-word]的短语？，＆＃34;根据华盛顿邮报审查的事件的视频的介绍，五次。</p><p> Lindsey asked in the chat system why they were playing the song, then said he was “really disappointed,” according to the video. Nine other employees who were present in the meeting echoed his frustrations by putting emoji expressing shock alongside his comment.</p><p> Lindsey在聊天系统中问了为什么他们正在玩这首歌，然后说他“真的很失望”，根据视频。在会议中出现的其他员工通过将表达休克与他的评论一起表达震惊来回应他的挫折。</p><p>   “It shows you the insensitivity and the lack of awareness,” Lindsey said. A manager subsequently apologized, according to the video.</p><p>   “它展示了你的不敏感性和缺乏意识，”Lindsey说。根据视频，经理随后道歉。</p><p> The country was in the midst of a historic reckoning over racial justice, and Facebook had just set an ambitious hiring goal of 30 percent more people of color in leadership by 2025.</p><p> 该国在一个历史悠久的历史上，在种族司法中估计，Facebook刚刚在2025年通过2025年在领导力的领导者中获得了30％的雄心勃勃的招聘目标。</p><p> But Lindsey and other current and former Black employees involved in hiring — as well as potential recruits who filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last summer — describe a problematic system that makes it difficult to achieve that and other diversity goals. They say the company has adapted metrics that prompt recruiters to go through the motions without actually delivering talent. Even the diverse candidates who are brought in can be rejected over vague terms such as “cultural fit.” They also say that the problem goes deeper than hiring and that many employees of color feel alienated by the social network’s culture.</p><p> 但是，Lindsey和其他当前和前任黑人员工参与招聘 - 以及去年夏天提交了与平等就业机会委员会的索赔的潜在新手 - 描述了一个有问题的系统，使得难以实现这一目标和其他多样性目标。他们说，该公司有改编的指标，促使招聘人员在没有实际提供人才的情况下通过运动。即使是被带入的多样化候选人也可以拒绝含糊不清的术语，如“文化契合”。他们还说问题比招聘更深，并且许多员工的颜色蕴含着社会网络的文化。</p><p>  Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said the company is focused on advancing racial justice in the workplace and in recruiting. “We’ve added diversity and inclusion goals to senior leaders’ performance reviews. We take seriously allegations of discrimination and have robust policies and processes in place for employees to report concerns, including concerns about microaggressions and policy violations,” he said. He did not address the incident  involving the Drake song.</p><p>  Facebook发言人Andy Stone表示，该公司专注于推进工作场所的种族正义和招聘。 “我们为高级领导人的绩效评估增加了多样性和包容目标。他说，我们认真对抗歧视指控，并为员工提供有关员工的强迫政策和流程，包括对微不足道和政策违规行为的担忧，“他说。他没有解决涉及德雷克歌的事件。 </p><p>   Lindsey quit the company in November, just 11 months after he started, and has since founded a start-up.</p><p>Lindsey于11月退出公司，在他开始后的11个月内，已经创立了一个初创公司。</p><p> Facebook is facing a federal investigation by the EEOC that launched last summer into allegations of bias in hiring, promotion and pay, according to the complaint. That case has since been expanded into a systemic probe by the EEOC, a special designation which means that the federal agency is examining whether company practices may be contributing to widespread discrimination and is assessing the potential to bring a broader lawsuit representing an entire class of workers, according to the lawyers representing the complainants.</p><p> 根据投诉，Facebook通过去年夏天推出的联邦调查，该联邦调查了去年夏季推出的指控，促进招聘和支付偏见。此案以来，该案件已被EEOC扩展到全身探针，这意味着联邦机构正在审查公司实践是否可能导致广泛歧视，并正在评估潜在的潜力，以带来一大类工人的更广泛的诉讼根据代表申诉人的律师。</p><p> The EEOC declined to comment. The agency can only speak publicly about charges if they result in a lawsuit against the employer.</p><p> EEOC拒绝发表评论。如果他们导致对雇主的诉讼，该机构只能公开发言。</p><p>  In the EEOC complaint, three Black job applicants say they met all the advertised job qualifications but were rejected after going through the interview process. They say they were told by Facebook interviewers that the company was looking for people who would fit in culturally. One candidate, whose lawyer requested The Washington Post withhold her name because parts of the complaint are not public, was told by a Facebook hiring manager, “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit,” but was not given any further explanation.</p><p>  在EEOC投诉中，三名黑人求职者表示，他们遇到了所有广告的工作资格，但在采访过程之后被拒绝。他们说他们被Facebook面试官告诉了公司正在寻找适合于文化的人。一名候选人，他的律师要求华盛顿邮政扣留她的名字，因为投诉的部分不公开，由Facebook招聘经理告诉，“毫无疑问，你可以做这份工作，但我们真的正在寻找一种文化健康， “但没有得到任何进一步的解释。</p><p>  Culture fit is an ill-defined term for whether a candidate is a good match for a company’s internal culture.</p><p>  文化适合是候选人是否对公司内部文化的良好匹配的裁定术语。</p><p> A Facebook operations manager who is identified in the complaint, Oscar Veneszee Jr., who is Black and still works at Facebook, said in an interview that he had submitted more than half a dozen qualified applicants who were underrepresented minorities for jobs at Facebook, but that all were rejected and he suspected it was because they failed the cultural fit test.</p><p> 在投诉中被确定的Facebook运营经理Oscar Veneszee Jr.在Facebook上仍然在Facebook上营造，他在接受面试中表示，他提交了超过一半的合格申请人，这些申请人在Facebook的少数少数群体中，但是这一切都被拒绝了，他怀疑是因为他们失败了文化契约测试。</p><p>  “When I was interviewing at Facebook, the thing I was told constantly was that I needed to be a culture fit, and when I tried to recruit people, I knew I needed find people who were a culture fit,” he said. “But unfortunately not many people I knew could pass that challenge because the culture here does not reflect the culture of Black people.”</p><p>  “当我在Facebook进行面试时，我不断讲述的是，我需要成为一种文化健康，当我试图招聘人时，我知道我需要找到一种文化健康的人，”他说。 “但不幸的是，我知道的那些人可能会通过这种挑战，因为这里的文化不反映黑人的文化。” </p><p>  Facebook’s Stone said the company’s recruiters do not assess cultural fit, but the company looks for whether skills and behaviors in the interview process, such as responses to questions about what a person might do in a particular scenario, align with Facebook’s values.</p><p>Facebook的Stone表示，该公司的招聘人员不评估文化契合，但公司寻找面试过程中的技能和行为，例如对某人在特定情景中可能做的问题的回答，与Facebook的价值保持一致。</p><p> “There is no culture fit check mark on an application form, but at Facebook it is like this invisible cloud that hangs over candidates of color,” said Lindsey. He added that at least a dozen qualified candidates of color that he referred for interviews were also rejected by Facebook, with culture fit was part of those decisions. “It really boils down to who do I feel comfortable hanging out with.”</p><p> “在申请表中没有文化契合校验标记，但在Facebook上它就像这个隐形的云挂在颜色候选人身上，”Lindsey说。他补充说，至少有十几个合格的颜色候选人，他提到了他提到的面试，也被Facebook拒绝，文化适合是这些决定的一部分。 “这真的归结为谁觉得舒服闲逛。”</p><p>  Racial issues at Facebook have been particularly acute over the last year because of the decision by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to give wide latitude to racially divisive comments by President Trump during last summers’ protests, and because of the company’s role in providing a platform for extremist groups that espouse white supremacist ideas. The decision to leave up Trump’s comment was of particular concern to workers of color, some of whom  met personally with senior leaders to protest the decision while others have left the company. Facebook software engineer  Ashok Chandwaney quit publicly in the fall, citing unease with the social media giant’s role in fueling hate.</p><p>  由于首席执行官马克扎克伯格的决定，Facebook在Facebook的种族问题尤其严重，因为CEO Mark Zuckerberg在最后夏季抗议活动中由总统特朗普总统划分的种族分歧评论，而且由于公司在为极端主义团体提供平台方面的作用那个支持白色至高无上的想法。留下特朗普评论的决定对颜色工人特别关注，其中一些人与高级领导人遭到抗议决定，而其他人则离开了公司。 Facebook软件工程师Ashok Chandwaney在秋季公开戒烟，引起了社会媒体巨头在促进仇恨方面的作用。</p><p>  Zuckerberg’s decision “created such lack of psychological safety on all kinds of levels, and Black employees in particular didn’t know how to truly process that,” said a former Black executive who cited the decision as one of her reasons for resigning.</p><p>  Zuckerberg的决定“在各种水平上创造了这种缺乏心理安全，特别是黑人员工尤其不知道如何真正处理，”一位前的黑人高管表示，该决定是她辞职的原因之一。</p><p>  Facebook is one of the several Silicon Valley companies, including Google and Microsoft, to announce ambitious diversity targets in the wake of the death of  George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed while in police custody. But years of annual tech companies’ diversity reports show only incremental progress on increasing the ratio of Black and Latino employees, and high attrition rates among Black women, supported by recent accounts of racial bias and inequities in pay and promotion from Black women at  Google,  Pinterest and  Amazon.</p><p>  Facebook是几家硅谷公司之一，包括谷歌和微软，在乔治·弗洛伊德的死亡之后宣布雄心勃勃的多样性目标，这是一个在警察拘留时杀死的非武装的黑人。但是，年度科技公司的多元化报告仅表明增加了增加黑人和拉丁裔员工比例的增量进展，以及最近对谷歌的黑人女性的种族偏见和促进的种族偏见和不平等的高磨损率， Pinterest和亚马逊。</p><p>  Google’s leadership is more than 95 percent White or Asian and 73 percent male, and Facebook’s is more than 87 percent White or Asian and 66 percent male, according to the companies’ 2020 diversity reports.</p><p>  据“公司的2020年的2020多个多样性报告”，谷歌的领导率超过95％的白色或亚洲人和73％的男性和73％的男性和66％的男性。</p><p>  The independent civil rights auditors Facebook hired to scrutinize its record last summer found attrition was of concern to employees of color and to civil rights advocates, and noted a “disconnect” between the experiences described by employees of color and the company’s myriad diversity and inclusion initiatives. In the report, which was made public by Facebook, auditors also called the company’s permissive stance on politicians’ speech a “ tremendous setback” for its civil rights progress, saying such decisions were made by members of senior leadership who lacked civil rights expertise.</p><p>  独立的民权审计员Facebook去年夏天发现审查其历史记录的消耗是关注的颜色员工和民权倡导者，并指出了员工员工的经验与公司的无数多样性和包容举措之间的“脱节” 。在该报告中，由Facebook公开，审计员还称该公司对政客们的私人立场对其民事权利进展的“巨大的挫折”，表示，缺乏公民权利专业知识的高级领导人的成员。 </p><p> The auditors noted that “civil rights leaders have characterized the current numbers for Hispanic and African American staff as abysmal across every category.“</p><p>审计师指出，“民权领导人的特征在于西班牙裔和非洲裔美国人员作为各种类别的easmal的目前的数字。”</p><p>  Facebook has pledged that 50 percent of its workforce will be made up of underrepresented people by 2024 — defined as underrepresented minorities and women — but its progress so far has been modest. Currently just over 85 percent of its workforce is White or Asian, and more than 90 percent of those in highly compensated technical roles are White or Asian, according to its annual diversity report. That is down from 91 percent of the overall workforce and 94 percent of the technical workforce in 2014, when the company first published its annual diversity report.</p><p>  Facebook已经承诺，其员工队伍的50％将由2024年由2024人组成 - 被定义为少数群体和妇女不足 - 但其进展到目前为止已经适度。目前刚刚超过85％的劳动力是白色或亚洲的，超过90％以上的高度补偿技术角色是白色或亚洲的，根据其年度多样性报告。这是2014年整体劳动力的91％的91％，当公司首次发表了其年度多样性报告时，占技术劳动力的94％。</p><p>   Women make up 37 percent of all roles, up from 31 percent in 2014. And they now fill 24 percent of technical roles, up from 15 percent in 2014.</p><p>   妇女占所有角色的37％，从2014年的31％起，他们现在填补了24％的技术角色，2014年的15％。</p><p> Many tech workers and civil rights advocates say progress on diversity often is thwarted by invisible biases and outright discrimination that permeate Silicon Valley culture, leading to fewer hires, unwelcoming environments and high attrition among workers of color.</p><p> 许多技术人员和民权倡导者表示，在渗透硅谷文化的无形偏见和彻底的歧视中，普遍存在的偏见和彻底的歧视，导致惠顾，不受欢迎的环境和颜色工人的高消耗措施，突然挫败了多样性。</p><p> Ifeoma Ozoma, a former public policy official at Facebook, said that when she was asked to interview job candidates at the social media giant, the process was superficial and numbers-driven. In one instance, she alleged, a Facebook recruiter told her there were already sufficient numbers of women in the running for a particular role, implying there was no need to find additional applicants from underrepresented groups.</p><p> Facebook的前公共政策官员的IFEMAO ozoma表示，当她被要求在社交媒体巨头采访候选人时，该过程是肤浅的，数字驱动。在一个例子中，她所称，一个Facebook招聘人员告诉她，在竞选中有足够数量的女性在竞赛中为特定的角色，暗示没有必要从不足的群体中找到额外的申请人。</p><p>   Ozoma added that none of the recruiting measures matter if retention isn’t a focus, “because even the best managers are not always able to protect their hires from toxic work environments.”</p><p>   ozoma补充说，如果保留不是焦点，那么招聘措施都没有招聘措施，因为即使最好的经理人并不总是能够保护他们的雇用免受毒性的工作环境。“</p><p>  When Lindsey started sourcing candidates for Facebook, he said he and other recruiters used a custom-built software dashboard called FBR, or Facebook Recruiting platform, where recruiters recorded their outreach to candidates and created profiles of them. Their manager had weekly meetings with them to gauge their progress.</p><p>  当Lindsey开始为Facebook采购候选人时，他和其他招聘人员使用了一个名为FBR的自定义软件仪表板，或Facebook招聘平台，招聘人员将其外展记录为候选人并创建了他们的概要文件。他们的经理每周都会与他们会面，以衡量他们的进展。 </p><p> If recruiters didn’t hit targets of making contact or starting the recruiting process with a specific number of people of each race and gender each week, they were told specifically that executives, namely Zuckerberg, were unhappy with them, Lindsey said. Managers would then enforce 30- to 90-day “lockdowns,” a long-standing companywide practice where employees are told to drop all other responsibilities to make progress on a single metric, such as a requirement to increase the number of Latino candidates a recruiter pinged on LinkedIn. Sometimes the recruiters were able to hit the targets, but it’s not clear how well it worked, he said.</p><p>Lindsey说，如果招聘人员没有用每个种族和性别的特定人民与每个种族和性别的人民开始接触或开始招聘流程的目标，那么他们被告知了高管，即Zuckerberg对他们不满意。经理将执行30至90天的“锁定”，这是一项长期的公司，员工被告知员工，以降低所有其他责任，以便在单一度量上取得进展，例如增加拉丁裔候选人的人数候选人在linkedin上ping。他说，有时招聘人员能够击中目标，但并不清楚它的工作程度。</p><p> Managers primarily instructed recruiters to infer the race and gender of candidates by scouring the Internet, particularly Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, he said.</p><p> 他说，管理人员主要指示招聘人员通过侦查互联网，特别是Instagram，Twitter和Facebook来推断候选人的种族和性别，他说。</p><p> They then formalized those guesses and inputted them into a system that any person who interviewed the candidate could  see, according to Lindsey and to a screenshot of the system viewed by The Post. The screenshot showed nine affirmative action, or AA, categories with a bubble next to them for check marks, that are part of a candidate’s profile for a job at Facebook. Seven of the categories were race-based, including Black and Hispanic, and there were two other categories for women and veterans. He said the system was still being used when he left.</p><p> 然后，根据Lindsey和由帖子观看的系统的屏幕，他们将这些猜测正式化并将其投入到任何采访候选人的人可以看到的人。屏幕截图显示了九个肯定行动，或AA类，其中包含泡沫的泡沫，用于复选标记，这是候选人在Facebook上工作的概况的一部分。七个类别是基于比赛的，包括黑人和西班牙裔，以及其他两类妇女和退伍军人。他说，当他离开时，系统仍在使用。</p><p> The pressure sometimes led the recruiters to make problematic assumptions, Lindsey said, based on his conversations with other employees, discussions at their team meetings and his own experience.</p><p> Lindsey基于与其他员工的谈话，讨论他们的团队会议和自己的经验，有时导致招聘人员产生问题的假设。</p><p>  Tech recruiters say it’s a common, if unspoken, practice in Silicon Valley to guess the race and gender of applicants. It’s a less-than-ideal outcome of companies trying to reduce the risk of violating civil rights laws, which effectively prevent employers from requiring candidates to disclose their race outright.</p><p>  技术招聘人员表示，如果毫无说服，硅谷的实践是一个常见的，猜测申请人的种族和性别。这是努力减少违反民权法律风险的公司不太理想的结果，这有效地阻止雇主要求候选人直接披露他们的种族。</p><p> Another former Black Facebook recruiter, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed that FBR contained race tags when he worked there in 2018. He said in his department, which was different than Lindsey’s, both team leaders and other recruiters told him not to use them. He was told they were being phased out because that type of guesswork was frowned upon. His team also no longer used “culture fit” as hiring criteria, he said.</p><p> 另一个以前的黑色Facebook招聘人员要求匿名，因为他没有被授权公开发言，确认FBR在2018年在那里工作时载有赛车标签。他在他的部门说，这与Lindsey的部门不同，这是团队领导者和其他招聘人员都不同。他不使用它们。他被告知他们正在逐步淘汰，因为这种猜测是皱起眉头的。他说，他的团队也不再使用“文化适合”作为招聘标准。</p><p> Julie Levinson Werner, a partner at the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, said that because  both state and federal law prohibit making hiring decisions because of a protected characteristic, companies avoid asking to try to mitigate their risk of a lawsuit.</p><p> Lawenstein Sandler的合伙人Julie Levinson Werner表示，由于州和联邦法律禁止由于受保护的特征而招聘决策，公司避免要求试图减轻其诉讼的风险。 </p><p> But many recruiters don’t put those guesses in writing or, if they risk doing so, might note the guesswork in code, such as emoji, in their applicant-tracking software, said diversity expert Nicole Sanchez, founder and CEO of Vaya Consulting. She advises clients against this kind of guesswork.</p><p>但是，许多招聘人员不会以书面形式提出这些猜测，或者如果他们这样做，可能会记录申请人跟踪软件中的代码，例如emoji的猜测，如vaya咨询的创始人兼首席执行官。她建议客户反对这种猜测。</p><p> Lindsey’s description of that practice within Facebook was troubling, Sanchez said, because it took that guesswork to another level by  potentially  exposing it to everyone involved in the hiring process.</p><p> 桑切斯说，Lindsey在Facebook内锻炼的描述是令人不安的，因为它通过将其猜测到另一个级别，可能会将其暴露给参与招聘流程的每个人。</p><p> Stone said the company does not instruct recruiters to visually inspect the race of prospective candidates and instead asks them to use objective criteria, such as membership in a professional society for a certain ethnicity or whether a person went to a historically black school.</p><p> 石头表示，该公司并没有指示招聘人员在视觉上检查潜在候选人的比赛，而是要求他们使用客观标准，例如专业社会的成员，以某种种族或者一个人是否参加历史上的黑人学校。</p><p>  According to Lindsey, the pressure resulted in some cases in recruiters feeling the need to duplicate candidate profiles — manipulating the profile slightly so the same candidate would count twice, or tagging White people as people of color — in the tracking system to inflate their numbers. He said he never did so.</p><p>  根据Lindsey的说法，压力导致招聘人员的某些情况感到需要重复候选人的概况 - 稍微操纵个人资料，所以同一候选人将数量计数两次，或将白人标记为颜色的人 - 在跟踪系统中膨胀。他说他从未这样做过。</p><p>  That system then fed into an interview and selection process that was itself not inclusive, Lindsey said. The educational backgrounds of candidates of color, who more frequently came from less prestigious universities, coding boot camps or  HBCUs, were often dubbed less of a “cultural fit” in HR meetings than other candidates, Lindsey said.</p><p>  Lindsey说，那种系统进入了一个面试和选择过程，本身并不包容。 Lindsey说，更频繁地来自更加着名的大学，编码营地或HBCUS的颜色候选人的教育背景往往被称为人力资源会议的“文化契合”，而不是其他候选人。</p><p> Lindsey says his time at Facebook led him to co-found his start-up, Siimee, focused on helping job candidates connect with recruiters on an app that focuses on prioritizing inclusivity and mitigating bias. It lets people create profiles where they can openly discuss their identities and ambitions and show those to potential employers.</p><p> Lindsey说他在Facebook的时间带领他共同发现他的初创公司，赛特赛，专注于帮助工作候选人与招聘人员联系在一个专注于优先考虑包含含量和减轻偏见的应用程序。它让人们创建个人资料，在那里他们可以公开讨论其身份和野心，并向那些展示潜在雇主。</p><p> He says a lot of people are surprised that he left such a prestigious company.</p><p> 他说，很多人都感到惊讶，他离开了这样一个着名的公司。 </p><p> “It was a hard year. The work from home, the racial justice protests. I worked for a platform where there was a lot of hate and disconnect, and as a Black man, I felt I was always under a microscope,” he said. “Just because you’re in this place everyone thinks is great and have stability, you don’t have to stay somewhere that is problematic in your eyes.”</p><p>“这是一个艰难的一年。 从家里的工作，种族正义抗议。 我为一个有很多仇恨和脱节的平台工作，作为一个黑人，我觉得我总是在显微镜下，“他说。 “只是因为你在这个地方每个人都认为是伟大的并且有稳定，你不必留在你眼中有问题的地方。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/facebook-discrimination-hiring-bias/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/facebook-discrimination-hiring-bias/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facebook/">#facebook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/招聘/">#招聘</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
