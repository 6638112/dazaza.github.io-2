I would amend that to read “Hungarian education isn’t  systemically magic”. As far as I know, there’s only one Hungarian educator with magic powers, and (like all good wizards) his secrets are maddeningly hard to find.</p><p>有人将我以前的帖子总结为“匈牙利的教育不是魔术”。我将其修改为“匈牙利的教育并不是系统性的魔术”。据我所知，只有一位具有魔力的匈牙利教育者，而且（就像所有好的巫师一样）他的秘密很难被发现。</p><p> Laszlo Polgar studied intelligence in university, and decided he had discovered the basic principles behind raising any child to be a genius. He wrote a book called  Bring Up Genius and recruited an interested woman to marry him so they could test his philosophy by raising children together. He said a bunch of stuff on how ‘natural talent’ was meaningless and so any child could become a prodigy with the right upbringing.</p><p> 拉斯洛·波尔加（Laszlo Polgar）在大学学习情报，并决定他已经发现养育任何孩子成为天才的基本原理。他写了一本名为《培养天才》的书，并招募了一个有兴趣的女人嫁给他，这样他们就可以通过共同抚养孩子来检验他的哲学。他说了一堆关于“天才”如何毫无意义的东西，因此任何一个孩子只要有正确的养育就可以成为神童。</p><p> This is normally the point where I’d start making fun of him. Except that when he trained his three daughters in chess, they became the 1st, 2nd, and 6th best female chess players in the world, gaining honors like “youngest grandmaster ever” and “greatest female chess player of all time”. Also they spoke seven languages, including Esperanto.</p><p> 通常这是我开始嘲笑他的时候。除了他训练自己的三个女儿下象棋外，他们分别成为世界上最佳女象棋手的第一，第二和第六名，获得了“有史以来最年轻的大师”和“有史以来最伟大的女象棋手”的荣誉。他们还说七种语言，包括世界语。</p><p> Their immense success suggests that education can have a major effect even on such traditional genius-requiring domains as chess ability. How can we reconcile that with the rest of our picture of the world, and how obsessed should we be with getting a copy of Laszlo Polgar’s book?</p><p> 他们的巨大成功表明，即使对于象棋能力这样的传统天才领域，教育也可能产生重大影响。我们如何才能将其与我们对世界的其余部分相协调，以及我们应该如何着迷于获得拉斯洛·波加尔（Laszlo Polgar）的书？</p><p>  Let’s get this out of the way first: the Polgar sisters were probably genetically really smart. The whole family was Hungarian Jews, a group with a great track record. Their mother and father were both well-educated teachers interested in stuff like developmental psychology. They had every possible biological advantage and I’m sure that helped.</p><p>  首先让我们解决这个问题：波尔加姐妹在基因上可能真的很聪明。整个家庭都是匈牙利犹太人，有着良好的记录。他们的父亲和母亲都是受过良好教育的老师，对诸如发展心理学之类的东西感兴趣。他们具有一切可能的生物学优势，我相信这会有所帮助。</p><p> J Levitt  proposes an equation to estimate a chess player’s IQ from their chess score. It suggests that chess grandmasters probably have IQs above 160. Plugging the Polgar sisters’ chess scores into his equation, I get IQs in the range of 150, 160, and 170 for the three sisters.</p><p> 莱维特（J Levitt）提出了一个方程，根据他们的象棋得分来估算其智商。这表明国际象棋大师的智商可能高于160。将波尔加姐妹的国际象棋得分计入他的等式后，我得出三个姐妹的智商分别为150、160和170。</p><p> This is biologically impossible. Even if both Polgar parents were 170-IQ themselves, regression to the mean predicts that their children would have IQs around 140 to 150. It’s mathematically possible for there to be an IQ that predicts you would have three children of 150, 160, and 170, but I doubt any living people have it, and even if they did there’s no way they would marry somebody else equally gifted.</p><p> 从生物学上讲这是不可能的。即使两个Polgar父母的本人都是170-IQ，对均值的回归也可以预测他们的孩子的智商在140到150之间。从数学上讲，有一个IQ可以预测您的孩子有150、160和170的三个智商。 ，但我怀疑任何有生命的人都会拥有它，即使他们做到了，他们也无法嫁给同样有天赋的人。</p><p> [EDIT: Thanks to a few people who pointed out some problems with my math here ( 1,  2,  3). I still think that having three supergenius-IQ kids when you and your spouse show no signs of being a supergenius yourself (Laszlo Polgar’s daughters could beat him at chess by the time they were 8) is pretty unlikely, but I admit not impossible. I still think arguing about this is unnecessary thanks to the points below.]</p><p>[编辑：感谢少数人在这里指出我的数学问题（1、2、3）。我仍然认为，当您和您的配偶没有任何迹象表明自己是超级天才的时候（Laszlo Polgar的女儿在8岁时就可以在国际象棋上击败他）是不可能的，但是我承认这并非不可能。由于以下几点，我仍然认为不必为此争论。]</p><p> On the other hand, I’m not sure Levitt’s right. Chess champion Gary Kasparov actually sat and  took an IQ test for the magazine  Der Spiegel, and his IQ was 135. That’s not bad – it’s top 1% of the population – but it’s not amazing either.</p><p> 另一方面，我不确定Levitt是正确的。国际象棋冠军加里·卡斯帕罗夫（Gary Kasparov）实际上坐着并为杂志《明镜》（Der Spiegel）进行了智商测试，他的智商为135。这还不错，它是该国人口的前1％，但这也并不令人惊讶。</p><p> This is what we should expect given  the correlation of about r = 0.24 between IQ and chess ability (see also  this analysis, although I disagree with the details). And the contrary claims – like  the one that Bobby Fischer’s IQ was in the 180s – are less well-sourced (although Fischer was  the son of a Hungarian-Jewish mathematician, so who knows?).</p><p> 考虑到智商和国际象棋能力之间的相关性约为r = 0.24，这就是我们应该期望的结果（另请参见此分析，尽管我不同意细节）。而相反的说法（如鲍比·费舍尔（Bobby Fischer）的智商在180年代的说法）则来之不易（尽管费舍尔是匈牙利犹太数学家的儿子，所以谁知道？）。</p><p> If it were possible to be a chess world champion with an IQ of 135, then maybe it’s possible to be a “mere” grandmaster with IQs in the high 120s and low 130s. And it’s just barely plausible that some sufficiently smart people might have three kids who all have IQs in the high 120s and low 130s.</p><p> 如果有可能成为智商为135的国际象棋世界冠军，那么也许有可能成为智商在120s和130s低之间的“纯粹”大师。而且，有些足够聪明的人可能会生三个孩子，他们的智商分别在120和130低之间，这几乎是不合理的。</p><p> But this just passes the buck on the mystery. 2% of people have IQs in the high 120s or low 130s, but 2% of people aren’t the top-ranked female chess player in the world. The Polgar sisters’ IQs might have been a  permissive factor in allowing them to excel, but it didn’t  necessitate it. So what’s going on there?</p><p> 但是，这仅仅是个谜。 2％的人的智商处于120或130的低点，但是2％的人并不是世界上排名最高的女棋手。波尔加姐妹的智商可能是允许他们脱颖而出的一个许可因素，但这并不是必须的。那到底是怎么回事？</p><p>  “Practice” seems like an obvious part of the picture. Malcolm Gladwell uses the Polgars as poster children for his famous  ‘10,000 hours of practice makes you an expert at anything’ rule. The Polgars had 50,000 hours of chess practice each by the time they were adults, presumably enough to make them quintuple-experts.</p><p>  “实践”似乎很明显。马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（Malcolm Gladwell）使用波尔加斯（Polgars）作为招贴画的孩子，因为他著名的“ 10,000个小时的练习使您成为任何领域的专家”。到了成年时，波尔加人每人都有50,000小时的国际象棋练习时间，大概足以使他们成为五重专家。</p><p> Robert Howard has a paper  Does High-Level Performance Depend On Practice Alone? Debunking The Polgar Sisters Case in which he argues against the strong version of Gladwell’s thesis. He points out that there are many chess masters who have practiced much less than the Polgar sisters but are better than they are. He also points out that even though the sisters themselves have all practiced similar amounts, youngest sister Judit is clearly better than the other two in a way that practice alone cannot explain.</p><p> 罗伯特·霍华德（Robert Howard）有一篇论文，高水平的表现是否取决于实践？揭穿“波尔加姐妹案”的论点，他在其中反对强壮的格拉德威尔论文的观点。他指出，许多国际象棋大师的练习程度远低于波尔加姐妹，但比他们高得多。他还指出，即使姐妹本人都练习过类似的量，但最小的妹妹朱迪特显然比其他两个姐妹更好，这是仅凭练习无法解释的。</p><p> I don’t know if the case he’s arguing against – that practice is literally everything and it’s impossible for anything else to factor in – is a straw man or not. But it seems more important to consider a less silly argument – that practice is one of many factors, and that enough of it can make up for a lack of the others. This seems potentially true.  This study showing that amount of practice only explains 12% of the variance in skill level at various tasks, and is often summarized as “practice doesn’t matter much”. But it finds practice matters more (25% of the variance) in unchanging games with clear fixed rules, and uses chess as an example.</p><p>我不知道他所争论的情况（实际上就是一切，而其他任何因素都不可能）是不是一个稻草人。但是，考虑一个不那么愚蠢的论点似乎更为重要，因为实践是众多因素之一，而其中足够的因素可以弥补其他因素的不足。这似乎是对的。这项研究表明，练习量只能解释各种任务技能水平差异的12％，通常被总结为“练习没什么大不了”。但它发现在具有明确固定规则的不变游戏中，练习的重要性更大（方差的25％），并以国际象棋为例。</p><p> So suppose that the Polgar sisters are genetically smart, but maybe not as high up there as some other chess masters. We would expect them to need much more practice to achieve a level of proficiency similar to those chess masters, and indeed that seems like what happens.</p><p> 因此，假设波尔加姐妹在遗传上很聪明，但也许不如其他国际象棋大师那么高。我们希望他们需要更多的练习才能达到与那些国际象棋大师相似的水平，确实如此。</p><p> (all of this is confounded by them being women and almost all the other equally-good chess masters being men. It’s unclear if the Polgars deserve extra points for overcoming whatever factor usually keeps women out of the highest levels of chess.)</p><p> （所有这些都因他们是女性而使其他所有同样出色的国际象棋大师都感到困惑。目前尚不清楚波尔加人是否值得克服其他因素而获得额外的积分，因为这些因素通常会使女性脱离国际象棋的最高水准。）</p><p> But I’m actually still not sure this suffices as an explanation. According to Wikipedia:</p><p> 但实际上，我仍然不确定这是否足以作为解释。根据维基百科：</p><p> Polgár began teaching his eldest daughter, Susan, to play chess when she was four years old. Six months later, Susan toddled into Budapest’s smoke-filled chess club,” which was crowded with elderly men, and proceeded to beat the veteran players.</p><p> 波尔加（Polgár）四岁时开始教长女苏珊（Susan）下棋。六个月后，苏珊（Susan）步入了布达佩斯满是烟熏味的象棋俱乐部，里面挤满了年老的男人，然后殴打了这位资深球员。</p><p> The study linked above suggests that Susan practiced 48 hours a week. During those six months, she would have accumulated about 1200 hours of practice. Suppose the elderly Budapest chess players practiced only one hour a week, but had been doing so for the last twenty-five years. They would have more practice than Susan – plus the advantage of having older, more developed brains. So why did she beat them so easily?</p><p> 上面链接的研究表明，苏珊每周练习48小时。在这六个月中，她将积累大约1200个小时的练习时间。假设布达佩斯的老棋手每周只练习一小时，但在过去的25年中一直如此。他们将比Susan拥有更多的实践能力-加上拥有更老，更发达的大脑的优势。那她为什么这么轻易打败他们呢？</p><p> Maybe there’s a time-decay factor for practice? That is, maybe Susan had been practicing intensively, so she got a lot of chances to link it all together as she was learning, and also it was fresh in her mind when she went to the club to go play? I’m not sure. If some of those veterans had been playing more than one hour a week (and surely the sort of people who frequent Budapest chess clubs do) then her advantage seems too implausible to be due to freshness-of-material alone.</p><p> 也许会有一个时间衰减因素进行练习？那就是说，苏珊也许一直在练习，所以她在学习的过程中有很多机会将它们联系在一起，当她去俱乐部参加比赛时，她的内心又是新鲜的吗？我不确定。如果其中一些退伍军人每周玩一个小时以上（肯定是经常去布达佩斯象棋俱乐部的那种人），那​​么她的优势似乎太令人难以置信，不能仅仅因为新鲜感而已。</p><p>   First, Susan could have benefitted from some form of malleability. A lot of people claim there’s a “developmental window” during which children have a unique ability to learn language.  If cats see only vertical stripes for the first few weeks of their lives, they never learn to see in horizontal. Maybe if you teach your kid high-level chess at age 4, they’ll be able to recruit systems that adults could never manage, or reorganize the fundamental structure of their brain to conform to chess better, or something like that.</p><p>首先，苏珊本可以从某种形式的延展性中受益。许多人声称有一个“发展窗口”，孩子在此期间具有独特的学习语言的能力。如果猫在其生命的前几周只看到垂直条纹，则它们永远不会学会水平观看。也许，如果您在4岁时教孩子高级象棋，他们将能够招募成年人无法管理的系统，或者重组他们的大脑基本结构以更好地适应象棋或类似的东西。</p><p> Second, Polgar might actually have some really good educational methods besides just “start early and have a lot of practice”. I assume this is true, but I’m having a lot of trouble finding them. Shockingly, Polgar’s book  Bring Up Genius is out of print and totally unavailable anywhere – I guess the book-reading community heard that someone wrote down a way to reliably turn any child into a genius which had a great real-world track record of success, and collectively decided “Nah, better read  Fifty Shades Of Grey instead”. I’m not sure at what point I should start positing a conspiracy of suppression, or whether that would be better or worse than the alternative.</p><p> 其次，除了“早点开始并有很多练习”之外，波尔加实际上可能还有一些非常好的教育方法。我认为这是对的，但是在查找它们时遇到了很多麻烦。令人震惊的是，波尔加尔的著作《培养天才》已经绝版，并且在任何地方都完全不可用–我想读书社区听说有人写下了一种可靠地将任何孩子变成天才的方法，该天才在现实世界中拥有良好的成功记录，并共同决定“不，最好改读《五十度阴影》”。我不确定应该在什么时候开始实施共谋压制，或者这会比替代方案好还是坏。</p><p> The book seems to possibly be available in Hungarian under the title  Nevelj zsenit!, but I can’t tell for sure and a lot of the Hungarian sites suggest it’s out of print even in that language. There  may have been a recent republication in Esperanto called  Eduku geniulon!, but I can’t find that one either. If anybody knows where to find this book and wants to send it to me, I will figure out some way to translate it and review it. I’d also be willing to pay for costs and even pay extra for your time if it helps. Come on, Esperanto-speakers! This is the only chance you’ll ever have to be useful!</p><p> 该书似乎可以在匈牙利以Nevelj zsenit！的名称获得，但是我不能肯定地说，而且许多匈牙利网站都建议即使该语言也已绝版。最近在世界语中可能有一个名为Eduku geniulon！的共和国，但我也找不到。如果有人知道在哪里可以找到这本书并将其发送给我，我将想出一种翻译和审阅它的方法。如果有帮助，我也愿意为此付出费用，甚至愿意为您的时间付出更多。来吧，世界语发言人！这是您永远有用的唯一机会！</p><p>  One thing I know without reading the book: Polgar says that his method should work to create geniuses in any field, not just chess. He said he chose chess kind of on the whim of his eldest daughter. From Wikipedia:</p><p>  我不读这本书就知道的一件事：波尔加说，他的方法应该可以在任何领域创造天才，而不仅仅是国际象棋。他说他是在长女的心血来潮下选择象棋的。从维基百科：</p><p> Polgár and his wife considered various possible subjects in which to drill their children, “including mathematics and foreign languages,” but they settled on chess. “We could do the same thing with any subject, if you start early, spend lots of time and give great love to that one subject,” Klara later explained. “But we chose chess. Chess is very objective and easy to measure.” Susan described chess as having been her own choice: “Yes, he could have put us in any field, but it was I who chose chess as a four-year-old…. I liked the chessmen; they were toys for me.”</p><p> 波尔加尔和他的妻子考虑了各种可能的科目，例如“数学和外语”，以教孩子们，但他们还是选择了国际象棋。 “我们可以对任何一个学科做同样的事情，如果您早一点开始，花很多时间并热爱那个学科，”克拉拉后来解释说。 “但是我们选择了国际象棋。国际象棋非常客观，易于衡量。”苏珊形容国际象棋是她自己的选择：“是的，他本可以把我们放在任何领域，但正是我选择国际象棋才四岁……。我喜欢西洋棋棋子；他们是我的玩具。”</p><p> It’s disappointing that he decided to stick with chess for his other two daughters. The study linked above suggests that chess is unusually amenable to practice. What would have happened if he’d tried to train his kids in art? In mathematics? In entrepreneurship? I’m not sure, and I’m really tempted to have some kids and find out.</p><p> 令人失望的是，他决定为其他两个女儿坚持下象棋。上面链接的研究表明，国际象棋非常适合练习。如果他尝试对孩子进行艺术培训，会发生什么？在数学上？在创业？我不确定，我真的很想生一些孩子来寻找答案。</p><p> (be right back, going to change my OKCupid profile to include “must be interested in n=1 developmental-psych experiments, have access to a rare book library, and speak either Hungarian or Esperanto”)</p><p> （马上回来，将我的OKCupid个人资料更改为包括“必须对n = 1个发展心理实验感兴趣，可以使用稀有的图书库，并且可以说匈牙利语或世界语”）</p><p> I mentioned this plan to a friend, who protested that this was cruel and tantamount to child abuse. After all, how can you force someone to spend their entire childhood indoors, studying mind-numbing chess problems day in and day out, instead of enjoying themselves like normal kids?</p><p>我向一位朋友提到了这个计划，他抗议这是残酷的，无异于虐待儿童。毕竟，您怎么能强迫某人在整个室内度过整个童年，日复一日地研究麻木的国际象棋问题，而不是像普通孩子那样自娱自乐？</p><p> First of all, this isn’t how the Polgar children (or adults) describe their experiment. From   The Guardian:</p><p> 首先，这不是波尔加孩子（或成年人）描述他们的实验的方式。从卫报：</p><p> Starting with his eldest daughter, Susan, Polgár was careful to treat it as a playful activity, turning it into a fantasy of dramatic wins and losses. Whereas Earl and Kultida Woods had coerced perfection from Tiger, the Polgárs encouraged enjoyment, By the time Susan had turned five, she was excited by playing and spent hundreds of hours practising. She was entered into a local competition and treated it as fun, winning 10-0, causing a sensation.</p><p> 从他的长女苏珊开始，波尔加尔小心翼翼地将其视为一种好玩的活动，将其变成了一场奇妙的得失的幻想。伯爵（Earl）和库迪达·伍兹（Kultida Woods）曾迫使老虎完美无缺，而波加尔人则乐在其中，而苏珊（Susan）快五岁时，她就因为打球而兴奋，并花了数百个小时练习。她参加了一场当地比赛，并把它当作娱乐，赢得了10-0的轰动。</p><p> Meanwhile, her younger sisters were intrigued and László allowed them to feel the pieces, seeing them as toys, with no formal tuition until they were five. Interviewed recently, all three girls described playing the game as something that they loved doing – it never felt like a chore. Instead of messing about playing Monopoly, netball or going to the local swimming pool, chess was just what the Polgár family enjoyed…Polgár understood that coercion was less valuable than small children’s need to enjoy fantasy play. Consequently, his daughters all seem to have grown into satiable, well-balanced people rather than success addicts.</p><p> 同时，她的妹妹们很感兴趣，拉兹洛（László）允许他们去感受这些碎片，将它们视为玩具，直到五岁之前都没有正式的学费。最近接受采访时，所有三个女孩都将玩游戏描述为他们喜欢做的事情–从来没有感觉像是一件琐事。象国际象棋一样，波加尔一家人不喜欢玩大富翁，无挡板篮球或去当地的游泳池，而只是国际象棋而已。波加尔了解到，强迫力的价值不及小孩子享受幻想游戏的价值。因此，他的女儿们似乎都已经成长为可满足的，均衡的人，而不是成瘾者。</p><p> But more important – I responded that the Polgars claim to have spent about 48 hours a week practicing chess. I spent seven hours a day in school, so if my teachers assigned two hours of homework a night then we spent about the same amount of time getting educated. Except what the  Polgars got out of it was world-champion-level mastery of their favorite subject in the world, nationwide fame, and (by their own accounts) loving every second of it, and what  I got was staring out a window all day as my teacher declared that we were going to make a collage about the meaning of Respect.</p><p> 但更重要的是–我回应说，波尔加人声称每周花费约48个小时练习国际象棋。我一天在学校里花了七个小时，所以如果我的老师每晚分配两个小时的功课，那么我们花的时间差不多是相同的。除了波尔加斯从中获得的成就之外，还获得了世界冠军级别的精通，他们掌握了世界上最喜欢的主题，享誉全国，并且（根据他们自己的说法）爱着它的每一秒钟，而我所得到的却是整日凝视着窗外正如我的老师宣布的那样，我们将对尊重的含义进行拼贴。</p><p> The Polgar sisters talk about how they loved their education, had a great childhood, thought their parents were always patient with them and never strict and harsh, and don’t regret anything. How many kids who went to public school can say the same?</p><p> 波尔加姐妹谈论他们如何热爱自己的教育，童年的美好时光，以为父母总是对他们忍耐，从不严厉苛刻，也不后悔。有多少孩子上公立学校可以说相同的话？</p><p> An article about Laszlo Polgar mentions that he had to fight the Hungarian authorities to be allowed to home school his children. Imagine being so certain of your own home-schooling techniques that you’re afraid taking your kids to  the Fasori Gymnasium is going to stunt their intellectual growth. And imagine being  right. And imagine my friend thinking that normal American public school might be better than that. It sort of boggles the imagination.</p><p> 关于拉斯洛·波尔加（Laszlo Polgar）的一篇文章提到，他必须与匈牙利当局作斗争才能被允许回家给他的孩子上学。想象一下，对自己的家庭学校学习技巧是如此确定，以至于您害怕带孩子去Fasori体育馆会阻碍他们的智力成长。并想象是正确的。想象一下我的朋友认为普通的美国公立学校可能比这更好。这有点使想象力迷住了。</p><p> And I guess I shouldn’t be too harsh, because the public school system tries to do the best it can with an impossible set of constraints. But I’m still suspicious.  Who else has the motivation to hide that book?</p><p>而且我想我不应该太苛刻，因为公立学校系统会在不可能的限制条件下尽力做到最好。但是我仍然很怀疑。还有谁愿意隐藏那本书？</p><p> [EDIT: Thanks to readers, I’ve got an Esperanto copy and a person willing to translate it.
