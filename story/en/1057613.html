Despite being represented by attorneys in Washington and partially backed by a not-for-profit group, the American Association of University Women, she finds herself putting in grueling hours preparing for her upcoming trial this year. She spends her nights, after her two kids are asleep, discovering documents and preparing for processes such as her recent deposition in March. The fight has affected her children’s lives almost as much as her own, she says.</p><p>  从那以后，Glasson说，赢得赢得她的案件已经成为一个近乎全职的工作，一个人在一家与全球律师军队的公司加入了一家。尽管由华盛顿的律师代表并部分受利润集团的非营利组织，但美国大学女性协会，她发现今年为即将审判的审判筹备了艰苦的时间。她花了她的夜晚，在她的两个孩子睡着了，发现文件并准备在3月份的最近沉积等流程。她说，战斗影响了她的孩子的生活，几乎和她一样。</p><p>  “Even if they don’t know what is going on exactly, they know mommy is not all there – they know that I am not always present for them,” she said of her children, who are two and four years old. “It is heartbreaking to see how this impacts not just the person who is targeted by pregnancy discrimination, but the entire family.”</p><p>  “即使他们不知道完全发生了什么，他们就知道妈妈并不是那里 - 他们知道我并不总是为他们呈现，”她说她的孩子，谁是两到四岁。 “看到这种影响不仅仅是怀孕歧视，而是整个家庭的影响是令人心碎的。”</p><p> Glasson’s case first gained publicity after she published a widely shared internal note, titled I’m Not Returning to Google After Maternity Leave, and Here is Why, which was eventually leaked to the public.</p><p> Glasson的案件首先在出版了广泛共享的内部票据后首先获得了宣传，以产假后的我没有回到谷歌，这就是为什么最终泄露给公众。</p><p> Chelsey then hired an attorney and, in response, Google investigated a small portion of her claims, but said it found no examples of policy violation. Glasson then filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in September 2019. After little movement on an EEOC investigation, she filed a lawsuit in July 2020. While many companies quickly move to resolve lawsuits, Google continues to aggressively deny Chelsey’s claims.</p><p> 然后，Chelsey聘请了一名律师，以答复，谷歌调查了她的一小部分索赔，但表示没有发现政策违规的例子。然后将Glasson于2019年9月向平等就业机会委员会（EEOC）提出了申诉。在EEOC调查方面的一点运动后，她于2020年7月提出了诉讼。虽然许多公司迅速搬迁诉讼，但谷歌继续积极拒绝Chelsey的索赔。 </p><p> Glasson says her situation underscores just how much a worker stands to lose when they go toe-to-toe with one of the world’s largest tech companies.</p><p>Glasson说她的情况强调了当他们与世界上最大的科技公司之一举办的工作人员会失去多少工作人员。</p><p> “What’s very clear is that Google does not take action regarding discrimination,” said Glasson. “This is in large part because it is a massive organization with huge resources at its disposal to fight someone like me – it’s not at all a fair fight.”</p><p> “有什么清楚的是，谷歌并没有采取关于歧视的行动，”Glasson说。 “这在很大程度上，因为它是一个大量的组织，可以使用巨大的资源来打击像我这样的人 - 这不是一场公平的战斗。”</p><p> ‘Pregnancy discrimination does not get more blatant than that’: where the allegations began</p><p> '怀孕歧视并没有比这更简单更明显：指控的开始</p><p> Glasson’s struggle began in early 2018, after she says she overheard a director at Google criticizing a pregnant employee, and learned that the employee was being given negative feedback in her performance review after disclosing the pregnancy.</p><p> 在谷歌批评怀孕员工的威胁委员会批评的董事之后，Glareson的斗争开始于2018年初，并了解到员工在披露怀孕后被员工在她的绩效审查中获得负面反馈。</p><p> In keeping with Google’s reporting guidelines, Glasson filed a complaint with human resources alleging pregnancy discrimination against her colleague. Shortly after, she says, the director began to retaliate against her over the report, interviewing other people to replace Glasson in her role. Glasson said HR acknowledged the retaliation but refused to stop it. She asked at the company how to face her boss when the ongoing investigation was making their relationship tense and was told multiple times to find a therapist.</p><p> 在与谷歌的报告准则保持一致中，Glasson向涉嫌对她的同事歧视的人力资源提起了投诉。她说，董事不久之后，董事开始在报告中对她进行报复，采访其他人取代玻璃的角色。 Glasson表示，HR承认报复但拒绝停止它。当正在进行的调查使其关系紧张并被告知多次寻找治疗师时，她询问了如何面对她的老板。</p><p> “When you are a victim and you are told to go to counseling, it is incredibly offensive – it’s sending a message that you’re crazy and you’re making all this up,” she said.</p><p> “当你是一个受害者而你被告知要去咨询时，它是非常令人反感的 - 它正在发送一条消息，你疯了，你已经取决了，”她说。</p><p> Several months later, Glasson then became pregnant herself and says she decided to transfer teams to escape the ongoing retaliation and harassment. But she found her new superior made negative comments about her pregnancy-related health issues, and denied her the management role she was hired into.</p><p> 几个月后，Glasson然后怀孕了自己，并说她决定转移团队以逃避正在进行的报复和骚扰。但她发现她对其怀孕相关的健康问题的新卓越的负面评论，并否认了她被雇用的管理角色。 </p><p> When you are a victim and you are told to go to counseling, it is incredibly offensive – it’s sending a message that you’re crazy and you’re making all this up</p><p>当你是受害者而你被告知要去咨询时，它是非常令人反感的 - 它正在发送一条你疯狂的信息，你已经取出了这一切</p><p>  Glasson says that five months before her maternity leave was scheduled, her new boss told her that she would not be given any management responsibilities while she was pregnant because of concerns that her upcoming maternity leave would “stress the team” and “rock the boat”.</p><p>  Glasson说，在她的产假5个月之前，她的新老板告诉她，因为她怀孕的，她不会因为担心她即将到来的产假而“强调球队”和“摇滚船”而被赋予任何管理职责。 。</p><p> “Pregnancy discrimination does not get more blatant than that, and yet here they were telling me it is not happening,” she said.</p><p> “怀孕歧视并没有比这更明显，但在这里他们告诉我它没有发生，”她说。</p><p> Glasson also says her doctor eventually ordered her to take bed rest but that her manager encouraged her to keep working. During the investigation and ongoing fallout with her manager, Glasson was prescribed Lexapro, an antidepressant, to manage stress and was diagnosed by her obstetrician with “acute stress”.</p><p> Glareson也称她的医生最终让她休息休息，但她的经理鼓励她继续工作。在调查和持续的后果与她的经理，GlassOn被规定的Lexapro，一种抗抑郁药，管理压力并被她的产科医生诊断为“急性胁迫”。</p><p> On 7 January 2019 Glasson had to go to the hospital for a life-threatening pregnancy-related medical issue, which she believes was exacerbated by the stress, and remained there until she gave birth to her daughter on 8 March 2019 . Days later, Google asked her to leave the company in exchange for three months of her base salary.</p><p> 2019年1月7日，Glasson不得不去医院寻求危及生命的妊娠相关的医学问题，她认为这是压力加剧，直到她在2019年3月8日生下女儿之前留下了那里。几天后，谷歌要求她离开公司以换取3个月的基础薪水。</p><p> “It was a very small amount,” she said of the payout. “Especially to be asked to leave the company with no health insurance, as I came out of the hospital with a newborn in hand, having come out of months in the hospital and healing from an emergency c-section.”</p><p> “这是一个非常少量的数量，”她说的支付。 “特别要被要求将公司留下没有健康保险，因为我用新生儿出来的医院，在医院几个月后，从紧急情况下愈合。”</p><p> In August 2019, Glasson received a one-paragraph email in response to her complaint, filed more than a year prior, saying that it had not found evidence of pregnancy discrimination. “Thank you for raising your concerns,” the email said. This response prompted her to file the lawsuit.</p><p> 2019年8月，GlassOn收到了一段电子邮件，以回应她的投诉，提交了一年多的时间，称它没有发现怀孕歧视的证据。 “谢谢你提高你的担忧，”电子邮件说。这个回应提示她提起诉讼。 </p><p> In response to a request for comment about Glasson’s claims, Google said it does not comment on ongoing cases but that it takes these allegations seriously.</p><p>为了回应关于Glasson索赔的评论请求，谷歌表示，它对持续的案件表示不发表评论，但它会认真对待这些指控。</p><p> “Reporting misconduct takes courage and we want to provide care and support to people who raise concerns,” a Google spokesperson said. “All instances of inappropriate conduct reported to us are investigated rigorously, and we have simplified how employees can raise concerns and provided more transparency into the investigations process at Google. We work to be extremely transparent about how we handle complaints and the action we take.”</p><p> 谷歌发言人表示，“报告不当行为需要勇气，我们希望为提出关注的人提供关心和支持。” “所有向我们报告的不恰当行为的实例都经过严格调查，我们简化了员工如何提高顾虑，并在谷歌调查过程中提供更多透明度。我们努力对我们如何处理投诉以及我们采取的行动来极为透明。“</p><p> Veena Dubal, a labor law professor at UC Hastings who teaches a course in pregnancy discrimination, said it is exceedingly rare for a company like Google to take an employee to court over an issue like this. “It almost seems they are trying to make an example over her,” she said, before highlighting that men  accused of wrongdoing at Google have received much better treatment than Glasson.</p><p> veena dubal是教授怀孕歧视课程的劳动法教授，表示，对于像谷歌这样的公司来说，这是一个像这样的职位向法院担任法庭的公司非常罕见。 “几乎看起来他们正试图向她举起一个例子，”她说，在强调谷歌被指控的男人被指控的人受到比Glasson的更好的治疗感到更好的治疗。</p><p> “When you look at the way men accused of sexual harassment were treated versus the way a woman alleging pregnancy discrimination was treated, it is such a despicable example of the role of misogyny and patriarchy in these tech companies.”</p><p> “当你看着所指控的男人被指控的人对治疗的女人被治疗，这是一个卑鄙的例子，即麻醉师和父权制在这些科技公司中的作用。”</p><p>  In the time since Glasson first filed her complaint, the attention paid to poor labor conditions in the tech industry – from white-collar developer jobs, to gig economy temps, and warehouse workers – has only grown.</p><p>  自格朗首先提起投诉以来，科技行业劳动力差的关注 - 从白领开发商工作，到演出经济临时，仓库工人 - 刚刚成长。</p><p> In early April 2021, the National Labor Relations Board found that two Amazon employees were  unfairly fired in retaliation for internally criticizing discriminatory practices.</p><p> 4月2021年初，国家劳工关系委员会发现，两名亚马逊员工因内部批评歧视性做法而受到不公平地解雇。</p><p> In December 2020, Pinterest reached a $22m settlement with a female former executive over  pay discrimination. Before that, two former employees, Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks,  came forward with allegations that they were retaliated against for advocating for fair pay.</p><p> 2020年12月，Pinterest达到了2200万美元的成绩，女性前执行额超过了薪酬歧视。在此之前，两名前雇员，IFEMA ozoma和Aercizu银行，提出了他们被报复的指控，以倡导公平薪酬。 </p><p>  Even in the midst of her own case, Glasson participated in  global walkouts over Google’s handling of sexual misconduct and other equity issues in the workplace. In December 2020, more than 1,200 Google employees signed a letter  condemning the company for allegedly firing an ethics researcher in retaliation for her criticism of Google’s diversity programs.</p><p>即使在她自己的案例中，Glares也参加了Google在工作场所的性行为不当行为和其他股权问题的过程中的全球罢工。 2020年12月，超过1,200名谷歌员工签署了一封信，涉嫌抵消伦理研究人员，以报复她对谷歌的多样化计划的批评。</p><p> “I couldn’t help but wonder at the time, ‘It’s easy to show up for something like this, but what would my co-workers actually do if they learned of what was happening to me?’” she said. “As I later learned, most would do little to nothing.”</p><p> “当时我忍不住奇怪，”这很容易出现这样的东西，但如果他们了解到对我发生的事情，我的同事会这样做什么？“”她说。 “因为我后来学到了，大多数人都不会做得几乎没有。”</p><p> Still, Glasson said countless Googlers have reached out to her in the years since her case was  first publicized in the online memo. The case is now scheduled to go to court in December.</p><p> 尽管如此，Glasson仍然表示，由于她的案件在在线备忘录中首次宣传，因此多年来无数陀螺陀螺。案件现在计划于12月去法庭。</p><p> “A lot of them tell me ‘I wish I had the courage to fight like you’,” she said. “It is heartbreaking, because they often have a lot of shame, and there is nothing to be ashamed about. It is such a difficult path to take, to fight this, and it is not right for every individual.</p><p> “很多人告诉我”我希望我有勇气像你一样战斗“，”她说。 “这是令人心碎的，因为他们经常有很多耻辱，并且没有什么可以羞愧的。这是一种艰难的途径，要抗击这一条艰难的途径，这对每个人都不是正确的。</p><p> “It really takes a huge toll,” she added. “I would not wish this on anyone.”</p><p> “这真的需要一个巨大的收费，”她补充道。 “我不希望任何人。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/09/she-sued-for-pregnancy-discrimination-now-shes-battling-googles-army-of-lawyers">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/09/she-sued-for-pregnancy-discrimination-now-shes-battling-googles-army-of-lawyers</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/怀孕/">#怀孕</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/pregnancy/">#pregnancy</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
