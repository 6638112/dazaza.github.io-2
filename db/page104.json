The same is true even when people using these chemicals urinate them into the sewage system. Once there, these compounds\u2014from  prozac to  cocaine\u2014can end up in the bodies of aquatic creatures. And, research suggests, the chemicals can impact them:  birth control, for instance, affects frog breeding after it enters the water.\n We metabolize many of the drugs we take, and water treatment plants remove some of rest. But some concentration can still remain as the water is released to the surrounding lakes and streams.\n So far, there&#39;s not been much research into how, if at all, other drugs like cocaine and  various opioids, affect aquatic life\u2014but scientists say negative effects are not wholly impossible. And there is now some evidence that at least some classification of drugs do cause trouble.  New research suggests that a common antidepressant, citalopram, can change the behavior of crayfish, making them bolder than they would be otherwise.\n The data come from A.J. Reisinger\u2014assistant professor in the Soil and Water Sciences Department at the University of Florida\u2014and his team, which travelled to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 2017. The facility has several artificial streams that mimic natural conditions but allow researchers to control different aspects of the environment. Reisinger&#39;s team went out into the field and collected rocks, bugs, leaves, and crayfish and put them into the artificial streams.\n Crayfish were chosen because they can reach high biomasses in aquatic ecosystems and will &#34;eat anything they can get their claws on. They&#39;ll eat bugs, they&#39;ll eat algae, they&#39;ll eat leaves, they&#39;ll eat juvenile fish, even,&#34; Reisinger told Ars.\n     The researchers brought their subjects to the Cary Institute and began their experiment after setting up each stream as close to reality as possible using the rocks and other material from the crayfish&#39;s normal environment. They set up a quarter of the streams to have neither citalopram\u2014a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant\u2014nor crayfish as a control. In a second quarter of the streams, they added crayfish but no citalopram. In a third quarter, they had only the SSRI\u2014in concentrations that have been found in nature\u2014and in the fourth, they added both.\n From there, the researchers let the experiment run for two weeks before removing individual crayfish and putting them in new tanks. These tanks had mazes in the middle, and Reisinger&#39;s team initially introduced the crayfish to them via a small shelter at one end. At the opposite side of the maze, the team placed either a substance that smelled like food (sardine gelatin, in this case) or another crayfish. The researchers wanted see how their subjects would react.\n The crayfish that were exposed to citalopram left their shelters faster, and they spent more time moving toward the food, compared to their peers who didn&#39;t get the SSRI. They didn&#39;t show any more interest in moving toward the other crayfish, however.\n &#34;That tells us they&#39;re more bold. They&#39;re more likely to leave their shelter in their real environment,&#34; Reisinger said.\n That boldness could potentially have a broader impact on the environment. The team found that the streams containing crayfish saw an increase an algal biomass and organic matter. However, this wasn&#39;t dependent on the crustaceans being exposed to the antidepressant.\n According to Reisinger, the bolder crayfish that had been exposed to citalopram might have had a different effect on the streams if the researchers had run the experiments for longer than two weeks. There were likely lags between the addition of the drug and the crayfish&#39;s altered behavior as well as between that and the crayfish having a different impact on their environment. &#34;We think that, if we had run the study for a little bit longer, we might have seen a difference,&#34; he said.\n     Alex Ford, a professor of biology at Portsmouth University in the UK, ran one of the earliest studies on the effects on prozac, another antidepressant, on shrimp. Much like Reisinger&#39;s work, Ford&#39;s suggested that the drug made them more reckless and active. Since then, his team has looked into a  slew of other substances in aquatic organisms, including other SSRIs and benzodiazepines.\n Ars asked Ford if it&#39;s possible for shrimp and other aquatic species to become intoxicated (or otherwise have their behaviors changed) as a result of recreational or medicinal psychoactive substances reaching the waterways. He said, &#34;Theoretically, yes. Not just with cocaine, but with the whole suite of drugs out there\u2014the illegal ones.&#34;\n Ford noted that, in the past, he and various colleagues studied if low amounts of cocaine would affect shrimp behavior, but it did not appear to. However, they simply looked at swimming speed among shrimp, and it&#39;s possible that other behaviors would&#39;ve changed. The concentration of the drugs\u2014which usually appears in water in low but continuous levels\u2014is also a factor.\n Hypothetically, say there&#39;s a small village that used a lot of fentanyl, an incredibly potent opioid. This hypothetical village also doesn&#39;t have the best water treatment plant, and the river into which wastewater flows is tiny. Under these conditions there could, theoretically, be an effect.\n Last month, Ford and around 30 international authors penned  a report suggesting that regulating bodies should consider potential changes to behavior in aquatic organisms before greenlighting a new chemical. Currently, they are tested for their effects on growth and reproduction. &#34;When we assess the impact of chemicals on the environment, we need to consider behavior, because at the moment, most chemicals only go through quite simple tests before they go on the market,&#34;

Rocky Linux 8.4 is binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, making it possible to run apps designed and tested only for RHEL without RHEL itself.   One of the questions we&#39;ve gotten repeatedly since first covering CentOS Linux&#39;s deprecation is &#34;why not just use [my favorite distro]?&#34; Linux and BSD users tend to be so accustomed to the same software working on multiple distributions, with similar package names and installation procedures, that they forget what using and installing proprietary software is frequently like. Rocky Linux and competitor  AlmaLinux (which released its own binary-compatible RHEL 8.4 clone in March) aren&#39;t simply &#34;Linux distros&#34; or even &#34;Linux distros which closely resemble RHEL.&#34; They&#39;re built from the same source code as RHEL 8.4, which guarantees that a wide array of proprietary software designed with nothing but RHEL 8.4 in mind will &#34;just work,&#34; regardless of how obscure a feature (or bug!) those packages depend upon in RHEL 8.4 might be.\n Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux aren&#39;t the only RHEL-compatible options out there, of course. Last December, we published a partial  list\u00a0of binary-compatible alternatives to RHEL, including RHEL&#39;s own CentOS Stream (which is only available as a rolling release) and Oracle Linux, as well as Rocky, Alma, and Alma&#39;s parent distro, CloudLinux.\n What makes Rocky Linux\u2014and AlmaLinux\u2014special is that both distros were created specifically to fill the void left by CentOS&#39;s deprecation. Their specific goal is to be available for anyone who needs them with commercial support also available. That latter point is in contrast with, for example, Springdale Linux\u2014which is another long-running &#34;RHEL rebuild&#34; which should &#34;just work.&#34; But it was primarily intended for and supported by a relatively small academic community.\n  Like any other Linux distro, you can simply  download an ISO of Rocky Linux and install it from scratch. But since Rocky Linux is specifically intended to serve as an easy replacement for similar distributions, it comes with easy-to-use conversion scripts as well.\n    There is no supported migration path from one of Rocky Linux&#39;s earlier release candidate (RC) builds to today&#39;s production build\u2014but interested users of other RHEL 8.4 binary-compatible distributions can use the free  migrate2rocky tool for convenient, in-place migration to Green Obsidian that should not mess up existing users, installed software, etc. The following distributions are supported by  migrate2rocky:\n  The Rocky Linux team warns that while migrations from other point releases &#34;may work,&#34; the only supported migration sources are those specifically built from RHEL 8.4 source. There are also issues with  Katello and some error messages associated with migrations beginning with RHEL 8.4 itself. We strongly recommend interested users carefully read the full  migrate2rocky release notes prior to attempting a migration\u2014and, as always, have tested and working backups available before proceeding!\n  Although Rocky Linux 8.4 is offered as a production-ready distribution today, one notable feature isn&#39;t available yet\u2014support for Secure Boot, which the Rocky team describes as a &#34;non-trivial process&#34; to get going on a new distribution.\n The process of enabling Secure Boot with Rocky is underway, however, and the team expects a second set of ISOs with Secure Boot support to be built and released relatively soon. Until then, potential Rocky Linux users who can&#39;t wait for Secure Boot support should consider AlmaLinux 8.4, which received its own Secure Boot support this May.\n Although there is always some element of risk when doing in-place migrations, it&#39;s worth noting that installing AlmaLinux (or another 8.4 compatible distro) with Secure Boot today does not mean you can&#39;t shift over to Rocky Linux later\u2014the  migrate2rocky\u00a0tool referenced in the last section should typically work simply, relatively quickly, and reliably if you need Secure Boot today but still prefer Rocky Linux once its Secure Boot support becomes available.\n  In the words of the Rocky Linux team, &#34;this is just the beginning, and the [Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation] is more than just Rocky Linux.&#34; The team goes on to describe the RESF as &#34;a home for those that believe that open source isn&#39;t just a switch that can be toggled at will.&#34;\n In order to put its money where its mouth is, the RESF didn&#39;t stop with making Green Obsidian&#39;s source code available\u2014the build infrastructure, Git repos, and &#34;everything else anyone would need to fork our work&#34; is easy to find.\n Although the RESF hasn&#39;t specified any other projects by name, it says that users should expect more in the coming weeks and months\u2014strongly implying that it may assist in hosting software and projects from like-minded developers and communities in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:17:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Amazon&#39;s warehouse in Dunfermline, Scotland. The footage showed laptops, TVs, jewelry, headphones, books, and face masks being loaded into crates marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n  An anonymous former Amazon employee told ITV that workers at the warehouse were given a weekly target of 130,000 items to destroy. This was corroborated by an internal memo viewed by ITV, which showed that during one week in April, 124,000 items were marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n      &#34;There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 COVID (face) masks still in their wrappers,&#34; the ex-employee told ITV. About half of the items marked for destruction were still in their shrink-wrap, while the other half were returned items in good condition, they said.\n An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that Dunfermline handles all products marked for destruction for the entire UK.\n  If 130,000 is a weekly average, that would translate to more than 6 million products marked for destruction every year. In 2019, undercover reporters in France found that Amazon destroyed  over 3 million products in one year.\n     ITV filmed the boxes of products marked &#34;destroy&#34; being loaded into trucks and driven to recycling centers, as well as to a landfill site.\n In a statement to Insider, the Amazon spokesperson said the landfill site mentioned by ITV was also a recycling center.\n &#34;We are working toward a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations, or recycle any unsold products. No items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero,&#34; the spokesperson said.\n In 2019, the  Mail on Sunday sent undercover reporters into a different UK warehouse where they witnessed unsold products being placed in a so-called &#34;destruction zone.&#34; The Mail then tracked the products from that warehouse as they were loaded into trucks and taken to a waste-disposal site and a landfill.\n     Amazon&#39;s spokesperson did not comment on whether the company had changed its infrastructure since the Mail&#39;s 2019 investigation.\n  By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.\n          Two crossed lines that form an &#39;X&#39;.

", "note_en": "Both creators were  suspended following ASMR streams that pushed the bounds of Twitch\u2019s community guidelines forbidding content that isn\u2019t  quite sexual in nature but is still too risqu\u00e9 for a platform deeply self-conscious about its advertising business. The Amazon-owned company declined to comment on the length of the bans or what provoked them, but pointed TechCrunch toward its rules on sexual content.\n It\u2019s possible that both Amouranth (Kaitlyn Siragusa) and Indiefoxx (Jenelle Dagres) will be reinstated Monday, 72 hours after their Friday ban, but both channels remained unavailable at the time of writing. Siragusa  confirmed to Polygon that she was suspended after a stream in which she did yoga poses while making ear-licking sounds into a microphone.\n   The so-called \u201c ASMR-meta\u201d on Twitch, where streamers boost their views by whispering into their microphones or producing licking sounds, sometimes while holding yoga poses, follows the  controversy around hot tubs on Twitch that exploded last month. In both instances, some Twitch creators believe that the platform\u2019s rules are selectively enforced.\n \u201cWith ASMR meta and crazy yoga poses, believe it or not I watched two other girls doing it to the tune of 2-5k views without any bans for months before I folded the activity into ASMR creating the infamous \u2018ASMR\u2019 meta,\u201d Siragusa wrote on Twitter. \u201cThose other streamers are still unbanned and continue to do it. My sin was taking inaction as a sign of tacit acceptance, and then blowing the top off the secret and hitting 30k viewers.\u201d\n Because both the ASMR meta and the hot tub meta were dominated by female streamers, the whole situation has attracted even more misogyny within the Twitch community, where  female streamers are still regularly harassed off the platform.\n I will always find it ENORMOUSLY IRONIC that the generation that fought \u201cviolent video games don\u2019t cause an uptick in gun/violent crimes\u201d(I agree), instantly turn tail &amp; succumb to a bad take like \u201cHOT TUB/ASMR GIRLS LITERALLY CREATE CREEPERS that plague other girl creators!\u201d\n  In a blog addressing the proliferation of women streaming from pools and hot tubs at the time, Twitch wrote that \u201cbeing found to be sexy by others is not against our rules, and Twitch will not take enforcement action against women, or anyone on our service, for their perceived attractiveness.\u201d The company clarified that while a bathing suit in a bedroom might break the rules, \u201ccontextually appropriate\u201d swimwear is allowed.\n  \u201cOur intention with the Sexually Suggestive policy was to draw a line on content that is overtly or explicitly sexually suggestive, not to ban all content that could be viewed as sexually suggestive \u2013 but we acknowledge that our rules are not as clear as they could be.\n Prohibiting every form of content that could be interpreted as suggestive would also result in far more restrictions on the video games and premium content that we currently allow, especially considering the ways that female characters are sometimes objectified or presented in a sexualized manner.\u201d\n Its solution at the time was to create a \u201cPools, Hot Tubs, and Beaches\u201d category where that content could live. Most of Twitch\u2019s categories are dedicated to specific games, with most of the platform\u2019s non-gaming streams listed in the popular catch-all category \u201cJust Chatting.\u201d\n ASMR has its own category with 2.4 million followers, encompassing ear-tingling ASMR streams that don\u2019t push the boundaries of Twitch\u2019s rules with the more recent crop of those that do. So far, instead of building out a more thoughtful way to corral sexually suggestive content, the company is opting to punish anybody who it decides crosses the line. But it\u2019s possible that could all change: Last month, Twitch said it was working on new policies to further clarify the rules on sexually suggestive content.\n Unfortunately for Twitch \u2014 and for the female creators disproportionately affected by its uneven policies \u2014 the abundance of ear-licking streams suggests that until then, the company will be making these same determinations over and over as it tries to draw a line within a gray area of its own making.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:16:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "asmr,suspends,\u62bd\u6410", "title": "\u62bd\u6410\u6682\u505c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684ASMR\u6eaa\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5973\u6027\u521b\u4f5c\u8005 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTwitch suspends two popular female creators over sexy ASMR streams\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/twitch-asmr-meta-amouranth-indiefoxx/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["asmr", "suspends", "\u62bd\u6410"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "40afbcfce20e042570d284be40d33de8.jpg", "infoid": 1067281, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636ePickbook\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f532020\u5e745\u6708\uff0cCouchbase\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b21\u4f30\u503c\u4e3a5.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u91d1\u989d\u4f30\u503c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7b79\u6b3e\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u7684\u72ec\u89d2\u517d\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u5e76\u5f00\u59cb\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u6316\u6398\u4e86Couchbase\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u8d22\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u516c\u53f8\u53ca\u5176\u5e02\u573aComps\u3002\n  COICBASE S-1\u63d0\u4ea4\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u9500\u552e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6280\u672f\u3002\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u5730\u8bf4\uff0cCouchbase\u4e3a\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u63aa\u8f9e\u4e2d\u7684NoSQL\uff08\u201c\u67b6\u6784\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u201d\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u4e0eSQL\u67e5\u8be2\u63d0\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n COICBASE\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4e91\u4e0a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u516c\u5171\u4e91\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u662f\u5728\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u8d22\u653f\u5e74\u5ea6\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u5438\u5f15\u4e86541\u540d\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u53bb\u5e74\u6536\u76d8\u751f\u621010780\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u7ecf\u5e38\u6027\u6536\u5165\u3002\n Couchbase\u5c06\u5176\u6536\u5165\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6876\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u8ba2\u9605\u5305\u62ec\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bb8\u53ef\u6536\u5165\u4ee5\u53ca\u516c\u53f8\u79f0\u4e4b\u4e3a\u201c\u652f\u6301\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u201d\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u201c\u5408\u540c\u540e\u652f\u6301\u201d\u6216PC\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u63fd\u5b50\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u201c\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u6709\u6743\u63a5\u6536\u672a\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5347\u7ea7\u201c\u5408\u540c\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u6536\u5165\u662f\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u8a00\u81ea\u660e\u7684\uff0c\u6bd4\u8ba2\u9605\u4ea7\u54c1\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002 ", "note_en": "According to  PitchBook data, Couchbase was last valued at a post-money valuation of $580 million when it raised $105 million in May 2020.

More specifically, Couchbase offers customers database technology that includes what NoSQL can offer (\u201cschema flexibility,\u201d in the company\u2019s phrasing), as well as the ability to ask questions of their data with SQL queries.\n Couchbase\u2019s software can be deployed on clouds, including public clouds, in hybrid environments, and even on-prem setups.

", "note_en": "The highly contagious delta variant is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain yet, and it will &#34;pick off&#34; the most vulnerable people, especially in places with low  Covid-19 vaccination rates, World Health Organization officials warned Monday.\n Delta, first identified in India, has the potential &#34;to be more lethal because it&#39;s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals who will become severely ill, have to be hospitalized and potentially die,&#34; Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO&#39;s emergencies program, said during a news conference.\n  Ryan said world leaders and public health officials can help defend the most vulnerable through the donation and distribution of Covid vaccines.\n &#34;We can protect those vulnerable people, those frontline workers,&#34; Ryan said, &#34;and the fact that we haven&#39;t, as Director-General (Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus) has said, again and again, is a catastrophic moral failure at a global level.&#34;\n The WHO said Friday that delta is becoming  the dominant variant of the disease worldwide.\n The agency declared delta a\u00a0 &#34;variant of concern&#34;\u00a0last month. A variant can be labeled as &#34;of concern&#34; if it has been shown to be more contagious, more deadly or more resistant to current vaccines and treatments,\u00a0 according to the health organization.\n Delta is now replacing alpha, the highly contagious variant that swept across Europe and later the U.S. earlier this year, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children&#39;s Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a recent interview.\n  Studies suggest it is around 60% more transmissible than alpha, which was more contagious than the original strain that emerged from Wuhan, China, in late 2019.\n  Delta has now spread to 92 countries, Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO&#39;s technical lead for Covid, said Monday. It now makes up at least 10% of all new cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and is on its way to becoming the dominant variant in the nation.\n The United Kingdom recently saw delta become the dominant variant there, surpassing its native alpha variant, which was first detected in the country last fall. The delta variant now makes up more than 60% of new cases in the U.K.\n WHO officials have said there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions. Still,\u00a0 there are signs\u00a0that the delta strain could provoke different symptoms than other variants.\n No variant has really found the combination of high transmissibility and lethality, but delta is &#34;the most able and fastest and fittest of those viruses,&#34; WHO officials said.\n &#34;This particular delta variant is faster, it is fitter, it will pick off the more vulnerable more efficiently than previous variants, and therefore if there are people left without vaccination, they remain even at further risk,&#34; Ryan said Monday.\n Van Kerkhove said &#34;unfortunately we don&#39;t yet have the vaccines in the right places to protect people&#39;s lives.&#34;\n The WHO has been urging wealthy nations, including the U.S. to donate doses. The Biden administration earlier Monday detailed where it will send 55 million vaccine doses, the majority of which will be distributed through COVAX, the WHO-backed immunization program.\n &#34;These vaccines are highly effective against severe disease and death. That is what they are intended for, and that is what they need to be used for&#34; Van Kerkhove said. &#34;This is what COVAX and WHO and all of our partners have been advocating for, that these vaccines reach people most at risk.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:10:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "covid,fastest,\u75ab\u82d7", "title": "\u8c01\u8bf4\u4e09\u89d2\u6d32\u662f\u6700\u5feb\uff0c\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684Covid\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5c06\u201c\u6311\u9009\u201d\u6700\u8106\u5f31\u7684 ", "title_en": "WHO Says Delta is the Fastest and Fittest Covid Variant and Will 'Pick Off' Most Vulnerable", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/covid-delta-who-says-variant-is-the-fastest-and-fittest-and-will-pick-off-most-vulnerable-.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["covid", "fastest", "\u75ab\u82d7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d717bfe70c3c158ff7c1f2bea7485287.png", "infoid": 1067278, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Tiktok\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u518d\u9700\u8981\u5728\u81f3\u5c11\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u201c\u751f\u7269\u4e2d\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u201d\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0cTiktok\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u521b\u9020\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u96c6\u6210\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6dfb\u52a0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u70f9\u996a\u89c6\u9891\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u914d\u65b9\u5171\u4eab\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u6210\u5206\u5217\u8868\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7Quizlet\u6dfb\u52a0\u6d4b\u9a8c\uff0c\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u547c\u5438\u547c\u5438\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e4b\u524d\u5df2\u7ecf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u6b64\u529f\u80fd;\u622a\u81f3\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u90fd\u80fd\u770b\u5230\u548c\u4e92\u52a8\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u4f46\u53ea\u6709A\uff06\uff0334;\u9009\u62e9\uff06\uff0334;\u7fa4\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u8005\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u3002\n \u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u66f4\u65b0\u60a8\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u3002\n \u5df2\u6279\u51c6\u4f7f\u7528Jump\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e73\u53f0\u5305\u62ec\u4e0a\u8ff0\u626b\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u547c\u5438\u548cQuizlet\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff0cStatmuse\u548cTabelog\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u559c\u6b22Buzzfeed\uff0cJumprope\uff0cIRL\u548cWatcha\u5c06\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5468\u63a8\u51fa\u3002\u6dfb\u52a0\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u5f71\u8bc4\u8bba\u548c\u7f8e\u5bb9\u6559\u7a0b\u3002\n  \u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u5c06\u662fSnapchat\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8ba9\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u5f71\u7968\u6216\u4ece\u5934\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u51a5\u60f3\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002 WeChat\uff0cMount Messaging App\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n \u201cTiktok\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5a31\u4e50\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u5730\uff0c\u201dTiktok\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\u3002 \u201c\u901a\u8fc7Tiktok\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u793e\u533a\u7684\u201d\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u201c\uff06\uff0339;

Today,  TikTok introduced Jump, a new way for creators to add interactivity to their videos via third-party integrations. So, for example, a cooking video could feature a list of ingredients via  Whisk, a recipe-sharing app. You might also be able to add a quiz via  Quizlet, or breathing exercises via  Breathwrk. The company has beta-tested this feature before; as of today, all users will be able to see and interact with Jumps, but only a &#34;select&#34; group of creators will actually be able to add them to their content.\n This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.  Update your settings here, then reload the page to see it.\n Some of the platforms that have been approved to work with Jump include the aforementioned Whisk, Breathwrk and Quizlet, as well as Wikipedia,  StatMuse and  Tabelog. Others like BuzzFeed,  Jumprope,  IRL and  WATCHA will launch in the coming weeks. Examples of added content include movie reviews and beauty tutorials.\n  The closest competitor to Jump would be  Snapchat\u2019s Minis, which are essentially mini apps that let you buy movie tickets through Atom or have meditation exercises from Headspace. WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging app, also has its own line of mini apps.\n \u201cTikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn,\u201d wrote Sean Kim, TikTok\u2019s head of product, in a press release. \u201cThrough TikTok Jump, we&#39;re creating that \u2018last mile\u2019 of our community&#39;s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform\u201d\n Update, 3:30PM ET: This story originally said that Jumps were now available for all users.

Heap Connect product. This part of our system is tasked with moving large amounts of data quickly to our customers&#39; warehouses. Using Spark allows us to easily scale up our data processing to support our largest customers, and we also get out-of-the-box support for column-based file formats like ORC.\n This blog post covers one of the first performance hurdles we had to solve. Our data processing job was seemingly hanging for some of our customers. Our root cause analysis identified a slowness in the Spark implementation of the ORC file reader.\n An unexpected algorithmic gotcha caused a tree-processing algorithm to perform an exponential number of operations. This meant that even a tiny tree with 50 nodes could cause the algorithm to effectively go on indefinitely.\n Luckily, we managed to work around the problem on our side without depending on Spark for a fix. After fixing our immediate production issue, we also contributed to a fix for Spark.\n  Our customers care about users, events (the actions users take on their website or product), and sessions. They also care about filtering these entities. For example, they might be interested in the \u201ccount of all events which happened in the United Kingdom.\u201d\n   It turns out that a very natural way to represent this set of predicates is with a binary tree, like this one:\n  The leaf nodes represent individual filter conditions, like \u201ccountry = UK\u201d. Non-leaf nodes represent an operation performed on their subtrees. An AND node says \u201conly match data that conforms to the conditions in my left subtree and in my right subtree\u201d. An OR node would be similar, but matching either the left or right subtree without requiring both subtrees to match at the same time.\n I mentioned \u201ctrees with 50 nodes\u201d earlier. Does anyone really want to apply that many filters to their data? A standard situation that causes this is if the customer wants to filter for events which:\n  Expressing this in a straightforward way, without introducing array-based filters, requires a tree with 50 leaf nodes.\n  Now that we\u2019ve covered how trees come into the picture, let\u2019s discuss why processing them can require so much time.\n Although it\u2019s a standard practice to represent filters as trees, there\u2019s no single, widely accepted implementation. Thus, a large project like Spark might need to support and integrate with multiple such tree-based representations. In our case, some debugging pointed us towards an algorithm for converting from Spark\u2019s internal tree-based filter into an ORC-specific\r SearchArgument.\n Since the two formats are not 100% equivalent, the conversion had to check whether the input tree could be converted before actually attempting to do so. This resulted in code like this:\n  At first, this looked pretty reasonable. However, the methods  canTransform and  transform contain almost identical logic. Thus, in the spirit of code reuse, the implementation did this instead:\n  Still looking pretty reasonable. However, notice the minor, yet very important difference: we\u2019re calling the  transform method twice.\n Why would that be very important? Doing something twice instead of only once sounds sub-optimal, but shouldn\u2019t really be that bad. Right...?\n  A more careful look shows that we\u2019re not simply \u201cdoing something twice\u201d. Instead, it\u2019s closer to \u201cdoing something twice; then twice again, in each of these two invocations; then twice again, ...\u201d and so on. That is, we\u2019re \u201cdoing something twice\u201d, raised to the power of H (where H is the height of the tree).\n Let\u2019s take a slightly more formal look. Let\u2019s call the number of operations required to transform a tree of height H, f(H). Then:\n  Or, translated back into words again, the complexity of the transform function is exponential in the height of the tree being transformed.\n For a tree with height 45, we get f(45) = 2 ^ 44 * f(1) = 17,592,186,044,416 * f(1).\n For simplicity, let\u2019s assume that f(1) = 1. Assuming a modern CPU can run ~3 billion operations per second, this innocent-looking tree transformation would take ~ 5800 seconds, or about an hour and a half. Each additional layer in the tree makes the operation take 2x longer.\n Also, notice that 1.5 hours is the time it takes us to simply transform a filter expression from one tree format into another. Once. No customer data was analyzed during that 1.5-hour period. That part is yet to begin.\n It\u2019s also interesting to note where this time is being spent. When running a Spark job, all the actual data processing is done by Spark Executors. Thus, most of the standard monitoring and optimization approaches are largely focused on Executor performance. But in our case, nothing was showing up anywhere in the Executor performance metrics. It seemed like the Executors were just idling all the time.\n While Spark Executors are responsible for the data processing, the Spark Driver is the component responsible for query planning. The exponential algorithm above was part of query planning. Thus, its slowness meant that the Spark Driver never managed to successfully plan the query. Because of this, there was no work for the Executors to pick up \u2014 and, thus, they were idling.\n  When introducing the problem, I said the algorithm was \u201cexponential in the size of the tree\u201d. However, our more careful analysis reveals that it\u2019s not in the  size of the tree, but rather, it\u2019s in the  height of the tree that it\u2019s exponential. We can use that detail to build a workaround.\n Before we do that, let\u2019s see how we ended up with trees that are so deep. It\u2019s actually very easy to do so if you\u2019re not actively trying to avoid it. In our case, we had code that looked like this:\n  This code was very easy to read and write. However, given a long list of  andPredicates, it resulted in heavily skewed trees.\n Given a list of 45 &#34;country = X&#34;, this straightforward implementation results in a tree with depth 45 that immediately triggers the exponential behavior. This causes jobs to get stuck on the predicate conversion step.\n  Luckily, in our specific use-case, very deep trees always had the same operation. For example, we could have a tree with 45 OR nodes like the above, or with 45 AND nodes. However, we never created 45-layer-deep trees that had a mix of ANDs and ORs. This consistency allowed us to manipulate the tree freely, without worrying about accidentally changing the semantics.\n This is because, due to associativity, we can combine the AND sub-clauses however we want. We can create a subtree composed of a subset of the AND clauses, and then merge them together, thus preserving the result.\n This allowed us to create an equivalent predicate tree that had a different shape. Building a balanced tree from an array of elements is a relatively standard tree algorithm. Using that instead of the heavily right-skewed tree resulted in enormous performance gains, with the performance going from multiple hours (or never finishing, for larger tree) to taking seconds.\n   Deploying this change to our production jobs made all the performance issues related to this code go away. We didn&#39;t need to wait for a Spark release or fork the codebase in order to change Spark internals, which was great for our velocity in getting a fix out.\n However, we knew that the right thing to do was to remove the exponential algorithm from Spark altogether, so we tackled that next.\n  We contributed a fix for the exponential complexity to Spark in  [SPARK-27105][SQL] Optimize away exponential complexity in ORC predicate conversion by IvanVergiliev \u00b7 Pull Request #24068 \u00b7 apache/spark. It was included in the Spark 3.0 release  ( Spark Release 3.0.0 | Apache Spark ).\n The high-level idea for avoiding the exponential behavior completely was more or less clear \u2014  don&#39;t call into the same method for &#34;checking for transformability&#34; and &#34;performing the transformation&#34;. Making the two different actions go through different code paths avoids the &#34;doing something twice, recursively&#34; problem we covered above.\n Getting to a code structure that is readable and maintainable and everyone is happy with took a bit longer though. After a number of different iterations, and incorporating ideas from multiple people, we ended up with code that is both readable and performant.\n If you like to solve production performance issues with algorithmic optimizations, and to improve the underlying tools you&#39;re using,  we are hiring!

There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 Covid (face) masks still in their wrappers.\n \u201cOverall, 50% of all items are unopened and still in their shrink wrap. The other half are returns and in good condition.\u201d\n The investigation also found a leaked document which showed that more than 124,000 items were marked \u201cdestroy\u201d during one week in April \u2013 compared to just 28,000 items in the same period labelled \u201cdonate\u201d.\n  However, an Amazon spokesman told the PA news agency that while the investigation followed lorries to a landfill site, no items are disposed of in that way.\n   A statement from Amazon said: \u201cWe are working towards a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations or recycle any unsold products.\n \u201cNo items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we\u2019re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero.\n \u201cWe are committed to reducing our environmental footprint and building a circular economy programme with the aim of reducing returns, reusing and reselling products, and reducing disposals.\u201d\n Energy recovery is when recyclable materials are stripped from products before the rest is reconverted into energy and put through the national grid.\n But the spokesman maintained this was a last resort for the company \u2013 and also denied it was cheaper to dispose of the items instead of returning them to the domestic sellers.\n Your  contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you\n   Support us now\n  Mark Ruskell, Scottish Greens environment spokesman and Mid Scotland and Fife Member of Scottish Parliament (MSP), said: \u201cAmazon\u2019s net profit has soared during this crisis while many people have struggled to make ends meet.\n \u201cIt\u2019s therefore obscene that this multi-billion corporation finds it more profitable to put unused items in the bin than help people out.\n \u201cIt is a damning indictment of our economy that the throwaway culture is put before people\u2019s needs. Even if it is not reflective of wider Amazon policy, the company must answer for why the Dunfermline warehouse has such high levels of waste and so little is resold or given to charities.\n \u201cThis shocking revelation shows that governments must do more to force companies to design waste out of their systems, with regulation and fines where they are failing to do the right thing.\u201d",

", "note_en": "Ubco\u2019s hero product, the Ubco 2X2, is an all-wheel drive electric motorbike that looks like a dirt bike but rides like a moped. What began as a solution for farmers to get around pastures and farms easily, safely and quickly has expanded to include an urban version of the bike that caters to fleet enterprise customers, gig economy workers and city riders.\n Since its founding in 2015, the company has produced two versions of its 145-pound utility bike: The Work Bike, the original off-road vehicle, and the Adventure Bike, the newer version that\u2019s made for city riding but can handle itself off-road.\n  Now that Ubco\u2019s got a fresh cash infusion from the round led by Seven Peak Ventures, Nuance Capital and TPK Holdings, it hopes to continue expanding into existing verticals, like food delivery, postal service and last-mile logistics. The company already works with Domino\u2019s in New Zealand and the United Kingdom, as well as a range of other national clients, like the New Zealand Post, the Defense Force, the Department of Conservation and P\u0101mu, or Landcorp Farming Limited and other local restaurants and stores.\n \u201cWe have a strong enterprise market in New Zealand and have developed a strong pipeline of sales internationally,\u201d Timothy Allan, CEO and co-founder, told TechCrunch.\n While direct consumer sales make up for most of Ubco\u2019s revenue at present, the company is pushing aggressively into enterprise, and more specifically, subscription services. The 2X2 is built on an intelligent platform that includes vehicle and power systems, cloud connectivity and data analysis, which enables the subscription model to work alongside fleet management systems.\n Ubco expects revenue to climb from $2.1 million in 2020 to $8.4 million by the end of 2021 as it pushes to increase its annual recurring revenue through subscriptions. Ubco\u2019s subscription model, which costs about $50 to $60 per week ($75 to $85 NZD) for fleet enterprise customers, is being rolled out in New Zealand, Australia, the U.K., Europe and the U.S. this year and into 202. Consumers will get access to the subscriptions as well within the next couple of months, according to a spokesperson for the company.\n Allan sees subscriptions as the future of the EV industry, not just because it allows for a high chance of profitability, but also because it\u2019s far more environmentally sustainable. As the company expands this part of its business model, it hopes to lead the circular economy space.\n The company predicts that vehicles run through the subscription model will have four times the life expectancy as those sold outright and produce 80% less carbon overall compared to a combustion vehicle.\n \u201cSubscription means we own the vehicle, so we manage the lifecycle,\u201d said Allan. \u201cSo the first life starts at high intensity, and that might be 60,000 kilometers delivering pizza, or it might be 30,000 kilometers on a farm, which are equally hard for different reasons. Then after, that vehicle will go down to a lower intensity application. After that the battery can then be pulled out, and that might go into passive solar storage or something like that.\u201d\n Allan sees solving the end-of-life issue as a personal and professional challenge, one with room for creativity since no one has fully figured out the correct way of doing it. He says he takes a bottom up approach when it comes to the engineering of the vehicle in a way that allows for easier recycling.\n \u201cLike when you design a battery, fuck putting fire retardant foam into it because you can\u2019t get it back at the end of life,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it starts with correctly labeling, engineering with intent so that you\u2019re designing for this type of assembly, and then your business or commercial system needs to support the concept. Now, we\u2019ve got the advantage because the economics and incentives are aligned, and that all aligns with New Zealand\u2019s product stewardship legislation.\u201d\n Trying to perfect the circular economy through utility vehicles isn\u2019t just about doing what\u2019s right for the environment. Allan thinks it\u2019ll be a smart business decision in the end, one that will draw in customers and give the company a competitive edge with enterprise clients.\n \u201cThis is a part of your journey with us as a customer,\u201d said Allan. \u201cIf we can design subscriptions and the life of the vehicle in such a way that you feel good about it, that\u2019s where we\u2019re driving from. Most people want to do the right thing, and we can provide something that logically fits the economics, can be done at scale and can be managed holistically.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 03:27:48",

Jim Jordan (R-OH) is calling on Microsoft to face the same antitrust scrutiny as other large tech platforms in a letter to the company Monday.\n In the letter, Jordan asks Microsoft president Brad Smith if he believes the company would be affected by the swath of antitrust bills introduced in the House earlier this month. There are five bills in total, spanning from offering up more money for antitrust enforcers to banning large tech platforms from buying up small competitors.\n The antitrust package came out of a yearslong investigation into Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. The measures focus on the anticompetitive behaviors of these four companies, and it\u2019s not as clear how they would affect other large companies like Microsoft. While Microsoft meets the standard laid out under these bills to be considered a \u201ccovered platform,\u201d like meeting the over $600 billion market cap and 50 million monthly active users, the bills don\u2019t target the company\u2019s specific lines of business.\n  \u201cBig Tech, including Microsoft, Inc., is out to get conservatives,\u201d Jordan said in his Monday letter. \u201cIt is unclear why Microsoft has avoided significant attention from House Democrats.\u201d\n Assumably, Microsoft would face the same proposed standards in acquiring companies, like taking on the burden of proof, and making the data it takes from users more portable and usable on other platforms. But whereas Amazon and Apple would face more structural changes, like selling off separate lines of business, Microsoft would likely not be subject to the rules.\n Jordan\u2019s letter, which also pointed out several instances he purports as Microsoft being biased against conservatives, comes as a rift is growing among the House Republican caucus over the package. While all five bills were introduced with Republican and Democrat co-sponsors, not all Republicans are on board.   The Wall Street Journal  reported last week that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) did not support the bills.\n Jordan also seems to oppose the measures, opting to take different action against tech, like reforming Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, to go after platforms that allegedly censor conservative speech.\n \u201cDemocrat impeachment managers don\u2019t care about conservative censorship. Their next big mission? Empower Big Tech and Big Government to make it worse,\u201d Jordan said in a tweet last week.\n Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), the top Republican on the House antitrust subcommittee, called Jordan out over his criticism on Twitter, saying, \u201cUsing antitrust laws to stop Big Tech\u2019s bad behavior isn\u2019t Big Government, it\u2019s law enforcement,\u201d Buck said.\n The House Judiciary Committee plans to mark up the package on Wednesday. It\u2019s unclear how every member plans to vote. Earlier this month, lobbyists for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media companies, including Fox Corp. and News Corp., were urging House Republicans to vote in favor of the bills.  On his show last Friday,  Fox News host Tucker Carlson also urged lawmakers to approve the bills.\n \u201cThe tech monopolies are actually a threat to the country,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cIf you care about democracy, you need to break up the monopolies.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 03:21:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Source: Kingslake, Rudolf, 1974, &#34; The Rochester Camera and Lens Companies&#34;,\r Rochester NY, Photographic Historical Society.\n      This is a most complicated story spanning almost 100 years, and I find that it is often\r difficult to discover what actually did happen, and to sort out the numerous changes of\r name, and acquisitions, and combinations of companies that went on in Rochester,\r especially during the period from 1890 to 1905. Small companies would be formed, often by\r employees from another company, and as often they would fail and their assets would be\r absorbed by the same or by another company. Companies, too, would be frequently\r reorganized with larger capital and a new set of officers, with often a different name,\r and it is hard to decide whether they are the same or a different company.  Eastman was particularly good at acquiring a company and\r then letting it operate for years under its old name, often marking on its products\r &#34;Eastman Kodak Company, successor to ...&#34; Even locating the address of a company\r is no real clue to ownership because often three or more companies would occupy the same\r building.\n  I must at this point acknowledge the great assistance I have received from Don Lyon in\r sorting out the various companies and personalities and changes of ownership, and\r particularly for giving me access to his voluminous records and files. He really should be\r giving this talk instead of me. I have gained most of my information from the city\r directories, and also some from the catalog files at the  George Eastman House. Although I have found out\r a lot about the numerous optical and camera companies of Rochester, my records are far\r from complete, and shall no doubt continue to find out interesting facts for many years to\r come. If anyone detects an error in my story, I hope they will point it out so that I can\r get everything correct as far as it goes.\n  I am very conscious that I should have started this research before the center of\r Rochester was torn to shreds to make room for the inner loop and the Urban Renewal\r project. Some streets have completely disappeared, many have changed their names, old\r buildings have been torn down to make room for parking lots, and it is often hopeless to\r find out where a company actually was located. This problem has been rendered even more\r difficult by the renumbering of streets that occurred in 1899 and 1911.\n  I have deliberately omitted companies devoted primarily to the manufacture of film,\r printing paper, plate holders, and the like, and more especially to optical companies\r making only spectacles, which has been a very active business in Rochester over the years.\r Thus I have omitted reference to companies such as Haloid, Defender, and even Xerox! The\r two large companies,  Bausch and Lomb and  Kodak have kept remarkably clear of each other&#39;s\r activities, and it is possible for tine historian to consider them separately, as I have\r done. The various camera companies were mainly related in some way to Kodak, while the\r lens and shutter companies were mostly connected with Bausch and Lomb. There have been\r exceptions, of course, as we shall see. There have also been several companies that have\r had no connection with either of these giants.\n      The photo-optical industry in Rochester was born in 1880. In that year Bausch and Lomb\r began to make photographic lenses; the  Rochester\r Optical Company began to make cameras; and  George\r Eastman began to make plates. However, my story actually begins back in 1853 when J.\r J. Bausch founded his tiny spectacle business and sat around vainly waiting for customers.\n  John Jacob Bausch was born in Gross Suessen, Germany, of a poor family, and was\r apprenticed to a spectacle maker. At the age of 20, in 1850, he decided to emigrate to\r America, and after a harrowing 49-day journey in a sailing vessel, landed in New York. He\r proceeded to Buffalo, where there was a cholera epidemic, and after trying unsuccessfully\r to find work, he moved to Rochester, where again he had the greatest difficulty in finding\r any sort of employment. He finally, at age 23, decided to set up an optician&#39;s shop in the\r Reynolds Arcade under the name of &#34;J. J. Bausch, Optician&#34;. At that time\r scarcely anybody in this country used eyeglasses, and many people had never even seen a\r pair, so his sales were almost nil. In 1856, as his trade card shows, his shop was called\r the &#34;J. J. Bausch Optical Institute.&#34;\n  In his endless struggle to find work, and even to survive, Bausch was greatly helped by\r a Mr. Henry Lomb, a cabinet maker, whom he probably met at the Turn Verein club. Lomb was\r born in 1828 and had also emigrated from Germany in 1849. He was a bachelor, and in 1853\r decided to join Bausch, where he proceeded to learn the optician&#39;s trade, and lodged with\r the Bausch family, turning over his earnings to them. At the outbreak of the Civil War,\r Lomb immediately enlisted, and finally rose to the rank of captain. He returned to\r Rochester in 1863, and in the following year the firm became &#34;Bausch and Lomb,\r Optician.&#34; By then business had improved to the point where they could open a factory\r at the corner of Andrews and Water Streets. Henry Lomb married in 1865, and in the\r following year moved to New York to act as the firm&#39;s sales agent there. He died in 190S,\r and because of his many civic activities and particularly his great interest in the\r Rochester Institute of Technology, a handsome memorial shaft was erected in his memory in\r 1932 in Rochester. Incidentally, the name of the company was changed to the\r &#34;Vulcanite Optical Instrument Company&#34; from 1866 to 1876, as this material was\r being extensively used to make spectacle frames. The name was changed back to the\r &#34;Bausch and Lomb Optical Company&#34; in 1876. After World War II it became\r &#34;Bausch and Lomb Inc.&#34;\n  After the Civil War, interest in spectacles rose rapidly, and the company constructed\r an enlarged factory in 1868 at River and Water Streets, followed six years later by an\r even larger building at the present location in St. Paul Street, the date 1874 being\r carved over the door. During the first World War they added a large building in front of\r the old one. We are now told that the company plans to abandon the entire establishment\r and move into the old Bond Clothing building on North Goodman Street.\n  Returning to 1875; at the urging of Bausch&#39;s eldest son Edward, the firm decided to\r branch out into optical instruments, beginning with the microscope for which there was a\r growing demand. To get started, they hired a temperamental character named Ernst  Gundlach, who had previously made microscopes in Berlin and was then\r living in Hackensack, New Jersey. Gundlach was employed by Bausch and Lomb from 1876 to\r 1878, but they quarreled frequently and finally separated. The microscope work, however,\r proceeded successfully under Edward Bausch&#39;s direction, and by 1903 they had sold about\r 44,000 instruments.\n  Bausch and Lomb added photographic lenses to their line in 1883, and began the\r manufacture of shutters in 1888. In 1892 they became the only company in America licensed\r to make Zeiss Anastigmats and other lenses. They also made Compound and Compur shutters by\r agreement with Deckel. These arrangements were finally terminated in World War I.\n  Some 1903 statistics are impressive. At that time Bausch and Lomb was making some 20\r million spectacle lenses a year, and had manufactured 500,000 photographic lenses and\r 550,000 shutters. As you know, the company is still in existence with branches in several\r other cities and abroad, making a wide range of optical and electronic products of the\r highest quality.\n      I have mentioned that difficult individual, Ernst Gundlach, who left  Bausch and Lomb somewhat unwillingly in 1878. His address at\r that time was 171 St. Paul Street while Bausch and Lomb were at No. 179, so he lived\r practically next door to the plant. In 1879 Gundlach was joined by a Lewis R. Sexton, and\r together they set up and operated an optical goods establishment in their home, while\r Sexton doubled as a teacher in No. 7 school, later becoming principal of School 17 and\r then of School 9. Being certain that the optical business was in good hands, Gundlach\r moved to Hartford, Conn., in 1880, where he lived for the next four years, giving his\r occupation as &#34;Optician.&#34; The following year Sexton moved the optical\r establishment to 29 Stone Street, where he was joined by two other opticians, J. C. Reich\r and J. Zellweger. In the 1883 Rochester directory he was listed as &#34;Dealer in Ernst\r Gundlach&#39;s Microscopes and Objectives.&#34;\n  Lewis R. Sexton died in August 1884 after having dropped out of optics, and Gundlach\r immediately returned to Rochester. He reorganized the business at 29 Stone Street as the\r &#34;Gundlach Optical Company&#34;, with himself, Reich, Zellweger, and H. H. Turner, a\r machinist, as officers. They claimed in their advertising to be &#34;Sole Manufacturers\r of E. Gundlach&#39;s Microscopes and Objectives.&#34; During the next eight years the company\r occupied several different locations, finally ending up in 1892 at 761 South Clinton\r Avenue where they stayed until well into the 1930&#39;s. In 1889 Gundlach was joined by his\r son Karl, who lived with him for many years.\n  Early in 1895, for some reason, Ernst Gundlach left the firm and established a rival\r company called the &#34;Gundlach Photo-optical Company&#34; at 5 South Water Street, as\r that building was then being vacated by the  Rochester\r Optical Company. In an advertisement published in the American Journal of Photography,\r Vol. XV, for August 1895, he stated that &#34;Ernst Gundlach has severed all connections\r with the old &#39;Gundlach Optical Company&#39;, and we are now the sole owners of his patent of\r December 9, 1890, under which his celebrated &#39;Rapid Rectigraphic&#39;, &#39;Perigraphic&#39;, and\r other lenses were so long made.&#34; Thus from 1895 there were two Gundlach companies\r existing independently in Rochester.\n  Late in 1895, the name of the second company was changed to &#34;Ernst Gundlach, Lens\r Manufacturers&#34; and in 1896 it was changed again to &#34;Ernst Gundlach, Son, and\r Co.&#34; then at 202 Court Street, the officers being B. W. Fenn, Z. P. Taylor, G. B.\r Gilbert, and A. S. Gilbert. However, the business cannot have been very successful, for\r two years later the Gundlachs left the city and moved to Chicago. After they left, the\r plant was re-named &#34;The Rochester Lens Company,&#34; and operated by Fenn and\r Gilbert. It was finally acquired by  Wollensak in 1905.\n  To return to the original Gundlach Optical Company: In 1895 H. H. Turner was manager,\r J. Zellweger and J. C. Reich were opticians, and in 1896 they acquired the Milburn Korona\r Company, which had been founded two years before by Gustave G. Milburn, and so added\r Korona cameras to their previous line of lenses. In 1896 they began also to advertise\r shutters, and added the Turner-Reich Anastigmat (U.S. Pat. 539,370) to their lens list. In\r 1898 Turner was president and manager, Zellweger was vice-president, and Reich secretary\r and treasurer. In August 1902 the company acquired the Manhattan Optical Company Of\r Cresskill, New Jersey, and changed the name of the company to the &#34;Gundlach-Manhattan\r Optical Company.&#34; Their building at 761 South Clinton Avenue at various times acted\r as the home of other companies, including the Rochester Panoramic Camera Company (1905),\r the  Seneca Camera Company (1903-1910), and the  Ilex Optical Company (1912-1916).\n  Around 1926 the name was changed to the Gundlach Manufacturing Company, and in 1928 it\r was taken over by John E. Seebold, president, and Walter H. Ashby as vice-president, under\r the strange name of the &#34;Seebold Invisible Camera Company.&#34; Seebold left the\r following year and Ashby became president. They suffered badly in the depression and\r finally moved to Fairport in October 1935, their old building on Clinton Avenue becoming\r the Kane Furniture Store. Early in 1954 their remaining assets were acquired by Albert\r Drucker, of Burke and James in Chicago, and finally re-organized as &#34;Dynamic Optics\r Inc.&#34; with David Goldstein as president. The firm ceased operations in 1972. In 1946\r Mr. Turner&#39;s son, Donald, founded the Turner Bellows Company which is still in existence\r at 165 North Water Street, making thousands of bellows a day for Polaroid.\n      The second company to branch off from  Bausch and Lomb\r was Wollensak. Andrew Wollensak was first employed as a machinist by Bausch and Lomb in\r 1882, and became a foreman the following year. He helped Edward Bausch with the design of\r the Iris Diaphragm shutter in 1890, and probably worked on other shutters as well. In 1899\r he and his brother John decided to establish a new company for the purpose of\r manufacturing a line of high quality shutters which could be sold at a reasonable price.\r The brothers managed to obtain financial help from Stephen Rauber, former president of the\r Union Brewing Company in North Clinton Avenue, and the new company, Rauber and Wollensak,\r was established in a building at 280 Central Avenue. Mr. Rauber died in 1901, and the name\r of the firm was then changed to the Wollensak Optical Company. The following year\r Wollensak commenced the production of lenses as well as shutters. The famous &#39;Optimo&#39;\r shutter was designed by Andrew Wollensak in 1909, and was sold extensively until 1930. The\r company purchased the Rochester Lens Company in 1905, thereby obtaining the right to\r manufacture the &#39;Royal&#39; anastigmat line developed by that company.\n  Andrew Wollensak senior, president of the company since its foundation, died in January\r 1936, his brother John having died three years earlier. John left five children, of whom\r Andrew A. and Frank J. remained active in the business for many years, and I knew them\r both. In 1913 the company moved to 1415 Clinton Avenue North at Norton Street, and in 1924\r to 872 Hudson Avenue. In 1938 a larger and more desirable building a few yards to the\r south, at 850 Hudson Avenue, fell vacant (it had been a clothing factory), and Wollensak\r moved into it. Unfortunately, during the past 15 years, after several changes of\r ownership, including Revere and 3M, the company gradually went downhill and in 1972\r finally closed its doors.\n  Wollensak was one of Rochester&#39;s finest companies, and at their height in 1958 they had\r over 1200 employees. Their lenses, shutters, and other products were considered to be\r excellent, and during the war they made a wide variety of optical equipment for the armed\r forces. It is too bad that they could not manage to survive.\n      The next offshoot from  Bausch and Lomb was Ilex. In 1910\r two Bausch and Lomb shutter designers named Rudolph Klein and Theodor Brueck (the latter\r had designed the &#34;Volute&#34; shutter in 1902) invented the revolutionary and\r extremely important shutter delay mechanism involving a rotating gear and a rocking pallet\r (U.S. Pat. 1,092,110). This device for the first time enabled a shutter to be made which\r would be accurate independently of temperature and other atmospheric conditions.\n  Klein and Brueck decided to leave Bausch and Lomb and set up their own business, which\r was called the &#34;XL Manufacturing Company&#34;, to manufacture the new shutter. They\r were aided financially by a wholesale jeweler named Morris Rosenbloom, and they set up\r their first factory on his premises at 156 Main Street East. However, they soon discovered\r that C. P. Goerz was also making a line of so-called &#34;X excel L&#34; shutters, so to\r avoid confusion they twisted the letters around and renamed their shutter the\r &#34;Ilex,&#34; and in 1911 the firm was called the Ilex Manufacturing Company. Very\r soon after, Friedrich Deckel of Munich sought permission to use their delay mechanism on a\r royalty basis in the famous line of &#34;Compur&#34; shutters, which proved to be a\r considerable financial help to Ilex.\n  From 1912 to 1916 the company, now called the Ilex Optical Company, occupied space in\r the  Gundlach building at 761 South Clinton Avenue; in 1917 they\r moved to 724 Portland Avenue, and eventually in 1930 to 690 Portland, where they are\r today. In 1921 they tried the experiment of setting up a separate lens factory at 814 St.\r Paul Street called the &#34;Acme Optical Company,&#34; but it lasted only a couple of\r years.\n  One of the major contributions of the Ilex company was the invention of a\r self-contained internal flash synchronization mechanism during World War II. This was\r designed by Alfred Schwartz, and the idea has, of course, been incorporated in all\r shutters by all manufacturers since that time.\n  Ilex has suffered many ups and downs in prosperity over the years. The first president,\r Morris Rosenbloom, died in 1935 and was succeeded by his son Rufus as president and E. C.\r Roland as vice-president. Roland died in 1942, and after the war the company&#39;s fortunes\r sank to a low ebb. Finally, in 1963, their remaining assets were acquired by two young  Elgeet employees, Eugene Miller and Manuel Kiner, and today the company\r is thriving with over 200 employees, and having to increase its factory space to keep up\r with the demand for its products.\n      Talking of  Ilex reminds me of Elgeet. The Elgeet Optical Company\r was founded by three young men who had been boyhood friends: Mortimer A. London, then a\r lens inspector at  Kodak, with David L. Goldstein and\r Peter Terbuska of Ilex. (The firm&#39;s name is an acronym of L, G. and T). In 1946 they began\r by leasing some machine tools to make lens-polishing machinery, and with this they set up\r shop in an Atlantic Avenue loft, where they did all their own lens manufacture, packaging,\r and selling.\n  By 1952 the firm had grown sufficiently to enable them to purchase a former clothing\r plant at 838 Smith Street. At that time Goldstein was president, Terbuska was secretary,\r and London treasurer. The company prospered and with nearly 300 employees they\r manufactured thousands of lenses for small movie cameras and many other applications.\n  London left in 1960, and in 1962 the firm acquired ownership of the ancient\r establishment of Steinheil in Munich, but they soon sold this, I believe to Lear Siegler.\r In 1964 there were difficulties at stock-holder&#39;s meetings, and the firm was reorganized\r with Alfred Watson as president. Two years later the assets of the company were acquired\r by MATI (Management and Technology Inc.), who acquired Turner Bellows at the same time.\r MATI survived only until 1969, when they disappeared. Goldstein purchased the remaining\r assets of the former  Gundlach Manufacturing Company in Fairport\r and reorganized it under the name &#34;Dynamic Optics Incorporated,&#34; but this also\r ceased operations in 1972.\n      So much for  Bausch and Lomb and their daughter\r companies. We will now turn our attention to the camera business initiated by William H.\r Walker, who came to Rochester in 1880 and set up as &#34;Wm. H. Walker and Company&#34;,\r at 79 Exchange Street. (He must not be confused with James T. Walker Of Palmyra, who made\r the Takiv camera ten years later). In 1882 Walker joined with W. H. Reid and J. Inglis to\r make dry plates, a business continued by Inglis for several years. In 1883 Walker gave up\r making cameras, and the &#34;Rochester Optical Company&#34; was established by W.

", "note_en": "In this article, I would like to give you a technical description of CVE-2021\u201320226(  ZDI-2021\u2013001 ) which is published before. I discovered this vulnerability and reported it to the vendor via the Zero Day Initiative. This article is not intended to inform you of the dangers of vulnerabilities, but to share tips from a technical point of view.\n An overview of the vulnerabilities and attack methods can be found at the links below. This blog will explain in a little more detail.\n  If you   have any questions or found any mistakes, I\u2019d appreciate it if you could contact me individually. And, the code in this article basically refers to the Linux Kernel source code at  Linux kernel 5.6.19.\n io_uring is one of the actively updated features as of 2021, and the information changes as the version changes (many changes have been made since the time I discovered it). Therefore, please note that the information is not up-to-date even at the time of writing the blog.\n  I will explain the outline of the PoC I wrote, but I will not post the actual code.\n    Please refer to some blogs/slides posted on the Internet for specs and detailed descriptions from the user\u2019s perspective.  From here, I will continue to explain the outline of io_uring on the assumption that you understand it.\n In io_uring, a file descriptor is first generated by a dedicated system call ( io_uring_setup), and by issuing  mmap() system call to it, Submission Queue(SQ) and Completion Queue(CQ) are mapped/shared in userspace memory. This is used as ring buffer by both sides(Kernel/Userspace). Entries for each system call such as read/write/send/recv are registered by writing SQE(Submission Queue Entry) to the shared memory. And then execution is started by calling  io_uring_enter().\n   By the way, the important part this time is the implementation of asynchronous execution, so I will focus on that. To explain it first, io_uring is not always executed asynchronously, but it is  executed asynchronously as needed. Please refer to the code below first.(After this, the Kernel v5.8 will be used to explain the behavior. The behavior may be slightly different from your environment.)\n #define _GNU_SOURCE #include &lt;sched.h&gt; #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; #include &lt;signal.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/fcntl.h&gt; #include &lt;err.h&gt; #include &lt;unistd.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt; #include &lt;linux/io_uring.h&gt; #define SYSCHK(x) ({ \\  typeof(x) __res = (x); \\  if (__res == (typeof(x))-1) \\  err(1, &#34;SYSCHK(&#34; #x &#34;)&#34;); \\  __res; \\ }) static int uring_fd; struct iovec *io; #define SIZE 32 char _buf[SIZE]; int main(void) {  // initialize uring  struct io_uring_params params = { };  uring_fd = SYSCHK(syscall(__NR_io_uring_setup, /*entries=*/10, &amp;params));  unsigned char *sq_ring = SYSCHK(mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,  MAP_SHARED, uring_fd,  IORING_OFF_SQ_RING));  unsigned char *cq_ring = SYSCHK(mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,  MAP_SHARED, uring_fd,  IORING_OFF_CQ_RING));  struct io_uring_sqe *sqes = SYSCHK(mmap(NULL, 0x1000, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,  MAP_SHARED, uring_fd,  IORING_OFF_SQES)); io = malloc(sizeof(struct iovec)*1);  io[0].iov_base = _buf;  io[0].iov_len = SIZE; struct timespec ts = { .tv_sec = 1 };  sqes[0] = (struct io_uring_sqe) {  .opcode = IORING_OP_TIMEOUT,  //.flags = IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK,  .len = 1,  .addr = (unsigned long)&amp;ts  };  sqes[1] = (struct io_uring_sqe) {  .opcode = IORING_OP_READV,  .addr = io,  .flags = 0,  .len = 1,  .off = 0,  .fd = SYSCHK(open(&#34;/etc/passwd&#34;, O_RDONLY))  };  ((int*)(sq_ring + params.sq_off.array))[0] = 0;  ((int*)(sq_ring + params.sq_off.array))[1] = 1;  (*(int*)(sq_ring + params.sq_off.tail)) += 2; int submitted = SYSCHK(syscall(__NR_io_uring_enter, uring_fd,  /*to_submit=*/2, /*min_complete=*/0,  /*flags=*/0, /*sig=*/NULL, /*sigsz=*/0));  while(1){  usleep(100000);  if(*_buf){  puts(&#34;READV executed.&#34;);  break;  }  puts(&#34;Waiting.&#34;);  } }\n In this code, after performing the necessary setup for the operations  IORING_OP_TIMEOUT and  IORING_OP_READV, it starts execution and then checks every 0.1 seconds to see if  readv() is complete. It seems that  readv() will be completed after 1 second, considering that it is executed in the order of ring buffer. However, when I actually run it, the result was as follows.\n  That is, execution of  readv() was completed immediately. This is because, as I said earlier, it is  executed asynchronously as needed, but in this case an execution of  readv() can be completed immediately (because it is known that its execution does not stop). So subsequent operation was compeleted first ( IORING_OP_TIMEOUT was ignored for the time being). As a test, check that  readv() is executed synchronously (= in the handler of the system call) with the following systemtap[\u00b9] script.\n [\u00b9]: A tool that allows you to flexibly execute scripts, such as tracing Kernel (but not only) functions and outputting variables at the traced points. I love this tool because Kernel debugging is a hassle.\n  \u2193 This is the output when the previous program (name of the file is  sample) is executed while above systemtap script is being executed. If it is asynchronous, it is easy to imagine that the execution task is registered in some worker, but since it is executed synchronously here, the name of the executable file which called the system call is printed.\n   So where did  IORING_OP_TIMEOUT go? The answer is \u201c passed to the Kernel Thread because it was determined that asynchronous execution was needed\u201d. There are several criteria for this, and if they meet, they will be enqueued into the Queue for asynchronous execution. Here are some examples.\n  } else if (req-&gt;flags &amp; REQ_F_FORCE_ASYNC) {  ......  /*  * Never try inline submit of IOSQE_ASYNC is set, go straight  * to async execution.  */  req-&gt;work.flags |= IO_WQ_WORK_CONCURRENT;  io_queue_async_work(req);\n  2. Decisions by the logic prepared for each operation. (e.g. Add IOCB_NOWAIT flag when calling  readv() and return EAGAIN if execution is expected to stop)\n static int io_read(struct io_kiocb *req, struct io_kiocb **nxt,  bool force_nonblock) {  ......  ret = rw_verify_area(READ, req-&gt;file, &amp;kiocb-&gt;ki_pos, iov_count);  if (!ret) {  ssize_t ret2; if (req-&gt;file-&gt;f_op-&gt;read_iter)  ret2 = call_read_iter(req-&gt;file, kiocb, &amp;iter);  else  ret2 = loop_rw_iter(READ, req-&gt;file, kiocb, &amp;iter); /* Catch -EAGAIN return for forced non-blocking submission */  if (!force_nonblock || ret2 != -EAGAIN) {  kiocb_done(kiocb, ret2, nxt, req-&gt;in_async);  } else { copy_iov:  ret = io_setup_async_rw(req, io_size, iovec,  inline_vecs, &amp;iter);  if (ret)  goto out_free;  return -EAGAIN;  }  }  ...... }\n  When EAGAIN is returned, it is enqueued into the Queue for asynchronous execution (if it is a type of operation that uses file descriptors, it gets references to the  file structure here).\n static void __io_queue_sqe(struct io_kiocb *req, const struct io_uring_sqe *sqe) {  ...... ret = io_issue_sqe(req, sqe, &amp;nxt, true); /*  * We async punt it if the file wasn&#39;t marked NOWAIT, or if the file  * doesn&#39;t support non-blocking read/write attempts  */  if (ret == -EAGAIN &amp;&amp; (!(req-&gt;flags &amp; REQ_F_NOWAIT) ||  (req-&gt;flags &amp; REQ_F_MUST_PUNT))) { punt:  if (io_op_defs[req-&gt;opcode].file_table) {  ret = io_grab_files(req);  if (ret)  goto err;  } /*  * Queued up for async execution, worker will release  * submit reference when the iocb is actually submitted.  */  io_queue_async_work(req);  goto done_req;  }  ...... }\n  static int io_issue_sqe(struct io_kiocb *req, const struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,  struct io_kiocb **nxt, bool force_nonblock) {  struct io_ring_ctx *ctx = req-&gt;ctx;  int ret; switch (req-&gt;opcode) {  case IORING_OP_NOP:  ret = io_nop(req);  break;  case IORING_OP_READV:  case IORING_OP_READ_FIXED:  case IORING_OP_READ:  if (sqe) {  ret = io_read_prep(req, sqe, force_nonblock);  if (ret &lt; 0)  break;  }  ret = io_read(req, nxt, force_nonblock);  break;\n  3. When the  IOSQE_IO_LINK|IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK flag is used(the execution order is specified) and the operation whose execution order is earlier is determined to require asynchronous execution.\n (Connect as a link as described in the code below, execute in order, and if condition 2 is met in the middle, whole link will be enqueued into the asynchronous execution queue)\n static bool io_submit_sqe(struct io_kiocb *req, const struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,  struct io_submit_state *state, struct io_kiocb **link) {  ......  /*  * If we already have a head request, queue this one for async  * submittal once the head completes.

But (I think) it is easy to understand, so I use it as a sample. As shown below, by linking an operation that requires asynchronous execution ( IORING_OP_TIMEOUT) with another operation, you can see that the previous  IORING_OP_READV is certainly executed after waiting for 1 second.\n Add  IOSQE_IO_HARDLINK flag to the  IORING_OP_TIMEOUT operation in the sample code above to clarify that it is linked to the subsequent operation.\n    At this time, if you display the name of the process that is executing  io_read() in the same way as before, you will get the following output.\n  As you can see by looking at the process list, this is a Kernel Thread.\n $ ps aux | grep -A 2 -m 1 sample garyo 131388 0.0 0.0 2492 1412 pts/1 S+ 19:03 0:00 ./sample root 131389 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S 19:03 0:00 [io_wq_manager] root 131390 0.0 0.0 0 0 ? S 19:03 0:00 [io_wqe_worker-0]\n Hereafter, this Kernel Thread will be referred to as a \u201cworker\u201d. This worker is generated by the following code and then, dequeues and executes the asynchronous execution tasks from Queue.\n static bool create_io_worker(struct io_wq *wq, struct io_wqe *wqe, int index) {  ...... worker-&gt;task = kthread_create_on_node(io_wqe_worker, worker, wqe-&gt;node,  &#34;io_wqe_worker-%d/%d&#34;, index, wqe-&gt;node);  ...... }\n  Aside: As explained earlier,   IORING_OP_TIMEOUT  behaves slightly differently from the figure below, but it is described as such for simplicity. Strictly speaking, when   io_timeout()  is called, it sets   io_timeout_fn()  in the handler and starts the timer. After the time set by the timer has elapsed,   io_timeout_fn()  is called to load the operations connected to the link in the asynchronous execution queue. In other words,   IORING_OP_TIMEOUT  itself is not enqueued in the asynchronous execution queue. TIMEOUT is used in the explanation so that it is easy to imagine that execution will stop.\n   It was found out that asynchronous processing is performed by a worker running as a Kernel Thread. However, there is a precaution here. Since worker is runninng as a Kernel Thread, the execution context is different from the thread which calls io_uring related system calls. Here, the \u201cexecution context\u201d means the  task_struct structure associated with the process and various information associated with it. For example,  mm (Manage the virtual memory space of the process) ,  cred (holds UID/GID/Capability), files_struct (holds a table for file descriptors. There\u2019s an array of  file structure in  files_struct structure, and file descriptor is its index) and so on.\n Of course, if it doesn\u2019t refer to these structures in the thread that calls the system call, it may refer to the wrong virtual memory or file descriptor table, or issue I/O operations with Kernel Thread privileges (\u2252 root) [\u00b2].\n [\u00b2]: By the way, this was an actual vulnerability, and at that time it forgot to switch cred, and operations were able to be executed with root privileges. Although the operation equivalent to open  open() was not implemented at that time, it was possible to notify the privilege in sendmsg\u2019s SCM_CREDENTIALS option that notifies the sender\u2019s authority. It is a problem around D-Bus because the authority is confirmed by it.  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47779\n Therefore, in io_uring, those references are passed to the worker so that the worker shares the execution context by switching its own context before execution. For example, you can see that then references to  mm and  cred are passed to the  req-&gt;work in the following code.\n static inline void io_req_work_grab_env(struct io_kiocb *req,  const struct io_op_def *def) {  if (!req-&gt;work.mm &amp;&amp; def-&gt;needs_mm) {  mmgrab(current-&gt;mm);  req-&gt;work.mm = current-&gt;mm;  }  if (!req-&gt;work.creds)  req-&gt;work.creds = get_current_cred();  if (!req-&gt;work.fs &amp;&amp; def-&gt;needs_fs) {  spin_lock(&amp;current-&gt;fs-&gt;lock);  if (!current-&gt;fs-&gt;in_exec) {  req-&gt;work.fs = current-&gt;fs;  req-&gt;work.fs-&gt;users++;  } else {  req-&gt;work.flags |= IO_WQ_WORK_CANCEL;  }  spin_unlock(&amp;current-&gt;fs-&gt;lock);  }  if (!req-&gt;work.task_pid)  req-&gt;work.task_pid = task_pid_vnr(current); }\n  You can see that the reference to  files_struct is passed to the  req-&gt;work in the following code.\n static int io_grab_files(struct io_kiocb *req) {  ......  if (fcheck(ctx-&gt;ring_fd) == ctx-&gt;ring_file) {  list_add(&amp;req-&gt;inflight_entry, &amp;ctx-&gt;inflight_list);  req-&gt;flags |= REQ_F_INFLIGHT;  req-&gt;work.files = current-&gt;files;  ret = 0;  }  ...... }\n  Then, before execution, these are replaced with the contents of the worker\u2019s  current (a macro that gets the  task_struct currently running thread).\n static void io_worker_handle_work(struct io_worker *worker)  __releases(wqe-&gt;lock) {  struct io_wq_work *work, *old_work = NULL, *put_work = NULL;  struct io_wqe *wqe = worker-&gt;wqe;  struct io_wq *wq = wqe-&gt;wq; do {  ...... if (work-&gt;files &amp;&amp; current-&gt;files != work-&gt;files) {  task_lock(current);  current-&gt;files = work-&gt;files;  task_unlock(current);  }  if (work-&gt;fs &amp;&amp; current-&gt;fs != work-&gt;fs)  current-&gt;fs = work-&gt;fs;  if (work-&gt;mm != worker-&gt;mm)  io_wq_switch_mm(worker, work);  if (worker-&gt;cur_creds != work-&gt;creds)  io_wq_switch_creds(worker, work);  ......  work-&gt;func(&amp;work);  ......  } while (1); }\n  Now, let\u2019s move on to the explanation of the vulnerabilities. In the code below (I posted earlier), you can see that the worker is passing a reference to the  files_struct structure of the thread executing the system call to the structure that the worker will refer later  without incrementing the reference counter.\n static int io_grab_files(struct io_kiocb *req) {  ......  if (fcheck(ctx-&gt;ring_fd) == ctx-&gt;ring_file) {  list_add(&amp;req-&gt;inflight_entry, &amp;ctx-&gt;inflight_list);  req-&gt;flags |= REQ_F_INFLIGHT;  req-&gt;work.files = current-&gt;files;  ret = 0;  }  ...... }\n  By the way, as explained briefly earlier, when enqueueing a task in the Queue for asynchronous execution, the reference to the  file structure is retained first from the specified file descriptor (passed to the  io_kiocb structure).\n static int io_req_set_file(struct io_submit_state *state, struct io_kiocb *req,  const struct io_uring_sqe *sqe) {  struct io_ring_ctx *ctx = req-&gt;ctx;  unsigned flags;  int fd; flags = READ_ONCE(sqe-&gt;flags);  fd = READ_ONCE(sqe-&gt;fd); if (!io_req_needs_file(req, fd))  return 0; if (flags &amp; IOSQE_FIXED_FILE) {  if (unlikely(!ctx-&gt;file_data ||  (unsigned) fd &gt;= ctx-&gt;nr_user_files))  return -EBADF;  fd = array_index_nospec(fd, ctx-&gt;nr_user_files);  req-&gt;file = io_file_from_index(ctx, fd);  if (!req-&gt;file)  return -EBADF;  req-&gt;flags |= REQ_F_FIXED_FILE;  percpu_ref_get(&amp;ctx-&gt;file_data-&gt;refs);  } else {  if (req-&gt;needs_fixed_file)  return -EBADF;  trace_io_uring_file_get(ctx, fd);  req-&gt;file = io_file_get(state, fd);  if (unlikely(!req-&gt;file))  return -EBADF;  } return 0; }\n   So the worker does not have to retrieve it from the file descriptor again and does not need to refer to the  files_struct structure. If so, it seems that there is no problem that the reference counter of the  files_struct structure is not incremented(because it is not used).  But this assumption is not true in Linux Kernel 5.5 and later. This is because system calls that affect file descriptor tables, such as  open/ close/ accept , are now available via io_uring. Obviously, these system calls affect the file descriptor table, so it looks like something can be used for exploitation However,\n Even if you simply calls  open/ close/ accept etc., nothing can happen if the  files_struct structure is available.   \u2014 Of course, system calls have  countermeasures when handling the same file by multiple threads, so it is not possible to simply cause a race condition between the calling thread and the worker.\n By freeing the  files_struct with setting reference counter to 0, a new process may reuse it as a  files_struct for that process. The worker will get a reference to the new process\u2019s  files_struct when reused.  \u2014 But  file structure is already obtained from the file descriptor, \u0336s\u0336o\u0336 \u0336i\u0336t\u0336 \u0336c\u0336a\u0336n\u0336n\u0336o\u0336t\u0336 \u0336g\u0336e\u0336t\u0336 \u0336a\u0336 \u0336r\u0336e\u0336f\u0336e\u0336r\u0336e\u0336n\u0336c\u0336e\u0336 \u0336t\u0336o\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336f\u0336i\u0336l\u0336e\u0336 \u0336s\u0336t\u0336r\u0336u\u0336c\u0336t\u0336u\u0336r\u0336e\u0336 \u0336o\u0336f\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336n\u0336e\u0336w\u0336 \u0336p\u0336r\u0336o\u0336c\u0336e\u0336s\u0336s\u0336 (This was a lie. I\u2019ll describe in \u201caside\u201d part.)  \u2014 It\u2019s possible to insert a  file structure into the file descriptor table of a new process by opening a file. But it will not be referenced. (Because people don\u2019t use fixed file descriptor number while programming.)\n Here, I will explain the mechanism around the reference counter of the  file structure in  countermeasures when handling the same file by multiple threads. Yes, it\u2019s a spoiler. The conclusion will be that it can actually be abused.\n  To understand how the reference counters in the  file structure work, we first need to understand what open/close actually does. Of course, the behavior changes depending on the actual file to be opened, but the following can be said in common.\n    static struct file *__alloc_file(int flags, const struct cred *cred) {  struct file *f;  int error; f = kmem_cache_zalloc(filp_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);  ......  atomic_long_set(&amp;f-&gt;f_count, 1);  ......  return f; }\n   static long do_sys_openat2(int dfd, const char __user *filename,  struct open_how *how) {  ......  fd = get_unused_fd_flags(how-&gt;flags);  if (fd &gt;= 0) {  struct file *f = do_filp_open(dfd, tmp, &amp;op);  if (IS_ERR(f)) {  put_unused_fd(fd);  fd = PTR_ERR(f);  } else {  fsnotify_open(f);  fd_install(fd, f);  }  }  putname(tmp);  return fd; }\n     int __close_fd(struct files_struct *files, unsigned fd) {  struct file *file;  struct fdtable *fdt; spin_lock(&amp;files-&gt;file_lock);  fdt = files_fdtable(files);  if (fd &gt;= fdt-&gt;max_fds)  goto out_unlock;  file = fdt-&gt;fd[fd];  if (!file)  goto out_unlock;  rcu_assign_pointer(fdt-&gt;fd[fd], NULL);  __put_unused_fd(files, fd);  spin_unlock(&amp;files-&gt;file_lock);  return filp_close(file, files); out_unlock:  spin_unlock(&amp;files-&gt;file_lock);  return -EBADF; }\n     The important thing here is the  fget()/ fput() functio\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-22 03:20:22", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8ba1\u6570,privilege,io", "title": "CVE-2021-20226\u53c2\u8003\u8ba1\u6570\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u672c\u5730\u7279\u6743Escalati ", "title_en": "CVE-2021\u201320226 a reference counting bug which leads to local privilege escalati", "transed": 1, "url": "https://flattsecurity.medium.com/cve-2021-20226-a-reference-counting-bug-which-leads-to-local-privilege-escalation-in-io-uring-e946bd69177a", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8ba1\u6570", "privilege", "io"]}]
