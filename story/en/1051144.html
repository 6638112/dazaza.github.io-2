The Fire Phone was going to be Amazon’s arrival in the design world. The Kindle was a breakthrough e-book reader, sure. But it was too utilitarian to be an object of desire, the sort of budget device you’d expect from a budget retailer. Developing a premium smartphone could ascend Amazon to the rare air of Apple, transforming it into a company that could make covetable things. This was important to Jeff Bezos. As he said in  an early memo, he wanted Amazon to be like Apple or Nike, “loved” by customers and perceived as “cool.”</p><p>Jared Ficklin是一个杰出的设计公司的秘密团队的一部分，它通过帮助设计，从亚马逊，火手机开发一个流域设备。火手机将成为亚马逊抵达设计世界。 Kindle是一个突破性的电子书阅读器，当然。但它太实用是一种欲望的对象，这类预算零售商所期望的预算设备。开发优质智能手机可以将亚马逊提升到苹果的罕见空气中，将其转化为一个可以携带令人难以驾驶的东西的公司。这对杰夫贝斯来说很重要。正如他在早期的备忘录中所说，他希望亚马逊像客户一样像苹果或耐克一样“被爱”，被认为是“酷”。</p><p> “Risk taking is cool. Thinking big is cool. The unexpected is cool,” he wrote then.</p><p> “风险拍摄很酷。思考大很酷。意外很酷，“他写道。</p><p> Ficklin worked for months under clandestine conditions he had never experienced before: inside a faraday cage, or an electrified room, with walls that blocked wireless signals. This level of security ensured no wireless signals could go in or out to leak information on the product. Eight perfectly clean human bodies, working on laptops that were required to stay in that room over the course of months, eventually permeated the space with an unavoidable biological odor. When his team visited Amazon’s Seattle offices, they were banned from taking Ubers, which could theoretically be tracked, or even from entering the building through the same entrance, lest an eagle-eyed reporter notice.</p><p> Ficklin在秘密条件下工作了几个月，他以前从未经历过：在法拉第笼或电气化的房间内，带有阻挡无线信号的墙壁。这种安全级别确保无需无线信号即可进入或输出对产品的信息。八个完美清洁的人体，致力于在几个月内留在该房间所需的笔记本电脑上，最终渗透了这种空间，具有不可避免的生物气味。当他的团队访问亚马逊的西雅图办事处时，他们被禁止采取Ubers，理论上可以追踪，甚至通过同一入口进入建筑物，以免鹰眼报告者通知。</p><p> Ficklin was never in a meeting with Bezos himself, but he got feedback—notably that the screen needed to be 3D, and more 3D, with layers of graphics and animations that popped out from the screen. That was illogical to Ficklin and most other designers who were focused on user experience. After all, even a library stacks its books in clean, flat rows for a reason. But the team allocated tremendous amounts of the phone’s processing resources to triangulating the position of a user’s face to the screen, to create a parallax effect. It was an absurd investment for a single, superficial feature with no tangible user benefit.</p><p> Ficklin从未在与Bezos本人见面，但他有反馈 - 特别是屏幕需要3D，更多的3D，具有从屏幕弹出的图形和动画。这对Ficklin和大多数专注于用户体验的设计师来说是不合逻辑的。毕竟，即使是一个图书馆也堆叠在干净的平行中的书籍是有原因的。但是，团队分配了大量的电话处理资源，以将用户面部的位置三角划分给屏幕，以创建视差效果。这是一个荒谬的投资，对单身肤浅的功能，没有有形用户的利益。</p><p> “We started calling this the Jeff Phone; we felt we were basically making a phone for Jeff Bezos,” Ficklin says with a laugh. “We were slowly designing a phone for billionaire tech company owners. But at the time there were three of those, and two [Tim Cook and Bill Gates] already had their own phone. It was like, who is this phone being marketed to?”</p><p> “我们开始召唤这个杰夫手机;我们觉得我们基本上是杰夫贝斯的电话，“菲克林笑着说。 “我们正在慢慢设计一部亿万富翁科技公司所有者。但是当时有三个，而两个[蒂姆厨师和比尔盖茨]已经有自己的电话。这是谁，这款手机被销售到了吗？“</p><p>  The Fire Phone flopped, in large part due to Bezos’s strategic error in over-indexing on one “cool” feature. To this day, Amazon design is rarely mentioned in the same breath as beloved companies like Apple and Nike, or even fellow technological giants Google, Microsoft, and Samsung.</p><p>  由于在一个“酷”功能上的过度索引中的ezoS的战略错误，火力手机在很大程度上翻开。至今，亚马逊设计很少提到与Apple和Nike等心爱的公司相同的呼吸，甚至是谷歌，微软和三星等机械巨头。</p><p> The Fire Phone illustrated that while Bezos is an open-minded and often instinctual thinker—many designers tell us they genuinely enjoyed working with him—he didn’t turn Amazon into a company that puts design first and places value on the insights and skepticism of designers. That’s important, because design-led companies consistently  beat the industry standard, growing revenue faster and offering more returns to shareholders. In one study, design-led companies  outperformed the S&amp;P Index by 219% between 2004 and 2014. A major part of design’s value proposition is the process. Designers identify problems to create solutions.</p><p> 虽然Bezos是一种开放性的，而且往往是本能思想家 - 许多设计师告诉我们，他们真的很喜欢和他一起工作 - 他没有把亚马逊转变为一家设计的公司，并在洞察力和持洞中洞察力设计师。这很重要，因为设计领导的公司一直击败行业标准，更快地增长收入并提供更多的回报股东。在一项研究中，设计领导的公司在2004年至2014年间比赛率胜过了S＆amp; P指数在2004年至2014年间的219％。设计的价值主张的主要部分是过程。设计师确定创建解决方案的问题。 </p><p> Amazon, on the other hand, has often identified solutions before naming the problem. Sometimes that approach worked. But often, it didn’t.  And it created an ecosystem with a surprising number of hidden costs. “Amazon will never be a design-led company. It’s evident in the quality of the products they ship. And although the design is still thriving there, I don’t believe it’s fundamental to the core DNA of the company,” says a former Amazon designer who worked closely with Bezos on several products. “Just because there’s ‘customer obsession’ doesn’t mean there’s an investment in quality and design rigor.”</p><p>另一方面，亚马逊通常在命名问题之前经常识别解决方案。有时这种方法有效。但经常，它没有。它创建了一个具有令人惊讶的隐藏成本的生态系统。 “亚马逊永远不会成为设计领导的公司。它在他们发货的产品质量方面很明显。虽然设计仍在那里蓬勃发展，但我不相信这是公司核心DNA的基础，“前亚马逊设计师在几种产品上密切合作。 “只是因为”客户痴迷“并不意味着对质量和设计严谨的投资。”</p><p>   Bezos’s design philosophy mirrors his broader approach to business, mixing outsize ambition with an obsessive focus on customer experience. His work on Amazon’s logo is indicative of how his own instincts in this process could be invaluable—a logo that is a bright point for the company, adorning every box Amazon ships with a smile, to this day.</p><p>   Bezos的设计哲学反映了他更广泛的业务方法，并使雄心为雄心壮志，对客户体验造成了强烈的关注。他对亚马逊的徽标的工作表明，他在这个过程中的本能如何是无价的 - 这是公司的一个令人尖锐的徽标，在这一天笑着装饰每个盒子亚马逊船只。</p><p> In 1999, Joanne Chan and David Turner of the brand identity firm Turner Duckworth sat down with Bezos to talk about redesigning Amazon’s logo. At least a dozen executives flanked the CEO around a large conference table. Bezos sat in the middle on one side, and Chan and Turner sat in the middle on the other side.</p><p> 1999年，乔安妮陈和品牌识别公司特纳的大卫特纳德沃思与贝佐斯坐下来谈论重新设计亚马逊的标志。至少有十几位高管在一个大型会议桌周围侧翼了首席执行官。贝佐斯在一边坐在中间，陈和特纳在另一侧坐在中间。</p><p>  Amazon’s logo at the time was like most internet logos in the late ’90s. It read out the full “amazon.com” for a culture still mastering web browsers, with a frowning orange swoosh beneath the word. Amazon was still known for selling books, and it was soon to get into the business of selling CDs. But Bezos took this moment to explain, firsthand and under a nondisclosure agreement, where he planned to take the company next.</p><p>  亚马逊当时的标志就像是90年代后期的大多数互联网标识。它为仍然掌握了Web浏览器的文化读出完整的“Amazon.com”，在这个词下面有一个皱眉的橙色旋转。亚马逊仍然为销售书而闻名，很快就会进入销售CD的业务。但Bezos花了这一刻来解释，第一手和在一个非歧视协议下，他计划接下来参加公司。</p><p> “We were told Amazon is eventually going to sell everything under the sun. He maybe didn’t use those exact words, but he said, ‘What I want to communicate [with the logo] is my company is going to be a retailer for everything,’ ” Chan says. “We were like, ‘Okay, right. What’s the most outlandish thing you think you’d ever sell?’ Because when clients talk about big goals, we press them.</p><p> “我们被告知亚马逊最终会卖掉太阳下的一切。他也许没有使用这些确切的话语，但他说，“我想用徽标沟通的东西是我公司将成为一切的零售商，”“陈说。 “我们就像，'好吧，对。你认为你曾经卖过的最古怪的事情是什么？“因为客户谈论大目标，我们按下它们。</p><p> “And I think he said ‘patio furniture.’ David Turner and I looked at each other like,  Yeah right! They’ll never be able to sell furniture online!”</p><p> “我认为他说'露台家具。'David Turner和我互相看着，是的，是的！他们永远无法在线销售家具！“</p><p> While unbelievable, Bezos’s brief was clear. First, don’t frame Amazon as a company that just sells books, because it will sell everything. Second, communicate that customer service is of paramount importance.</p><p> 虽然令人难以置信，但Bezos的简短明确了。首先，不要将亚马逊置于刚刚出售书籍的公司，因为它会销售一切。其次，传达客户服务至关重要。 </p><p> Several weeks later, Chan and Turner returned with a few options, and the first idea they presented was Bezos’s favorite. You’d recognize it because it’s still the logo that Amazon uses today. It reads “Amazon” with an orange smiling arrow beneath the word, the arrow pointing from the  a to the  z in the logo, implying that Amazon would sell everything from a to z. The smile symbol, the design team pointed out, could one day function without the word  Amazon at all.</p><p>几个星期后，陈和特纳用几个选项回来了，他们呈现的第一个想法是贝塞斯的最爱。你会认出它，因为它仍然是亚马逊今天使用的标志。它读取“亚马逊”，用这个词下方的橙色微笑箭头，箭头从A到徽标中的z指向的箭头，这意味着亚马逊将从A到Z销售所有内容。设计团队指出的微笑符号，可以在没有亚马逊这个词的一天功能。</p><p>  “[Bezos] was just beaming, really just beaming—delighted—expressing how much he loved it,” Chan says. “He banged his hand on the table and said, ‘This is it.’ He got up to leave. His SVP said, ‘Hold up, don’t we want to research this?’ He laughed his booming, booming laugh and said, ‘Anyone who doesn’t like this logo won’t like puppies.’ And he walked out.”</p><p>  “贝佐尔]只是发光，真的只是欣赏喜悦，表达他喜欢它，”陈说。 “他把手撞在桌子上说，”这就是它。“他起身离开了。他的SVP说，'坚持下去，我们不想研究这个吗？“他笑了他的蓬勃发展，蓬勃发展，说'任何不喜欢这个徽标的人都不会喜欢小狗。”他走了出去。“</p><p> Bezos gave more specific feedback on the logo later, but the tweaks were small, and Chan says he trusted the team to be the experts in the process. The only strong pushback from Bezos was regarding some two-color stationery that Turner Duckworth proposed for Amazon’s internal use, which featured the Amazon logo in black and orange.</p><p> Bezos稍后在徽标上给出了更具体的反馈，但调整很小，陈说他认为该团队成为该过程中的专家。 Bezos唯一强大的推动力是关于Turner Duckworth提出为亚马逊的内部使用的Turner Duckworth的一些双色文具，它以黑色和橙色为特色的亚马逊标志。</p><p> “He said, ‘Where does my customer benefit from doing two-color stationery? Let’s just do one-color stationery,’ ” Chan recalls. “That’s how laser-focused he was. He wanted everything to go back to customer satisfaction.”</p><p> “他说，'我的客户在哪里受益于双色文具？让我们做一个色彩的文具，'“陈召回。 “这就是激光的重点是如何。他希望一切都追溯到客户满意度。“</p><p>   Amazon’s name is now synonymous with many of its physical products, like the several generations of Echo and Fire TV. But in 2004, when Amazon began development on the Kindle, it had never made hardware before—and the Kindle project offered Bezos an opportunity to learn how. The project showcased a balance of Bezos’s own hubris and humility, as the original Kindle was both humble and grandiose at the same time.</p><p>   亚马逊的名称现在是许多物理产品的代名词，就像几代回声和火电视一样。但是在2004年，当亚马逊开始在Kindle上开始发展时，它从未在Kindle项目之前制造硬件，并且为ezzos提供了学习方式的机会。该项目展示了Bezos自己的哈布里斯和谦卑的平衡，因为原来的Kindle同时既有卑微和宏伟。</p><p> Amazon’s products are born inside the company’s secretive Lab126 group. Lab126 has 3,000 employees by current estimates, making it one of the largest internal design groups in the world. (Amazon declined to comment for this piece or confirm the lab’s head count.)</p><p> 亚马逊的产品诞生于公司的秘密Lab126集团内。 Lab126通过当前估计有3,000名员工，使其成为世界上最大的内部设计群体之一。 （亚马逊拒绝评论这件作品或确认实验室的头部计数。）</p><p>  In 2004, Lab126 founder Gregg Zehr, a former Apple engineer and Palm executive, was building his team from scratch. So he tapped Robert Brunner, the former director of industrial design at Apple who was then a partner at Pentagram, to serve as an external consultant on the project. (Brunner would later go on to found the lauded design firm Ammunition, which created products ranging from Beats by Dre to Ember coffee mugs.) “Jeff was really very hands on on this project,” Brunner recalls. “He was having a good time, I think.”</p><p>  2004年，Lab126创始人Gregg Zehr是一位前苹果工程师和棕榈阶，正在从头开始建造他的团队。因此，他在Pentagram的合作伙伴那时是苹果公司的前任工业设计主任罗伯特布伦纳击中了罗伯特布伦纳，以担任该项目的外部顾问。 （布伦纳稍后会继续发现赞扬的设计公司弹药，它创造了由Dre到Ember Coffee Mugs的节拍的产品。）“杰夫真的非常掌握在这个项目上，”布伦纳召回。 “我觉得他度过了愉快的时光。” </p><p> Over the course of two years of development, Brunner and his team met with Bezos roughly a dozen times. “Clearly, he wanted to not only drive the product, but also learn, and learn about the product development process and how it worked,” Brunner says. “In reality, he probably saw this future where they’d be creating all sorts of devices to access [Amazon] services.” Indeed, Bezos spent 10 hours a week taking Kindle meetings, obsessing over details down to the creation of Amazon’s own typeface, Bookerly.</p><p>在两年的发展过程中，布伦纳和他的团队大约会见了十几次。 “显然，他希望不仅可以推动产品，还要学习，并了解产品开发过程以及如何运作，”布伦纳说。 “实际上，他可能看到了这个未来，他们在那里他们正在创建各种各样的设备来访问[亚马逊]服务。”事实上，Bezos每周花10小时拍摄Kindle会议，痴迷于亚马逊自己的字体，书记的细节。</p><p> “I can remember spending hundreds of hours talking [with Bezos] about the front of the Kindle, tens of hours on packaging, and what the UX would be when you unboxed the device. I can remember spending probably hundreds of hours on the leather cases,” says Mark Randall, a former VP of supply chain at Amazon who worked tightly with the industrial design team. “The inside of the leather case was made of microfiber, and he’d be rubbing it, kneading it, literally making sure it was absolutely perfect before it shipped. He was just incredibly [detail-oriented].”</p><p> “我可以记住花费数百小时的[用贝罗斯]关于Kindle的前面，包装上的几十个小时，以及UX当你拆箱设备时的内容。我可以记住花费数百小时的皮革案件，“亚马逊的供应链前VP副总裁Mark Randall说，与工业设计团队紧紧奏效。 “皮革盒的内部由超细纤维制成，他会揉搓它，揉捏它，从而确保它在它发货之前绝对完美。他只是令人难以置信的[细节导向]。“</p><p> Some decisions were made early, like that the Kindle would have an e-ink screen, because it would be legible under sunlight, just like real paper. Other topics were larger debates.</p><p> 早期做出一些决定，就像Kindle会有一个电子墨水屏幕，因为它在阳光下可以清晰，就像真正的论文一样。其他主题是更大的辩论。</p><p> Bezos was firm that he wanted the device to have a keyboard, instead of being a sleeker device that was mostly a screen. “We as designers were not in favor of the upfront keyboard. . . . Having a QWERTY keyboard didn’t feel like a reading device. Obviously, Jeff won that argument,” Brunner says with a laugh. “And if you think that at the time one of the most successful devices of that era was the Blackberry. It was ubiquitous across any executive. Jeff had his Blackberry and thought the keyboard was really well executed.”</p><p> Bezos坚持不懈地，他希望该设备拥有键盘，而不是作为一个主要是一个屏幕的时尚设备。 “我们作为设计师并不赞成前期键盘。 。 。 。有一个QWERTY键盘感觉不像阅读设备。显然，杰夫赢得了这个论点，“布鲁纳斯笑着说。 “如果你认为当时这个时代最成功的设备之一是黑莓。在任何高管中都无处不在。杰夫有他的黑莓手机，并认为键盘真的很好地执行。“</p><p>  Bezos believed the keyboard was essential for search, a key consumer behavior on Amazon that he was certain would translate directly to the device. And because other emerging touch technologies the team tried, like force and capacitive resistance, were too underdeveloped, Brunner ultimately agreed that Bezos made the right call because he kept the needs of the user in mind.</p><p>  Bezos认为键盘对搜索至关重要，亚马逊的关键消费者行为，他确定他一定会直接转换为设备。而且由于其他新兴触摸技术团队尝试了，如力量和电容性抵抗，太欠发达，布伦纳最终同意贝佐斯致电，因为他记住了用户的需求。</p><p> The other big decision was how books could be downloaded to the device. The Kindle had Wi-Fi, but a cellular modem would make the Kindle a completely untethered, connected device that could download books anywhere. The question was, who would pay for a wireless subscription for their e-book reader?</p><p> 另一个大决定是如何将书籍下载到设备。 Kindle有Wi-Fi，但蜂窝调制解调器将使Kindle成为可以在任何地方下载书籍的完全无法阻止的连接设备。问题是，谁将为其电子书阅读器支付无线订阅？</p><p> “I remember this meeting where Jeff said, ‘You know, I want to bury the wireless cost in the cost of the book,’ ” Brunner says. “He figured out in his spare time the cost of delivering a paper book versus an e-book was relatively similar, so let’s just put it in there as part of the cost of the book.”</p><p> “我记得这次会议在杰夫说，”你知道，我想把无线成本埋入这本书的成本，“”布伦纳说。 “他在业余时间讨论了提供纸质书与电子书的成本相对相似，因此让我们把它放在那里，作为这本书的成本的一部分。” </p><p> Examine the industrial design of the original Kindle today and  it’s a wild object that time has largely forgotten. Its design is asymmetrical, with the right edge of the device faceted off to grip with your right hand. Below the screen lives a big keyboard. Beside the screen is a scroll wheel and a tiny mirror slider to show your position on a page. The back of the device is covered in hieroglyphics.</p><p>仔细检查原始Kindle的工业设计，这是一个狂野的对象，时间在很大程度上被遗忘了。其设计是不对称的，装置的右边缘刻上握住右手。屏幕下面生活了一个大键盘。屏幕旁边是滚轮和一个微小的镜子滑块，以显示您在页面上的位置。设备的背面被象形文字覆盖。</p><p> “There was this hyperbolic idea that this was a new Rosetta Stone,” says Symon Whitehorn, who worked alongside Brunner on the design, unsure if that brash overconfidence was born from Bezos or another executive.</p><p> “这是一个新的思想思想，这是一个新的Rosetta Stone，”Symon Whitehorn说，在设计的布伦纳一起工作，不确定如果狂热过度自由于Bezos或其他执行官，则不确定。</p><p>  But as maximalist as the Kindle looks, its functionality was pared back for ease of use. Bezos resisted the urging of many within Amazon to turn the Kindle into a PDF-editing productivity machine, and backed Pentagram’s cleaner, three-piece approach to the UI: the store, your library, and the reading space. This UI paradigm still defines the Kindle today. “Nobody is too good; everybody is good enough. It has that sort of feel to it,” Brunner says. “Jeff was like that in the beginning. He just wanted to make sure people had access.”</p><p>  但作为当Kindle看起来的最大值主义者，它的功能是为了易于使用而折叠。 Bezos抵制了亚马逊中许多人的推动，将Kindle转换为PDF编辑的生产力机器，并支持五角星的清洁剂，三件套方法到UI：商店，图书馆和阅读空间。这个UI范例仍然定义了今天的Kindle。 “没有人太好;每个人都足够好。布伦纳说，它有这种感觉。 “杰夫在开始时就像那样。他只是想确保人们有了访问。“</p><p> As for its name, “Kindle,” that wasn’t invented by accident, but by the thoughtful work of Karin Hibma and her late husband, Michael Patrick Cronan, who specialized in naming products like the Apple’s Lisa computer and the TiVo box. (Hibma also named this website, Co.Design.)</p><p> 至于它的名字，“Kindle，”不是由意外发明的，而是由卡林·赫布马的周到的工作和她长期的丈夫，迈克尔·帕特里克克隆南，他们专注于苹果公司的丽莎电脑和Tivo盒等驯服产品。 （HIBMA也命名为此网站，有限公司。）</p><p> “[Bezos], at one point, made a comment that he wanted to do something that would not be braggadocious, but small and humble, about starting something,” Hibma says.  Kindle was already a word that Hibma and Cronan had flagged in early explorations. No wonder it was also the word that Bezos ended up choosing: It was the perfect word for the start of something larger at Amazon.</p><p> “贝佐尔]，一点，发表评论，他想做一些不会吹嘘的东西，而是小而谦虚，关于开始一些东西，”哈马说。 Kindle已经是哈马和克罗尼亚在早期探索中被标记的一句话。难怪这也是贝塞斯最终选择的词：这是在亚马逊开始更大的完美词。</p><p>  Bezos’s obsession with customers didn’t always lend itself to a fruitful design process. A failed collaboration with Motorola is a case in point.</p><p>  Bezos对顾客的痴迷并不总是借出富有成效的设计过程。与摩托罗拉的合作失败是一个案例。</p><p> Bezos famously began product work by having his employees write press releases about a new product or feature before it even entered development. It’s a way of backing into product development but ending somewhere that would hopefully ensure consumer interest and satisfaction. This is not how most product development works at major design studios, which identify a problem first and experiment with solutions second.</p><p> Bezos通过在进入开发之前，在甚至进入开发之前，他的员工写下新产品或功能的员工撰写新产品或功能，开始了产品工作。这是一种支持产品开发的一种方式，但结束希望确保消费者兴趣和满足的地方。这并不是大多数产品开发在主要设计工作室的工作原理，它首先识别一个问题并在第二个解决方案的实验。 </p><p>  In eschewing conventional product design, Bezos’s approach made products that were functional, and even future-forward. But they were rarely covetable, and they were sometimes downright silly. Great design is born from a discernible need, as demonstrated by products  as low tech as the OXO vegetable peeler. An insight (that peelers are hard to hold) became a unique design (a peeler with a big handle like a bicycle’s) that subsequently became iconic and covetable (the peeler both worked well and looked like no other peeler on the planet).</p><p>在避免传统的产品设计方面，Bezos的方法使产品具有功能性，甚至未来的产品。但他们很少难以驾驭，他们有时是彻头彻尾的愚蠢。伟大的设计诞生于可辨别的需求，如产品所示，作为低技术作为Oxo蔬菜削皮器。洞察力（削皮器很难抓住）成为一种独特的设计（一个削皮器，带有一个像自行车一样的削皮器），随后成为标志性和难以录制的（削皮器两者都良好工作，看起来像地球上没有其他削皮器）。</p><p> When Amazon was considering developing its own smartphone in the 2010s, before the Fire Phone was born, the company invited Motorola to discuss a potential collaboration. It’s easy to forget today, but Motorola was a powerhouse in phone design during that era. It dominated the aughts with the Razr. Before the iPhone, Apple tapped Motorola for a doomed collaboration on the Rokr. The phone, first planned to hold more than 1,000 songs and integrate seamlessly with iTunes just like an iPod, was designed with the expensive storage to do so, before Apple downgraded the number of songs to 100—seemingly sabotaging the launch. Motorola was understandably nervous to partner with a giant like Amazon following the Apple disaster. (Apple did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p> 当亚马逊正在考虑在2010年代开发自己的智能手机时，在火手机出生之前，该公司邀请摩托罗拉讨论潜在的合作。今天很容易忘记，但摩托罗拉在那个时代期间是电话设计中的省电。它占据了razr的一个。在iPhone之前，Apple在Rokr上击败了摩托罗拉为注定注定的协作。手机，首先计划持有超过1,000首歌曲并与iTunes无缝集成，就像iPod一样，设计有昂贵的存储，在Apple将歌曲降至100似乎破坏发射之前。在Apple灾难之后，摩托罗拉对与亚马逊的巨头合作，可理解地紧张。 （Apple没有回复评论请求。）</p><p> Jim Wicks, then SVP of consumer experience design at Motorola Mobility, remembers meeting with Amazon skeptically—even though, in retrospect, it could have been a watershed for both companies. “[Bezos] was in the one . . . iconic meeting. And he would absolutely have no memory of it,” Wicks says. “But you could tell. You know how someone is in a meeting and there’s a dissonance, a mismatch? And it could even be that it’s not the content and idea. It’s the processing through this in a way that’s different than the way I usually like to process things.”</p><p> Jim Wicks，然后在摩托罗拉流动性的消费者体验设计的SVP，记得与亚马逊的会面持怀疑态度 - 即使在回想起来，这可能是两家公司的分水岭。 “贝佐尔”在那里。 。 。标志性会议。他绝对不会记住它，“威克斯说。 “但你可以说。你知道有人在会议中，有一个不和谐，不匹配吗？它甚至可能不是内容和想法。这是通过与我通常喜欢处理事物的方式不同的方式来处理。“</p><p> Looking back, Wicks realizes that Motorola’s traditional approach probably didn’t resonate with Bezos or the larger Amazon team, who operated less on product romance than practicality. “Our culture was so driven by the touchy-feely, the product, the story, and that’s how we did great things,” Wicks says. “[Products] were thoughtful strategies, but there was also this strong emotional push for what you believe.

Perhaps Motorola could have been the ticket to making the Fire Phone great. In any case, Wicks insists that he didn’t think any less of Amazon or Bezos because of the experience. “Sometimes we might think that Amazon is not creative or human-centered or consumer focused,” he says. “But boy, they do obsess about who they identify as consumers. Their methods externally just don’t feel as sexy sometimes.”</p><p>  也许摩托罗拉避免了与火手机的另一个灾难性伙伴关系。也许摩托罗拉可能是制造火手机的票。无论如何，威克斯坚持认为，由于经验，他并没有想到任何亚马逊或贝多斯。 “有时我们可能认为亚马逊不是创造性的或以人为本的或消费者聚焦，”他说。 “但是男孩，他们对他们认为是消费者的人都痴迷。他们的方法在外部只是不有时候性感。“</p><p> The Fire Phone debuted and disappeared between July 2014 and August 2015. There are several reasons it failed. The phone premiered for $650, which priced it toe-to-toe with the polished iPhone. In prioritizing a novel UI over functionality, it launched without mainstay apps like Starbucks and Google Maps. So Amazon dropped the price by hundreds of dollars, and then offered it for just 99¢ with an AT&amp;T contract. “The tech press had a field day when the Fire Phone came out,” recalls Randall, the former VP of supply chain at Amazon. “Jeff was like, ‘Eh, that wasn’t successful. We go again.’ Stuff like that doesn’t faze him in the slightest.”</p><p> 在2014年7月至2015年7月至2015年8月期间，消防手机失望并消失了。失败了几个原因。通过650美元的手机，用抛光的iPhone定价它脚趾脚趾。在优先考虑新型UI过度功能时，它没有像星巴克和谷歌地图这样的MainStay应用程序就会启动。因此，亚马逊将价格降低了数百美元，然后在AT＆amp的合同提供了99¢。 “科技出版社有一个野外的火车出来的场所，”亚马逊供应链的前副总裁Randall回忆起兰德尔。 “杰夫就像，'呃，那没有成功。我们再次走了。“这样的东西就像最轻微的那样让他感到困惑。” </p><p> It helped that the Fire Phone didn’t need to succeed. Amazon is not Apple. Its devices, usually priced on a budget, have never needed to make oodles of money on their own. Rather, they are physical bridges to Amazon’s various digital services—and, most important, its gargantuan retail store. The Fire Phone had a dedicated button so you could scan a product to find it on Amazon. But that function was myopic compared to the wider world of possibilities Apple offered with its rich App Store. Bezos wanted to sell an object that was as “cool” as Apple’s products with a price to match, but didn’t offer the functionality to get there.</p><p>它有助于防火手机不需要成功。亚马逊不是苹果。它的设备通常在预算上定价，从未以为自己制作过obles。相反，它们是亚马逊各种数字服务的物理桥梁 - 而且最重要的是它的宗园零售商店。火手机有一个专用按钮，因此您可以扫描产品以在亚马逊上找到它。但是，与苹果公司提供了丰富的App Store的更广泛的可能性，该功能是近视。 Bezos希望出售作为苹果产品的“酷”的物体，以匹配的价格，但没有提供到达那里的功能。</p><p> Still, it was a bold move. Amazon was not a consistently profitable company into the early 2010s; the company didn’t explode with revenue  until 2017. And yet, even as Amazon was losing money in much of its digital retail business, it continued to invest in Lab126, where it only lost more money.</p><p> 不过，这是一个大胆的举动。亚马逊并不是一家始终如一的有利可图的公司进入2010年初;该公司直到2017年直到2017年并没有爆炸。然而，即使亚马逊在其数字零售业务中亏损的大部分资金，它也在继续投资Lab126，其中它只失去了更多的资金。</p><p> “Investing as hard in Lab126 as large as he did when the company wasn’t making money was a ballsy move,” says Randall, alluding all the way back to the Kindle days. “I was at many strategic executive meetings. . . . Even when [Bezos] was challenged by others, he was adamant, ‘I’m going to do this.’ He said, ‘The hardware business is hard. It’s going to take a long time. We’d better start now, double down.’ ” While the Fire Phone didn’t work out, it did seem to teach Bezos where his competitive strengths were: fast, cheap, and capable design.</p><p> “当公司没有赚钱时，在Lab126中投入艰难的是，当公司没有赚钱是一个大战的举动，”兰德尔说，一路暗指回到Kindle日子。 “我是许多战略执行会议。 。 。 。即使[Bezos]被其他人挑战，他也是坚定的，“我要这样做。”他说，'硬件业务很难。这需要很长时间。我们现在最好开始加倍。“”当火手机没有锻炼时，它似乎教导了他的竞争优势：快速，便宜，设计的设计。</p><p>  The Fire Phone was quickly followed by the Echo. Where the quirky, 3D Fire Phone flopped, the Echo—which was arguably the first device to make spoken interface mainstream—became a hit. It’s an excellent example of how Bezos was sometimes able to start with that press release vision and turn it into a product that people would buy, especially with enough time for revision.</p><p>  火手机很快跟回来。在古怪的，3D火警翻转的地方，回声可以说是一个制作界面主流的第一个设备 - 变得击中。这是一个很好的例子，谁有时能够从那个新闻发布愿景开始，并将其转化为人们会购买的产品，特别是有足够的时间进行修改。</p><p> At the heart of Amazon’s innovation culture lives the Japanese concept of   kaizen (or what’s often translated as “continuous improvement”). You can see the value of kaizen in Amazon’s shipping speeds from a few days, to two-day, to one-day, to same-day.
