"note_en": "This is the story of a man whose ideas could have saved a lot of lives and spared countless numbers of women and newborns&#39; feverish and agonizing deaths.\n    The year was 1846, and our would-be hero was a Hungarian doctor named  Ignaz Semmelweis.\n  Semmelweis was a man of his time, according to  Justin Lessler, an assistant professor at  Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n    It was a time Lessler describes as &#34;the start of the golden age of the physician scientist,&#34; when physicians were expected to have scientific training.\n  So doctors like Semmelweis were no longer thinking of illness as an imbalance caused by bad air or evil spirits. They looked instead to anatomy. Autopsies became more common, and doctors got interested in numbers and collecting data.\n  The young Dr. Semmelweis was no exception. When he showed up for his new job in the maternity clinic at the General Hospital in Vienna, he started collecting some data of his own. Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many women in maternity wards were dying from  puerperal fever \u2014 commonly known as childbed fever.\n  He studied two maternity wards in the hospital. One was staffed by all male doctors and medical students, and the other was staffed by female midwives. And he counted the number of deaths on each ward.\n  When Semmelweis crunched the numbers, he discovered that women in the clinic staffed by doctors and medical students died at a rate nearly five times higher than women in the midwives&#39; clinic.\n            In the midwives&#39; clinic, women gave birth on their sides. In the doctors&#39; clinic, women gave birth on their backs. So he had women in the doctors&#39; clinic give birth on their sides. The result, Lessler says, was &#34;no effect.&#34;\n  Then Semmelweis noticed that whenever someone on the ward died of childbed fever, a priest would walk slowly through the doctors&#39; clinic, past the women&#39;s beds with an attendant ringing a bell. This time Semmelweis theorized that the priest and the bell ringing so terrified the women after birth that they developed a fever, got sick and died.\n     So Semmelweis had the priest change his route and ditch the bell. Lessler says, &#34;It had no effect.&#34;\n  By now, Semmelweis was frustrated. He took a leave from his hospital duties and traveled to Venice. He hoped the break and a good dose of art would clear his head.\n  When Semmelweis got back to the hospital, some sad but important news was waiting for him. One of his colleagues, a pathologist, had fallen ill and died. It was a common occurrence, according to  Jacalyn Duffin, who teaches the history of medicine at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston, Ontario.\n     &#34;This often happened to the pathologists,&#34; Duffin says. &#34;There was nothing new about the way he died. He pricked his finger while doing an autopsy on someone who had died from childbed fever.&#34; And then he got very sick himself and died.\n  Semmelweis studied the pathologist&#39;s symptoms and realized the pathologist died from the same thing as the women he had autopsied. This was a revelation: Childbed fever wasn&#39;t something only women in childbirth got sick from. It was something other people in the hospital could get sick from as well.\n  But it still didn&#39;t answer Semmelweis&#39; original question: &#34;Why were more women dying from childbed fever in the doctors&#39; clinic than in the midwives&#39; clinic?&#34;\n    &#34;The big difference between the doctors&#39; ward and the midwives&#39; ward is that the doctors were doing autopsies and the midwives weren&#39;t,&#34; she says.\n  So Semmelweis hypothesized that there were cadaverous particles, little pieces of corpse, that students were getting on their hands from the cadavers they dissected. And when they delivered the babies, these particles would get inside the women who would develop the disease and die.\n     If Semmelweis&#39; hypothesis was correct, getting rid of those cadaverous particles should cut down on the death rate from childbed fever.\n  So he ordered his medical staff to start cleaning their hands and instruments not just with soap but with a chlorine solution. Chlorine, as we know today, is about the best disinfectant there is. Semmelweis didn&#39;t know anything about germs. He chose the chlorine because he thought it would be the best way to get rid of any smell left behind by those little bits of corpse.\n       What Semmelweis had discovered is something that still holds true today: Hand-washing is one of the most important tools in public health. It can keep kids from getting the flu, prevent the spread of disease and keep infections at bay.\n  You&#39;d think everyone would be thrilled. Semmelweis had solved the problem! But they weren&#39;t thrilled.\n  For one thing, doctors were upset because Semmelweis&#39; hypothesis made it look like they were the ones giving childbed fever to the women.\n  And Semmelweis was not very tactful. He publicly berated people who disagreed with him and made some influential enemies.\n  Eventually the doctors gave up the chlorine hand-washing, and Semmelweis \u2014 he lost his job.\n     Semmelweis kept trying to convince doctors in other parts of Europe to wash with chlorine, but no one would listen to him.\n  Even today, convincing health care providers to take hand-washing seriously is a challenge. Hundreds of thousands of hospital patients get infections each year, infections that can be deadly and hard to treat. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says  hand hygiene is one of the most important ways to prevent these infections.\n  Over the years, Semmelweis got angrier and eventually even strange. There&#39;s been speculation he developed a mental condition brought on by possibly syphilis or even Alzheimer&#39;s. And in 1865, when he was only 47 years old, Ignaz Semmelweis was committed to a mental asylum.\n  The sad end to the story is that Semmelweis was probably beaten in the asylum and eventually died of  sepsis, a potentially fatal complication of an infection in the bloodstream \u2014 basically, it&#39;s the same disease Semmelweis fought so hard to prevent in those women who died from childbed fever.", "posttime": "2020-07-12 00:00:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u751f\u547d,championed,\u533b\u751f", "title":

"note_en": "If you are having difficulty discovering your purpose in life, start by defining your favorite problems.\n We often feel lost in life when we lack purpose. Traditionally, we have been trained to rely on our ideas, our passions, and our skills to find direction. While this puts us on track to find  something, this mindset is horrendously inadequate and inefficient in discovering purpose.\n We all have ideas. We all have a purpose. Some of us lack the former and most of us lack the latter. In either case, we must work  systematically to discover these and form a cohesive connection between the two. And by systematically, I mean implementing a set of selective filters that will take us from  idea to  purpose with precision and effectiveness.\n   Most ideas are just plain bad. Some are good. And very few are great. Your objective is to find those great ideas which serve your life\u2019s purpose. An effective way to approach this is to first  define your favorite problems. You might think it\u2019s an odd way of referring to your problems. But this filter is absolutely critical to the process.\n Here is Richard Feynman, a Nobel-Prize winning physicist, describing it in his typical playful and observational style:\n \u201cYou have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while, there will be a hit, and people will say, \u2018How did he do it? He must be a genius!\u201d\n Think of your favorite problems as a set of receptors. They take in information, sort it into relevant applications, and allow you to apply your ideas in a much more focused way to achieve your purpose.\n But this alone is not sufficient. What good is your \u201cfavorite problems\u201d filter if you are throwing any and every idea at it like a blindfolded dart-thrower? Therein lies the need for a preceding filter: asking better questions.\n A set of specific and useful questions is the filter through which you will examine your ideas. You may not be actively thinking about the questions you are asking on a day-to-day basis, but every action you take, every decision you make, and every cake you bake (sorry, I had to\u2026) is in some form generated by a question.\n When you combine the two filters of  questions and  problems, you will have a robust vetting system in place for your ideas.\n   When a restaurant manager envisions building an efficient and seamless operation, she must begin by identifying the problems that will prevent her from achieving it.\n She has many  ideas on how it can be achieved, so she begins to ask  questions that define her  problems.\n One of her problems might be in hiring, so she asks herself \u201chow can I construct a reliable and repeatable hiring process that is effective in identifying the best candidate?\u201d\n She vets her ideas through the questions she asks. The questions inform the problem. And through acute awareness of the problem, she is able to achieve her  purpose.\n   You have an  idea to go on Indeed and apply for the highest paying job you can find. Conventional wisdom applauds this approach. You\u2019re beginning to see why it\u2019s all wrong.\n By implementing your filters, you start to ask  questions like: \u201chow can I develop an income stream that will allow me to achieve financial freedom in 5-10 years?\u201d (Remember: specific and useful)\n By asking the right question relative to your purpose, you identify the  problem in achieving your goal of financial freedom:  Indeed is useful for stacking the odds against you for jobs with a finite yearly salary. Hardly the most effective way to reach your goal.\n Due to your effective filters, you save yourself the headache of implementing your bad ideas, and you begin to think of better ideas that will serve your ultimate purpose!\n    Let\u2019s now apply this method to discovering your life\u2019s purpose. In this case, you are starting from incomplete information: you lack purpose.\n Instead, start by identifying your favorite problems. These are problems you often think about, which could be related to any of your deepest interests, skills, and passions. These are problems that inspire you and captivate you, ones that go beyond the scope of day-to-day problems. Write these down. Make them specific enough to be actionable, yet broad enough to think about them for years to come. To give you an idea:\n \u201cWhat is the weather going to be like tomorrow?\u201d = Too specific, and useless in the grand scheme of things.\n \u201cHow can I surround myself with optimistic, curious, and supportive people who give me energy?\u201d (Courtesy of David Perell) = This is the realm you want to be in.\n If your questions are precise and relevant to your favorite problems, you will have a more direct path to discovering your purpose. Begin a habit of consciously formulating and referring back to your questions. You will miss the mark often (see dotted arrows above), but that is all part of the learning process. The more deliberate and thoughtful you are in this process, the closer you will be to achieving the life you want to live.\n  For the last 15 years of my working life, I have wandered aimlessly, jumping from job to job, curiosity to curiosity, and never focusing my energies in one primary direction. I haven\u2019t quite found my true purpose yet, but with this system, I am more on the path than I have ever been in my entire life.\n If you want to begin a more deliberate approach to discovering your purpose, it helps to have an example to gain inspiration. Here are my 12 favorite problems, divided my scope:\n  1.  Am I hunting antelope or chasing mice? This question originated from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. This helps me refocus on my priorities when I get bogged down in minutiae. Every action I take is put through this filter to ensure that I am consistently effective in the most relevant areas.\n 2.  How can I balance my time between cultivating meaningful relationships and meaningful work? I put this tweet out recently, which sums up my passion for what I\u2019m currently building:\n When you do unfulfilling work, 8 hrs/5x a week is full-time.  When you do meaningful, self-directed work, 16 hrs/7x a week feels like part-time.\n\u2014 Joe Balcom (@thejoebalcom)  July 6, 2020\n  While I\u2019ve finally found a meaningful path worth travelling, I still struggle to make time for those closest to me. Perhaps this will solve itself as I become more efficient in my work, but tomorrow is never guaranteed. It must be a priority.\n 3.  How can I overcome the tyranny of perfectionism? Even as I write this post, I am suffering from the effects of perfectionism. I constantly check and recheck my work, just to make sure everything is \u201cperfect.\u201d Eventually, I let my work out into the world, but not after hours of painstaking attention to detail.\n 4.  How can I find my 1,000 True Fans? Anyone trying to build an online business should read  this article by Kevin Kelly. The intimidation level of building something that sells is immense. This article is so good at lowering it and making you feel that your goals are well within reach.\n 5.  What is the least crowded channel? I\u2019ve asked this question to myself for over a decade. It is why I\u2019m done submitting resumes, it\u2019s why I didn\u2019t get a master\u2019s degree (I didn\u2019t catch myself in time for undergrad), and it is why I\u2019ve been able to identify entry points to otherwise \u201cinaccessible\u201d leadership positions and unique adventures. It is why you are reading this today.\n 6.  What would this look like if it were easy? Thanks to Tim Ferriss for this one. This is particularly useful when overwhelmed, frustrated, or intimidated. When I first became a restaurant manager, it was easy to get lost in the million tasks I needed to get done. By asking this question, I was able to devise a  system for reducing stress and achieving my goal in a more effective way.\n   7. How can I help change the  paradigm of travel\u2014to help people aim for  meaningful exploration rather than frivolous luxury?\n 8. How do I articulate the importance and, dare I say,  necessity of travel in a compelling and persuasive way?\n  9. How can I help change the  paradigm of work\u2014to look at it through the lens of  meaningfulness instead of working by default (for money, approval, necessity)?\n 10. How can I shepherd people into the age of leverage and teach people that a prosperous future is in  divorcing their time from their income?\n  11. How can I help change the  paradigm of mental health\u2014to look at it through the lens of community and togetherness, rather than through shame and secrecy?\n 12. How can I inspire and teach people in a convincing way how to overcome self-imposed limitations\u2014to  not just step outside their comfort zone, but to demolish it altogether?\n   These questions aren\u2019t perfect, and will probably adjust over time. But they serve as a way to focus my energies in the most effective directions, and get closer to my true purpose than ever before.\n I hope this helps you begin to formulate your approach to life in a more thoughtful way. Having things written down, illustrated, and listed will free your mind. You will have the mental lightness to move forward and towards a defined goal with purpose and precision.\n Cultivate your vision of what you want in life. If laying on the couch eating chips doesn\u2019t serve your overall vision, do less of that. You will now be able to calibrate your habits in service of your life\u2019s purpose.\n And remember, if nobody calls your vision arrogant, you\u2019re probably not thinking big enough.\n  Did you love this essay?

"note_en": "Published: July 1, 2020   I.\u00a0  The smartest person I\u2019ve ever known had a habit that, as a teenager, I found striking. After he\u2019d prove a theorem, or solve a problem, he\u2019d go back and continue thinking about the problem and try to figure out different proofs of the same thing. Sometimes he\u2019d spend hours on a problem  he\u2019d already solved.\u00a0  I had the opposite tendency: as soon as I\u2019d reached the end of the proof, I\u2019d stop since I\u2019d \u201cgotten the answer\u201d.   Afterwards, he\u2019d come out with three or four proofs of the same thing, plus some explanation of why each proof is connected somehow. In this way, he got a much deeper understanding of things than I did.   I concluded that\u00a0 what we call &#39;intelligence&#39; is as much about virtues such as honesty, integrity, and bravery, as it is about &#39;raw intellect\u2019.   Intelligent people simply  aren\u2019t willing to accept answers that they don\u2019t understand \u2014 no matter how many other people try to convince them of it, or how many other people believe it, if they aren\u2019t able to convince them selves of it, they won\u2019t accept it.   Importantly, this is a \u2018software\u2019 trait &amp; is independent of more \u2018hardware\u2019 traits such as processing speed, working memory, and other such things.   Moreover, I have noticed that these \u2018hardware\u2019 traits vary greatly in the smartest people I know -- some are remarkably quick thinkers, calculators, readers, whereas others are \u2018slow\u2019. The software traits, though, they all have in common -- and can, with effort, be learned.\u00a0  What this means is that you can internalize good intellectual habits that, in effect, \u201cincrease your intelligence\u201d. \u2018Intelligence\u2019 is not  fixed.   II.   This quality of \u201cnot stopping at an unsatisfactory answer\u201d deserves some examination.    One component of it is energy: thinking hard takes effort, and it\u2019s much easier to just stop at an answer that seems to make sense, than to pursue everything that you don\u2019t quite get down an endless, and rapidly proliferating, series of rabbit holes.   It\u2019s also so easy to think that you understand something, when you actually don\u2019t. So even figuring out  whether you understand something or not requires you to attack the thing from multiple angles and test your own understanding.   This requires a lot of intrinsic motivation, because it\u2019s so hard; so most people simply don\u2019t do it. \u00a0  The Nobel Prize winner William Shockley was fond of talking about \u201cthe will to think\u201d:  Motivation is at least as important as method for the serious thinker, Shockley believed... the essential element for successful work in any field was \u201cthe will to think\u201d. This was a phrase he learned from the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi and never forgot.  \u201cIn these four words,\u201d Shockley wrote later, \u201c[Fermi] distilled the essence of a very significant insight: A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack \u2018the will to think\u2019 -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the results of his efforts.\u201d The discipline of competent thinking is important throughout life... (  source)\nBut it\u2019s not just energy. You have to be able to motivate yourself to spend large quantities of energy on a problem, which means on some level that  not understanding something \u2014 or having a bug in your thinking \u2014 bothers you a lot. You have the drive, the will to know.   Related to this is\u00a0 honesty, or integrity: a sort of compulsive unwillingness, or inability, to lie to yourself. Feynman said that the first rule of science is that you do not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. It is uniquely easy to lie to yourself because there is no external force keeping you honest; only  you can run the constant loop of asking \u201cdo I really understand this?\u201d. \u00a0  (This is why writing is important. It\u2019s harder to fool yourself that you understand something when you sit down to write about it and it comes out all disjointed and confused. Writing forces clarity.)   III.  The physicist Michael Faraday believed  nothing without being able to experimentally demonstrate it himself, no matter how tedious the demonstation.   Simply hearing or reading of such things was never enough for Faraday.  When assessing the work of others, he always had to repeat, and perhaps extend, their experiments. It became a lifelong habit\u2014his way of establishing ownership over an idea. Just as he did countless times later in other settings, he set out to demonstrate this new phenomenon to his own satisfaction. When he had saved enough money to buy the materials, he made a battery from seven copper halfpennies and seven discs cut from a sheet of zinc, interleaved with pieces of paper soaked in salt water. He fixed a copper wire to each end plate, dipped the other ends of the wires in a solution of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), and watched. (  source)\nUnderstanding something really deeply is connected to our physical intuition. A simple \u201cwords based\u201d understanding can only go so far. Visualizing something, in three dimensions, can help you with a concrete \u201chook\u201d that your brain can grasp onto and use as a model; understanding then has a physical context that it can \u201ctake place in\u201d.   This is why Jesus speaks in parables throughout the New Testament \u2014 in ways that stick with you long after you\u2019ve read them \u2014 rather than just stating the abstract principle. \u201c Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.\u201d can stick with you forever in a way that \u201c God watches over all living beings\u201d will not.  Faraday, again, had this quality in spades -- the book makes clear that this is partly because he was bad at mathematics and thus understood everything through the medium of experiments, and contrasts this with the French scientists (such as Ampere) who understood everything in a highly abstract way.   But Faraday\u2019s physical intuition led him to some of the most crucial discoveries in all of science:  Much as he admired Amp\u00e8re&#39;s work, Faraday began to develop his own views on the nature of the force between a current-carrying wire and the magnetic needle it deflected. Amp\u00e8re&#39;s mathematics (which he had no reason to doubt) showed that the motion of the magnetic needle was the result of repulsions and attractions between it and the wire.  But, to Faraday, this seemed wrong, or, at least, the wrong way around. What happened, he felt, was that the wire induced a circular force in the space around itself, and that everything else followed from this. The next step beautifully illustrates Faraday&#39;s genius. Taking Sarah&#39;s fourteen-year-old brother George with him down to the laboratory, he stuck an iron bar magnet into hot wax in the bottom of a basin and, when the wax had hardened, filled the basin with mercury until only the top of the magnet was exposed. He dangled a short length of wire from an insulated stand so that its bottom end dipped in the mercury, and then he connected one terminal of a battery to the top end of the wire and the other to the mercury.  The wire and the mercury now formed part of a circuit that would remain unbroken even if the bottom end of the wire moved. And move it did\u2014in rapid circles around the magnet! ( source)\n Being able to generate these concrete examples, even when you\u2019re not physically doing experiments, is imporatant.   I recently saw this striking representation of the \u201cbag of words\u201d model in NLP. If you were reading this in the usual dry mathematical way these things are represented, and then  forced yourself to come up with a visualization like this, then you\u2019d be much further on your way to really grasping the thing.   Conversely, if you\u2019re  not coming up with visuals like this, and your understanding of the thing remains on the level of equations or abstract concepts, you probably do not understand the concept deeply and should dig further.     Another quality I have noticed in very intelligent people is  being unafraid to look stupid.   Malcolm Gladwell on his father:  My father has zero intellectual insecurities... It has never crossed his mind to be concerned that the world thinks he\u2019s an idiot. He\u2019s not in that game.  So if he doesn\u2019t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn\u2019t care if he sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of concern about it... So he asks lots and lots of dumb, in the best sense of that word, questions. He\u2019ll say to someone, \u2018I don\u2019t understand. Explain that to me.\u2019 He\u2019ll just keep asking questions until he gets it right, and I grew up listening to him do this in every conceivable setting.  If my father had met Bernie Madoff, he would never have invested money with him because he would have said, \u2018I don\u2019t understand\u2019 a hundred times. \u2018I don\u2019t understand how that works\u2019, in this kind of dumb, slow voice. \u2018I don\u2019t understand, sir. What is going on?\u2019\nMost people are not willing to do this -- looking stupid takes courage, and sometimes it\u2019s easier to just let things slide. It is  striking how many situations I am in where I start asking basic questions, feel guilty for slowing the group down, and it turns out that  nobody understood what was going on to begin with (often people message me privately saying that they\u2019re relieved I asked), but I was the only one who actually spoke up and asked about it.\u00a0  This is a habit. It\u2019s easy to pick up. And it makes you smarter.   IV.  I remember being taught calculus at school and getting stuck on the \u201cdy/dx\u201d notation (aka Leibniz notation) for calculus.   The \u201cdy/dx\u201d just looked like a fraction, it looked like we were doing division, but we weren\u2019t  actually doing division. \u201cdy/dx\u201d doesn\u2019t mean \u201cdy\u201d divided by \u201cdx\u201d, it means \u201cthe value of an infinitesimal change in y  with respect to an infinitesimal change in x\u201d, and I didn\u2019t see how you could break this thing apart as though it was simple division.   At one point the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus involved multiplying out a polynomial, and along the way you could cancel out \u201cdy*dx\u201d because \u201cboth of these quantities are infinitesimal, so in effect this can be cancelled out\u201d. This reasoning  did not make sense.  The \u201cproof\u201d of the chain rule we were given looked like this.\u00a0    (Amusingly, you can even get correct results using invalid mathematics, like this. Even though this is clearly invalid, it doesn\u2019t feel far off the \u201cvalid\u201d proof of the chain rule I was taught.)    It turns out that my misgivings were right, and that the Leibniz notation is basically just a convenient shorthand and that you more or less  can treat those things \u201cas if\u201d they are fractions, but the proof is super complicated etc. Moreover, the Leibniz shorthand is actually far more  powerful and easier to work with than Newton\u2019s functions-based shorthand, which is why mainland Europe got way ahead of England (which stuck with Newton\u2019s notation) in calculus. And then all of the logical problems didn\u2019t really get sorted out until Riemann came along 200 years later and formulated calculus in terms of  limits.\u00a0But all of that went over my head in high school.  At the time, I was infuriated by these inadequate proofs, but I was under time pressure to just  learn the operations so that I could answer exam questions because the class needed to move onto the next thing.   And since you actually  can answer the exam questions and mechanically perform calculus operations without ever deeply understanding calculus, it\u2019s much easier to just get by and do the exam without really questioning the concepts deeply -- which is in fact what happens for most people. (See\u00a0 my essay on education.)  How many people actually go back and try and understand this, or other such topics, in a deeper way? Very few. Moreover, the \u2018meta\u2019 lesson is: don\u2019t question it too deeply, you\u2019ll fall behind. Just learn the algorithm, plug in the numbers, and pass your exams. Speed is of the essence. In this way, school kills the \u201cwill to understanding\u201d in people.  My countervailing advice to people trying to understand something is:  go slow. Read slowly, think slowly, really spend time pondering the thing. Start by thinking about the question yourself before reading a bunch of stuff about it. A week or a month of continuous pondering about a question will get you surprisingly far.   And you\u2019ll have a semantic mental \u2018framework\u2019 in your brain on which to then hang all the great things you learn from your reading, which makes it more likely that you\u2019ll retain that stuff as well. I read somewhere that Bill Gates structures his famous \u201creading weeks\u201d around an outline of important questions he\u2019s thought about and broken down into pieces. e.g. he\u2019ll think about \u201cwater scarcity\u201d and then break it down into questions like \u201chow much water is there in the world?\u201d, \u201cwhere does existing drinking water come from?\u201d, \u201chow do you turn ocean water into drinking water\u201d, etc., and only  then will he pick reading to address those questions.   This method is  far more effective than just reading random things and letting them pass through you.   V.  The best thing I have read on really understanding things is the  Sequences, especially the section on Noticing Confusion.  There are some mantra-like questions it can be helpful to ask as you\u2019re thinking through things. Some examples:   Why  must X be true? Why does this  have to be the case? What is the single, fundamental reason?\n Do I really believe that this is true, deep down? Would I bet a large amount of money on it with a friend?\n  VI.  Two parables:  First, Ezra Pound\u2019s parable of Agassiz, from his \u201c ABC of Reading\u201d (incidentally one of the most underrated books about literature). I\u2019ve preserved his quirky formatting No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish:  A post-graduate student equipped with honours and diplomas went to Agassiz to receive the final and finishing touches.  The great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it.  Post-Graduate Student: \u201cThat\u2019s only a sun-fish\u201d  Agassiz: \u201cI know that. Write a description of it.\u201d  After a few minutes the student returned with the description of the Ichthus Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichterinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.  Agassiz again told the student to describe the fish. The student produced a four-page essay.  Agassiz then told him to look at the fish.  At the end of the three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.\nThe second, one of my favorite passages from \u201cZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\u201d:  He&#39;d been having trouble with students who had nothing to say. At first he thought it was laziness but later it became apparent that it wasn&#39;t. They just couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.   One of them, a girl with strong-lensed glasses, wanted to write a five-hundredword essay about the United States. He was used to the sinking feeling that comes from statements like this, and suggested without disparagement that she narrow it down to just Bozeman.   When the paper came due she didn&#39;t have it and was quite upset. She had tried and tried but she just couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.   He had already discussed her with her previous instructors and they&#39;d confirmed his impressions of her. She was very serious, disciplined and hardworking, but extremely dull. Not a spark of creativity in her anywhere. Her eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, were the eyes of a drudge. She wasn&#39;t bluffing him, she really couldn&#39;t think of anything to say, and was upset by her inability to do as she was told.   It just stumped him. Now he couldn&#39;t think of anything to say. A silence occurred, and then a peculiar answer: &#34;Narrow it down to the main street of Bozeman.&#34; It was a stroke of insight.   She nodded dutifully and went out. But just before her next class she came back in real distress, tears this time, distress that had obviously been there for a long time. She still couldn&#39;t think of anything to say, and couldn&#39;t understand why, if she couldn&#39;t think of anything about all of Bozeman, she should be able to think of something about just one street.   He was furious. &#34;You&#39;re not looking!&#34; he said. A memory came back of his own dismissal from the University for having too much to say. For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see. She really wasn&#39;t looking and yet somehow didn&#39;t understand this.   He told her angrily, &#34;Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick.&#34;    Her eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, opened wide. She came in the next class with a puzzled look and handed him a five- thousand-word essay on the front of the Opera House on the main street of Bozeman, Montana. &#34;I sat in the hamburger stand across the street,&#34; she said, &#34;and started writing about the first brick, and the second brick, and then by the third brick it all started to come and I couldn&#39;t stop. They thought I was crazy, and they kept kidding me, but here it all is. I don&#39;t understand it.&#34;   Neither did he, but on long walks through the streets of town he thought about it and concluded she was evidently stopped with the same kind of blockage that had paralyzed him on his first day of teaching.  She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard, just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say. She couldn&#39;t think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn&#39;t recall anything she had heard worth repeating. She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself, as she wrote, without primary regard for what had been said before. The narrowing down to one brick destroyed the blockage because it was so obvious she had to do some original and direct seeing.\nThe point of both of these parables: nothing beats direct experience. Get the data yourself. This is why I wanted to analyze the  coronavirus genome directly, for example. You develop some basis in reality by getting some first-hand data, and reasoning  up from there, versus starting with somebody else\u2019s lossy compression of a messy, evolving phenomenon and then wondering why events keep surprising you. \u00a0  People who have not experienced the thing are unlikely to be generating  truth. More likely, they\u2019re resurfacing cached thoughts and narratives. Reading popular science books or news articles is not a substitute for understanding, and may make you stupider, by filling your mind with narratives and stories that don\u2019t represent  your own synthesis.   Even if you can\u2019t experience the thing directly, try going for information-dense sources with high amounts of detail and  facts, and then reason up from those facts. On foreign policy, read books published by university presses -- not  The Atlantic or  The Economist or whatever. You can read those after you\u2019ve developed a model of the thing yourself, against which you can judge the popular narratives.  Another thing the parable about the bricks tells us:  understanding is not a binary \u201cyes/no\u201d. It has layers of depth. My friend understood Pythagoras\u2019s theorem far more deeply than I did; he could prove it six different ways and had simply thought about it for longer.  The simplest things can reward close study. Michael Nielsen has a nice example of this -- the equals sign:  I first really appreciated this after reading an essay by the mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov. You might suppose a great mathematician such as Kolmogorov would be writing about some very complicated piece of mathematics, but his subject was the humble equals sign: what made it a\n......",

"note_en": "Much of the emotional suffering in the world comes from the substitution of power for value. The curse of our times is that so many people have developed the habit of seeking to feel temporarily more powerful when they feel devalued. This leads almost inevitably to power struggles and some degree of abuse of others, if acted out, or, if held in, to some level of  depression.\n  Those afflicted with this terrible, though common habit lose sight of behavioral possibilities that would make them feel more valuable when they most need it\u2014when the feel devalued. They grow alienated from their more humane values, which makes them feel progressively less valuable. To compensate, they inflate their egos to fragile proportions, which seem to need more and more power as defense. This dynamic, fueled by the systematic substitution of power for value, leads to what is commonly and erroneously considered the  narcissistic constellation of  personality disorders.\n  Covariant with the substitution of power for value is the persistent need to be right while making others wrong. Seeming to be right justifies disrespect, contempt, and other forms of emotional pollution, which spread like wildfire in our electronic age. In addition, they suffer an illusion of certainty. High adrenaline emotions, particularly  anger, create the profoundest illusions of certainty, due to their  amphetamine effects. The amphetamine effect\u00a0creates a temporary sense of  confidence and certainty, while narrowing mental focus and eliminating most variables from consideration. That&#39;s why you feel more confident after a cup of coffee (a mild amphetamine effect) than before it, and it\u2019s why you\u2019re convinced that you\u2019re right and everyone else is wrong when you&#39;re angry.\n  Certainty itself is an emotional state, not an intellectual one. To create a feeling of certainty, the brain must filter out far more information than it processes, which, of course, greatly increases its already high error rate during emotional arousal. In other words, the more certain you feel, the more likely you are wrong in some respect.\n  Mental focus, the foundation of feelings of certainty, distorts reality by magnifying and amplifying one or two aspects of it while filtering out everything else. You might discover more detail about the one or two aspects you focus on, but what you discover will have no contextual meaning, because you have isolated those aspects from their dynamic interaction with the rest of the reality in which they exist. In other words, focus magnifies things out of proportion and blows them out of context.\n   The self-justification trap of needing to be perceived as right ruins most relationships. I&#39;ve had many dozens of  therapy clients who confessed that they wished that they weren&#39;t right, as it would make their marriages so much easier.\n The danger to close relationships of this way of thinking cannot be overstressed. Seeming to be right justifies the most potent predictors of divorce: criticism, stonewalling, defensiveness, and contempt. It all but precludes binocular vision\u2014the ability to see both perspectives at once\u2014and leads both parties convinced that their partners simply don&#39;t care how they feel. It can be no other way when the goal is to show your partner that you&#39;re right and he or she is wrong.\n  In love relationships, it\u2019s never enough to be right. The ultimate measure of relationship interactions is their level of compassion and kindness. When those fail, it doesn\u2019t matter who is right.\n Never judge an interaction in a love relationship merely by who&#39;s right. Instead, ask yourself how compassionate and kind you are in the interaction. Spend less effort trying to control your partner&#39;s thinking and more trying to understand and appreciate differences in your perspectives.", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:59:27", "source_domain":

"note_en": "I recently came across a study of the behaviour of people in a buffet line. The results blew me away. At the average breakfast buffet, the first item was taken by 75% of the diners (even when the order of the items was reversed). Two-thirds of all the food taken came from the first three items, regardless of how long the buffet was.\n     We are less in control of our actions and decisions than we think we are.\n Buffet line behaviour is harmless, but it&#39;s scary to think about the other areas of our lives where this same passive consumption creeps in.\n   The Internet is like an information buffet - anything you could possibly imagine - available at the click of a button. Grabbing the first piece of information on offer - usually social media or a news headline - is dangerous.\n   This was The World&#39;s headline, the day after the Titanic tragedy, when 1,500 people died.\n    &#34;If excessive smoking actually plays a role in the production of lung cancer, it seems to be a minor one.&#34; - The Director of the National Cancer Institute in 1954.\n    We live in the age of abundance. It&#39;s never been easier to passively consume the opinions of others. It&#39;s also never been more dangerous.\n      Passive consumption acts as a blindfold, making us blissfully unaware of things which are right in front of our eyes.\n   In every period of history, people believed things that were ridiculous. People used to believe that evil spirits hid in the leaves of Brussel sprouts. They\u2019d cut a cross in each sprout before tossing it in the pan - to drive out the evil spirits.\n   Hindsight makes it easy to see that these beliefs were ridiculous, but at the time you\u2019d be frowned upon for believing anything otherwise. It\u2019s na\u00efve of us to think that our time is different. It\u2019s unlikely that ours is the first period to have everything figured out, or the first period without any ridiculous beliefs.\n   If everything you believe is something you&#39;re told to believe, is it a coincidence? Probably not.\n   And if you believe everything you&#39;re told to now, how can you be sure you wouldn&#39;t have believed everything you were told to if you grew up in apartheid-era South Africa, or in Germany in the 1930s?\n   We believe things today that people in the future will find ridiculous. The way to avoid these beliefs is by learning to think for yourself, and having the courage to stand by your thoughts.\n   The aim is not to oppose the crowd, but to avoid believing something simply because the crowd tells you to.\n      Your mind is like a sponge, it absorbs what it\u2019s exposed to. Whether you put a sponge in water or in Coca-Cola, it\u2019ll absorb it. Your mind absorbs the information you feed it, whether it\u2019s good or bad.\n   Everything you do - the    career  you pursue, the    partner  you pick, the company you build - starts with a thought. That&#39;s why improving the way you think, improves the way you do everything. It\u2019s difficult to think well when the sponge in your head is only exposed to the information at the front of the buffet.\n   My company prioritises independent thinking. Regardless of what you\u2019re doing, you&#39;re encouraged to think creatively and independently. That ethos, and the creativity that results from it, is the reason a small South African company is being invited to work with places like Harvard and MIT. It\u2019s the reason we\u2019re making waves in education - an industry that hasn&#39;t seen much progress in over a century.\n  The world needs people who can think for themselves. People who can formulate a new direction: for a country, for a company, and for those around them. People with a new way of doing things, a new way of looking at things. People, in other words, with vision.\n  But thinking for yourself is difficult.    Copernicus  realised the sun didn&#39;t go around the earth when traditional wisdom, everyone around him, and even the evidence of his senses said that it did. The idea was such a stretch that even he had a hard time believing it. He was forced into believing it because it was the only way the numbers made sense.\n   Everyone tried to talk him out his idea. It happened in the 1400s, and it happens today. Society encourages conformity, and you\u2019re ridiculed for having ideas that don\u2019t fit into the box that society operates in. It\u2019s important to reject the urge to conform, because what society wants for you is not always what\u2019s good for you.\n   The world is desperate for people who think creatively, independently and flexibly. They\u2019re the creators, inventors and innovators. The people that drive progress and make the world a better place. The people that steer us in the right direction as the world changes faster and faster each day.\n      During a scorching heatwave, when crops catch fire, a circle is drawn around the blaze and the crops in that circle are deliberately set alight before the flames can reach it. Once the fire reaches the circle it stops, as there is nothing there left to burn. They use fire to kill fire.\n   Our minds - when fed the first piece of information you come across - are like crops without a ring of protection. They\u2019re vulnerable and waiting to be destroyed. By being deliberate about what we consume and what we believe, we develop a ring of protection.\n   In the centre of that ring is a mind that can go anywhere. A mind in the habit of going where society tells it not to, and thinking thoughts which are unthinkable. A mind capable of thinking creatively, independently and flexibly.\n      We all have gifts. Whether you\u2019re a painter, an engineer or a baker, it\u2019s your responsibility to share your gifts with the world. That\u2019s how the world gets better. That\u2019s how the future gets built.\n   At the end of the day, the question is simply how will you use your gifts? Will you choose a life of ease, or a life of service and adventure?\n   I choose the latter. I believe most people will too. We all want to    reach our potential . We all want to improve the world around us and feel a sense of pride in what we&#39;ve done. Nobody wants to reach their    death bed  feeling like they could have done more.\n   When everything we do is determined by how we think, our minds are worth protecting. Are you protecting yours?", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:58:59", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7cbe\u795e,day,\u76f8\u4fe1", "title":

It is the glorious urban symphony that pours into a typical New York City apartment building day and night.\n  What if there were technology to cancel the offending clamor, like a pair of giant noise-canceling headphones for your apartment?\n Researchers in Singapore have developed an apparatus that can be placed in a window to reduce incoming sound by 10 decibels. The system was created by a team of scientists, including Masaharu Nishimura, who came up with the basic concept, and Bhan Lam, a researcher at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n \u201cI grew up in Singapore,\u201d Dr. Lam said in a Zoom interview from his apartment there. \u201cIt\u2019s a small city with a lot of noise, so I have some motivation to solve this problem.\u201d\n Their results were  published on Thursday in Scientific Reports. The prototype is not yet the most practical device in real world conditions, but it points the way toward the development of technologies that may help ease the strain of noisy city living.\n Borrowing from the same technological principles used in noise-canceling headphones, the team expanded the concept to fit an entire room by placing 24 small speakers in a window. The speakers emit sound waves that correspond to the incoming racket and neutralize it \u2014 or, at least some of it.\n  The system is based on the frequency of the sound waves and, for now, the optimal range is between 300 and 1,000 hertz.\n In Singapore, a city near the Equator where temperatures are often high, overlapping transportation systems and the desire for natural ventilation in modern high-rise apartment towers can pose a healthy-living conundrum.\n Dr. Lam explained that \u201cin places like Singapore, we want to keep the windows open as much as possible\u201d to reduce the use of  carbon-intensive air-conditioners and to prevent  buildup of stale air that can pose health risks for some people.\n But with windows open, the constant din from city traffic, trains, jets passing overhead and construction equipment can rattle apartments. The Anti-Noise Control Window, as it is called, is the sonic equivalent of shutting a window.\n With any sound, the best way to reduce it is at the source, like a gun\u2019s silencer. So the researchers treated the window aperture itself as the noise source, because most noise enters a room that way.\n The system uses a microphone outside the window to detect the repeating sound waves of the offending noise source, which is registered by a computer controller. That in turn deciphers the proper wave frequency needed to neutralize the sound, which is transmitted to the array of speakers on the inside of the window frame.\n The speakers then emit the proper \u201canti\u201d waves, which cancel out the incoming waves, and there you have it: near blissful silence.\n \u201cIf you sit in the room, you get that same feeling like when you flick on the switch of noise-canceling earphones,\u201d Dr. Lam said, splaying his hands to denote the calming effect.\n The system is best at attenuating the audible blasts from the types of steady noise sources found within the optimal frequency range.\n Unfortunately, human voices do not fit within most of that range. One of the next hurdles will be to find a way to silence loud conversations from across the way.\n Another limitation is that the system is not good at neutralizing sporadic noises, like firecrackers, car horns or the occasional earsplitting crash of metal storefront shutters \u2014 the kinds of noises that drive many New Yorkers to slam their windows shut.\n One reason for the limitation on frequency is the size of the speakers. To cancel out lower frequencies would require larger bass speakers. But those would interfere with ventilation and your ability to see through the window.\n It\u2019s a trade-off, and one solution might be installing larger windows, or discovering a way to make it work with smaller speakers.\n As it is, the 24 speakers, each about 2 inches in diameter, are a bit of an aesthetic hindrance.\n \u201cOne complaint that we get is that it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Dr. Lam

"note_en": "In 2017, Khan Academy started using React Native in our iOS and Android apps. As of this year 1, we\u2019ve reached a big milestone: our transition to React Native is complete! Every screen in the app is rendered in React Native 2.\n    The design of iOS and Android apps were nearly identical, with similar interaction-design, features, and content.\n  Maintaining two codebases is challenging, with different data designs, bugs, and coordination for developing new features. (More on this in a minute.)\n  Our mobile team is small 3, so the transition didn\u2019t require coordinating large numbers of engineers.\n  Our website was already using React, so we had in-house expertise with the concepts and tools to help with the transition.\n  Let\u2019s talk a bit more about the challenges of maintaining two separate codebases:\n  Different bugs would appear on different platforms. Of course this is the case with React Native, too, but it\u2019s far less-common.\n  Implementing a new feature required coordination of design, engineering, and testing across two platforms. That meant that you needed at least two engineers (iOS &amp; Android), ideally available at the same time - and for a team as small as ours, that was pretty hard to do!\n  Once a feature was built, it was hard to change because you\u2019d have to change it on both platforms. It was hard to adjust &amp; update designs.\n  Architectures varied a lot between the platforms. Our iOS codebase was four years older than our Android codebase. iOS had Swift, ReactiveCocoa, Cartography, and CoreData. Android had its own set of dependencies and data-flow designs. The differences here added up - it wasn\u2019t often straightforward to borrow a feature from the other platform, and it wasn\u2019t easy to review the other platform\u2019s code, so our engineers were largely siloed by platform.\n    The transition essentially moved in three phases: Exploration, Straddling, and Extinction. (Basecamp\u2019s  Hill Chart is a great metaphor for this.)\n  Exploration (early 2017) was early work to add bridges between native and Javascript code, with our very first screens in React Native, like the Search tab. Nearly all of the networking, data, business logic, and all that \u201cclient-side backend\u201d stuff was passed over a bridge. This involved lots of boilerplate, so it was pretty tedious.\n  Straddling (mid-2017 to mid-2018) was the hardest, for sure. We had decided to use React Native, but were far from the finish line. We now had three things to think about: native iOS, native Android, and the React Native code. Engineers needed to know two (or more) paradigms to make changes, and there was lots to learn!\n  Extinction (mid-2018 to mid-2020) was my favorite part. This phase started with our \u201cStreaming Topic Tree\u201d project, a multi-month effort where we fully transitioned our content database (our many courses, videos, articles, and exercises) from a big bundled native database (e.g. CoreData) to a lightweight, caching library written in Javascript. Now that our client-side content database was in React Native, we didn\u2019t need to pass nearly as much over the bridges we\u2019d built, and could start deleting lots of native code. This year\u2019s v7.0 release was the final push to upgrade our last native screen to React Native, while unifying the navigation design across phones and tablets.\n     We use React Native for the \u201ccontents of a screen\u201d, and native code for the navigation around those screens. There are a few underlying reasons, but it\u2019s essentially a balance of \u201cwhere does the complex implementation live\u201d vs \u201cwhat makes a native app feel native\u201d.\n  The vast majority of \u201cbusiness logic\u201d for our apps lives in the screen\u2019s content (like the contents of our Home tab\u2019s cards, or the downloading rules for our Bookmarks tab). By comparison, the contents of a tab bar or navigation bar don\u2019t depend much on business logic.\n  However, navigation bars and navigation controllers written in React Native feel  fake in small ways that add up. A native navigation controller gives us the correct swipe-to-go-back gesture, as well as the correct animation timings for push/pop animations. A native navigation bar handles notched-iPhones with ease. Wrapping each screen in a native UIViewController also gives us familiar places in a screen\u2019s lifecycle when needed. (There are libraries out there that have worked hard to mimic system-standard navigation bars; we\u2019ve not found one that meets our needs.)\n  When we started that experiment in 2017, our rule was that the app had to still \u201cfeel\u201d native. There are some places where it\u2019s imperfect, for sure, but we feel confident that the compromises we\u2019ve made have allowed us to vastly improve our apps in many other ways!\n    There are two pieces to translations for the mobile app: content and platform strings. Content strings come from our content management system; examples include questions in our interactive exercises, the contents and subtitles for a video, or the text in an article. (Many of these content strings are part of that \u201cStreaming Topic Tree\u201d I mentioned earlier.) Platform strings are defined in our mobile apps\u2019 codebase; examples include the text in a \u201cSign up\u201d button, a tab bar item\u2019s title, or the text shown in our Settings screen.\n  We\u2019ve got some excellent homemade infrastructure for maintaining platform strings. You define a string in JavaScript, and we\u2019ve built scripts that copy the string over to native iOS and Android strings. This has been quite helpful; we can easily reuse strings across native and React Native without issue, which greatly helped in that \u201cstraddling\u201d transition period.\n  From 2015-2019, our app only supported six locales, but now we\u2019re at nineteen! A shared iOS &amp; Android implementation helped us get a streaming topic tree, which meant that adding additional languages wouldn\u2019t bloat our app size. Additionally, we were able to design components in React Native that handle non-Latin characters with ease. Our mobile team is no longer the constraint on expanding our mobile apps\u2019 reach \u2014 it\u2019s whether we\u2019ve got enough of our (massive) content library translated to a particular locale. This has been a huge morale boost to our international advocates; they\u2019re really excited to have a proper mobile app for communities around the world.\n    This section\u2019s a bit more of a personal-opinion, so uh, keep that in mind! Your mileage may vary.\n  Moving to React Native hasn\u2019t been perfectly rosy\u2014 there have been bumps along the way, like learning a new language, a new component lifecycle, and more. The \u201cstraddling\u201d period was particularly challenging; there was a lot of tedious boilerplate code in bridging our native and React Native code!\n  On a personal level, I miss a lot about Swift - in particular, associated-value enums, convenience initializers, named parameters, and the ease of adding functions and vars to structs and classes.\n    React Native has felt far more malleable than UIKit; it feels great to shape and refactor code. The code you write for a UICollectionView is different than a UITableView is different than a UIStackView, for example \u2014 but in React Native, you kinda just\u2026 don\u2019t have to worry about it? For the most part, you can cut-and-paste code when refactoring, and it\u2019s pretty trivial to change something from a grid to a list. (There\u2019s a lot of overlap between this perk and many of the perks of SwiftUI.)\n  Developer tooling is excellent. Xcode is where I came up as a developer, so I know its quirks, but my true love is now VSCode. It\u2019s been a new vocabulary to learn, for sure \u2014 but the fact that I\u2019ve got a VSCode plugin that autoformats my code when I hit save? Incredible! There are so many linters and auto-fixers that our code reviews really don\u2019t involve many nitty styleguide fixes: the computer\u2019s doing the formatting for us, and it just feels so  helpful.\n  I\u2019m making an Android app, and I\u2019m barely proficient in writing Android apps! I know enough to add an extra parameter or function, but I\u2019m no architect on Android\u2026 yet I\u2019m able to reach our much-larger population of Android learners and build features for them! This is well in-line with our mission and my personal values, and it has felt so nice to be able to participate here.\n  I feel more ready to participate in our web frontend. I\u2019m a mobile developer at heart, but now that I\u2019m familiar with React Native, it\u2019s not much of a stretch to help out on our webapp, and a good portion of our mobile team is already doing exactly that! It feels great to branch out and explore web development (and we\u2019ve got web engineers contributing to our mobile codebase, too!).\n    Our iOS and Android apps share a single codebase, with engineers specializing in features of the app, rather than platform. This means we\u2019re way better about improving the quality of a given feature over time, and we can make incremental improvements to features, rather than feeling like we need to get everything in the initial version.\n  Shared infrastructure made it far easier for us to transition to GraphQL, which in turn is simplifying our  server-side transition to Go.\n  Our apps are significantly smaller. Switching from a big bundled content-library database to a streaming one dramatically reduced our app size. Yes, this could\u2019ve been done natively, but it was easier to implement this in a single place rather than coordinating it in two.\n  We\u2019re a far better dance partner with our website. During this transition, we took care to make our mobile designs resemble the information design of our website, which simplifies adding new cross-platform features like our new Mastery Challenge feature. Engineers have been able to bounce between web and mobile when they\u2019re interested, which makes us feel closer with the organization as a whole. (If you\u2019re a frontend engineer interested in Khan Academy, you\u2019d be able to help build features across our mobile apps and the website!)\n  We\u2019ve still got native code in the app, and that\u2019s wonderful! When needed, we can hop back to Xcode or Android Studio and implement platform-specific features, like iPad multitasking.\n  We\u2019ve got a  robust design system, which helps our designers and engineers quickly put together improvements to our products. For mobile, this shows up in some key ways, like having standards and prebuilt components that handle touch-highlights, accessibility, loading states, and more.\n    The main engineering project at Khan Academy right now is  Goliath, where we\u2019re re-architecting our backend into a collection of Go services. Our unified mobile infrastructure has helped us in this transition: even though our mobile team is a half-dozen people, we\u2019re still able to build new features and fixes! Our apps are in a far better place to improve and expand their capabilities, localizations, quality, and performance.\n  One last caveat before finishing up here:  Fully native apps are also terrific, and many of us still really enjoy working on them in our other projects. (Personally, my heart still belongs to Xcode, and I really enjoy thinking in Swift!) That said, our transition to React Native has been a huge boon to our team.

When a service receives a request, it maps it onto the vendor-specific data representation and data transmission technology. Once the underlying backend returns a response, the service maps it back onto the abstract schema graph and delivers it to the requesting MetaMate.\n Discovery services supply a MetaMate with services it can interact with. These services can be publicly routable or live in a private network.\n Gateway services enable a MetaMate to interact with external data providers. Talk to APIs, blockchains, websites, or p2p networks. In a nutshell: everything that&#39;s connected to the internet.\n The MetaMate community progressively models the abstract schema graph around real-world data. Its type system is derived as the lowest common denominator of the language capabilities of widely adapted data transmission technologies, namely GraphQL, gRPC, Thrift, and OpenApi.\n   The abstract schema graph programmatically enforces the backward compatibility of the schema. Services and applications built on top of MetaMate work forever.\n MetaMate takes care of mapping the communication between different versions of types. A v1 client seamlessly talks to a v2 service.\n MetaMate&#39;s CLI generates typed SDKs per project, covering only the desired subset of the overall schema graph.\n As MetaMate&#39;s type system is derived as the lowest common denominator of the capabilities of leading transmission protocols, it maps seamlessly onto GraphQL, gRPC, Thrift, and JSON based data transmission implementations.\n MetaMate is stateless and follows the 12 Factor app. It&#39;s easy to deploy and scale.", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:55:37", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

performance testing is in general a  testing practice performed to determine how a  system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other  quality  attributes of the system, such as  scalability,  reliability and resource usage.\n Performance testing, a subset of  performance engineering, is a  computer science practice which strives to build performance standards into the implementation, design and architecture of a system.\n    Load testing is the simplest form of performance testing. A load test is usually conducted to understand the behaviour of the system under a specific expected load. This load can be the expected concurrent number of users on the  application performing a specific number of  transactions within the set duration. This test will give out the response times of all the important business critical transactions. The  database,  application server, etc. are also monitored during the test, this will assist in identifying  bottlenecks in the application software and the hardware that the software is installed on.\n  Stress testing is normally used to understand the upper limits of capacity within the system. This kind of test is done to determine the system&#39;s robustness in terms of extreme load and helps application administrators to determine if the system will perform sufficiently if the current load goes well above the expected maximum.\n  Soak testing, also known as endurance testing, is usually done to determine if the system can sustain the continuous expected load. During soak tests, memory utilization is monitored to detect potential leaks. Also important, but often overlooked is performance degradation, i.e. to ensure that the throughput and/or response times after some long period of sustained activity are as good as or better than at the beginning of the test. It essentially involves applying a significant load to a system for an extended, significant period of time. The goal is to discover how the system behaves under sustained use.\n  Spike testing is done by suddenly increasing or decreasing the load generated by a very large number of users, and observing the behaviour of the system. The goal is to determine whether performance will suffer, the system will fail, or it will be able to handle dramatic changes in load.\n  Breakpoint testing is similar to stress testing. An incremental load is applied over time while the system is monitored for predetermined failure conditions. Breakpoint testing is sometimes referred to as Capacity Testing because it can be said to determine the maximum capacity below which the system will perform to its required specifications or Service Level Agreements. The results of breakpoint analysis applied to a fixed environment can be used to determine the optimal scaling strategy in terms of required hardware or conditions that should trigger scaling-out events in a cloud environment.\n  Rather than testing for performance from a load perspective, tests are created to determine the effects of configuration changes to the system&#39;s components on the system&#39;s performance and behaviour. A common example would be experimenting with different methods of  load-balancing.\n  Isolation testing is not unique to performance testing but involves repeating a test execution that resulted in a system problem. Such testing can often isolate and confirm the fault domain.\n  This is a relatively new form of performance testing when global applications such as Facebook, Google and Wikipedia, are performance tested from load generators that are placed on the actual target continent whether physical machines or cloud VMs. These tests usually requires an immense amount of preparation and monitoring to be executed successfully.\n   It can measure which parts of the system or workload cause the system to perform badly.\n Many performance tests are undertaken without setting sufficiently realistic, goal-oriented performance goals. The first question from a business perspective should always be, &#34;why are we performance-testing?&#34;. These considerations are part of the  business case of the testing.Performance goals will differ depending on the system&#39;s technology and purpose, but should always include some of the following:\n  If a system identifies end-users by some form of log-in procedure then a concurrency goal is highly desirable. By definition this is the largest number of concurrent system users that the system is expected to support at any given moment. The work-flow of a scripted transaction may impact true  concurrency especially if the iterative part contains the log-in and log-out activity.\n If the system has no concept of end-users, then performance goal is likely to be based on a maximum throughput or transaction rate.\n  This refers to the time taken for one system node to respond to the request of another. A simple example would be a HTTP &#39;GET&#39; request from browser client to web server.In terms of response time this is what all  load testing tools actually measure.It may be relevant to set server response time goals between all nodes of the system.\n  Load-testing tools have difficulty measuring render-response time, since they generally have no concept of what happens within a  node apart from recognizing a period of time where there is no activity &#39;on the wire&#39;. To measure render response time, it is generally necessary to include functional  test scripts as part of the performance test scenario. Many load testing tools do not offer this feature.\n  It is critical to detail performance specifications (requirements) and document them in any performance test plan. Ideally, this is done during the requirements development phase of any system development project, prior to any design effort. See  Performance Engineering for more details.\n However, performance testing is frequently not performed against a specification; e.g., no one will have expressed what the maximum acceptable response time for a given population of users should be. Performance testing is frequently used as part of the process of performance profile tuning. The idea is to identify the &#34;weakest link&#34; \u2013 there is inevitably a part of the system which, if it is made to respond faster, will result in the overall system running faster. It is sometimes a difficult task to identify which part of the system represents this critical path, and some test tools include (or can have add-ons that provide) instrumentation that runs on the server (agents) and reports transaction times, database access times, network overhead, and other server monitors, which can be analyzed together with the raw performance statistics. Without such instrumentation one might have to have someone crouched over  Windows Task Manager at the server to see how much CPU load the performance tests are generating (assuming a Windows system is under test).\n Performance testing can be performed across the web, and even done in different parts of the country, since it is known that the response times of the internet itself vary regionally. It can also be done in-house, although  routers would then need to be configured to introduce the lag that would typically occur on public networks. Loads should be introduced to the system from realistic points. For example, if 50% of a system&#39;s user base will be accessing the system via a 56K modem connection and the other half over a  T1, then the load injectors (computers that simulate real users) should either inject load over the same mix of connections (ideal) or simulate the network latency of such connections, following the same user profile.\n It is always helpful to have a statement of the likely peak number of users that might be expected to use the system at peak times. If there can also be a statement of what constitutes the maximum allowable 95 percentile response time, then an injector configuration could be used to test whether the proposed system met that specification.\n   In detail, what is the performance test scope? What subsystems, interfaces, components, etc. are in and out of scope for this test?\n For the user interfaces (UIs) involved, how many concurrent users are expected for each (specify peak vs. nominal)?\n What does the target system (hardware) look like (specify all server and network appliance configurations)?\n What is the Application Workload Mix of each system component? (for example: 20% log-in, 40% search, 30% item select, 10% checkout).\n What is the System Workload Mix? [Multiple workloads may be simulated in a single performance test] (for example: 30% Workload A, 20% Workload B, 50% Workload C).\n  A stable build of the system which must resemble the production environment as closely as is possible.\n To ensure consistent results, the performance testing environment should be isolated from other environments, such as  user acceptance testing (UAT) or development. As a best practice it is always advisable to have a separate performance testing environment resembling the production environment as much as possible.\n  In performance testing, it is often crucial for the test conditions to be similar to the expected actual use. However, in practice this is hard to arrange and not wholly possible, since production systems are subjected to unpredictable workloads. Test workloads may mimic occurrences in the production environment as far as possible, but only in the simplest systems can one exactly replicate this workload variability.\n Loosely-coupled architectural implementations (e.g.:  SOA) have created additional complexities with performance testing. To truly replicate production-like states, enterprise services or assets that share a common  infrastructure or platform require coordinated performance testing, with all consumers creating production-like transaction volumes and load on shared infrastructures or platforms. Because this activity is so complex and costly in money and time, some organizations now use tools to monitor and simulate production-like conditions (also referred as &#34;noise&#34;) in their performance testing environments ( PTE) to understand capacity and resource requirements and verify / validate quality attributes.\n  It is critical to the cost performance of a new system that performance test efforts begin at the inception of the development project and extend through to deployment. The later a performance defect is detected, the higher the cost of remediation. This is true in the case of functional testing, but even more so with performance testing, due to the end-to-end nature of its scope. It is crucial for a performance test team to be involved as early as possible, because it is time-consuming to acquire and prepare the testing environment and other key performance requisites.\n    This part of performance testing mainly deals with creating/scripting the work flows of key identified business processes. This can be done using a wide variety of tools like  HP LoadRunner,  NeoLoad,  Apache JMeter,  Rational Performance Tester,  Silk Performer,  Gatling, and  Flood.\n Each of the tools mentioned in the above list (which is not exhaustive nor complete) either employs a scripting language (C, Java, JS) or some form of visual representation (drag and drop) to create and simulate end user work flows. Most of the tools allow for something called &#34;Record &amp; Replay&#34;, where in the performance tester will launch the testing tool, hook it on a browser or thick client and capture all the network transactions which happen between the client and server. In doing so a script is developed which can be enhanced/modified to emulate various business scenarios.\n  This forms the other face of performance testing. With performance monitoring, the behaviour and response characteristics of the application under test are observed. The below parameters are usually monitored during the a performance test execution\n   As a first step, the patterns generated by these 4 parameters provide a good indication on where the bottleneck lies. To determine the exact root cause of the issue,  software engineers use tools such as  profilers to measure what parts of a device or software contribute most to the poor performance, or to establish throughput levels (and thresholds) for maintained acceptable response time.\n  Performance testing technology employs one or more PCs or Unix servers to act as injectors, each emulating the presence of numbers of users and each running an automated sequence of interactions (recorded as a script, or as a series of scripts to emulate different types of user interaction) with the host whose performance is being tested. Usually, a separate PC acts as a test conductor, coordinating and gathering metrics from each of the injectors and collating performance data for reporting purposes. The usual sequence is to ramp up the load: to start with a few virtual users and increase the number over time to a predetermined maximum. The test result shows how the performance varies with the load, given as number of users vs. response time. Various tools are available to perform such tests. Tools in this category usually execute a suite of tests which emulate real users against the system. Sometimes the results can reveal oddities, e.g., that while the average response time might be acceptable, there are outliers of a few key transactions that take considerably longer to complete \u2013 something that might be caused by inefficient database queries, pictures, etc.\n Performance testing can be combined with  stress testing, in order to see what happens when an acceptable load is exceeded. Does the system crash? How long does it take to recover if a large load is reduced? Does its failure cause collateral damage?\n Analytical Performance Modeling is a method to model the behaviour of a system in a spreadsheet. The model is fed with measurements of transaction resource demands ( CPU, disk I/O,  LAN,  WAN), weighted by the transaction-mix (business transactions per hour). The weighted transaction resource demands are added up to obtain the hourly resource demands and divided by the hourly resource capacity to obtain the resource loads. Using the responsetime formula (R=S/(1-U), R=responsetime, S=servicetime, U=load), responsetimes can be calculated and calibrated with the results of the performance tests. Analytical performance modeling allows evaluation of design options and system sizing based on actual or anticipated business use. It is therefore much faster and cheaper than performance testing, though it requires thorough understanding of the hardware platforms.\n   Decide whether to use internal or external resources to perform the tests, depending on inhouse expertise (or lack of it)\n   Develop a detailed performance  test plan (including detailed scenarios and  test cases, workloads, environment info, etc.)\n  Specify test data needed and charter effort (often overlooked, but vital to carrying out a valid performance test)\n    Configure the test environment (ideally identical hardware to the production platform), router configuration, quiet network (we don&#39;t want results upset by other users), deployment of server instrumentation, database test sets developed, etc.\n Dry run the tests - before actually executing the load test with predefined users, a dry run is carried out in order to check the correctness of the script\n Execute tests \u2013 probably repeatedly (iteratively) in order to see whether any unaccounted-for factor might affect the results\n Analyze the results - either pass/fail, or investigation of critical path and recommendation of corrective action\n   According to the Microsoft Developer Network the Performance Testing Methodology consists of the following activities:\n Identify the Test Environment. Identify the physical  test environment and the production environment as well as the tools and resources available to the test team. The physical environment includes hardware, software, and network configurations. Having a thorough understanding of the entire test environment at the outset enables more efficient  test design and planning and helps you identify testing challenges early in the project. In some situations, this process must be revisited periodically throughout the project&#39;s  life cycle.\n Identify Performance Acceptance Criteria. Identify the response time, throughput, and resource-use goals and constraints. In general, response time is a user concern, throughput is a business concern, and resource use is a system concern. Additionally, identify project success criteria that may not be captured by those goals and constraints; for example, using performance tests to evaluate which combination of configuration settings will result in the most desirable performance characteristics.\n Plan and Design Tests. Identify key  scenarios, determine variability among representative users and how to  simulate that variability, define test data, and establish metrics to be collected. Consolidate this information into one or more models of system usage to be implemented, executed, and analyzed.\n Configure the Test Environment. Prepare the test environment, tools, and resources necessary to execute each strategy, as features and components become available for test. Ensure that the test environment is instrumented for resource monitoring as necessary.\n  Execute the Test. Run and monitor your tests. Validate the tests, test data, and  results collection. Execute validated tests for analysis while monitoring the test and the test environment.\n Analyze Results, Tune, and Retest. Analyse, Consolidate and share results data. Make a tuning change and retest. Compare the results of both tests. Each improvement made will return smaller improvement than the previous improvement. When do you stop? When you reach a CPU bottleneck, the choices then are either improve the code or add more CPU.", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:55:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,\u6027\u80fd,performance,\u6d4b\u8bd5", "title": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u8bd5", "title_en": "Software Performance Testing", "transed": 1, "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_performance_testing", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "\u6027\u80fd", "\u6d4b\u8bd5"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e61744fa7701255597adc58d6481948b.jpg", "infoid": 1011206, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\u9053\u683c\u62c9\u65af\u00b7R\u00b7\u970d\u592b\u65bd\u5854\u7279(Douglas R.Hofstadter)\u7684https://www.dropbox.com/s/mhtvh64qjy5qoe0/quine.py?dl=0 G\u00f6del\uff0c\u57c3\u820d\u5c14\uff0c\u5df4\u8d6b\uff1ahttps://amzn.to/2C3NPiC", "note_en": "Code shown in the video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mhtvh64qjy5qoe0/quine.py?dl=0 G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach by Douglas R.

"note_en": "I had hoped to write about electric bikes this week, as part of my ongoing effort  to live without a car. I was also considering weighing in on Uber\u2019s  purchase of the Postmates food delivery service and its implications for the already beleaguered restaurant industry. Or, perhaps the rumors that Twitter is considering a subscription service. Or, and this is interesting, the spectacular I.P.O. of the insurance industry disrupter Lemonade.\n  Every week, it seems that the giant social network makes news, typically of the kind that makes the company look bad, and typically by declining to get out of the way of the history that is being made.\n Just last week, after hundreds of advertisers joined a boycott of Facebook, its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, cavalierly shrugged off the effort by a group of concerned civil rights groups and told his employees that, \u201cMy guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough.\u201d\n He said this as the company\u2019s second in charge, the chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, was reportedly going around trying to persuade those marketers to do just that.\n The pair also tried and failed, via Zoom, to appease a passel of those civil rights organizations \u2014 including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Color of Change and others \u2014 who are justifiably sick and tired of all talk and no action from Facebook.\n These groups have been behind the advertiser boycott in which hundreds of companies, including the giant Unilever, have temporarily pushed the pause button on marketing on the platform. They also brought  a list of 10 demands, which they have pushed for before to no avail.\n It went about as well as an appearance by President Trump at a mask-lovers convention.\n Among the comments from the attendees: \u201cspin,\u201d \u201cvery disappointing,\u201d \u201cfunctionally flawed.\u201d Rashad Robinson of Color of Change, summing it all up for The Times, said: \u201cThey showed up to the meeting expecting an A for attendance. Attending alone is not enough.\u201d\n Facebook actually got an F, too, this week in an independent report that the company had commissioned about itself. The report decried Facebook\u2019s decisions about how to protect its users from discriminatory content, including in ads. It called Facebook\u2019s actions \u2014 including a recent decision by Mr. Zuckerberg not to pull down incendiary posts by Mr. Trump \u2014 a \u201csignificant setback for civil rights.\u201d\n Well, that\u2019s pretty disastrous \u2014 and utterly right. Sadly, the 89-page report was not much of a surprise to most critics of the company, which has been slow-walking its responsibility over hate speech and a range of other toxic waste on its platform since,  well, always.\n Mr. Zuckerberg has tried for a while to wrap himself up in the First Amendment \u2014 getting the whole point of the words of that amendment wrong nearly every time \u2014 and he has insisted that he does not want to be an \u201carbiter of truth.\u201d Yet he has set up the company in such a way \u2014 completely under his sway \u2014 that suggests he has to be, in fact, an arbiter of truth.\n With Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s overwhelming voting and corporate power, there is no reason to have a board \u2014 which is why board members with backbones, like Reed Hastings and Ken Chenault, have left \u2014 and every reason to put the responsibility for cleaning up the mess squarely at Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s feet.\n I keep trying to figure out a way to explain what is happening \u2014 actually, to explain why nothing is happening \u2014 with a fresh metaphor. Once, I compared Facebook to a city manager who treats the streets like  The Purge. The Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, likened Facebook to a cigarette company. And still others have likened it to a chemical company that carelessly spews noxious information into the river of society.\n This week, I finally settled on a simpler comparison: Think about Facebook as a seller of meat products.\n Most of the meat is produced by others, and some of the cuts are delicious and uncontaminated. But tainted meat \u2014 say, Trump steaks \u2014 also gets out the door in ever increasing amounts and without regulatory oversight.\n The argument from the head butcher is this: People should be free to eat rotten hamburger, even if it wreaks havoc on their gastrointestinal tract, and the seller of the meat should not be the one to tell them which meat is good and which is bad (even though the butcher can tell in most cases).\n Basically, the message is that you should find the truth through vomiting and \u2014 so sorry \u2014 maybe even death.\n In this, Mr. Zuckerberg is serving up a rancid meal that he says he\u2019s not comfortable cooking himself, even as his hands control every aspect of the operation. Which is why I say to him and every executive at Facebook: You cannot hold on to such enormous power and avoid responsibility when things get tough.\n \u201cMany in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression,\u201d the report said. It was written by civil rights lawyers Laura W. Murphy and Megan Cacace, who also flagged worries about the impact on the 2020 election.\n \u201cFacebook has made policy and enforcement choices that leave our election exposed to interference by the president and others who seek to use misinformation to sow confusion and suppress voting,\u201d they wrote, making it clear that what Facebook does counts a lot.\n Of course, Ms. Sandberg, who has increasingly played blocker for Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s very bad calls, posted about the report in a who-me style that has now become a joke for those of us who follow the company. Noting that the report was \u201cthe beginning of the journey, not the end\u201d for Facebook, she concluded that \u201cwhat has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go.\u201d\n Beginning? Increasingly clear? That\u2019s just \u2014 as they say in the meat biz \u2014 tripe. The real sizzle is that Mr. Zuckerberg told employees to wait out the advertiser boycott.\n As always, Facebook is making us more nauseous than ever, as its own report, its own advertisers, its own employees are telling us. But we\u2019re all still hungry for leadership from Mr. Zuckerberg.\n I know I am. So next week, I promise, I am going to make a sweet column about Lemonade out of all these bitter lemons.\n  The Times is committed to publishing   a diversity of letters  to the editor.

"note_en": "Much of artificial intelligence (AI) in common use is dedicated to predicting people\u2019s behavior. It tries to anticipate your next purchase, your next mouse-click, your next job move. But such techniques can run into problems when they are used to analyze data for health and development programs. If we do not know the root causes of behavior, we could easily make poor decisions and support ineffective and prejudicial policies.\n AI, for example, has made it possible for health-care systems to predict which patients are likely to have the most complex medical needs. In the United States, risk-prediction software is being applied to roughly 200 million people to anticipate which patients would benefit from extra medical care now, based on how much they are likely to cost the health-care system in the future. It employs predictive machine learning, a class of self-adaptive algorithms that improve their accuracy as they are provided new data. But as health researcher Ziad Obermeyer and his colleagues showed in a  recent article in  Science magazine, this particular tool had an unintended consequence: black patients who had more chronic illnesses than white patients were not flagged as needing extra care.\n What went wrong? The algorithm used insurance claims data to predict patients\u2019 future health needs based on their recent health costs. But the algorithm\u2019s designers had not taken into account that health-care spending on black Americans is typically lower than on white Americans with similar health conditions, for reasons unrelated to how sick they are\u2014such as barriers to health-care access, inadequate health care, or lack of insurance. Using health-care costs as a proxy for illness led the predictive algorithm to make recommendations that were accurate for white patients\u2014lower health-care spending was the consequence of fewer health conditions\u2014but perpetuated racial biases in care for black patients. The researchers notified the manufacturer, which ran tests using its own data, confirmed the problem, and collaborated with the researchers to remove the bias from the algorithm.\n This story illustrates one of the perils of certain types of AI. No matter how sophisticated, predictive algorithms and their users can fall into the trap of equating correlation with causation\u2014in other words, of thinking that because event X precedes event Y, X must be the cause of Y. A predictive model is useful for establishing the correlation between an event and an outcome. It says, \u201cWhen we observe X, we can predict that Y will occur.\u201d But this is not the same as showing that Y occurs  because of X. In the case of the health-care algorithm, higher rates of illness (X) were correctly correlated with higher health-care costs (Y) for white patients. X caused Y, and it was therefore accurate to use health-care costs as a predictor of future illness and health-care needs. But for black patients, higher rates of illness did not in general lead to higher costs, and the algorithm would not accurately predict their future health-care needs. There was correlation but not causation.\n This matters as the world increasingly turns to AI to help solve pressing health and development challenges. Relying solely on predictive models of AI in areas as diverse as health care, justice, and agriculture risks devastating consequences when correlations are mistaken for causation. Therefore, it is imperative that decision makers also consider another AI approach\u2014 causal AI, which can help identify the precise relationships of cause and effect. Identifying the root causes of outcomes is not causal AI\u2019s only advantage; it also makes it possible to model interventions that can change those outcomes, by using causal AI algorithms to ask what-if questions. For example, if a specific training program is implemented to improve teacher competency, by how much should we expect student math test scores to improve? Simulating scenarios to evaluate and compare the potential effect of an intervention (or group of interventions) on an outcome avoids the time and expense of lengthy tests in the field.\n Certainly, predictive AI algorithms have an important role to play if applied and used correctly. A good example is  precision agriculture, which uses predictive AI to process data from satellite imagery and sensors to help farmers predict crop yields, detect disease and weeds, and recognize different species of plants. But being able to predict an outcome is not the same as understanding what actually causes it. Predicting that a farmer\u2019s crop yield will be lower this year is one thing; understanding why makes it possible to take steps to increase the harvest.\n Another challenge with using only predictive models is a fundamental lack of knowledge about why they make particular predictions in the first place. This is a problem with  deep learning\u2014the kind of predictive AI that\u2019s at work in precision agriculture. Deep learning was inspired by how human brain cells are organized (in \u201clayers\u201d) and how they communicate with each other (taking input signals from cells of one layer, transforming the signals, and outputting the transformed signals to cells of another layer). Unlike commonly used methods for predicting outcomes\u2014such as  regression, a traditional statistical technique that maps the relationships between variables to the predicted outcome with a single best mathematical formula\u2014deep learning can map variables to outcomes with much more complex relationships between them. By combining multiple layers between the input variables and outcomes, deep learning algorithms can learn input-output relationships far more complex than a single mathematical formula and use them to predict outcomes. However, the links and intermediaries between variables are \u201cblack boxed,\u201d meaning that the users\u2014and even the creators\u2014of the algorithms cannot easily discern how the variables relate to the outcome and to each other. This means it is often impossible to know which input features deep learning models have used to make their predictions.\n This opacity is unacceptable when dealing with the trajectory of people\u2019s lives, such as in the US criminal justice system. In 2016, 2.3 million American adults, or one in 111, were in  prison, housed at great cost to federal and state governments. Courts throughout the United States have introduced \u201crecidivism scores\u201d in an attempt to lower incarceration costs by reducing the number of inmates without increasing crime. The recidivism score is a single number reached through a predictive algorithm that estimates the likelihood that a person convicted of a crime will reoffend. In theory, the score makes it possible for a judge to focus on incarcerating those more likely to commit additional crimes, and it should even help to remove potential bias in sentencing. But recidivism scores are inherently faulty because they are based on risk-assessment tools that pick up statistical correlations rather than causations. For example, low income is correlated with crime, but that does not mean it causes crime. Yet people from low-income households may automatically be assigned a high recidivism score, and as a result they are more likely to be sentenced to prison. Fixing the criminal justice system requires a focus on understanding the causes of crime, not merely its correlates.\n A closer look at causal AI will show how it can open up the black box within which purely predictive models of AI operate. Causal AI can move beyond correlation to highlight the precise relationships between causes and effects.\n  The importance of testing causality is not new in either the health or development sectors. A straightforward way to do it is to conduct an intervention in people randomly assigned to one population group, known as the treatment group, and conduct no intervention in an otherwise identical group, known as the control group. By comparing the results between the two groups, it\u2019s possible to isolate the effect of the intervention. In clinical studies this is known as a  randomized controlled trial, and in marketing research it\u2019s called  A/B testing.\n Development economists Michael Kremer, Abhijit Banerjee, and Esther Duflo were awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019 for spearheading the application of randomized controlled trials to identify root causes of development issues and to design solutions. Such trials have overturned some conventional wisdom about causality. For example, numerous observational studies had identified associations between vitamin D deficiency and increased risks of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. But randomized controlled trials  demonstrated that vitamin D supplements do not reduce the risks of these conditions\u2014they have not found a causal link between vitamin D supplements and health outcomes.\n Randomized controlled trials, however, have limitations. Large groups of individuals are required to ensure that the results aren\u2019t biased or affected by coincidental, outlier characteristics such as age, sex, health status, or educational level. This tends to make such trials extremely expensive (in the millions of dollars) and time-consuming (they can take years to conduct). Furthermore, randomized controlled trials can test the effect of only one or at most a few bundled interventions at a time, despite the fact that health and social outcomes are complex, with many underlying drivers. Finally, they can predict only whether an intervention will cause an effect on a typical member of the treatment group, not on a specific individual.\n This is where causal AI comes in. It offers new opportunities to test causality in individuals and population groups faster and more efficiently, along with the ability to unravel the underlying complexity. It allows researchers and program designers to simulate an intervention and infer causality by relying on already available data.\n  There are two approaches to causal AI that are based on long-known principles: the potential outcomes framework and causal graph models. Both approaches make it possible to test the effects of a potential intervention using real-world data. What makes them AI are the powerful underlying algorithms used to reveal the causal patterns in large data sets. But they differ in the number of potential causes that they can test for.\n To understand the two methods and how they work\u2014as well as their differences\u2014consider the following hypothetical scenario: Researchers wanted to discover if an antismoking advertising campaign persuaded people to quit, but there was no control group because the ads were released nationally. They only had a data set showing whether individuals were exposed to the ads, whether they gave up smoking, and information on their demographics and other health behaviors. Even without a control group, causal AI provides ways to infer causality.\n The potential outcomes framework, proposed by statisticians Paul  Rosenbaum and Donald  Rubin in 1983, compares the outcome (quitting smoking) of an individual who has been exposed to the cause of interest (the antismoking ad) with an inferred \u201cpotential outcome\u201d of the same individual had he/she not been exposed. The challenge is of course that no data exists on nonexposure outcomes for a person who was in fact exposed to the campaign. So, for each individual who was exposed to the ad, the AI algorithms instead find an individual in the data set who was not exposed to the ad but who is identical in other significant respects (such as age, race, and education). In other words, an artificial control group is reverse engineered to mimic a randomized controlled trial. The limitation is that while it is able to solve the problem of having no control group, the potential outcomes framework can test the effect of only one prespecified intervention at a time\u2014in this case, did the ad campaign lead to that person\u2019s decision to quit smoking?\n Causal graph models, by contrast, can do more than test a single pair of variables for their cause-and-effect relationship. They can be used as exploratory tools to map all the different causal pathways to an outcome of interest and show how different variables relate to each other. Applying a causal graph to our antismoking campaign might show that exposure to the ad in a pharmacy caused some people to stop smoking directly but others to buy nicotine patches, which in turn caused them to quit.\n There are several causal graph models. One widely used method is the structural equation model, in which researchers specify the variables that may interact and how they might do so, and the model then analyzes the data to reveal whether they actually do. While this model can test many such relationships in the data, the whole network of interaction between different variables needs to be specified using existing knowledge. The limitation of this model is that it tests only the linkages between the hypothesized variables: If the variables that actually cause the effect are not included among the specified ones, they won\u2019t be evaluated against the other options.\n Another causal graph method is the  causal Bayesian network, a term coined in the 1980s by computer scientist and philosopher Judea Pearl and named for 18th-century English statistician Thomas Bayes. This method estimates the relationships between all variables in a data set. It results in an intuitive visual map showing which variables influence each other, as well as the extent of their influence. The advantage of this approach is that, unlike in a structural equation model, these interactions do not need to be specified ahead of the test, making it a true discovery method.\n Although causal Bayesian networks require an abundance of data to capture the universe of possible variables, the potential of this approach is exciting for several reasons. It enables the data-driven discovery of multiple causal relationships at the same time. In the example of the antismoking ad campaign, a causal Bayesian network might show how advertising and the availability of different quit-smoking aids each affected people\u2019s behavior, or it might reveal how  personal aspirations played a role. Equally important, unlike the black box of predictive AI, in the causal AI approach the relationships between the variables (exposure to ads, the availability of nicotine patches) and the outcome (stopping smoking) become visible to researchers, program implementers, and policy makers.\n Causal graphic models also make it possible to simulate many possible interventions simultaneously. For example, what if different antismoking ads targeted different age groups or combined a general campaign with outreach by peer educators? They also allow for the incorporation of expert knowledge to counter the possible limitations of a purely data-driven approach. Experts can, for instance, help to determine which variables should go into the model, they can place conditions on the model to improve its accuracy, and they can help understand results that are counterintuitive.\n  The field of causal AI is evolving rapidly. As its potential becomes more apparent, researchers are putting it to work in fields as diverse as climate change and health, demonstrating its broad potential.\n Climate change | Causal AI techniques have been applied to climate change to understand whether and how humans are one of its contributing causes and what drives people\u2019s beliefs about it. To investigate this question, British scientists used a causal AI technique called  counterfactual event attribution in the potential outcomes framework to determine whether human-produced greenhouse gas emissions were an  underlying cause of the deadly European heatwave of 2003, which by some estimates was responsible for more than  70,000 deaths. Using historical data, solar data, information on volcanic eruptions, and atmospheric data on greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone, the researchers simulated summer temperatures across Europe in 2003, with and without the impact of humans. They found that the heatwave was much more likely to occur when the model included activities such as air travel or electricity production than when those effects were excluded. Published in 2004, this was one of the first studies linking an extreme weather event to human activity, and it provided a powerful argument for reducing the greenhouse gases generated by such activity. The research has been cited by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n Causal AI has also identified the factors that lead people to become more polarized in their beliefs about climate change.  Researchers surveyed participants from the United States and Australia and used Bayesian networks to model how different people responded to a range of messaging about climate change. They found that when presented with consensus information about climate change in an online survey, Americans who actively distrusted climate scientists responded by updating their beliefs in the  opposite direction of the information they were given. This causal framework provided a new way to estimate the interconnected relationships between worldviews, scientific beliefs, and trust in scientists. Insights like this are important for shaping public perceptions of the need for action to combat climate change. Such results  provide a framework for designing interventional messaging that takes into account how participants might react to information, based on their beliefs and backgrounds.\n Childhood diarrhea | Causal AI offers opportunities to address widespread and complex health problems where other approaches have not been successful. Childhood diarrhea is one example. This illness is the second biggest cause of death globally among children under 5 years of age. Many factors are associated with diarrhea, but it is extremely challenging to disentangle the causal pathways, both biological and structural, of diarrheal disease. This makes designing effective interventions difficult.\n A  study in Pakistan used data from a national survey of more than 110,000 individuals from more than 15,000 households. The survey included household, social, environmental, and economic variables. When using multivariate regression, a traditional statistical technique, the researchers found 12 household variables that were significantly associated with diarrhea. However, these were not easy to interpret: For example, one variable was the number of rooms in the household. By contrast, analyzing the same data set with a causal Bayesian network produced a network map revealing three variables that directly influenced diarrheal disease in children: the use of dry-pit latrines rather than toilets connected to drains; reliance on a water source other than piped, river, or stream water; and lack of formal trash collection. If incorporated societally or by national policy, these insights could lead to effective interventions to reduce childhood diarrheal disease.\n Maternal and newborn mortality rates | Mortality rates remain stubbornly high in many low-income countries for mothers and their newborns. Women delivering their babies at health-care facilities is critical for the survival and well-being of both mother and infant. Through a national incentive scheme that pays families to deliver their babies at facilities (300 Indian rupees [around $4] for the hospital delivery itself, and a further 300 Indian rupees if the mother has also made use of antenatal care), the Indian government has been able to rapidly improve the rate of institutional delivery. However, in many Indian states this trend has plateaued at about 80 percent.\n At Surgo Foundation, we tried to understand why women were not choosing institutional delivery and what kinds of additional interventions were needed in order to get them to do so. Our work has used a variety of techniques,  including causal AI, to identify why some f\n......", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:53:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker

The contract will be worth\u00a0600 million euros over five years.\n  In  the Israeli high-tech sector, these are the kind of numbers that make a company a juicy acquisition target. And remarkably, the contract is not only huge, it\u2019s Aquarius\u2019 first.\n  Aquarius has designed an engine that can be used to bring power to remote locations across Asia. Field tests in the Philippines will start later this year, followed by mass production, according to a report by Bloomberg News.\n   The technology &#34;enables us to open huge markets that were once totally off-limits,\u201d Stuart Hendry, vice president of Nokia Enterprise, Asia Pacific, told Bloomberg. \u201cWe will have the ability to supply power to those residing in extremely isolated areas such as remote islands, high in the mountains or deep in the jungle.\u201d\n  \u201cWhen we came the first time, they scheduled a meeting for us at 12:20. Do you know what that means? That we have 10 minutes because at 12:30 the Austrians eat lunch. That\u2019s what they thought of us in the industry.\u201d\n Gal Fridman\n The founders of Aquarius.

Credit: David Bachar\n To understand why a multinational company would commit hundreds of millions of dollars in a deal with  a tiny startup, a short history of the engine is probably necessary.\n  The four-stroke internal combustion engine was invented by Nicholas Otto in Germany 150 years ago. Several years later, two of his employees, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach, developed a four-piston engine. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s the engine that we have been familiar with up to now. Nothing has changed,\u201d says Gal Fridman, Aquarius\u2019 chairman and one of its three founders. \u201cThey\u2019ve added a computer, added turbo, but the change is minor, and since the patent has already expired, all of the motor vehicle manufacturers are still using this combustion and gas exchange system.\u201d\n   The four-stroke engine works in four steps: intake, compression, combustion (ignition) and exhaust. The combustion releases energy, with the piston pushed upwards again. This linear motion is converted into a rotational motion by a crankshaft, which drives the vehicle forward.\n  In a standard gasoline engine, the process requires valves and spark plugs. The conversion of linear to rotational motion creates much friction that must be reduced with oil. But the lubricant gets hot and emits smoke, coating the engine in soot. In short, it\u2019s not an elegant process.\n  When Aquarius CEO Ariel Gorfung was first approached by Shaul Yaacoby with the idea for an innovative new engine design, he was suspicious. Gorfung was running a venture capital fund and is well-known in  the Israel high-tech industry. He\u2019s seen a lot of business proposals over the years. \u201cI knew he was a genius, but I was still apprehensive,\u201d he recalls. Yaacoby, who today is Aquarius\u2019 chief technology officer, was not an engineer.\n     Yaacoby\u2019s idea for a linear internal combustion engine is conceptually speaking nothing new. The first patents for one were registered as early as 1940. There is even a Wikipedia entry on a free-piston linear generator. But the concept was tested and abandoned many times \u2013 it remained the elusive Holy Grail of the transportation industry.\n  Still, in recent years some 15 groups around the world have been working towards a smiliar thing, including big shots like Japan\u2019s Toyota and the German space agency. The latter has been at it since 2002, but the idea hasn\u2019t gotten further than articles in academic journals.\n  \u201cThe dream has never been abandoned. There are all kinds of serious groups with high hopes trying to build a two-stroke linear engine again. Aquarius is one of them and I wish them luck,\u201d says Prof. Eran Sher, an expert on internal combustion engines. \u201cThey all feature a two-stroke internal combustion engine that has no crankshaft but moves freely within the cylinder housing. There are a lot of problems in this configuration related to engine stability, timing and consistent operation, which is why this idea has failed so far.\u201d\n   Aquarius\u2019 main competitor is the U.S. company Mainspring Energy, which was founded in 2010 by three Stanford graduates and is developing a linear generator that uses a low-temperature reaction of air and fuel to drive magnets through copper coils to produce electricity. It\u2019s raised $133 million from investors that include Bill Gates and says it will have its first commercial engine on the market this year.\n  Could an Israeli autodidact have succeeded where a team of German Ph.D.s and Toyota have failed?\n  \u201cA fair question,\u201d admits Gorfung. \u201cAt the beginning we were sheepish about asking money from others. We used our own capital and went to a lathe workshop in Ra\u2019anana, and that\u2019s how we built the first prototype.\u201d\n  Armed with that prototype, they raised $3 million in 2015 from local investors such as banker Leon Recanati and industrialist Zvi Yemini. But before they dared do that, the team decided to get a professional opinion about the engine, for which they had to go abroad. \u201cThere was no one to ask because in Israel we know about  rocket engines for missiles, but there isn\u2019t a lot of knowledge about internal combustion engines,\u201d recalls Fridman.\n   They turned to the Austrian company AVL, which is known worldwide for its engine expertise. \u201cWhen we came the first time, they scheduled a meeting for us at 12:20. Do you know what that means? That we have 10 minutes because at 12:30 the Austrians eat lunch. That\u2019s what they thought of us in the industry,\u201d says Fridman.\n  \u201cThey told us that what we are showing them is too good to be true, that it could never work, that everyone had tried and failed .... It took a year and half for AVL to get back to us, but today they are still conducting tests for us and one of our engines has been installed and is running at a factory in Gratz, Austria,\u201d he says.\n  Aquarius still struggles to be taken seriously. \u201cWe had a hard time recruiting employees,\u201d recalls Fridman. \u201cThe first engineer we hired was Pierre Detre, who was Formula One engineer for Renault and Toyota. He didn\u2019t want to hear from us at all. Ariel had to wait for him outside his house to get a chance to talk to him. Today, he\u2019s our chief engineer.\u201d\n  Eventually, the AVL test results came back. Fridman and Gorfung were confident it would meet emission standards but they were concerned if it would meet efficiency benchmarks, in other words the ability to convert gasoline into mechanical energy. Worldwide, the rate is 20%, which adds up to a lot of wasted energy.\n  \u201cWhen we talked among ourselves, Ariel and I, we said that if it reaches 22% efficiency, we\u2019ll close the company. If we get to 27%, we\u2019ve got a problem and if it\u2019s over that \u2013 that was our dream. The first measurements showed 34% efficiency. That makes us a world champion of engines. Sometimes you hear about reaching 39% but that happens at certain points, let\u2019s say at 8,000 rotations per minute. Our engine works at a consistent rate so it\u2019s always efficient,\u201d says Fridman.\n   The Aquarius engine is light, weighing 10.5 kilograms, compared with 120 for a conventional engine. It contains just 12 parts and only one of them moves, compared with 200 moving parts in a regular engine. It has just one piston where explosions are created inside a valveless cylinder moves the piston conductor right and left at great speed. The end of the rod is connected to a magnet that moves inside metal coils, generating electricity with each stroke. All this makes the engine simple to manufacture, and cheap and easy to operate. Theoretically, it should suffer fewer breakdowns.\n  As the engine has accumulated working hours and test results, Aquarius has raised more capital \u2013 a total of $40 million as of today from investors that include Marius Nacht, a founder of Israel\u2019s Check Point Software Technology; Dr. Gideon Stein, chief scientist at the self-driving technology company Mobileye, Japanese auto parts maker Musashi Seimitsu and Hollywood producer Avi Lerner. Aquarius has also received a $5 million grant from the Polish government because most of its development team is based there.\n  Its biggest investor is Shlomo Elia, a well-known figure in the Israeli defense industry and the first outside to back the company.\n  Early on, Aquarius had approached the automobile industry certain that its engine would find its place under the hoods of the world\u2019s cars. It never happened. Auto making is a conservative industry subject to heavy regulation and it wasn\u2019t easy to convince companies to revolutionize. Like many startups, Aquarius had to undertake a strategic pivot into a different market segment, which turned out to be generators.\n     \u201cIf you think about it, to call it an engine is incorrect,\u201d says Fridman. \u201cIt should be called a converter. You put in one kind of energy and take out another kind. We thought in terms of making wheels turn, but in the end we chose to convert gasoline to electricity.\u201d\n  One big market is in the telecommunications industry, says Gorfung. Today, around the world there are 4.5 million antennas using for mobile communications, but next-generation 5G technology will increase that to 20 million. About 15% of them need to be powered by generators that sell for between $5,000 and $12,000 each \u2013 a $15 billion market. The entire global market for generators is worth $100 billion.\n  \u201cIn India there are about a million communication points, and if they\u2019re powered by a generator you need to replace the oil after 250 hours of operation,\u201d says Fridman. \u201cWhat do you think they do with the burned oil? In Switzerland, they may dispose it properly, but in a lot of places they just pour it on the ground and put in new oil, which ruins the environment.&#34; Maintenance has to be done after every 1,000 hours.\n  \u201cWhat do you think they do with the burned oil? In Switzerland, they may dispose it properly, but in a lot of places they just pour it on the ground and put in new oil, which ruins the environment.&#34;\n Aquarius Chairman Gal Fridman\n A man fixes a generator in Khan Yunis, Gaza Strip. Credit: IBRAHEEM ABU MUSTAFA / Reuters\n \u201cWe chose generators because it\u2019s a market that\u2019s sensitive to maintenance and logistics, and that\u2019s where we have an advantage. Even if competitors like Caterpillar and General Electric were to offer their generators for free to eliminate the competition they would still need to provide service,\u201d he says.\n  Martin Hauske, the Asia Pacific Energy Segment sales leader at Nokia, calls Aquarius\u2019 technology trailblazing in terms of operating cost and maintenance. It is a perfect solution when you need to install a generator, for example, on an isolated island or remote places in Australia. Nokia is already talking to customers in the Philippines, New Zealand and other countries.\n  Hauske sees a market of 55 million Asians without access to electricity that could benefit. When Nokia looks at the future electricity grid, it sees something like a communications network that combines generators with solar panels and batteries. The Aquarius generator is part of this value proposition, he says.\n  Gorfung says that assuming the field trials are successful, Aquarius will start seeing revenues from the Nokia contract next year. The company still faces the problems involved in mass production.\n  \u201cThe challenges of mass production are huge, so we\u2019re going to do it by outsourcing with someone who takes responsibility to build the production line, undertake quality control and ship the product,\u201d he says.\n   The Aquarius generator, according to its website, is a meter long and weighs 100 kilograms. Competing generators weigh six times that much and have to be brought in by truck. The company won\u2019t discuss costs in detail, but they are about the same proportion to the competition as the weight.\n  The next goal for Aquarius is to develop an engine that doesn\u2019t use fossil fuel. \u201cBecause of our engine is so efficient, its emissions are low. But we have undertaken a series of developments that could bring them to zero \u2013 and it would be a non-fossil engine,\u201d says Gorfung. All in all, Aquarius amounts to a story of daring and ambition even by the standards of Israeli startups. Fridman acknowledges that but doesn\u2019t express any hesitation because any challenge less than that wouldn\u2019t interest him. That\u2019s why he had sold an early startup he had cofounded.\n  \u201cI was bored,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you heard of Transalp? It\u2019s the toughest competition in cycling \u2013 riding through the Alps in eight days, 160 kilometers a day on average. I did it twice. When I met Ariel and we started thinking about the idea [of Aquarius], I told him, \u2018I don\u2019t want to climb Mt. Tabor. I want to climb Everest. Maybe we won\u2019t reach the summit but it will be interesting.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-07-11 23:53:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "In a work-from-home world, hitting the local cafe for a daily caffeine fix has become a ritual of the now-forgotten past. And no matter how much kitchen brewing consumers take up, that just can\u2019t seem to make up for the demand blow.\n Global coffee consumption is set to fall this year for the first time since 2011, the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts. That\u2019s even with a huge surge in bean buying at the grocery store amid pantry loading. Shutdowns for cafes and restaurants -- which typically account for about 25% of demand -- were overwhelming, and it could be a while before things pick up again.\n The disappearance of cafe culture is happening in every major region. Researcher Marex Spectron estimates globally more than 95% of the out-of-home market was shuttered at some point during the pandemic. It\u2019s the latest cruel twist of the coronavirus, which has ripped so much away from people that not even the simple pleasure of lingering over a latte is safe.\n For Notes, a coffee-shop chain in London, restrictions are easing in the city, but most of its 10 cafes that cater to office workers remain closed.\n \u201cIt will be a slow and staggered comeback for us as a lot of the offices in London are not coming back on until after summer, and some may even open only next year,\u201d said co-founder Robert Robinson.\n Consumers have shown they\u2019re hesitant to dine out in droves again as economies reopen. Coffee shops, which often depend on morning commuters and afternoon breakers, have been especially hard hit. Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc. has lost much of its breakfast crowd during the coronavirus pandemic, while Starbucks Corp. is retooling its model, rolling out a \u201cpickup\u201d store format that doesn\u2019t have any of the tables and chairs that traditionally made its cafes a popular hang-out spot.\n \u201cIf you feel like having a cappuccino, ordering it online doesn\u2019t really work as coffee is all about the social aspect,\u201d said Robinson.\n A hobbled recovery for coffee demand could be devastating for the roughly 125 million globally that depend on the crop for their livelihood. Growers were already struggling through financial crisis after years of bumper harvests sparked a prolonged bear market. Citigroup Inc. predicts that futures for arabica beans could drop roughly 10% in the second half of the year to about 90 cents a pound, hovering near break-even costs. Meanwhile the International Coffee Organization has warned of the dangers of child labor in producing regions as poverty increases for farmers.\n Brazil\u2019s Suplicy Cafes Especiais, one of the country\u2019s largest cafe chains, was forced to postpone payments to farmers for cargoes that had already been delivered. Meanwhile, orders for new supplies will resume only gradually, Chief Executive Officer Felipe Braga said in a telephone interview.\n Suplicy operates 25 stores, the vast majority of which have been closed by Covid-19 restrictions since mid-March. A handful reopened recently amid easing lockdown restrictions, but then they were shuttered once again because not enough customers were coming through.\n \u201cSome of our franchising partners already warned us that they will close\u201d permanently, Braga said.\n Still, some shop operators are taking steps to change their business model, which could help spark some rebound.\n Max Crowley\u2019s two Bandit coffee shops in New York\u2019s Midtown and Chelsea neighborhoods remain \u201con pause,\u201d hobbled by the closure of local offices. Meanwhile, he\u2019s just opened up a new Hamptons location in the Town of Southampton, an enclave where many New York City dwellers fled to at the peak of the pandemic and where well-to-do residents spend summers.\n \u201cManhattan traffic is still very light. The Hamptons is very busy. It makes sense for us. It\u2019s where many of our customers go,\u201d Crowley said.\n  In Asia, the fastest-growing market for coffee, consumption at restaurants and cafes is expected to recover in the second half of the year as many countries emerge from lockdowns, according to Tan Heng Hong, APAC food and drink analyst at market research company Mintel. And the USDA also predicts a rebound in global demand next year.\n Still, a global second wave of infections could halt reopening plans. McDonald\u2019s Corp. has said its pausing the resumption of all dine-in services in its U.S. restaurants as the virus flares up in areas across the country. And even if stores open, fears of contagion could continue to keep customers away. Starbucks is operating about 95% of the company\u2019s U.S. stores, but comparable sales were down 43% in May.\n Plus there\u2019s the economic downturn, which generally spurs consumers to trim their dining out expenses.\n The Dalgona coffee sensation -- a fluffy, whipped beverage made from instant coffee that was popularized on social media -- shows that consumers are trying to recreate the fun cafe experience at home instead.
