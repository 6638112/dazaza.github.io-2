Then we all watched as the company’s valuation plummeted and its IPO plans went up in smoke. Today, WeWork is rumored to be   going public  via   a SPAC  at a $10 valuation, down significantly from  the $47 billion it was valued at after  raising $1 billion in its SoftBank-led Series H  round in January 2019.</p><p>并且随着越来越多的财产越来越舀出来，线路继续模糊。然后我们都观看了公司的估值暴跌，其IPO计划在烟雾中升起。如今，沃德沃德将通过SPAC估值，从470亿美元的价值大大降低，在2019年1月筹集了10亿美元的价格之后，从470亿美元的价值大大降低。</p><p> Co-founder and then-CEO Adam Neumann notoriously   stepped down  later that year amid allegations of a toxic combination of arrogance and poor management. WeWork has since been very publicly trying to redeem itself and turn around investor — and public — perception.</p><p> 联合创始人兼手德·纳米姆曼在那年晚些时候令人叹息地走下去，在指控傲慢和贫困管理的毒性结合。自从很高兴地努力兑换投资者和公众 - 感知，从那以来一直很公开。</p><p>  Chairman Marcelo Claure kicked off a strategic, five-year turnaround plan in earnest in February 2020. That same month, the beleaguered company named a real estate — not tech — exec as its   new CEO , a move that set tongues wagging.</p><p>  Marcelo Claure董事长在2020年2月开始获得战略五年的周转计划。同月，贝尔梅雷公司被评为房地产 - 不是技术 - 刽子手，作为其新首席执行官，这一举动舌头摇摆。</p><p> WeWork then also set a target of becoming   free cash flow positive  by a year to 2022 as part of its plan, which was aimed at both boosting valuation and winning back investor trust.</p><p> Wework然后还将一年的自由现金流量的目标设定为每年到2022年作为其计划的一部分，这是旨在提高估值和赢得投资者信任的旨在。</p><p> It likely saw the demise of competitor Knotel, which ended up   filing for bankruptcy  and selling assets to an investor, and realized it needed to learn from some of that company’s mistakes.</p><p> 它可能看到竞争对手的竞争对手的消亡，最终提出了破产和卖给投资者的资产，并意识到它需要学习其中一些公司的错误。</p><p>   Since the implementation of its turnaround plan, the company says it has exited out of over 100 pre-open or underperforming locations. (It still has   over 800 locations  globally, according to its website.) WeWork has also narrowed its net loss to $517 million in Q3 2020 from $1.2 billion in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>   公司自上行计划的实施以来，该公司表示，它已退出超过100个预先开放或表现不佳的地点。 （根据其网站，它仍然拥有超过800多个地点。）威斯威沃斯队在2019年第三季度的12亿美元起，纽约季度跌至5.17亿美元。</p><p> Meanwhile, revenue has taken a hit, presumably due to the impact of the coronavirus. Revenue slumped to $811 million the 2020 third quarter, compared with $934 million in Q3 2019.</p><p> 与此同时，收入受到了击中，可能是由于冠状病毒的影响。 2019年第三季度，收入跌至2020年第三季度811万美元。 </p><p>  With so many people being forced to work from home and avoiding others during the work day, the office space in general struggled. WeWork either had to adapt, or potentially deal with a bigger blow to its valuation and bottom line.</p><p>有了这么多人被迫在家中工作，在工作日期间避开别人，办公空间一般挣扎。 Wework要么不得不适应或可能对其估值和底线进行更大的打击。</p><p> WeWork’s dilemma is similar to  those of real estate companies around the world. With so many companies shifting to remote work not just temporarily, but also permanently, landlords everywhere have had to adjust.</p><p> Wework的困境类似于世界各地的房地产公司。有了这么多公司，不仅仅暂时转向遥远的工作，而且永久地，到处都是楼主必须调整。</p><p> For example, as McKinsey   recently pointed out , all landlords have been forced to be more flexible and restructure tenant leases. So in effect, anyone operating commercial real estate space has had to become more flexible, just as WeWork has.</p><p> 例如，正如麦肯锡最近指出的那样，所有地主都被迫更加灵活，重组租户租约。因此，随着Wework的拥有，经营商业房地产空间的任何人都必须变得更加灵活。</p><p> For its part, WeWork has taken a few steps to adapt. For one, it realized its membership-only plan was not going to work anymore, and a dip in membership was evidence of that. So, it worked to open its buildings to more people through new   On Demand  and   All Access  options. The goal was to give people who were weary of working out of their own homes a place to go, say one day a week, to work. WeWork also saw an opportunity to work with companies to offer up its office space as a perk via an All Access offering, as well as with universities that wanted to give their students an alternative place to study.</p><p> 就其部分而言，Wework采取了一些步骤来适应。对于一个，它意识到其唯一的成员计划不会再上班，并且会员资格的拨款证明了这一点。因此，它致力于通过新的需求和所有访问选项开设更多人。目标是给予疲惫的人，疲惫不堪，在他们自己的房屋中工作一个地方，一天一周，工作。 Wework还看到有机会与公司合作，通过所有访问权限以及想要为学生提供替代学习的大学提供办公空间。</p><p> For example,  Georgetown did a pretty unique partnership with WeWork to have one of its locations serve as “their replacement library and common space.” And,  companies like Brandwatch have recently shifted from leveraging WeWork’s traditional spaces to instead offer employees access to WeWork locations around the globe via All Access passes.</p><p> 例如，乔治城与Wework做出了一个非常独特的合作伙伴关系，使其其中一个地点成为“他们的替代图书馆和公共空间”。而且，Brandwatch等公司最近从利用Wework的传统空间转移，而是提供员工通过所有访问通行证提供员工访问全球的Wework位置。</p><p> WeWork has also launched new product features. At the beginning of the year, the company launched  the ability to book space on the weekend and outside of business hours.</p><p> Wework还推出了新产品功能。在年初，该公司在周末和营业时间之外推出了预订空间的能力。</p><p>   I talked with Prabhdeep Singh, WeWork’s global head of marketplace, who is overseeing the new products and also spearheading WeWork’s shift online, to learn more about the company’s new strategy.</p><p>   我与Prabhdeep Singh，Wework的全球市场负责人谈过，他正在监督新产品，也是在线推动Wework的转移，了解有关公司的新战略的更多信息。 </p><p> “What we’ve essentially done is unbundle our space,” he said. “It used to be that the only way to enjoy our spaces was via a bundled subscription product and monthly memberships. But we realized with COVID, the world was shifting, and to open up our platform to a broader group of people and make it as flexible as humanly possible. So they can now book a room for a half hour or get a day pass, for example. The use cases are so wide.”</p><p>“我们基本上做了什么是拖欠我们的空间，”他说。 “曾经是享受我们空间的唯一方法是通过捆绑的订阅产品和每月会员资格。但是，我们与Covid实现了，世界正在转移，并将我们的平台向更广泛的人开放，使其成为人类可能的灵活性。因此，他们现在可以预订一个半小时或一天的房间。用例非常宽。“</p><p> Since On Demand launched as a pilot in New York City in August 2020, demand has steadily been climbing, according to Singh. So far, reservations are up by 65% — and revenue up by 70% — over the 2020 fourth quarter. But of course, it’s still early and they were starting from a small base. Nearly two-thirds of On Demand reservations are made by repeat customers, he added.</p><p> 根据辛格的说法，自从纽约市成为纽约市飞行员的需求以来，需求稳步攀登。到目前为止，在2020年第四季度，预订高出65％ -  70％的收入增长了70％。但当然，它还在早期，他们从一个小基地开始。他补充说，近三分之二的需求预订是由重复客户进行的。</p><p> “Over the last year and a half, we’ve been really figuring out what things we want to focus on what things we don’t,” Singh said. “As a flexible space provider, we are looking at where the world is going. And while we’re a small part of the whole commercial office space industry, we are working to use technology to enable a flexible workspace experience via a great app and the digitization of our spaces.”</p><p> “在去年，一半，我们一直弄清楚我们想要专注于我们没有的事情的事情，”辛格说。 “作为灵活的空间提供商，我们正在寻找世界的位置。虽然我们是整个商业办公空间行业的一小部分，但我们正在努力使用技术来实现灵活的工作空间体验，并通过优秀的应用程序和我们的空间的数字化。“</p><p> For now, things seem to be looking up some. In February, WeWork says it had nearly twice as many active users compared to January. Also, people apparently like having the option to come in at off hours. Weekend bookings now account for an estimated 14.5% of total bookings.</p><p> 现在，事情似乎正在抬头看一些。 2月，韦德表示，与1月相比，它有几倍的活跃用户。此外，人们显然就像有选择在OFF时间进入。周末预订现在占总预订的14.5％。</p><p> Nearly double as many existing members purchased All Access passes in February 2020 compared to January to complement their existing private office space during COVID, the company said.</p><p> 该公司表示，与1月20日相比，许多现有成员购买所有访问通行证的两倍近似着两倍，以便在Covid期间补充其现有的私人办公空间。</p><p> In the beginning of the COVID-19, WeWork saw a   higher departure  of small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) than of its enterprise members, partially due to the nature of their businesses and the need to more immediately manage cash flow, the company said. But in the third quarter of 2020, SMB desk sales were up 50% over the second quarter.</p><p> 在Covid-19开始，WeWorks比其企业成员更高的中小型企业（SMBS）出发，部分原因是由于其业务的性质以及更多地立即管理现金流，而且。但在2020年的第三季度，第二季度SMB台面销售额增长了50％。</p><p> Interestingly, throughout the pandemic, WeWork has seen its enterprise segment grow at nearly double the rate of its SMBs, now making up over half of the company’s total membership base.</p><p> 有趣的是，在整个大流行中，WeWork已经看到其企业部门在其SMB的速度几乎增加了几乎两倍，现在弥补了公司总成员基础的一半。 </p><p>  While it’s slowing down investing in new real estate assets in certain markets, it is still working to “right-size” its portfolio via exits.</p><p>虽然它在某些市场的新房地产资产投入投资时，它仍然通过退出来“正确”的投资组合。</p><p> And, when it comes to its finances, as of March 2, WeWork said its   bonds  were trading at the highest point since the summer of 2019, when the company failed to go public. That’s way up from a 52-week low of about 28%.</p><p> 而且，截至3月2日的截至3月2日，我们债券表示，自2019年夏天以来，其债券在2019年夏天的最高点上，当公司未能公开。这是从52周的低点超过约28％。</p><p> “At ~92% for a ~10% yield, the creditor sentiment is clearly positive and a testament to the overall market’s belief that WeWork’s flexible workspace product has a viable future in the future of real estate,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><p> “在〜10％的收益率下〜92％，债权人情绪显然是积极的，并且对整体市场的信念证明了沃德的灵活工作空间产品在房地产未来具有可行的未来，”一位发言人告诉TechCrunch。</p><p> Just last March, WeWork’s  bonds  were  trading at 43 cents on the dollar and S&amp;P Global had lowered WeWork’s credit rating further into junk territory and put the company on watch for further downgrades, reported   Forbes .</p><p> 就在去年3月份，Wework的债券在美元和S＆amp的43美分上交易。P Global将Wework的信用评级进一步降低到垃圾领土上，并将该公司在观察中提出进一步降级，报告福布斯报告。</p><p> Still, the company is not done adapting. Singh told TechCrunch that to make WeWork’s value proposition even stronger, it’s working to offer a “business in a box.” Late last year, WeWork partnered with a number of companies to offer SMBs and startups, for example, services such as payroll, healthcare and business insurance.</p><p> 尽管如此，该公司仍然没有进行调整。辛格告诉TechCrunch，使Wework的价值主张更强大，它正在努力提供“在一个盒子里的业务”。去年年底，WeWork与许多公司合作，提供SMB和初创公司，例如工资单，医疗保健和商业保险等服务。</p><p> “ A lot of people that come to WeWork are growing businesses,” Singh said. “So while we’ve stuck with our core business services, we’re working to offer more, as in a real suite of HR services that might be complex and expensive for a small business to manage on their own.”</p><p> “很多人来到Wewore的人都在越来越多的企业，”辛格说。因此，虽然我们陷入困境的核心业务服务，但我们正致力于提供更多，就像一个真正的人力资源服务套件中，这可能是一个很复杂和昂贵的小企业自己管理。“</p><p> It’s also working to be able to offer its On Demand product globally so that people can opt to work out of a WeWork space from any of its locations around the world.</p><p> 它还致力于在全球范围内提供其按需产品，以便人们可以选择从世界上任何地点的Weworks空间中工作。 </p><p> “Right now, we are in the largest work from home experiment,” Singh said. “I think we’re about to shift to the largest return to work experiment ever. We are just going to be very well positioned.”</p><p>“现在，我们在家庭实验中的最大工作中，”辛格说。 “我认为我们即将转移到最大的回归工作实验。我们只是非常好的定位。“</p><p> The company appears to be trying to become a more sophisticated real estate company that may not be as flashy as the one of the Adam Neumann era, but more stable and more in demand. But is it trying to do too much, too fast?</p><p> 该公司似乎试图成为一个更复杂的房地产公司，可能不会像亚当·新南时代一样华丽，但更稳定，需求更多。但它试图做太多，太快了吗？</p><p>    Early Stage is the premier ‘how-to’ event for startup entrepreneurs and investors.
