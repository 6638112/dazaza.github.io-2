it\u2019s never been easier to find tortillas that smell like fresh popcorn, taste like the earth, and support small family farms in Mexico. In  certain cities, you can buy a bag of fresh masa for homemade tacos as readily as you can find sliced bread. Just a few years ago, your only options for quality tortillas were to scour the web for \u201ctortiller\u00edas nearby\u201d or ask your favorite taquero where they got theirs. So how did we get here?\n \u201cWe\u2019re in the era of third wave masa, and it\u2019s been 100 years in the making,\u201d Jorge Gaviria says, referring to a century of access to  nixtamalized masa in the United States culminating in our current golden age. As the cofounder of  Masienda, an importer of heirloom Mexican corn and high-quality tortilla equipment, he has earned the moniker of masa pioneer in the resurgence of premium masa. He likens the new demand for complex, aromatic, earthy Mexican corn to the  third wave specialty coffee movement\u2019s impact on our coffee appetites. \u201cMeticulous sourcing, single-origin, and geeking out about the process is now happening with masa,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of framework.\u201d\n  The first wave of masa in the U.S. was all about convenience, starting with the invention of Maseca, the first instant masa flour, in 1941. In the decades that followed, a second wave of brick-and-mortar tortilla shops began in states with large Mexican immigrant populations. These tortiller\u00edas make decent masa out of American commodity field corn and have been the backbone of American barrios for generations.\n  Masa\u2019s third wave is all about seeking the most flavorful corn varieties from small growers across Mexico. Two brands\u2014Masienda in the States and  Tamoa in Mexico\u2014are shaping this new standard by lugging heavy sacks of really good-tasting corn from Mexico to the U.S., all in the name of serious tortillas. As of now, these are the only companies with sufficient connections to Mexican farmers to ensure a consistent supply of heirloom corn. But they\u2019re not alone in building this wave. Tortiller\u00edas like  Three Sisters Nixtamal in Portland, Oregon, and  Kernel of Truth Organics in Los Angeles, as well as restaurants like  Suerte in Austin, are working with American farmers to make the best possible masa using domestic corn.\n   The difference in flavor between true nixtamalized masa made from heirloom organic corn versus Maseca-based tortillas made from conventional corn is like swapping supermarket white bread for a hot loaf of whole grain sourdough. The aroma, flavor, and even texture is incomparable. If you want to understand why, you can: Transparent sourcing is a keystone of this golden age.\n  In 2019, Gaviria published a  15-page report of Masienda\u2019s sourcing model, which includes an impact analysis, expenses, and portraits of their farmers. Gaviria shares that he expects his 2021 report to be published in the next month. \u201cWe have structures in place where we document how much corn we are purchasing each year from each community to understand a baseline over the course of a few years,\u201d he says. \u201cOur corporate interest is not to over-source, but balancing what we believe is an appropriate amount that still allows for individuals to supply their local community.\u201d It\u2019s a necessary check to protect a delicate ecosystem, ensuring a future not just for heirloom corn, but also for the culture and community that make it possible.\n  Appetites for quality masa on both sides of the border have been growing for years. Taco nerds in the U.S. have longed for a day where the tortilla was treated with as much respect as the juicy meat placed on it. But they had to wait until 2014 to see tortillas with an origin statement appear on an upscale restaurant menu, which came with the arrival of Mexican chef Enrique Olvera\u2019s  Cosme in New York City.\n  The idea behind Cosme\u2019s handmade tortillas was to tell a story of Mexico with each bite. Olvera, the celebrated chef behind  Pujol in Mexico City and  Damian in Los Angeles, insisted on a whole masa  program, nixtamalizing masa for tortillas and training American servers on the subtleties of regional corn varieties. The corn itself came from Masienda, which sold its first sack of Mexican corn to Cosme in 2014, marking it as one of the first Mexican restaurants in America to use real Mexican corn. Cosme\u2019s wild success sparked a new wave of interest in quality masa among the food-obsessed set. It also signaled to restaurant operators that despite the higher effort and cost, focusing on quality masa could be commercially viable. Masienda\u2019s base of customers grew, quickly, expanding into the direct-to-consumer market with varieties like chalque\u00f1o blanco and easier-to-nixtamalize blue varieties.\n The tortillas were a hit. In his   New York Times review of Cosme in 2015, restaurant critic Pete Wells described the tortillas aroma as \u201ccompletely wholesome\u2014like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby\u2019s cheek at the same time.\u201d\n  In the years since, Masienda has contributed two further innovations to the golden age of masa. The first, the adorably named  Molinito, is a countertop mill that grinds tortiller\u00eda-quality masa on demand. It\u2019s the first machine of its kind designed for home or restaurant kitchens that uses stone in its grinding mechanism rather than metal burrs, essential to achieving the buttery-smooth quality of premium masa. Before the Molinito, you had to pay a lot of money to ship heavy portable grinders from Mexico or seek out hand-cranked manual grinders from mom-and-pop Mexican markets. While these types of metal grinders sufficed for the average home cook, there is something extra romantic about getting that immaculate Play-Doh that only stone grind wheels can provide. The second game changer, which, like the Molinito, came to market in 2020, is a  \u201cchef grade\u201d instant tortilla flour akin to Maseca, but made from heirloom corn varieties, just like Masienda\u2019s fresh masa. As a just-add-water option, it\u2019s a historic boon to serious home taqueros and corn nerds.\n  At the same time, homegrown tortiller\u00edas around the country have been striving to make the best possible masa using American corn. Rather than relying on commodity dried field corn, enterprising tortiller\u00eda owners have been connecting with growers of varieties native to Northern California and the Midwest. It turns out that corn grown according to American organic standards makes pretty great masa too.\n  In Portland, Oregon, Adriana Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel and her husband, Pedro Ferbel-Azc\u00e1rate, founded  Three Sisters Nixtamal in 2012, after getting tired of bringing back suitcases full of enchiladas Potosinas from Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel\u2019s family\u2019s home in Mexico\u2019s state of San Luis Potosi. Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel committed to the painstaking process of showing local food lovers why they should care about the tortillas they used for their Tuesday taco nights. The couple showed up every week at Portland\u2019s famous Saturday Farmers Market and free-sampled their way to a loyal customer base. Market goers were especially drawn to an eye-catching stack of marbled tortillas. The tortillas are made from a unique formula that Three Sisters Nixtamal created by carefully layering yellow, white, and blue corn masa batches with its red masa made with dried red chiles.\n \u201cWhen we first started, you couldn\u2019t even find American corn to nixtamalize!\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel tells me in Espa\u00f1ol about her tortiller\u00eda\u2019s long journey. They wanted to get their corn as locally as possible, she says, but all the corn grown nearby in California and Washington was either a sweet corn variety or lower quality corn for animal feed. \u201cThe only organic corn that farmers were growing back then was used to feed their animals. It was hard at first.\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel remembers vividly when she saw her first sack of Masienda corn in 2015. She was mesmerized by the sheer existence of heirloom Mexican corn in the States. \u201cBut it was $5 a pound just to buy the corn,\u201d she continues, \u201cand by the time you added labor and equipment cost to nixtamalize, we couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d So they went their own way with American-grown field corn from Northern California, which was the most local the couple could find back then. In 2021, they are still committed to masa education, and you can still find their stand\u2019s vendors slicing masa to make freshly puffed tortillas for curious passersby to try at the farmers market. Their tortillas are now in many co-ops and supermarkets along the Pacific Northwest too.\n In Austin, Texas, Ferm\u00edn Nu\u00f1ez of  Suerte has made his own contribution to the country\u2019s tortilla renaissance in the form of outrageously delicious tacos on tortillas made from local corn. \u201cSuerte came about after being obsessed with making tacos out of central Texan corn,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. His obsession began with a serendipitous blob of masa that his future business partner, Sam Hellman-Mass, nixtamalized from Texas corn. \u201cBy luck, a well-known farmer here in Austin gave Sam some of his quality corn grown the right way that he usually fed his pigs with, and we opened Suerte, chasing that perfect tortilla since then.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass fought the uphill battle against Austin\u2019s Tex-Mex expectations, and through each plate of constantly revolving antojitos, like his perfect triangular tetelas filled with braised greens, he\u2019s taught many the joy of great masa in a region more partial to thick  flour tortillas and crunchy \u201chard shells.\u201d The accolades came pouring in. In 2019,  Food &amp; Wine placed it at number two on its  Best New Restaurant list. Waves of new articles and public attention followed shortly after. With growing demand and no other nixtamal of that quality in town, Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass effectively created a new corn market in Texas, and they are now stretching the limits of what the local supply can allow. \u201cThe corn growing season in Texas is crazy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez continues. \u201cYou can only plant and harvest corn in Texas in March, so that means that you gotta commit to and predict how much corn the restaurant will go through the following year.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez, who was born in northeast Mexico, believes that it\u2019s all about respecting the region where your Mexican restaurant is located. \u201cIf we were in Mexico, we would probably use corn from Mexico, but we\u2019re not\u2014we\u2019re in Austin.\u201d\n   For the longest time, public demand and market competition has pushed taqueros and taqueras in the U.S. to use the least expensive tortillas possible. This led to the almighty institution of $2 tacos that has dominated taquer\u00edas for the past 20 years. Organic tortillas can cost up to five times that of tortillas made from Maseca, and that figure only rises for handmade tortillas at restaurants. The result is a double standard that venerates the idea of a well-made taco, but also prevents the taquero from using better ingredients and selling tacos at a livable price. Something weird happens when you place a tortilla under beautiful ingredients. Before it was a \u201csmall plate.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a taco. In a market where customers don\u2019t think twice about paying $6 for a cup of coffee or $25 for a bowl of pasta, why are they unwilling to spend a few more dollars for a taco made with especially flavorful heirloom corn?\n  The high price of good masa has a lot to do with the physical heaviness of dried corn, and the fact that it grows best in the southern parts of Mexico. Transporting small-but-weighty batches of corn across the country costs money. But besides making for better tortillas, buying from heirloom corn farmers brings crucial support to traditional foodways surrounding one of the world\u2019s first domesticated crops. More important, it also supports the hardworking farming families who have saved those seeds for generations and helps them continue to grow rare, flavorful varieties for all your taco-nerding needs.\n At the same time, low-income Mexican people in Mexico and the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be priced out of their own culinary heritage. A true masa revolution needs to account for the inequalities and exploitation that exist in the supply chain, and it must protect those communities in relation to the growing demand for heirloom corn.\n \u201cMaking organic nixtamal using organic corn was our way of giving the middle finger to an industry that took so much of our cultural existence,\u201d Ricardo \u201cRick\u201d Ortega says. He is the cofounder of L.A.\u2019s first organic tortiller\u00eda,  Kernel of Truth Organics. Ortega and his founding business partner, Omar Ahmed, started his revolutionary tortiller\u00eda in 2014 as a stand against the city\u2019s gentrification, which threatens to erase their hometown\u2019s Mexican heritage. Ahmed is a second-generation tortillero. After his family\u2019s longstanding tortilla shop was gentrified out of Echo Park, an L.A. neighborhood that was a hotbed for gang violence in the \u201990s but is now one of L.A.\u2019s most expensive, Ortega and Ahmed pooled their savings to launch the brand, nixtamalizing on other shops\u2019 equipment in off-hours.\n The pandemic nearly forced Kernel of Truth Organics to shut down its tortilla-making permanently, but it barely ground by. Despite an urgent need for capital, Ortega and Ahmed refuse to sell tortillas to retail locations that mark up their products. \u201cI think about my mom and our abuelas,\u201d Ortega says. He admits that he still catches his parents with Guerrero tortillas\u2014a national mass-market brand\u2014in their refrigerator, but he is not giving up. This parental tortilla treason encapsulates the challenge posed by organic and heirloom corn tortillas: \u201cHow can we make these organic tortillas affordable enough for our parents and se\u00f1oras?\u201d Ortega asks.\n  As Ortega says, tortiller\u00edas like his are fighting the long fight. \u201cThe good fight,\u201d as he calls it. \u201cTo keep true tortillas close to our hearts and to keep masa in our hands.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:28:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,age,\u7389\u7c73\u997c", "title":

", "note_en": "In 2006, Redfin was the first company to put homes on a map\u2070. This was even before Google Maps was a performant platform. They launched with Microsoft Virtual Earth before migrating to Google Maps in 2008\u00b9. This was a legendary achievement in proptech, massively empowering homebuyers to shop on their own. Ever since, high quality map browsing has been table stakes for any real estate shopping tool.\n Going into Q2, the maps on Opendoor were having performance issues. When a user viewed  homes in Phoenix, it could take 15+ seconds before they see anything on the map.\n  Before we could start optimizing map speed, we needed to figure out why it felt slow. After some profiling with Chrome dev tools, it became apparent that there was a slow call to our REST API to fetch the property listing data to display on the map. Looking further, Datadog showed us that the bulk of this time was spent in ActiveModelSerializers and fetching from the DB. We then constructed a metric that captured the user pain we wanted to address: p90 time to fetch property data for the map. We use a 90th percentile to capture the predominant user experience while excluding outliers.\n   The 10.54s p90 to &lt;1s p90 optimization happened in 5 parts over about 1 month:\n   We use Rails  active_model_serializers to describe the fields that the REST API will return. A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases. This causes over-fetching of data both from our APIs and from the backing DB (we store listings in MongoDB). We also updated our  Mongoid queries to use  projections to return only the data necessary to fulfill the request from MongoDB. Creating specialized serializers just for the map component and reducing data fetches solved these issues and got us nearly a 2x speedup.\n A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases.\n   While fixing the DB problem, we noticed that we had smart logic in place to cache the serialized list of properties when the front-end requested an unfiltered list of properties for a region. This is the most common type of query because it\u2019s the default state when a user lands on a map. Unfortunately a bug had been introduced that turned off this caching behavior in all cases. We corrected this behavior and added integration tests around the endpoint to ensure the cache is populated, then hit on subsequent requests. Alerts on latency spikes and cache hit rate will catch and flag us to investigate caching system failures in prod (more on that below).\n  Datadog showed a lot of bouncing around between our serializers and mongo. It turned out that one of the fields had added an n+1 query by doing a fetch in one of the serializer fields as it was serializing a list of properties. We did this by using  Mongoid\u2019s includes() when querying for properties from the database. Optimizing queries so that all data was fetched in bulk before anything was serialized won us a few more seconds.\n  Both the properties on the map and the properties in the list were fetched by the same query. This was a design decision made to keep the logic simple and minimize the payload size if a property appears in both the list and the map. Profiling revealed that payload size wasn\u2019t really an issue, but each list required its own CloudSearch and database query. Splitting these into two separate API calls done in parallel from the front-end was an easy win and didn\u2019t require any encounters with multi-threading in Rails.\n  Our final win came from avoiding the database entirely on some requests. Normally we fetch property listings from CloudSearch then hydrate them with a few extra fields from MongoDB. Instead, we switched the front-end to only expect latitude/longitude point locations and display clusters if there are more than 120 properties to show. This means that when point clusters are showing we don\u2019t have to touch MongoDB, and in the cases we do, it\u2019s a small number of properties and relatively quick.\n  The final step was ensuring we have a great way to catch regressions. While automated tests are useful to catch bugs at the code level, alerting is important because subtle config changes can break distributed systems (like the cache) in ways automated testing in a staging environment may not catch. We now get notified by Datadog when there\u2019s an anomalous latency change and we have useful dashboards with associated metrics.\n    As a result, we\u2019re seeing great performance from our home shopping tools and have seen even faster adoption of  Opendoor-Backed Offers, an offering that backs our buyers\u2019 home offers with all cash to give them a competitive edge in today\u2019s hot market. Performance work on web and mobile is a top priority for me and my team. We will continue investing resources into our home shopping tools with the goal of delivering the best experience possible to our customers.\n If this type of work sounds interesting, Opendoor is hiring!

", "note_en": "Patrick Doherty had always been very active. He trekked the Himalayas and hiked trails in Spain.\n  But about a year and a half ago, he noticed pins and needles in his fingers and toes. His feet got cold. And then he started getting out of breath any time he walked his dog up the hills of County Donegal in Ireland where he lives.\n  &#34;I noticed on some of the larger hill climbs I was getting a bit breathless,&#34; says Doherty, 65. &#34;So I realized something was wrong.&#34;\n  Doherty found out he had a rare, but devastating inherited disease \u2014 known as  transthyretin amyloidosis \u2014 that had killed his father. A misshapen protein was building up in his body, destroying important tissues, such as nerves in his hands and feet and his heart.\n    &#34;It&#39;s terrible prognosis,&#34; Doherty says. &#34;This is a condition that deteriorates very rapidly. It&#39;s just dreadful.&#34;\n  So Doherty was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to try to treat amyloidosis. The approach used a revolutionary gene-editing technique called  CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA.\n      On Saturday, researchers reported the first data indicating that the experimental treatment worked, causing levels of the destructive protein to plummet in Doherty&#39;s body and the bodies of five other patients treated with the approach.\n    The advance is being hailed not just for amyloidosis patients but also as a proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other, much more common diseases. It&#39;s a new way of using the innovative technology.\n  &#34;This is a major milestone for patients,&#34; says  Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who shared a Nobel Prize for her work helping develop CRISPR.\n  &#34;While these are early data, they show us that we can overcome one of the biggest challenges with applying CRISPR clinically so far, which is being able to deliver it systemically and get it to the right place,&#34; Doudna says.\n  CRISPR has already been shown to help patients suffering from the devastating blood disorders  sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer and to  restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder.\n  But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab, and infusing them back in or injecting CRISPR directly into cells that need fixing.\n    The study Doherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene-editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right cells. In this case, it&#39;s cells in the liver making the destructive protein.\n  &#34;This is the first example in which CRISPR-Cas9 is injected directly into the bloodstream \u2014 in other words systemic administration \u2014 where we use it as a way to reach a tissue that&#39;s far away from the site of injection and very specifically use it to edit disease-causing genes,&#34; says John Leonard, the CEO of  Intellia Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the study.\n  Doctors infused billions of microscopic structures known as nanoparticles carrying genetic instructions for the CRISPR gene-editor into four patients in London and two in New Zealand. The nanoparticles were absorbed by their livers, where they unleashed armies of CRISPR gene-editors. The CRISPR editor homed in on the target gene in the liver  and sliced it, disabling production of the destructive protein.\n  Within weeks, the levels of protein causing the disease plummeted, especially in the volunteers who received a higher dose. Researchers reported at the  Peripheral Nerve Society Annual Meeting and in a  paper published in  The New England Journal of Medicine.\n  &#34;It really is exciting,&#34; says Dr.  Julian Gillmore, who is leading the study at the University College London, Royal Free Hospital.\n  &#34;This has the potential to completely revolutionize the outcome for these patients who have lived with this disease in their family for many generations. It&#39;s decimated some families that I&#39;ve been looking after. So this is amazing,&#34; Gillmore says.\n  The patients will have to be followed longer, and more patients will have to be treated, to make sure the treatment&#39;s safe, and determine how much it&#39;s helping, Gillmore stresses. But the approach could help those struck by amyloidosis that isn&#39;t inherited, which is a far more common version of the disease, he says.\n  Moreover, the promising results potentially open the door for using the same approach to treatment of many other, more common diseases for which taking cells out of the body or directly injecting CRISPR isn&#39;t realistic, including heart disease, muscular dystrophy and brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s.\n  &#34;This is really opening a new era as we think about gene-editing where we can begin to think about accessing all kinds of different tissue in the body via systemic administration,&#34; Leonard says.\n    &#34;This is a wonderful day for the future of gene-editing as a medicine,&#34;  agree  Fyodor Urnov, a professor of genetics at the University of California, Berkeley. &#34;We as a species are watching this remarkable new show called: our gene-edited future.&#34;\n  Doherty says he started feeling better within weeks of the treatment and has continued to improve in the weeks since then.\n  &#34;I definitely feel better,&#34; he told NPR. &#34;I&#39;m speaking to you from upstairs in our house. I climbed stairs to get up here. I would have been feeling breathless. I&#39;m thrilled.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:27:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u57fa\u56e0,gene,crispr", "title":

", "note_en": "Adventures with Van Gogh is a weekly blog by Martin Bailey, our long-standing correspondent and expert on the artist. Published every Friday, his stories will range from newsy items about this most intriguing artist to scholarly pieces based on his own meticulous investigations and discoveries.\n  Reproduced here for the first time: a trio of sketches from Vincent\u2019s village\u2014designed as a bookmark\n One of Van Gogh\u2019s most unusual artworks has just emerged\u2014three unknown sketches of peasants. They are drawn on a thin vertical strip of paper, a curious format for an artist to choose. The drawings were found in a novel on the French peasantry and the paper is exactly the same height as the book.\n The three sketches are reproduced by  The Art Newspaper here for the first time. Discoveries of totally unknown Van Gogh drawings are now rare\u2014perhaps once or twice in a decade. The sheet has just gone on display at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in a new exhibition on acquisitions,   Here to Stay (until 12 September). Although it is presented in the show as simply a trio of sketches, the artwork almost certainly served an unexpected purpose.\n    Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Amsterdam museum, told us: \u201cI believe that it was made as a bookmark. It would be curious to draw three sketches in this configuration unless there was a reason, and it fits snugly inside the book in which it was found.\u201d\n    Vincent, an avid reader, gave his copy of a novel on the French peasantry to his Dutch artist friend Anthon van Rappard. Writing to Van Rappard on 15 June 1883, he said he would be posting a package to him in Utrecht, with prints and a book by the French writers Emile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian, whom he greatly admired.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan recounts the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of an Alsace peasant. Illustrated by Th\u00e9ophile Schuler, Vincent assured his friend that \u201cI do think you\u2019ll find the Erckmann-Chatrian beautiful\u201d.\n    Van Rappard died in 1892, aged just 33, and the book then passed to his wife Henri\u00ebtte, who lived until 1910.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan, together with the bookmark, was quietly preserved by her family until 2019, when both were privately sold to the Van Gogh Museum.\n The pencil drawings are crude, since they were done soon after Vincent set out to become an artist, but they are important since so few of his early informal sketches survive. Stylistically, they can be dated to autumn 1881, when he was living in his parent\u2019s village of Etten and was deeply interested in capturing figures of the local peasants at work.\n It was not until two years later that Vincent sent  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan to Van Rappard, suggesting that the bookmark had lain forgotten in the novel and was not noticed when he wrapped up the package. If Vincent had set out to give Van Rappard a few sketches, he would have been much more likely to have sent very recent ones, to demonstrate how his art was developing.\n On the 28cm-high bookmark, the upper sketch shows a woman walking by a pollarded tree. The middle one portrays a seated man beside a fire, a work reminiscent of a finished drawing which Van Gogh made in November 1881,   Old Man at the Fireside  (now Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). The lower sketch depicts a woman in profile. Van Gogh may well have seen the figures as loosely illustrating the Erckmann-Chatrian novel.\n    The front of the book is signed \u201cVincent\u201d. He had sent the book to Van Rappard \u201cto read\u201d and it is unclear whether the signature indicates that it was a gift or was a polite reminder that it was a loan and should be returned.\n    In October, just over year after sending the book, Van Rappard visited Vincent in Nuenen\u2014but without returning the book. During the visit Van Gogh sketched a portrait of his friend, the largest drawn portrait in his entire oeuvre. Only the top half of the work survives.\n Sadly, their friendship came to an abrupt end in May 1885, after Van Rappard wrote critically about Vincent\u2019s only  lithograph, which depicted his painting of  The Potato Eaters. Vincent, who was furious, dismembered the portrait, neatly slicing it in half. The bottom half has been lost, but he soon reused the reverse of the top half to make rough sketches of a pair of women and a man carrying a bundle of wood.\n Thanks to this recycling, the most important half of the Van Rappard portrait, with the eyes, has been saved\u2014poignant evidence of Van Gogh\u2019s closest friendship during his Dutch artistic years.\n  \u2022 Christie\u2019s is to sell a drawing of   The Potato Harvester (Aardappelrooier)  in London on 30 June, estimated at \u00a3300,000-\u00a3500,000. Dating from June-July 1885, it was done in Nuenen, the village in the south of the Netherlands. Fork in hand, the peasant is digging up potatoes, while smoking his pipe.  The Potato Harvester was originally owned by the distinguished Dutch art historian H.P. Bremmer.\n    \u2022 The  Sunflowers (August 1888) is back in London this week, after being the star attraction for a tour of the National Gallery\u2019s paintings to Japan and Australia. At the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra the exhibition of 61 works was seen by 201,000 people during its 15-week run. With Covid-19, this is likely to rank among the world\u2019s best-attended 2020-21 exhibitions.\n    Martin Bailey is a leading Van Gogh specialist and investigative reporter for  The Art Newspaper. Bailey has curated Van Gogh exhibitions at the Barbican Art Gallery and Compton Verney/National Gallery of Scotland. He was a co-curator of Tate Britain\u2019s  The EY Exhibition: Van Gogh and Britain (27 March-11 August 2019). He has written a number of bestselling books, including  The Sunflowers Are Mine: The Story of Van Gogh&#39;s Masterpiece (Frances Lincoln 2013, available in the  UK and  US),  Studio of the South: Van Gogh in Provence (Frances Lincoln 2016, available in the  UK and  US) and  Starry Night: Van Gogh at the Asylum (White Lion Publishing 2018, available in the  UK and  US). Bailey&#39;s  Living with Vincent van Gogh: The Homes &amp; Landscapes that Shaped the Artist (White Lion Publishing 2019, available in the  UK and  US) provides an overview of the artist\u2019s life.
