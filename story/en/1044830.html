It was a forwarded screenshot of a WhatsApp message that had reached a friend from a sister-in-law’s friend’s public-school teacher mother, and it suggested there were hundreds of extra COVID-19 vaccine doses in Brooklyn that needed to be used by 7 p.m. There was no source for the intel but no telltale signs of a scam, either. Although New York’s distribution effort was already notorious for Cuomo’s threat to punish health-care providers for breaking prioritization protocol, he’d  recently switched to threatening them for not using doses fast enough. Plus, people in other parts of the country had been  finding  leftover vaccine doses through whispers and Walgreens pharmacists. There was an address five miles away and, I thought, maybe just enough time to get completely, inexplicably lucky.</p><p>昨天凌晨4:30，当我沉浸在Zoom网络研讨会的第二个小时时，我收到了一个奇怪的文字。这是转发给WhatsApp消息的屏幕快照，该消息已从一个sister子的朋友的公立学校老师的母亲那里收到，并且暗示布鲁克林还需要使用数百种额外的COVID-19疫苗剂量，这需要7人使用下午也没有情报来源，也没有任何欺诈迹象。尽管纽约的分销工作已经因Cuomo威胁要惩罚医疗服务提供者违反优先顺序协议而臭名昭著，但他最近却因威胁他们没有足够快地使用剂量而威胁他们。另外，该国其他地区的人们已经通过耳语和Walgreens药剂师找到了剩余的疫苗剂量。有一个地址在五英里外，我想，也许只是足够的时间就完全可以了，莫名其妙。</p><p>  When I started biking, I felt that the warmer weather and last half-hour of sunlight justified a ride, no matter the outcome. As I got closer, though, I started to believe that if the rumor was true, I would never have been able to justify to myself that I had stayed at my desk and turned down an escape from the pandemic. I started pedaling as fast as I could, my belief growing that I could, just maybe, beat enough people to, well, save myself.</p><p>  当我开始骑自行车时，无论结果如何，我都觉得天气转暖和阳光持续了半个小时是合理的。但是，当我走近时，我开始相信，如果谣言是真的，我将永远无法为自己辩解说我一直呆在办公桌前，拒绝了大流行的逃脱。我开始尽可能快地踩踏板，我越来越相信我可以击败足够多的人来拯救自己。</p><p>  Hundreds, if not thousands, of other New Yorkers thought the same thing. I arrived on my bike at the Brooklyn Army Terminal at 5:15, snaking past cars that were lined up in a jam down the block. I found what looked like an extremely popular construction site: people hurrying to join lines pressed against chainlink-fence and concrete barriers, the closest one behind a giant illuminated traffic sign reading “COVID-19 VACCINE HUB.” I joined the first line I saw, which extended from the vaccination site entrance on 58th Street around the corner onto 1st Avenue and was starting to turn around the next block. For a minute, I indulged the ludicrous possibility of snatching a highly coveted spare vaccine via chain text. That fantasy ended when the man in front of me informed me I was in the line for people with appointments.</p><p>  成百上千的纽约人都认为同一件事。我于5:15骑着自行车到达布鲁克林陆军候机楼，在那排被堵在街区下的果酱中排队的汽车驶过。我发现了一个看起来非常受欢迎的建筑工地：人们急忙加入紧贴链条栅栏和混凝土屏障的线路，这是在巨大的带灯交通标志后面最接近的一条，上面写着“ COVID-19 VACCINE HUB”。我加入了我所看到的第一条线，该线从拐角处第58街的疫苗接种点入口延伸至第一大街，并开始转弯下一个街区。一分钟，我沉迷于通过链式文本抢夺令人垂涎的备用疫苗的可笑可能性。当我前面的那个人告诉我我要去约会的人时，那个幻想就结束了。</p><p>  After word started to spread of 400+ surplus vaccine shots in Brooklyn—passed on by WhatsApp messages and screenshots—this is what *part* of the scene looks like right now  pic.twitter.com/cndF7r5zzc</p><p>  消息开始在布鲁克林传播400多张多余的疫苗注射疫苗后，又传出了WhatsApp消息和屏幕截图，这就是现场的一部分，现在看起来像pic.twitter.com/cndF7r5zzc</p><p>— Stephen Lurie (@luriethereal)  January 14, 2021</p><p>-斯蒂芬·卢里（@luriethereal）2021年1月14日</p><p>  Turning the corner back to 58th and then on to 2nd Avenue, I followed another line that had formed in the road, squished against a chainlink fence by cars, arriving police vehicles, and ambulances coming and going from the nearby hospital. Helicopters arrived, adding to the cacophony of vehicles and the chatter of people in line.</p><p>  拐弯处回到第58条街，然后转到第二大街，我沿着那条在路上形成的线，乘着汽车，到达的警车和附近医院来回的救护车，在铁丝网围栏上挤压。直升机的到来，增加了车辆的响声和排队的人的喧嚣。</p><p>  A man who identified himself as a security employee for the site started coming down the line telling people that the doses were gone. Almost no one left their spot. On his way back to the entrance, the woman behind me asked him if what he were saying were true, why wasn’t anyone leaving. “I guess they don’t believe me,” he said. Instead, people were discussing the latest intel they heard from a friend or what they last saw online: how many doses were  actually left, that the 400 advertised were gone but that we should wait until after 8 p.m. to see if they had leftovers from appointment no-shows, that officials were telling us to go home just to manage the crowd.</p><p>  一个自称是该站点的安全员工的男人开始下线，告诉人们剂量已经消失。几乎没有人离开他们的位置。在回入口的路上，我身后的女人问他说的话是否正确，为什么没有人离开。他说：“我猜他们不相信我。”取而代之的是，人们在讨论他们从朋友那里听到的最新情报，或者他们最后一次在网上看到的情报：实际上还剩下多少剂，广告中的400剂已经用完，但我们应该等到晚上8点以后。看看他们是否有约会缺席遗留下来的残留物，这些官员正在告诉我们回家只是为了管理人群。 </p><p>  The line started moving toward the front, but, as we’d all learn once we got there, this wasn’t because they were letting people in. The doses were real, but now the site had run out.</p><p>生产线开始向前方移动，但是，正如我们所有人都知道的那样，这并不是因为他们让人们进入。剂量确实存在，但是现在该站点已经用完了。</p><p>  Despite  comments from Mayor de Blasio’s press secretary Bill Neidhardt and Councilmember Justin Brannan that  suggested the crush was based on misinformation — denials that were  widely  reproduced in  news accounts — people on site when I arrived, and those who had been there  earlier, indicated the opportunity had been a real one. While it’s not clear whether the availability was anything near to the “410+ doses” claimed in the WhatsApp message, it was apparent that there had been surplus doses and that walk-ins were taken.</p><p>  尽管市长德拉布拉西奥的新闻秘书比尔·内德哈特（Bill Neidhardt）和安理会成员贾斯汀·布兰南（Justin Brannan）表示，暗恋是基于错误的信息-新闻报道中广泛否认的否认-我抵达时在现场的人以及早些时候在场的人都表示有机会曾经是真实的。虽然尚不清楚可用性是否与WhatsApp消息中声称的“ 410+剂量”相差无几，但显然存在多余的剂量，并采取了步入式。</p><p>  A doctor standing at the front entrance told a crowd that “today was an exception … we ran through the amount we had for walk-ins, we’re not doing any more walk-ins.” Other  videos show health-care workers confirming that there had been extra doses available earlier in the day. While I couldn’t find anyone who’d made it in time, some people seem to have  successfully received a walk-in vaccination based on the tip.</p><p>  站在前门的一名医生告诉人群：“今天是个例外……我们花了很多时间来进行步入式检查，我们不再进行步入式检查。”其他视频显示，医护人员确认当天早些时候还有额外的剂量。虽然我找不到及时做到这一点的人，但有些人似乎已经成功地收到了根据提示进行的步入式疫苗接种。</p><p>  By about 6:15, the walk-in line had disappeared, police had seemed to figure out how to turn away the cars and any pedestrians that continued to arrive, and hospital staff had found a megaphone to help manage the line that remained with people who had appointments set.</p><p>  到大约6:15，步入式警戒线消失了，警察似乎已经弄清楚了如何转弯汽车和任何继续到达的行人，医院工作人员找到了一个扩音器来帮助管理留在人群中的警戒线谁安排了约会。</p><p>  The people I spoke with were brought there by pretty much every communication method, and by official, semi-official, peer-to-peer, and fully crowdsourced means. For some, information about the extra doses did certainly come, at some point, from health-care professionals. James Kent, 63, had a Friday appointment but was contacted in the late afternoon Thursday by the health system. “I got a call at 4:51 asking if I was available tonight to come in and switch my appointment that was scheduled for tomorrow,” he told me after receiving his vaccination. “Now, I’m here and it’s done.” Another woman I spoke to had been accompanying her parents to receive a vaccination at another site when a staff member there informed her she’d just received word of extra doses at the Brooklyn Army Terminal.</p><p>  我与之交谈的人几乎是通过各种沟通方式，以及通过官方，半官方，点对点以及完全众包的方式而带到那里的。对于某些人来说，有关额外剂量的信息肯定确实来自医疗保健专业人员。 63岁的詹姆斯·肯特（James Kent）周五有预约，但卫生系统在周四下午晚些时候与他联系。 “收到疫苗后，他告诉我：“我4:51接到电话，要求我今晚是否有空来接班，并更改原定于明天的约会。” “现在，我在这里，一切都完成了。”我与之交谈的另一位女士曾陪同她的父母在另一个地点接受疫苗接种，当时那里的一名工作人员通知她，她刚刚在布鲁克林陆军候机楼收到了额外的剂量消息。</p><p>  Most, however, just saw something on Twitter, Facebook, or a group chat. James Seward, 40, heard about the vaccines on Facebook and rode his bicycle from Dumbo to Sunset Park “as fast as he could” to see if he could get one. When he arrived, he said he found “a long, long line and confusion.” Someone in line told him he needed to make an appointment online. “I found the link and tried filling it out five times and it just kept saying ‘no appointments available,” he said. He was eventually informed by site staff that there were no more walk-ins available.</p><p>  但是，大多数人只是在Twitter，Facebook或群聊上看到了一些东西。 40岁的詹姆斯·塞沃德（James Seward）听说过Facebook上的疫苗，并以最快的速度骑着自行车从小飞象（Dumbo）到日落公园（Sunset Park），看他是否能买到。当他到达时，他说他发现了“漫长的排队和混乱。”排队的人告诉他，他需要在线预约。他说：“我找到了链接，并尝试将其填写5次，但它一直在说'没有可用的约会。”最终，现场工作人员通知他没有更多的步入式洗手间。</p><p>  A woman who gave her name as Nana, who I found playing an ad hoc role ferrying information up and down the appointment line, told me she received a text from a friend and rushed over even though she didn’t really believe it could be true.</p><p>  一位以娜娜（Nana）为名的女士，我发现她扮演一个临时角色，在约会专线上下传递信息，她告诉我她收到了一位朋友发来的短信，尽管她并不真正相信那是真的，但还是冲了过来。 。 </p><p>  I’d done exactly the same, even against the particular absurdity that tightly controlled vaccine doses could be found by word-of-mouth  and the general New York knowledge that, no matter how early you think you are, there will always be masses of your neighbors that beat you to the punch. I saw a lot of people try to extract special information from police and hospital staff about the possibility of extra doses if they stuck around, but I’d seen the same from people trying to snag an open table even when the restaurant was fully booked. Though the circumstances of the rush gave it an apocalyptic flavor, there didn’t seem to be any real human descent into chaos. No fistfights or shouting matches about who was in line, no storming of the gates. Just a lot of cold people, all desperate enough to chase down a lead so unlikely it could have been — and actually was — real.</p><p>我做了完全一样的事情，即使面对特别荒谬的说法，即通过口耳相传和纽约的一般知识都可以发现严格控制疫苗剂量，无论您认为自己多早，打败你的邻居。我看到很多人都试图从警察和医院工作人员那里获取特殊信息，以了解如果他们呆在外面可能会产生额外的剂量，但是即使人们已经订满了餐厅，我也试图从一张敞开的桌子上抢走那些人。尽管匆忙的情况给人一种世界末日的味道，但似乎没有人真正陷入混乱。没有关于谁在排队的打架或高喊比赛，也没有冲进大门。只是很多冷酷的人，他们都拼命地追逐线索，以至于不可能是真实的。</p><p>  This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google  Privacy Policy and  Terms of Service apply.</p><p>  本网站受reCAPTCHA保护，并适用Google隐私政策和服务条款。</p><p>    By submitting your email, you agree to our  Terms and  Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.</p><p>    提交电子邮件，即表示您同意我们的条款和隐私声明，并收到我们的电子邮件来信。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/01/i-tried-to-get-a-leftover-dose-of-the-vaccine-last-night.html">https://www.thecut.com/2021/01/i-tried-to-get-a-leftover-dose-of-the-vaccine-last-night.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/获得/">#获得</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dose/">#dose</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
