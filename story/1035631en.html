Ticket sales on Eventbrite generated over $13,000 in donations to The Video Game History Foundation, which astounded us – our estimate was about 1/10 of that!</p><p>2020年10月30日，我们启动了一个非常特别的活动“视频游戏源项目”：与游戏开发人员罗恩·吉尔伯特（Ron Gilbert）进行了两个小时的炉边聊天，庆祝他最著名的游戏《猴岛的秘密》诞生30周年。 Eventbrite的门票销售为视频游戏历史基金会筹集了超过13,000美元的捐款，这震惊了我们-我们的估计约为其中的1/10！</p><p> Now that ticketholders have had exclusive access for a while, we’ve decided to make the entire stream public, which you can find embedded below. We also retained the live chat for historical reference, which you can see by viewing the video on YouTube. It includes insight from former Lucasfilm Games developers Noah Falstein and David Fox, among other special guests!</p><p>现在，持票人已经可以使用独占权限一段时间了，我们决定将整个视频流公开，您可以在下面找到它们。我们还保留了实时聊天记录，以供历史参考，您可以通过在YouTube上观看视频来查看。它包括前卢卡斯电影游戏开发商Noah Falstein和David Fox的见解，以及其他特别邀请！</p><p>  During the stream, Ron and I go in-depth into where the ideas for the game came from, the development process, the environment at Lucasfilm Games, and more. We even do a live coding demonstration of the game’s famous SCUMM scripting language, and take a look at a few of the development tools used in the making of the game, including FLEM, BYLE, and SPIT (they had a house style…).</p><p>在会议期间，我和罗恩（Ron）会深入探讨游戏创意的来历，开发过程，Lucasfilm Games的环境等。我们甚至对游戏中著名的SCUMM脚本语言进行了现场编码演示，并查看了游戏制作中使用的一些开发工具，包括FLEM，BYLE和SPIT（它们具有房屋风格…）。</p><p> We also showed quite a bit of cut content, which is what I want to focus on in this post. The following was a combination of art extraction, code restoration, and heavy research. Special thanks in no particular order to Marius Fietzek Winter, Aric Wilmunder, Jake Rodkin, and our own Rich Whitehouse for helping.</p><p>我们还展示了很多剪裁的内容，这是我在本文中要重点介绍的内容。以下是艺术提取，代码恢复和大量研究的结合。特别感谢Marius Fietzek Winter，Aric Wilmunder，Jake Rodkin和我们自己的Rich Whitehouse的帮助。</p><p>  The artists at Lucasfilm Games in 1990 were, by all accounts, prolific. Some of the art that survived in the Monkey Island vaults might have never been intended for the game at all, some may have been ideas that were abandoned early on, and some are from other game projects entirely!</p><p>众所周知，1990年卢卡斯电影运动会的艺术家多产。在猴子岛金库中幸存的某些艺术可能根本就不是游戏的原本，一些可能是很早就被放弃的想法，而某些则完全来自其他游戏项目！</p><p>  These three pieces are, more than likely, not art that was ever meant for the in-production game. As Gilbert explained during the stream, often artists like Steve Purcell would “just draw.” So it is unlikely that the vulture wearing a bib was ever meant for the game…though the humor does fit.</p><p>这三件作品很可能不是生产游戏所需要的艺术品。正如吉尔伯特在直播中解释的那样，像史蒂夫·珀塞尔（Steve Purcell）这样的艺术家经常会“随便画画”。因此，穿围兜的秃鹰不可能曾经是游戏中必不可少的……尽管幽默确实很适合。</p><p> A close-up portrait of salty sword trainer Captain Smirk. Whether this is an early draft, a practice sketch, or something else entirely is unclear.</p><p>咸剑教练斯米尔克船长的特写肖像。这是一个初稿，一个实践草图还是其他完全不清楚的东西。</p><p> In SCUMM terminology, a “costume” is a set of animation frames that an “actor” – a piece of code, say, Guybrush Threepwood or the seagull behind the SCUMM Bar – can be assigned. Here we have a costume of unknown origins, our only clue being the file name, “SPRITE.” As with most human costumes in the game, SPRITE has a full animation set for walking and talking in all four directions.</p><p>用SCUMM术语来说，“服装”是一组动画帧，可以分配一个“演员”（一段代码，例如Guybrush Threepwood或SCUMM Bar后面的海鸥）。在这里，我们有一个未知来源的服装，我们唯一的线索是文件名“ SPRITE”。与游戏中大多数人类服装一样，SPRITE具有完整的动画设置，可以在所有四个方向上走路和说话。</p><p> Before Melee Island’s beloved governor, Elaine Marley, was conceived, Monkey Island had a very different plot, starring a very different governor – Governor Fat! According to the game’s creator, Ron Gilbert, this costume was never used in the production of the game. Perhaps its artist was working from an old design document? Unfortunately, as with many things, the purpose of this costume has been forgotten after thirty years.</p><p>在构思近战岛上最受欢迎的州长Elaine Marley之前，猴子岛的情节大相径庭，由一个完全不同的州长– Fat担任主演！根据游戏的创作者罗恩·吉尔伯特（Ron Gilbert）的说法，这种服装从未在游戏的制作中使用过。也许是它的艺术家正在使用旧的设计文档？不幸的是，就像许多事情一样，这种服装的目的在三十年后就被人们遗忘了。</p><p> Here’s a true rarity – a peek at a Lucasfilm adventure game that was only ever a prototype! This is Layla Thomas, from a spy game called Top Secret that, as far as we know, never got very far. These few frames of animation survived inside of another character’s costume file. Perhaps the artist was using her animations as reference?</p><p>真正的稀罕之处-看看卢卡斯电影冒险游戏，这只是一个原型！这是Layla Thomas，来自名为Top Secret的间谍游戏，据我们所知，它从未走得太远。这几帧动画保存在另一个角色的服装文件中。也许艺术家正在使用她的动画作为参考？</p><p> Any Monkey Island fan remembers the game’s insult swordfighting, but what about  drunk insult swordfighting? This costume is all that remains of the concept, which was cut early in development. The reason? Having to write alternate “drunk” versions of each insult and reply presented a design challenge.</p><p>任何Monkey Island粉丝都记得游戏的侮辱性剑术，但是醉酒的侮辱性剑术呢？这种服装是概念的剩余部分，该概念在开发初期就被切断了。原因？必须为每个侮辱写替代的“醉酒”版本并进行答复，这给设计带来了挑战。</p><p> Speaking of swordfighting, here’s Sheriff Fester Shinetop with a full set of fighting animations! Players never get to battle him in the game, though this was planned early in the game’s conceptual, pre-production stage.</p><p>说到剑术，这里的警长Fester Shinetop带有全套战斗动画！尽管这是在游戏的概念性，预生产阶段的早期计划的，但玩家从未在游戏中与他战斗。</p><p>  It’s the freelance police! No, Sam &amp; Max were not set to make a cameo in the game… as far as we know. These costumes were actually used by new programmers at Lucasfilm Games to practice using the SCUMM environment, by creating a micro adventures using the characters and their office environment. This was three years before the eventual  Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road, which used entirely different art! Only a few frames of animation from this testing environment survived into the Monkey Island repository – perhaps they were used in the game as placeholders for characters who had not been drawn yet?</p><p>是自由警察！不，据我们所知，Sam＆Max没有准备在游戏中做客串。这些服装实际上是Lucasfilm Games的新程序员使用的，通过使用角色及其办公环境创建微型冒险来在SCUMM环境中进行练习。距离最终的Sam＆Max上路了三年，后者使用了完全不同的艺术品！在此测试环境中，只有几帧动画保存到了Monkey Island存储库中-也许它们在游戏中用作了尚未绘制的角色的占位符？</p><p> Help make us preserve more video game history! Everything we do is funded by donors just like you.</p><p>帮助我们保留更多的视频游戏历史！我们所做的一切都是像您一样由捐助者提供资金的。</p><p>  Meet Proto-Guybrush! This early design for the character sported a red sash and brown boots, and was a little bit shorter and squatter. Here’s a fun fact: when you’re on an overhead map in the final version of the game, Guybrush is reduced to a four pixel sprite, the third of which is red – a leftover from this old design!</p><p>认识Pro-Guybrush！该角色的早期设计采用了红色腰带和棕色靴子，并且稍矮且蹲着。这是一个有趣的事实：当您在游戏最终版本的俯视图上时，Guybrush缩小为四个像素的精灵，其中三分之一为红色，这是旧设计的残余！</p><p> An older design for Governor Elaine Marley. Elaine would go through much more significant changes that Guybrush, including an entirely different color palette, different posing, and the addition of headwear.</p><p>总督Elaine Marley的旧设计。 Elaine将经历比Guybrush更为重要的变化，包括完全不同的调色板，不同的摆姿势以及添加头饰。</p><p>   An early concept for the bridge puzzle. In the final game, the bridge is guarded by a troll, but an early concept for stopping the player here involved a booby trap instead. As far as anyone remembers, this puzzle was never actually in the playable game, and likely existed only as art.</p><p>桥梁难题的早期概念。在最后一场比赛中，这座桥由巨魔守护，但是在这里阻止玩家的早期概念是使用诱杀装置。据任何人记得，这个难题实际上从未出现在可玩游戏中，而可能只是作为艺术品而存在。</p><p>  Another unused animation – most, if not all, of the sword-fighting costumes in the game have an unused jump, as demonstrated here using BYLE, the Lucasfilm Games costume animation tool. It is the only animation (in BYLE terms, “chore”) that doesn’t have a name in these files, suggesting perhaps that it was never used in-game.</p><p>另一个未使用的动画–游戏中大多数（如果不是全部）剑术服装都具有未使用的跳跃，如此处使用Lucasfilm Games服装动画工具BYLE所示。这是唯一在这些文件中没有名称的动画（用BYLE术语表示，“琐事”），这表明它可能从未在游戏中使用过。</p><p>  A very different concept for the governor’s mansion, which survived only as a “z-plane” file. An explanation is due here: whenever a room lets characters walk behind areas, that room requires a separate z-plane file to define those areas in white pixels. In this case, characters would be able to walk behind the front of the building’s porch. The reason this one survived at all is because in the final game, the exterior mansion has no z-plane, meaning the artist never overwrote the original version!</p><p>州长官邸的概念非常不同，后者只能作为“ z平面”文件保存下来。这里有一个解释：每当一个房间让角色走到区域后面时，该房间都需要一个单独的z平面文件来以白色像素定义这些区域。在这种情况下，角色可以走在建筑物门廊的后面。之所以能够幸存下来，是因为在最终游戏中，外部豪宅没有z平面，这意味着艺术家永远不会改写原始版本！</p><p> In many cases, these z-plane files were generated before the background art was done, and provide us glimpses at early drafts! For example, here in the circus tent of the Fettuccini Brothers, we see a slightly different arrangement of torches, as well as an entire section to the left that was deleted from the final game.</p><p>在许多情况下，这些z平面文件是在完成背景技术之前生成的，为我们提供了初稿的一瞥！例如，在Fettuccini兄弟的马戏团帐篷中，我们看到了火把的排列稍有不同，以及从最后一场比赛中删除的整个左侧部分。</p><p> (Note: Any spots in the original art that are actually meant to be white are re-colored in the z-plane file to yellow, which explains – among other things – the lack of dithering in the yellow section of the tent.)</p><p>（注意：原始艺术中实际上本应是白色的任何斑点都在z平面文件中重新着色为黄色，这尤其说明了帐篷的黄色部分没有抖动。）</p><p> Here is an early version of the docks (in this instance, we took the liberty of restoring the art that would have been behind the white z-plane pixels, as it was likely identical to the final art). Governor Marley’s re-election campaign poster is missing, the SCUMM Bar is merely a “SCUM” Bar, and the crane atop the leftmost building is actually in the water!</p><p>这是码头的早期版本（在这种情况下，我们可以自由地恢复原本在白色z平面像素后面的艺术品，因为它很可能与最终艺术品相同）。马利州长竞选连任的海报不见了，SCUMM酒吧只是一个“ SCUM”酒吧，最左边建筑物顶部的起重机实际上在水里！</p><p>  An early version of Low Street on Melee Island, with simple pixel dithering in place of the final version’s detail. Look closely and you can spot two z-planes that never function in the game, near the tops of the buildings. Looking at the game’s code, we see unused functions (with no associated code, meaning we only have their names) called “walk-onto-parapet,” “hang-around-on-the-parapet,” and “vacate-parapet.” Our best guess is that the random pirates that you encounter walking around on the street may have also been planned to appear behind these spots, providing a little more life to the environment.</p><p>近战岛低街（Low Street）的早期版本，通过简单的像素抖动代替了最终版本的细节。仔细观察，您可以在建筑物顶部附近发现两个在游戏中永远不会起作用的Z平面。查看游戏代码，我们会看到未使用的功能（没有关联的代码，这意味着我们只有它们的名称），分别称为“步入栏杆”，“栏杆上空”和“腾空栏杆”。 ”我们最好的猜测是，您在街上闲逛时遇到的随机海盗也可能已经计划出现在这些地点的后面，从而为环境提供了更多生命。</p><p>  Here’s a draft of Low Street, featuring what may have been yet another early design for the governor’s mansion on the upper-left.</p><p>这是低街（Low Street）的草稿，其中可能是左上角州长官邸的另一种早期设计。</p><p>  The unfinished version of Stan’s reveals the artist’s process: the main objects in the environment were first outlined to finalize the overall layout of the room, before going back to add in detail.</p><p>Stan的未完成版本揭示了艺术家的过程：首先概述环境中的主要对象，以最终确定房间的总体布局，然后再重新进行详细说明。</p><p>  A mild change for the title screen – in the earlier version, the lights in the village were much brighter. Note that the z-plane here was actually for the mist cloud that lazily drifts during the opening credits: in SCUMM terminology the clouds are an actor with a costume, just like a character in the game.</p><p>标题屏幕的变化不大-在早期版本中，村庄的灯光要明亮得多。请注意，这里的z平面实际上是用于在开学分期间懒散地漂移的雾云的：在SCUMM术语中，云是具有服装的演员，就像游戏中的角色一样。</p><p>  The title screen art also revealed an unused animation for the lookout’s fire pit on top of the mountain. In the video above, we restored this animation in code. The timing is a best guess, and the mist cloud was moved down a few pixels to avoid a clipping error.</p><p>标题屏幕上的图片还显示了山顶fire望台火坑的未使用动画。在上面的视频中，我们用代码恢复了此动画。最佳时机是最佳时机，雾云向下移动了几个像素以避免裁剪错误。</p><p> Here are surviving pieces of an earlier version of the game’s title screen, with completely different art! The water here is more detailed, and the village lights are centered on the screen.</p><p>以下是游戏标题屏幕的早期版本中尚存的片段，它们具有完全不同的艺术品！这里的水更详细，乡村的灯光集中在屏幕上。</p><p> We know that this title screen was used in the game at one point in development (along with its animated fireplace!), as it appears briefly in a promotional video previewing the game.</p><p>我们知道这个标题屏幕是在游戏开发中的某一时刻（以及动画壁炉！）使用的，因为它在预览游戏的促销视频中短暂出现过。</p><p>  Did you know that the five overhead Monkey Island maps line up into a perfect composite image? The view here is the combined map as it appears in the final game. But was there more to it?</p><p>您是否知道五张架空的猴岛地图排列成一个完美的合成图像？这里的视图是最终游戏中出现的组合地图。但是还有更多呢？</p><p>  This is the art file for an unused room in the game…or rather, nine unused rooms. The slices of shorelines on the right would be placed over the blank blue image on the left in code, depending on where the player was. It appears that the game design at one point allowed Guybrush to row onto the open sea, away from the island (or perhaps the inverse – Guybrush would approach the island from the open sea).</p><p>这是游戏中未使用的房间的美术文件，或者说是九个未使用的房间。取决于玩家所在的位置，右侧的海岸线片段将被放置在代码左侧的空白蓝色图像上方。似乎游戏设计在某一点上允许Guybrush在远离岛屿的地方划入公海（或者可能是相反的– Guybrush将从公海接近岛屿）。</p><p>  These newly revealed shorelines, when applied to the composited Monkey Island map, give us the complete image for the first time ever!</p><p>这些新近揭示的海岸线，当应用于合成的猴岛地图时，有史以来第一次为我们提供完整的图像！</p><p>  Here’s an abandoned version of the SCUMM Bar. The left portion is identical, but the kitchen is not – in the final game, the kitchen is a completely separate room, and appears with a different layout and perspective!</p><p>这是SCUMM酒吧的废弃版本。左边部分是相同的，但厨房不是-在最后一场比赛中，厨房是一个完全独立的房间，并且以不同的布局和视角出现！</p><p>  Why was it changed? As far as we can tell, it had to do with the cook. As players know, Guybrush must sneak past the cook while he’s serving guests in order to sneak into the kitchen. An investigation into parts of the game’s code that were left unused suggested the developers were having trouble with the way the cook would come in and out of the kitchen once Guybrush was in there. It appears this change was made as an easy way to address that.</p><p>为什么改变了？据我们所知，这与厨师有关。如玩家所知，Guybrush在为客人服务时必须潜行经过厨师，才能潜入厨房。对游戏代码中未使用的部分进行的调查表明，一旦Guybrush进入厨房，开发人员就无法解决厨师进出厨房的方式。看来此更改是解决此问题的简便方法。</p><p> And finally, here’s an early environment whose art did  not survive, though we do have a partial photograph of it! At one point in development, the lookout post on top of Melee Island was presented in an entirely different perspective, as seen here. If you look closely, you’ll see that the artist – likely Mark Ferarri – actually rotated the entire perspective around, without changing much of the design.</p><p>最后，这是一个早期环境，尽管我们确实有部分照片，但其艺术并没有幸存下来！在开发的某一时刻，以完全不同的视角呈现了近战岛顶部的look望台，如下所示。如果仔细观察，您会发现艺术家-可能是马克·费拉里（Mark Ferarri）–实际上围绕整个视角进行了旋转，而没有改变很多设计。</p><p>  We don’t have the art, but we do have some leftover code from this version, so we know a few things: the sunset scene in the background would change its colors into a nighttime version as the game progressed (just as the dock scene does in the EGA version of the game – this feature did not make it into the VGA version), the lookout would occasionally move between two different posts instead of staying still, and though there is no code for it, there may have been an object called “lookout boat” in the scene. Clues in the code suggest that this object was likely just art in the background, and not something the player could interact with. Nn unused costume file called LOOK_SHI.BYL (left) exists in the repository clearly showing a boat, but it is unknown if this is related.</p><p>我们没有美术，但是这个版本中确实有一些剩余代码，因此我们知道一些事情：随着游戏的进行，背景中的日落场景将其颜色更改为夜间版本（就像停靠场景一样）在游戏的EGA版本中使用-此功能未在VGA版本中使用），监视有时会在两个不同的帖子之间移动而不是静止不动，并且尽管没有代码，但可能存在一个对象在现场被称为“监视船”。代码中的线索表明，该对象可能只是背景中的艺术品，而不是玩家可以与之交互的东西。仓库中存在Nn个未使用的服装文件，名为LOOK_SHI.BYL（左），清楚地显示了一条船，但是未知是否与此相关。</p><p> Here it is, the legendary lost area of Monkey Island! Called “Trail,” this room was a pathway into the cannibal village. Fans have wondered about this room for years, as it appears briefly in  a 1990 news report about Lucasfilm Games that was uploaded online! Other than the cool dripping leg animation, there isn’t much to this room. It appears to have existed only for dramatic effect, as there is almost nothing to interact with here. The exact reason for the cut is unknown but there are two compelling cases: one is that the room slowed down the game’s pacing, and another – much simpler – explanation is that cutting it saved a significant amount of disk space.</p><p>在这里，传说中的猴岛迷路区！这个房间叫做“ Trail”，是通向食人村的一条小路。多年来，粉丝一直对这个房间感到疑惑，因为它在1990年有关Lucasfilm Games的新闻报道中短暂出现，并在线上传！除了酷炫的腿部动画外，这个房间没有什么其他功能。它的存在似乎仅是为了产生戏剧性的效果，因为这里几乎没有任何交互作用。削减的确切原因尚不得而知，但有两种令人信服的情况：一种是房间放慢了游戏的节奏，另一种（简单得多）的解释是削减可以节省大量的磁盘空间。</p><p>  Cutting this room appears to have been a very late decision, as it has what appears to be completed artwork in the later 256-color VGA version (complete with the dripping leg – but not the village smoke). It is unknown why the trail artwork and view of the cannibal’s village was altered so drastically for this version, perhaps they were recycling the art for another purpose?</p><p>裁切这个房间似乎是一个很晚的决定，因为它具有后来的256色VGA版本中的完整艺术品（带有滴水的支腿-但不是乡村烟雾）。尚不知道为什么在此版本中食人族村庄的步道艺术品和景观发生了如此大的变化，也许他们将艺术品用于其他目的？</p><p>  Two unused animation frames exist for the game’s ending, for Guybrush turning his head to look at Elaine. In the final game, he does this by simply shifting his eyes. This cut was likely done to save on disk space, as large pieces of art like this took up a lot of room – though as Gilbert told us during the stream, he thinks the eye turn is funnier.</p><p>游戏结束时存在两个未使用的动画帧，Guybrush转过头看向Elaine。在最后一场比赛中，他只是通过移动眼睛来做到这一点。这样做可能是为了节省磁盘空间，因为像这样的大件艺术品占用了很多空间-尽管正如Gilbert在直播中告诉我们的那样，他认为转眼很有趣。</p><p>  In an early version of the game, Guybrush would witness a handful of Monkey Island’s cannibals opening the monkey head, giving the player a clear view of how they would have to eventually get in. The scene partially exists in code, but was cut before any of the special animations – such as a cannibal using the cotton swab key in the monkey’s ear – were created. An interesting note here is that the cannibals in this scene have unique color palette assignments, meaning they are characters you technically never meet in the shipped game.</p><p>在游戏的早期版本中，Guybrush会目睹少数Monkey Island的食人族打开猴子头，从而使玩家清楚地知道他们最终将如何进入。场景部分存在于代码中，但在任何情况下都被剪切了制作了一些特殊的动画-例如使用猴耳中的棉签的食人族。这里有趣的一点是，此场景中的食人族具有独特的调色板分配，这意味着从技术上讲，它们是您在出厂游戏中从未遇到的角色。</p><p>  Early in the game’s development, the random pirates that appear on High Street and Low Street also appeared on the docks. They even walked in and out of the SCUMM Bar! The explanation we’ve heard for this cut is that players could easily be confused if they followed a pirate into the bar and couldn’t find them inside. Note: we have increased the frequency of random pirate spawns in code in order to demonstrate this feature, in the game they would have appeared much more infrequently.</p><p>在游戏开发的早期，出现在高街和低街的随机海盗也出现在码头上。他们甚至进出SCUMM酒吧！我们听到的关于裁员的解释是，如果玩家跟随海盗进入酒吧并在里面找不到他们，他们很容易感到困惑。注意：为了证明此功能，我们增加了代码中随机生成的海盗的频率，在游戏中它们的出现频率很少。</p><p>  And finally, here’s a room that was cut before it was fully drawn in. This is the Idol Room inside of the Governor’s Mansion, which was part of a puzzle to steal the idol that involved using jam to lead ants from one room to another. This puzzle was replaced by one of the final game’s most memorable moments, where Guybrush jumps behind the scenes and solves a series of elaborate and bizarre puzzles, outside of our view. One way of looking at this sketch is that it reveals the room where that moment happens! Where’s the yak?</p><p>最后，这是一间在完全投入使用之前被切开的房间。这是总督府大楼内的偶像室，这是窃取偶像的一个难题，其中涉及利用果酱将蚂蚁从一个房间引导到另一个房间。这个难题被最后一场游戏中最难忘的时刻所取代，Guybrush跳到幕后，解决了我们无法理解的一系列复杂而奇特的难题。查看此草图的一种方法是，它揭示了发生瞬间的房间！ the牛在哪里？</p><p>  The surviving source code for Monkey Island doesn’t have too many things that didn’t make the final cut – even the earliest surviving design documents mostly resemble the final product. But the few things that did survive offer an interesting glimpse into some of the game’s older ideas.</p><p>Monkey Island尚存的源代码并没有太多内容未能最终定稿，即使是尚存的最早的设计文档也大都类似于最终产品。但是，幸存下来的一些东西使人们对游戏中的一些较早的想法有了有趣的了解。</p><p>  At one point, the number fixing segment on Phatt Island had an entirely different puzzle! This one involved guessing colors, instead of guessing numbers. Can you solve it?</p><p>有一次，Phatt岛上的固定数字部分完全不同！这涉及猜测颜色，而不是猜测数字。你能解决吗？</p><p>  Here is a room that was likely cut before final art was drawn – a voodoo spell room inside of LeChuck’s fortress. While there is no functional code for interacting with any objects in the room, the SCUMM script suggests that the player would have solved a puzzle here that involved creating voodoo recipes by spelling words with the voodoo ingredients – perhaps a throwback to the gambling puzzle above?</p><p>这是一间在绘制最终艺术品之前可能已被砍掉的房间-勒查克（LeChuck）堡垒内的伏都教巫术室。尽管没有功能代码可与房间中的任何对象进行交互，但SCUMM脚本表明，玩家将在这里解决一个难题，该难题涉及通过拼写带有voodoo成分的单词来创建voodoo食谱–也许是上述赌博难题的回溯？</p><p>  The most surprising find of all were these close-up cutscenes of Largo and LeChuck! These scenes trigger whenever the player finds one of the four pieces of the map.</p><p>最令人惊讶的发现是Largo和LeChuck的这些特写过场动画！每当玩家找到地图的四个部分之一时，就会触发这些场景。</p><p> There are five close-up scenes in total, the first in the video above is completely unused in the game – in fact, we have no relics in code to even signal when this would have been triggered. The remaining four play out exactly the same as they do in the final game, except with this unique close-up artwork. In fact, the source code for these scenes simply comments out any reference to the close-up art, meaning the timing and dialogue are exactly the same.</p><p>一共有五个特写场景，上面视频中的第一个场景在游戏中是完全未使用的-实际上，我们没有代码中的遗物甚至在触发时会发出信号。剩下的四只玩法与最后一场比赛完全相同，唯一不同的是特写镜头。实际上，这些场景的源代码会简单地注释掉对特写镜头的任何引用，这意味着时间和对话完全相同。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamehistory.org/monkeyisland/">https://gamehistory.org/monkeyisland/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/代码/">#代码</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/源代码/">#源代码</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/monkey/">#monkey</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
