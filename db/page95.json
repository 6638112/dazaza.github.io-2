Now, Harris describes, his vision is that Career Karma will match employees and contractors to job training programs in the marketplace it has built over the past few years.\n  To execute on this stage of the business, Career Karma announced today that it has raised a $40 million Series B at an undisclosed valuation. The round was led by Top Tier Capital Partners, alongside GV (Google Ventures), Bronze Venture Fund, Stardust, Trousdale Ventures and Alumni Ventures Group. Existing investors also participated in the round, including SoftBank, Emerson Collective, Kapor Capital, Backstage, 4S Bay Partners and Y Combinator.\n \u201cStage one was become the number one career advice service for the internet, stage two was become the world\u2019s largest community of career transitioners and now phase three is to become the world\u2019s largest staffing firm,\u201d said Harris in an interview with TechCrunch.\n Similar to Handshake and Guild Education, both valued as multibillion-dollar businesses, Career Karma is playing the middleman. As an employee benefit, Career Karma will be able to get students employer-paid tuition, and then re-skill and up-skill them into ideally more advanced job skills.\n Employers will serve as a zero-cost acquisition channel that helps Career Karma work with lots of employees at scale \u2014 a business its been in since launch.\n  \u201cOn the user side, we\u2019re able to identify the job training programs that they\u2019re interested in, the current skills that they have and the job that they want,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEventually we\u2019re going to have a really powerful database internally.\u201d\n Career Karma\u2019s strategy shift means its business model will need a refresh as well. Previously, Career Karma charged a fee to bootcamps when it successfully placed a student in one of their programs. The fee was usually 10% of a placed-student\u2019s tuition, which could range from $10,000 to $50,000, Harris says. While this strategy could appear to align incentives \u2014 Career Karma only makes money when it successfully places a student inside a boot camp \u2014 it could also pressure the platform to focus more on pace of placement than personalization of placement. The enterprise business won\u2019t necessarily bring the same sorts of pressures, since it will be built to serve career services, not just program matching.\n Now, with an enterprise side, Harris said the company is hiring folks to help figure out the best new pricing strategy. Beyond the aforementioned companies, there\u2019s precedent in this sort of pivot: last year, Codecademy  raised the same sum in a Series D round to sell its services to the enterprise. A few weeks ago, the same company  sold to Skillsoft in a $525 million deal.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 04:02:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "karma,\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf", "title": "\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6dafKarma\u5360\u573040\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ee5\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3aEdtech\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u798f\u5229", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tCareer Karma lands $40M to evolve into an edtech employee benefit\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/career-karma-lands-40-million-to-evolve-into-a-edtech-employee-benefit/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["karma", "\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "81c4c0e3fc0921d505f10b0c307fb8a2.png", "infoid": 1072669, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u94b1\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u9996\u5148\u662f\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684Y\u7ec4\u5408\u80a1\u6743\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u4e3a125,000\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u53607\uff05\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u672c\u96c6\u56e2\u73b0\u5728\u8fd8\u5c06\u4ee5\u4e0d\u660e\u7ec6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u4e8b\u9879\u4e3a375,000\u7f8e\u5143 - \u672a\u6765\u80a1\u6743\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u534f\u8bae - \u201c\u6700\u6709\u5229\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u201d\u6761\u6b3e\u3002\n\u90a3\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u8005\u73b0\u5728\u4e3a\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u672c\u5e76\u4e0d\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6;\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u8fd9\u4e48\u957f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56e2\u961f\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u672f\u8bed\u662f\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u60ca\u559c\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u8fdc\u8d85\u8fc7\u7c7d\u7c7d\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u5e02\u573a\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u524d\u5f80\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u5373\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u6784\uff0cY\u7ec4\u5408\u8005\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u542f\u52a8\u5e02\u573a\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdb\u5316\u3002\u4ece\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4eb2\u4eba\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0cYC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u9065\u9065\u3002 TechCrunch Reckoning\uff0c\u8be5\u4ea4\u6362\u673a\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u53c2\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u5176\u4ed6\u56fd\u5bb6\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u8be5\u5c0f\u7ec4\u4e5f\u642c\u5230\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728TechCrunch\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6211\u4eec\u8d5e\u8d4f\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u518d\u4ece\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u5f00\u8f66\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u592a\u5c11\u6905\u5b50\u7684\u5927\u623f\u95f4\u3002", "note_en": "The money comes in two different forms. The first is the well-known Y Combinator equity deal, worth $125,000 for 7% of accelerated startups. The group will now also offer $375,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note \u2014 a simple agreement for future equity \u2014 with a \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clause.\n Uncapped means that there is no defined maximum price at which the $375,000 SAFE will convert to shares, while the \u201cmost favored nation\u201d language ensures that Y Combinator gets as good a deal as anyone else in a later conversion.\n  That Y Combinator is now offering more capital to startups is not surprising; indeed, that it took this long for the group to update its terms is the bigger surprise. Still, a half-million dollars is much more in keeping with where the pre-seed and seed-stage investing markets have headed in recent years, namely to larger dollar amounts at higher prices.\n The updated terms do not mean that the accelerator itself will have any less preserved upside in portfolio companies. In fact, you could argue that Y Combinator\u2019s updated terms are defensive in that it is offering more capital in addition, but not in place of, its traditional equity stake in companies that pass through its doors. So the accelerator may be better able to attract the best early-stage startups with larger checks, even as it puts its initial equity investment to work at a price point that has proven historically lucrative.\n  As an institution, Y Combinator has been updating itself as the startup market has evolved. From a focus on in-person work, YC  went remote during the pandemic. The result of that switch was more participating startups from other countries and markets,  by TechCrunch reckoning.

While women are born with a certain number of ovocytes \u2014 an immature female sex cell that later gives rise to fully mature ovum or egg cell \u2014 they eventually run out of these, at which point their ovaries stop functioning as an organ and stop producing the hormones that control women\u2019s physiology.\n Gameto wants to help delay that process, or even push it off forever if a woman chooses, by developing a platform for ovarian therapeutics that will initially be used to improve the process of assisted fertility but hopefully, eventually, be used, too, to identify cell therapies that can prevent what Radenkovic describes as the \u201cmedical burden\u201d of menopause. Asked for more details, Radenkovic is loath to dive into specifics but she says that the young company has already begun testing whether ovarian supporting cells could help mature eggs and reduce the number of IVF cycles that many women who are hoping to become pregnant currently endure.\n \u201cWe have strong preclinical evidence to to believe in our platform,\u201d she adds of the company, which is chaired by serial entrepreneur Martin Varsavsky, whose last company,  Prelude Fertility, has\u00a0 create a nationwide network of fertility centers across the U.S.\n Some notable investors are willing to bet on the company, too. Gameto just raised $20 million in funding led by Future Ventures, whose cofounder, Maryanna Saenko, says the firm is \u201cdeeply excited about the prospect of a better standard of care for women undergoing menopause. The suffering caused by menopause is not a biological imperative, and the many complications that come along with menopause, particularly early-onset menopause, can be entirely avoided\u201d along with today\u2019s hormone replacement therapies, which she describes as \u201cblunt hammers, lacking personalization.\u201d\n  Other participants include Bold Capital Partners, Lux Capital, Plum Alley, TA Ventures, Overwater Ventures, Arch Venture Partners cofounder Robert Nelsen and 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki.\n Gameto had previously raised $3 million in seed funding last year, including from Atomic founder Jack Abraham, SALT Fund, FJ Labs, Coatue Management founder Dan Rose and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong.\n Certainly, the market opportunity is huge and the thesis \u2014 given that people are living longer \u2014 makes a lot of sense. Indeed, look for other startups to begin focusing more squarely on delaying menopause.\n Already, Gameto has some competition, including from Celmatix, a 12-year-old company that\u2019s  creating a drug program to slow the depletion of a woman\u2019s ovarian reserve and that similarly hopes to separate a woman\u2019s endocrine function from reproduction. In the past,  according to Fortune, the company has received a grant Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to work on nonhormonal contraceptives and early last year, it announced a separate a partnership with pharmaceutical giant Bayer and the drug development company Evotec.\n Researchers have meanwhile been looking into the issue of treating menopause as a treatable disease for at least several years.

You\u2019re a 20-year-old millionaire. What do you have to be depressed about?\u201d says Alex Warren, a TikTok star with 14.7 million followers. \u201cBut that\u2019s what I struggle with. I feel like I\u2019m not allowed to be depressed.\u201d\n  On \u201cHype House,\u201d these ordinary-teens-turned-icons agonize over the nature of their chance celebrity status, worrying that their fame will vanish as quickly as it appeared. The eponymous Hype House is one of TikTok\u2019s longest-running  content houses, where social media stars live together and film videos. This concept isn\u2019t new \u2014 YouTube, Twitch and Vine stars have  experimented with these collaborative, live-in projects for years.\n Thomas Petrou (8 million followers) is the de facto manager, though he says he doesn\u2019t take a cut of profits \u2014 he calls himself the dad of the house, but in addition to making sure everyone does their dishes, he makes sure that the Hype House brand can net at least $80,000 per month to stay afloat. His influencer friends like Vinnie Hacker (12.9 million followers), Jack Wright (8.8 million followers), Alex Warren (14.7 million followers) and others live rent-free in the  $5 million mansion \u2014 all they have to do is post on the official Hype House TikTok once per month, which generates the venture revenue through ongoing branded content deals. Plus, TikTok now directly pays creators for the traffic they drive on the platform.\n The Netflix series marks the end of an era for the Hype House, focusing more on the challenges that these influencers face than the antics of these young millionaires.\n All things considered, the videos that these TikTokers post aren\u2019t that different from what any average teenager would post (except that now they post from a mansion). With almost 20 million followers, the official Hype House TikTok features the stars experimenting with new filters, iterating on the latest trends and, of course, dancing.\n  Throughout the eight-episode series, a cloud of anxiety hovers over the scenic Santa Rosa Valley home. Some Hype House members aren\u2019t churning out content on behalf of the group as often as Petrou wants them to, because they feel uninspired and disillusioned. In one scene, some Hype House members try to come up with content ideas while lying on giant beanbags, but the best idea they can think of is to make up a \u201clit-ass handshake.\u201d They might live rent-free in a beautiful mansion, but they don\u2019t seem to be having fun.\n Meanwhile, Alex Warren is grasping at straws, staging stunts that aren\u2019t getting as much online engagement as he wants. Even as he grapples with troubling family situations and a foot injury, he\u2019s terrified to take a mental health break.\n \u201cWhen you stop posting in this line of work, you lose engagement,\u201d Warren explains in a confessional. \u201cYou don\u2019t get sick days in this job. If you get a sick day, you lose followers, which is a loss of revenue, which is, you know, your job.\u201d\n  TikTok stardom is becoming comprehensible as a career on the internet, as  dozens of startups crop up aiming to help these suddenly famous kids navigate brand deals and partnerships (for a cut of their riches, of course). On YouTube, most early creators found profit through ad revenue, but at least in the platform\u2019s beginning days, there wasn\u2019t the same attention to monetization as there is now. Other platforms are also eager to capitalize on the success of TikTok and its biggest stars \u2014 Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars to incentivize creators to post on their platforms, rather than TikTok.\n \u201cAs an influencer, our whole lives are put on this weird pedestal more so than a traditional celebrity,\u201d Nikita Dragun (14.2 million followers) explains on the show. \u201cYou have to become a spokesperson, an activist, a model, a publicist, a manager\u2026 You have to be so many things at once.\u201d\n In most ways, the growth of creator monetization is a good thing \u2014 there are more tools than ever to help creative people make a living by doing what they love. Even LinkedIn has  a team of 40 staff dedicated to working with creators. But at the same time, some creators feel pressure to monetize every aspect of their lives. Part of Warren\u2019s following stems from his posts about his relationship with his girlfriend Kouvr Annon, also a TikTok star with 13.6 million followers \u2014 but Warren struggles to separate their private lives from the content they make, straining their (rarely) off-camera relationship.\n In this era of the internet, accelerated by the growth of TikTok, it\u2019s not just about posting videos. It\u2019s about cobbling together as many different revenue streams as you can to make sure that if your platform died tomorrow (it\u2019s happened before \u2014  R.I.P. Vine), you\u2019d still have a career. After all, TikTok stars don\u2019t make the bulk of their income from TikTok itself. The fortune comes from brand deals, sponsorships, merch sales, podcasts, reality shows and unexpected forays into  music and  acting.\n \u201cHype House\u201d emphasizes these creators\u2019 self-awareness about their own mediocrity. They\u2019re charismatic, funny and conventionally attractive enough to entertain the masses, but they know that their fame has more to do with luck than talent, so they worry that their good fortune can be snatched away at any second. They stress about what they would do if they had to return to their hometowns, where many of them have fractured families; they worry about being \u201ccanceled.\u201d\n \u201cSocial media is a numbers game. Your money depends on the numbers,\u201d Warren explains. \u201cIf people stop watching as much as I\u2019m putting out, it means I\u2019m doing something wrong, so what am I doing wrong, and how can I get those people back?\u201d\n Warren\u2019s anxiety isn\u2019t unfounded \u2014 something as arbitrary as a change in TikTok\u2019s algorithm could hamper his growth. When you\u2019re used to explosive social media growth, how do you handle it when those numbers start to plateau, or worse, plummet?\n In addition to worrying about TikTok\u2019s algorithm, the business model of content houses is similarly unstable. Since starting the venture, the Hype House has faced a number of  lawsuits, including a dispute with fellow influencer and former Hype House member Daisy Keech. In a recent  YouTube video, Petrou says he\u2019s spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on lawsuits. Though the legal issues aren\u2019t broached on \u201cHype House,\u201d Petrou describes waking up and vomiting due to the stress of running the collective. These content houses should, in theory, ease the burden on independent creators \u2014 by being part of a collective, they have a team surrounding them to workshop ideas, collaborate on videos and bring in an additional income stream from the shared accounts. But instead, \u201cHype House\u201d makes it seem like relying on each other without clear financial agreements only made the stress worse.\n  Among the Hype House social circle is Charli D\u2019Amelio, the most followed person on TikTok with 133 million followers \u2014 Forbes estimated that she was also the highest-paid creator on the platform, earning  $17.5 million last year.\n \u201cI just like, post, as any other teenager in the world,\u201d D\u2019Amelio said on the reality show that Hulu made about her suddenly famous family. \u201cI was just posting on social media\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d As D\u2019Amelio once joked in her TikTok bio, \u201c don\u2019t worry i don\u2019t get the hype either.\u201d\n But even the creator economy\u2019s biggest star has doubts about whether her stardom is sustainable. In the pilot of \u201cThe D\u2019Amelio Show,\u201d she reveals that she\u2019s thought about what she\u2019ll do if she doesn\u2019t keep making millions, or if the pressure of her lifestyle becomes too much.\n \u201cBeing on calls with CEOs of companies\u2026 I\u2019m like, that\u2019s kind of fun?\u201d D\u2019Amelio says. \u201cSo no matter what really happens with social media, I could always go into marketing, because I know how it works. I know the back ends of everything, which is cool.\u201d\n It\u2019s bizarre for D\u2019Amelio to have a backup plan when she makes more money in a year than most people will make in their lifetime (plus their children\u2019s lifetimes, plus their grandchildren\u2019s lifetimes\u2026 unless one of the grandchildren makes it big on TikTok). But for viewers, the entire point of shows like \u201cHype House\u201d and \u201cThe D\u2019Amelio Show\u201d is to humanize these social media stars. For the production teams, the point is to make Netflix and Hulu money and for the stars themselves, it\u2019s to get an extra paycheck, and help them maintain and bolster their fame\u2026 it\u2019s all terribly meta. They leverage this semi-manufactured vulnerability to make themselves into even bigger stars.\n Maybe the biggest winner here is TikTok.

While  the value of the contract might seem just a drop in the bucket for the agency\u2019s nearly $10 billion budget, the contract was significant in that it cemented the agency\u2019s relationship with the controversial firm. The FBI previously acknowledged using Clearview AI to the Government Accountability Office but did not specify if it had a contract with the company.\n The FBI didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but it isn\u2019t the only federal law enforcement agency to ramp up its procurement of privately-owned facial recognition technologies in recent months. In September, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spent almost $4 million\u00a0on facial recognition technology from a company called Trust Stamp, as  Business Insider first reported. The same month agency  purchased a contract with Clearview AI starting at $500,000 with the potential to go up to $1.5 million dollars. In total, ICE investment in Clearview AI has more than doubled during the Biden administration, said Jack Poulson, executive director of the nonprofit Tech Inquiry.\n The contracts demonstrate that despite a growing chorus of concerns from lawmakers, regulators and civil liberties advocates about the dangers of facial recognition technology, federal law enforcement agencies have no interest in rolling back their use of the technologies. Instead, they\u2019re plowing ahead with private partnerships with companies whose databases of photos of private citizens eclipse government databases in scale.\n In fact, CyberScoop identified more than 20  federal law enforcement contracts with a total overall ceiling of over $7 million that included facial recognition in the award description or to companies whose primary product is facial recognition technology since June, when  a government watchdog released a report warning about the unmitigated technology. Even that number, which was compiled from a database of government contracts created by transparency nonprofit Tech Inquiry and confirmed with federal contracting records, is likely incomplete.  Procurement awards often use imprecise descriptions and sometimes the true beneficiary of the award is obscured by subcontractor status.\n This lack of transparency is especially noteworthy in light of  a June report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office that found 13 federal agencies that have law enforcement, including the FBI, did not track which non-federal systems with facial recognition technology their employees used.\u00a0 If agencies don\u2019t know what systems their employees are using, they cannot guarantee the technology has been vetted by the department for accuracy.\n That\u2019s a big concern when it comes to facial recognition technology. A 2019 study by the federal government found significantly higher false positives when facial recognition technology is deployed on Black and Asian individuals compared to white males. Even with mild improvements in recent years, civil liberties advocates warn it still poses a serious risk of discriminatory policing. The technology also raises serious privacy worries when deployed widely. \u00a0Clearview AI, which underwent federal testing  for accuracy for the first time in October, gained early scrutiny by building its database by  scraping millions of images from social media companies without user knowledge. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube  have all demanded Clearview AI stop the practices.\n  Lawmakers have also expressed fears over the unregulated use of technology by law enforcement. Democrats last year introduced legislation that  would prohibit federal entities from using biometric technologies absent congressional approval and would block funding to state and local law enforcement unless they enact their own bans. A separate bill introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that has gained bipartisan support  would prevent law enforcement from purchasing data commercially\u00a0that would otherwise require a warrant \u2014 including databases like Clearview AI. So far, neither bill has seen a floor vote.\n \u201cClearview AI harvested millions of Americans\u2019 personal photographs without their permission to build a massive facial recognition database,\u201d Wyden told CyberScoop in a statement. \u201cIt is deeply disappointing that the government would choose to reward this practice with taxpayer dollars, and use its credit card to end-run Americans\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights.\u201d\n Privacy advocates say that while the FBI\u2019s recent contract sheds some light on its operations, it shows that transparency isn\u2019t slowing down the harmful effects of the technology.\n \u201cThis is a case where we see that transparency isn\u2019t enough because now we see that the FBI has a contract with Clearview but that doesn\u2019t make anyone any safer,\u201d said Caitlin Seeley George, campaign director at nonprofit Fight for the Future.\n The technology has been deployed against activists, as the June GAO report shows, and increasingly adopted by private companies,  leading to evidence of discriminatory outcomes based on false matches.\n But privacy advocates see promise in other avenues. More than 27 states and localities have passed  some sort of ban on facial recognition use.\u00a0And both the Federal Trade Commission and White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy have expressed interest in addressing the privacy harms of facial recognition technology. The Federal Trade Commission recently told lawmakers that it was considering options including rulemaking to help regulate potentially discriminatory algorithmic technology, including facial recognition software. Meanwhile, the OSTP\u00a0  is developing an \u201cA.I. Bill of Rights\u201d and has hosted listening sessions with advocates on the issue.\n \u201cI think a couple of years ago these kinds of conversations weren\u2019t happening at all so the fact that we\u2019re having these conversations is a good sign,\u201d said Seeley George. \u201cAnd there are some good people in these agencies who care about human rights and want to do the right thing.\u201d\n Still, these steps lag behind a number of allied nations that have recently taken swift action to crack down on Clearview AI. Investigations by the Canadian, Australian, and  United Kingdom governments  found that Clearview violated local privacy laws. France\u2019s data privacy  regulator last month ordered the company to delete user data collected in violation of the European Union\u2019s data privacy laws.\n The Biden administration\u2019s silence on the company, especially in light of its  push elsewhere against surveillance technologies including spyware, is \u201cthe sign of a government that is not taking privacy issues seriously,\u201d said Poulson.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:39:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "rust,ai,growing,\u673a\u6784", "title":

"note_en": "Take-Two Interactive Software    TTWO  -14.80%  agreed to buy  Zynga    ZNGA  42.42%  in a roughly $11 billion deal as the maker of Grand Theft Auto looks to expand its mobile portfolio with hits like Words With Friends and FarmVille.\n  The cash-and-stock deal announced Monday is one of the videogame industry\u2019s biggest acquisitions. Take-Two Chief Executive Strauss Zelnick said a purchase of Zynga would give it a strong position in mobile, which has been the fastest-growing segment of the global videogame industry in recent years.\n  \u201cMore than 50% of our net bookings will come from mobile upon closing this transaction,\u201d Mr. Zelnick said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He added that the combined company will have more than one billion users, creating an opportunity to cross-promote content to a broader audience.\n  Under the cash-and-stock deal, Zynga stockholders would receive $9.86 for each share they own, including $3.50 in cash and $6.36 of Take-Two stock. The companies said the deal had an enterprise value of $12.7 billion, after adjusting for Zynga\u2019s convertible shares, cash and debt.\n    The deal, which is expected to close by midyear, represents about a 64% premium to Zynga\u2019s stock price of $6 as of Friday\u2019s close. In midday trading Monday, Zynga shares rose 42% to $8.49, while Take-Two fell 16% to $138.89.\n  \u201cWhile one never wants to be cavalier about a decline in their stock price, we are after all judged by our stock price,\u201d Mr. Zelnick said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always taken the view that we play for the long term.\u201d\n  Take-Two is best known for its computer and console game franchises such as Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K. \u201cGrand Theft Auto V,\u201d launched in 2013, is one of the bestselling videogames of all time. It has sold more than 155 million units world-wide, according to company data.\n  In recent years, Take-Two has expanded into mobile games through acquisitions of studios Playdots, SocialPoint and Nordeus. Though Zynga started out making browser-based games for  Facebook  it later shifted its focus to mobile games. Today, its portfolio includes hits such as \u201cCSR Racing\u201d and \u201cZynga Poker.\u201d\n  Mr. Zelnick said an attractive part of Zynga is that it has its own advertising platform. It is rare for game makers to have such a platform in-house, as most rely on third parties.\n  Shares of Zynga fell late last summer as the company took a hit from  Apple  new privacy rules, which  make it harder to track users for the purpose of selling targeted advertising. Zynga also reported  greater-than-expected audience declines because of easing pandemic restrictions.\n    More recently, though, the company has shown signs of rebounding. In November, Zynga reported record third-quarter bookings and narrowed its loss, as advertising sales nearly doubled. The company said then that it expects full-year revenue of $2.78 billion and $2.81 billion in net bookings, which was unchanged from the previous quarter.\n  Take-Two\u2019s most recent earnings report, issued in November, was for its fiscal second quarter and showed modest increases in revenue and net bookings. At that time, the company also raised its outlook for the full fiscal year ending in March, saying it expects revenue in the range of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion and net bookings of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion.\n  On a call with analysts, Mr. Zelnick said he avoided one of the buzzier terms in the videogame space today, the metaverse.\n  \u201cThat\u2019s a word we stayed away from today,\u201d he said in the Journal interview. But he added that Take-Two and Zynga both see opportunities with related technologies  such as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs.\n  \u201cI think both teams are very focused on what Web 3.0 will bring,\u201d he said, referring to another term for  the next evolution of the internet.\n    Mr. Zelnick said Zynga will be folded into Take-Two\u2019s mobile-games division and continue to operate independently as is the case with its other units such as Rockstar Games and 2K. It is possible that Zynga could make mobile games based on Take-Two\u2019s console and computer franchises such as Red Dead Redemption and Borderlands, he said.\n  \u201cOne of the key opportunities is to bring our core intellectual properties to the mobile business, in many instances for the first time,\u201d Mr. Zelnick said.\n  He added that Take-Two has had a relationship with Zynga\u2019s management team for a while. Mr. Zelnick said Take-Two admires Zynga\u2019s free-to-play business model, which lets players download games for free but with the option to spend money on virtual goods.\n  The global videogame industry  was one of the bigger beneficiaries of the pandemic\u2019s social-distancing restrictions, with consumer spending on game software jumping roughly 23% in 2020 from the year prior, according to estimates from Newzoo BV. Last year, though, that growth shrank to about 1.4%, bringing the total to about $180 billion, the analytics firm said.\n  Consumer spending on mobile games has been particularly robust in recent years, outpacing that of spending on console and computer games combined.\n  Deal activity has also been heavy in the videogame sector, which overall generated an estimated $180.3 billion in global consumer spending last year, according to analytics firm Newzoo BV. Last year,  Microsoft  bought the owner of the popular Doom videogame franchise for $7.5 billion,  its biggest games acquisition. Also last year,  Electronic Arts  acquired Glu Mobile Inc.  for $2.4 billion and Playdemic Ltd.  for $1.4 billion.\n  Notably, EA also purchased Codemasters Group Holdings last February for $1.2 billion after Take-Two  initially bid on the company, which is known for its Formula One auto-racing series.\n  Zynga has grown through deal-making as well in recent years, having purchased studios such as Rollic and StarLark. The company also in May bought Chartboost, a mobile advertising and monetization platform, for approximately $250 million, in a move aimed at helping to improve its ad-targeting capabilities.\n  Last year, Zynga\u2019s \u201cToon Blast\u201d mobile game was its top revenue generator, amassing more than $415 million from player spending, according to estimates from Sensor Tower Inc. Zynga acquired the maker of Toon Blast, Istanbul-based Peak, in 2020  for $1.8 billion.\n  The deal between Take-Two and Zynga would benefit both companies, said MKM analyst Eric Handler, who recently named the latter as one his top stock picks for 2022. \u201cThe videogames industry is increasingly becoming one of scale,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:34:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u83b7\u5f97,zynga", "title": "Take-B\u5c06\u4ee512.7\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u83b7\u5f97Zynga\uff0c\u6216\u6bcf\u80a19.86\u7f8e\u5143\uff0cZynga 1\u67087\u65e5\u6536\u76d8\u4ef7\u4e3a64\uff05; Take-Byopminds GTA\uff0cRed Dead\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u6807\u9898", "title_en": "Take-Two will acquire Zynga for $12.7B, or $9.86 per share, a 64% premium on Zynga's January 7 closing price; Take-Two develops GTA, Red Dead, and other titles", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/videogame-maker-take-two-interactive-to-buy-zynga-in-12-7-billion-deal-11641818298?mod=djemalertNEWS", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u83b7\u5f97", "zynga"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f06da83efd353779ccbc33cb049029a9.jpg", "infoid": 1072664, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e00\u4efd\u62a5\u544a\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6b27\u6d32\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u963b\u6b62\u4e86Apple\u4e0eiOS 15\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u6765\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5c42\u3002\nApple\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8Web\u65f6\u7ed9\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u53e6\u4e00\u5c42\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u901a\u8fc7Apple\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u53d1\u9001\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u662f\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u3002\u8be5\u7279\u5f81\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e746\u6708\u5728WWDC\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u5728IOS 15\u4e2d\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u4e2d\u3002\nT-Mobile\u662f\u6b27\u6d32\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u79c1\u4eba\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u4fe1\u51fd\u3002\u8f7d\u4f53\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u524a\u51cf\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4ece\u8bbf\u95ee\u201c\u91cd\u8981\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u201d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u7535\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u201c\n\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5f53\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u8702\u7a9d\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684T-Mobile\u548cSprint\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u7559\u7684iCloud\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff1a\n\u8be5\u66f4\u6539\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5c1a\u672a\u4ee5\u7f51\u7edc\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u770b\u8d77\u6765T-Mobile\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u5176\u8702\u7a9d\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528iCloud\u79c1\u6709\u7ee7\u7535\u5668 - \u81f3\u5c11\u73b0\u5728\u3002\u60c5\u51b5\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u60a8\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u8ba1\u5212\u800c\u5f02\u3002\n@ 9to5mac\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf@tmobile\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e5f\u662f\u963b\u6b62#icloud\u516c\u5171\u7ee7\u7535\u5668\u3002\u6211\u662f\u524d\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3002", "note_en": "Earlier today, a  report indicated that some European carriers were blocking the Private Relay feature introduced by Apple with iOS 15. This feature is designed to give users an additional layer of privacy by ensuring that no one can view the websites that they visit.\n Now, in addition to some carriers in Europe, it appears that T-Mobile/Sprint in the United States is also blocking iCloud Private Relay access when connected to cellular data.\n  Apple says that Private Relay is a feature designed to give users another layer of privacy when browsing the web. The first relay is sent through a server maintained by Apple, and the second is a third-party operator.\u00a0The feature was announced at WWDC last June and initially slated for inclusion in iOS 15.\n Apple ultimately shipped the feature as a \u201cpublic beta,\u201d meaning that it is disabled by default in the newest iOS 15 and macOS Monterey releases. You can manually enable it by going to Settings on your iPhone, tapping your name at the top, choosing iCloud, and choosing \u201cPrivate Relay.\u201d\n T-Mobile was among the carriers in Europe that signed an open letter expressing concern about the impact of Private Relay. The carriers wrote that the feature cuts off networks and servers from accessing \u201cvital network data and metadata and could impact \u201coperator\u2019s ability to efficiently manage telecommunication networks.\u201d\n In the UK, carriers including T-Mobile, EE, and others have already started blocking Private Relay usage when connected to cellular data.  9to5Mac has also now confirmed that T-Mobile is extending this policy to the United States.\n This means that T-Mobile and Sprint users in the United States can no longer use the privacy-preserving iCloud Private Relay feature when connected to cellular data. An error message in the Settings app explains:\n Your cellular plan doesn\u2019t support iCloud Private Relay. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.\n The change does not appear to be network-wide just yet, but rather it appears T-Mobile is in the process of rolling it out. This means that some users might still be able to use iCloud Private Relay when connected to their cellular network \u2013\u00a0at least for now. The situation could also could vary based on your location or plan.\n Apple has yet to comment on this situation, but it is worrisome to see carriers like T-Mobile interfering with system-level iOS features. There\u2019s likely not much that Apple can do here, but it underscores another limitation of Private Relay as a feature as well as the power that carriers hold.\n @9to5mac Looks like  @TMobile USA is also blocking  #icloud Public Relay.

This flowering cultivar of the Callery pear (  Pyrus calleryana) was bred to be thorn-less and sterile. We thought it could not reproduce.\n    We soon found out that the flowers stink, but it took a few years to discover the trees are brittle. The Bradford cultivar breaks in storms.\n  So horticulturists went back to the lab to create stronger cultivars  including \u2018Aristocrat\u2019, \u2018Autumn Blaze\u2019, \u2018Capital\u2019, \u2018Chanticleer\u2019 (also known as \u2018Cleveland Select\u2019), \u2018New Bradford\u2019, \u2018Redspire\u2019, and \u2018Whitehouse. The tree was poised to become invasive.\n It took a while to realize that different sterile cultivars within the reach of the same pollinating insect could cross pollinate and produce fertile fruit. The seed is a hybrid of hybrids. Birds eat the fruit and transport the seeds.\n  Pyrus calleryana spreads prolifically now by seeds and roots in old fields, roadsides and disturbed soil. The invasive trees are not noticeable until early spring when they bloom before our native white-flowering trees:  chokecherry,  downy serviceberry (shadbush), and  hawthorn.\n  It\u2019s gone wild in 25 states and is listed as invasive in 14. In July 2021 South Carolina banned   Pyrus calleryana sale and cultivation with enforcement phased in by October 2024.\n  In November 2021 the  PA Department of Agriculture added Callery pear ( Pyrus calleryana) to the state\u2019s list of Noxious Weeds. It cannot be legally sold or cultivated in our state though you may see it in nurseries while enforcement is phased in through February 2024.\n  In the meantime, if you are offered a Callery pear cultivar as a landscaping choice, don\u2019t buy it.\n  ( fruit photo by Kate St. John, remaining photos and map from bugwood; click on the captions to see the originals)\n p.s.

"note_en": "It\u2019s a new year, and I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s a good time to replace myself as the CEO of Signal. I have now been working on Signal for almost a decade. It has always been my goal for Signal to grow and sustain beyond my involvement, but four years ago that would still not have been possible. I was writing all the Android code, was writing all of the server code, was the only person on call for the service, was facilitating all product development, and was managing everyone. I couldn\u2019t ever leave cell service, had to take my laptop with me everywhere in case of emergencies, and occasionally found myself sitting alone on the sidewalk in the rain late at night trying to diagnose a service degradation. I\u2019ve spent the past four years endeavouring to change that, and today the picture is radically different. Signal is now an amazing group of 30 people: a mix of wonderful engineers, super talented designers, gifted and unflappable support staff, and a very accomplished and committed leadership team. I rarely write code anymore, and if I do it\u2019s in a minor role. I am not tempting fate by leaving cell service, no single person is ever perpetually on call, and hopefully nobody at Signal will ever find themselves sitting on the sidewalk with their laptop in the rain again (unless that happens to be your preferred remote work setup). We have a great leadership team that is facilitating product development, managing the organization, and pushing the technology forward. Most importantly, the values and the mission that Signal was built on are embedded in the whole of the organization, and everyone involved is here to honor them and see them through. Simultaneously, Signal has grown in adoption and popularity around the world even faster than I imagined. People increasingly find value and peace of mind in Signal (technology built for them instead of for their data), and  are increasingly willing to sustain it. Every day, I\u2019m struck by how boundless Signal\u2019s potential looks, and I want to bring in someone with fresh energy and commitment to make the most of that. In other words, after a decade or more, it\u2019s difficult to overstate how important Signal is to me, but I now feel very comfortable replacing myself as CEO based on the team we have, and also believe that it is an important step for expanding on Signal\u2019s success. I\u2019ve been talking with candidates over the last few months, but want to open up the search with this announcement in order to help find the best person for the next decade of Signal. Please get in touch if that might be you! I will continue to remain on the Signal board, committed to helping manifest Signal\u2019s mission from that role, and I will be transitioning out as CEO over the next month in order to focus on the candidate search. Brian Acton, who is also on the Signal Foundation board, has volunteered to serve as interim CEO during the search period. I have every confidence in his commitment to the mission and ability to facilitate the team for this time. Finally, thank you to everyone who has helped make Signal what it is, has been supportive of what we\u2019re building, and has been there along the way. We already have so much exciting work that\u2019s coming soon in the pipeline right now, and I\u2019m optimistic about all the potential for Signal over the next decade.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:24:32", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9996\u5e2d,year,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u65b0\u5e74\uff0c\u65b0\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98", "title_en": "New Year, New CEO", "transed": 1, "url": "https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9996\u5e2d", "year", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072661, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5305\u62ec\u8036\u9c81\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u4e54\u6cbb\u57ce\u5927\u5b66\u548c\u897f\u5317\u5927\u5b66\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5341\u516d\u6b21\u4e3b\u8981\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u5b66\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u6d89\u5acc\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u8fdd\u89c4\u800c\u88ab\u8d77\u8bc9\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5171\u540c\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u5b9a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u63f4\u52a9\u5956\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "Sixteen major U.S. universities, including Yale University, Georgetown University and Northwestern University, are being sued for alleged antitrust violations because of the way they work together to determine financial-aid awards for students.\n  According to a lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court late Sunday by law firms representing five former students who attended some of the schools, the universities engaged in price fixing and unfairly limited aid by using a shared methodology\u00a0to calculate applicants\u2019 financial need.

In spring 2020, many Republicans, including President Donald Trump, insisted that COVID was hardly worse than the flu; that its fatality risk was comparable to an everyday activity, like driving in a car; and that an obsessive focus on cases wouldn\u2019t give an accurate picture of what was going on in the pandemic.\n In the current Omicron wave, these Republican talking points seem to have mostly come true\u2014for most  vaccinated  non-senior adults, who are  disproportionately Democrats.\n But Democratic talking points about the severity of COVID and the need for commensurate caution remain valid and not only for the sick and elderly. Ironically, they are especially true for the unvaccinated\u2014a  disproportionately Republican group that has seen their hospitalization rates soar this winter to all-time highs. About 9,000 Americans are dying of COVID every week. Preliminary state data  suggest that more than 90 percent of today\u2019s deaths are still among unvaccinated people. This year, COVID is on pace to kill  more than 300,000 unvaccinated people who would, quite likely, avoid death by getting two or three shots.\n  The messiness of Omicron data\u2014record-high cases! but much milder illness!\u2014has deepened our COVID   Rashomon, in which different communities are telling themselves different stories about what\u2019s going on, and coming to different conclusions about how to lead their lives. That\u2019s true even within populations that, a year ago, were united in their desire to take the pandemic seriously and were outraged by those who refused to do so.\n A virus that seems both pervasive and mild offers an opening to people who are, let\u2019s call them, \u201cvaxxed and done.\u201d The attitude of the VADs is this:\n For more than a year, I did everything that public-health authorities told me to do. I wore masks. I canceled vacations. I made sacrifices. I got vaccinated. I got boosted. I\u2019m happy to get boosted again. But this virus doesn\u2019t stop. Year over year, the infections don\u2019t decrease. Instead,  virulence for people like me is decreasing, either because the virus is changing, or because of growing population immunity, or both. Americans should stop pointlessly guilting themselves about all these cases. In the past week,  daily confirmed COVID cases per capita were higher than the U.S. in Ireland, Greece, Iceland, Denmark, France, the U.K., Spain, Portugal, Italy, Switzerland, and even Australia, one of the most COVID-cautious countries in the world. As the coronavirus continues its unstoppable march toward endemicity, our attitude toward the virus should follow a similar path toward stoicism. COVID is becoming something like the seasonal flu for most people who keep up with their shots, so I\u2019m prepared to treat this like I\u2019ve treated the flu: by basically not worrying about it and living my life normally.\n It\u2019s hard to put a number on how many people are in this group, but we have some hard data to prove that their ranks are growing. This past December, airports processed  twice as many travelers compared with the same period in 2020, despite many flights being canceled. On several days, TSA-checkpoint numbers exceeded their totals from pre-pandemic 2019. This is not the picture of a country that is hunkering down for Omicron. It is the limited snapshot of a mostly vaccinated population with millions of people who are eager to move on.\n I have a lot of sympathy for this group\u2019s case, especially as it relates to schools. The risk of COVID to vaccinated teachers  and even unvaccinated students seems lower than we initially thought. Meanwhile, the costs of remote schooling seem  higher than we feared. The White House and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona have come out strongly in support of keeping schools open. Other Democratic leaders, like Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, are fighting reluctant teachers to keep school in person. Even among pro-vaccine Americans, a growing number of people seem to be saying they are done with remote school as a baseline COVID policy.\n But there is an opposing group. Let\u2019s call them the \u201cvaxxed and cautious.\u201d Here\u2019s my best summary of their perspective:\n Why on earth would we suddenly relax measures   now, during the largest statistical wave of COVID ever recorded in the U.S.? We shouldn\u2019t treat Omicron like any old seasonal flu, because it\u2019s not like any old seasonal flu. It\u2019s likely deadlier for those without immunity and almost certainly several times more transmissible for everybody else. We have no idea what the effects of Omicron on long COVID will be, but  evidence of  lingering symptoms should make us wary of just letting tens of millions of people get needlessly infected. Moreover, the health-care system is  already worn down and at risk of being overloaded. Record-high caseloads are societally debilitating, creating long chains of infections that are bound to reach some immunocompromised people and the elderly, thus causing needless death. For all these reasons, we should take individual measures to throttle the spread of this virus.\n If you feel a bit torn between these ideologies, I understand. I\u2019m a bit torn myself.\n  In the past few weeks, several people have told me that they feel extremely safe personally but remain worried about passing along the virus to vulnerable people in their networks. So what should they do? This is not a problem with an easy answer, because the gap between individual risk and societal risk in this pandemic has never been wider. The risk of death from Omicron for boosted, healthy adults under 50 seems to be somewhere between that of riding a bike and going on an airplane. In isolation, this statistic makes the vaxxed-and-done perspective a no-brainer: Nobody consults the CDC website to decide if it\u2019s safe to bike down the street.\n But a pandemic is more than the sum of individual healthy-adult experiences. Viruses are  societal multiplication problems. When a double-digit share of a public-school system comes down with Omicron, school is out, and the effects ripple through local families. When a double-digit share of a medical system comes down with Omicron, doctor and nurse availability plummets, and the effect ripples through the hospital. With workers out across industries, entire cities stop functioning. In Washington, D.C., last week, some schools had to delay opening not because of the virus but because snowplows couldn\u2019t make the roads safe enough to get there\u2014too many snowplow drivers were out sick.\n My synthesis view is that we should start with the obvious. If I were COVID czar, my rules for early 2022 would be to try desperately to keep schools open and in person, follow through on  vaccine mandates for nursing homes, distribute free rapid tests to allow people to identify their own infectiousness when they mix households with vulnerable people, and expand vaccine PSA programs, since the vaccines seem by far the most effective intervention against the virus.

Most often the answers to the questions come back to a central theme \u2013 because that\u2019s the way it\u2019s always been done. To that I say, \u201cYes, I know this is the way it\u2019s always been done\u2014but is there a better way?\u201d\n Let\u2019s question everything. From our questions can flow incredible things \u2014 ideas that seem a bit ridiculous \u2026 until they become common. Questions like: if we worked less, could we actually be more effective and productive? If we approached our work differently, could we be better outside of work?\n I think it\u2019s important to ask questions in all parts of our lives and work. It\u2019s useful to look at something that have been done one way for so long that it\u2019s become a default, and then shift it slightly, just to see what happens \u2014 and to see what might improve.\n That\u2019s the motivation behind our company\u2019s experiment with a four-day workweek. We\u2019re turning Fridays into something more like Saturdays or Sundays \u2014 genuine time off, with no planned meetings or work. Our Board, Leadership Team, and People Ops team have been supportive, and we\u2019re eager to see how the pilot goes.\n What\u2019s the rationale? Work is changing and the biggest obstacle we have to face is burnout. It\u2019s why we launched  Conscious.org, a place to catalog all the future of work experiments that we\u2019ve embraced and used to improve our internal culture.\n The four day workweek speaks to a shift in people\u2019s working styles \u2014 namely, that if you can get your work completed from Monday to Thursday, then there should be no latent expectation that Friday is time on. Instead, it can be time off \u2014 a period to rest, recover, engage with loved ones, think creatively and all the other things that enliven us.\n Here\u2019s what many of us know but can be tough to admit: Work will fill the space you give to it. My bet is that we\u2019re going to become vastly more efficient from Monday to Thursday. We\u2019ll trim those excess meetings; we won\u2019t send unnecessary communications. Because we\u2019ll have less time, we\u2019ll get more concrete work done.\n As with everything we do at Bolt, this is an experiment. To that end, we\u2019re encouraging employees to set the following out-of-office email notification of Fridays: \u201cI\u2019m out of the office today because we\u2019re working consciously here at Bolt and are currently testing out a four-day workweek. I\u2019ll be back in touch with you on [Monday].\u201d We\u2019ll be tracking our successes and failures closely\u2014and, in the tradition of  Conscious.org, sharing them publicly.\n Is this a way to do the workweek better? I think so, but we\u2019re testing the hypothesis and doing so with an organization that has big goals, a growing team, and a lot on the line. We\u2019ll keep you all updated as this moves forward, and we look forward to letting you know how we do.\n Check out   Fast Company\u2019s article  on how Bolt is the first tech unicorn to shift to a four-day workweek.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:12:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "day", "title": "\u5207\u6362\u5230\u4e3a\u671f\u56db\u5929\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5468", "title_en": "Switching to a four-day workweek", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bolt.com/blog/switching-four-day-workweek/#", "via": "", "real_tags": ["day"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e9a77ae47790d803d19b65c1b33b4ea7.png", "infoid": 1072658, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u662f21\u4e16\u7eaa\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u771f\u6b63\u6709\u6548\u5417\uff1f\u83b7\u5f97\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u81ea\u5df1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u6211\u4e70\u4e86\u4e24\u5757160\u74e6\u7684\u9762\u677f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9633\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b89\u88c5\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "note_en": "Using renewable energy is a popular trend in the 21st century.

When a company is accepted into the YC batch program, we now invest a total of $500,000. We still invest $125,000 for 7% and now also invest an additional $375,000 on an uncapped safe with an MFN  1.\n This is the type of deal that we have wanted to offer YC founders for years \u2014 and with the recent success of YC companies, including ten IPOs in 2021 and more to come this year, we are now able to do so. This sum will enable founders to focus on launching, building, and scaling their company. It will remove the immediate pressure to fundraise and accept less than favorable terms.\n Incidentally, we also hope that this deal will encourage more founders of any age and from every demographic group and geographic location to take the leap into the startup world, apply to YC, and build their own successful startup.\n Dalton Caldwell, YC\u2019s Managing Director, Architect, and long-term Group Partner, who first suggested that now was the right time to make this change, also pointed out that if founders stay lean, this is more than enough capital to survive for years, regardless of the economic environment.\n Our  founding principles state that YC\u2019s value is \u201cthe number of startups we help times how much we help them.\u201d More startups in the world is a good thing \u2014 and for the founders of those startups, we\u2019re always iterating to improve our program. This terrific deal will make it even more likely that they find product market fit, raise a successful seed round, and build a world-changing technology company.\n  1 The $375,000 is on an uncapped safe with \u201cMost Favored Nation\u201d (MFN) terms. MFN means that this safe will take on the terms of the lowest cap safe (or other most favorable terms) that is issued between the start of the batch and the next equity round. Simply put, we\u2019re giving the company money now but at terms you\u2019ll negotiate with future investors.  \u21a9", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:10:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "The Ladies of iFixit have earned 1 million in  reputation! This collective milestone is thanks to a wonderful group of women fixers, each of whom contribute to iFixit\u2019s community by finding solutions to repair-related problems.\n So who are the Ladies of iFixit? We are comprised of  51 members, who together and over a significant period of time have authored or contributed to 3,000  repair guides and provided 486 solutions to the repair community. Our ladies are from different departments (and countries), but we are not pigeonholed by our positions or titles\u2014all of us can fix.\n We share whatever knowledge we have, be it by answering questions on our  Answers Forum, creating a guide, or improving the knowledge base by editing existing guides and tackling unanswered questions.\n  Our resident guidekeeper and orphan slayer (trust us, it\u2019s nicer than it sounds),  Sam Goldheart makes up the bulk of our 1 million achievement, with 443K in reputation, 108 solutions, and 2,287 guides authored or edited. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I made one [guide], but I love that they\u2019re still helping people out every day,\u201d Sam said. \u201cGetting comments on those guides always makes my day.\u201d These days, she considers herself a \u201clead-tech-writer-turned-blog-writer,\u201d who does a little bit of everything around the iFixit office. And while she isn\u2019t exclusively writing guides anymore, the Internet still reaps the benefits of her meticulous instructions.\n One fixer  saved over $400 thanks to a Goldheart guide. Another praised her  attention to detail in providing accurate screw sizes and emphasizing necessary precautions to avoid accidents. \u201cIt was hard work to make those guides, but the investment super paid-off,\u201d Sam said. \u201cAs an Easter egg, readers can look up my very first guide, one I made before I was hired. It\u2019s pretty bad!\u201d\n  Sam\u2019s candor speaks to the core of the iFixit philosophy. Even if you write a \u201cpretty bad guide\u201d when you\u2019re starting out, at least you\u2019re sharing what you know. With enough patience and curiosity, you can hone your skills, grow your confidence, and fix more things. And that\u2019s what we are all about here!\n Our Japanese Localization Lead,  Midori Doi started working at iFixit just before the iFixit Japanese website launched. At the time, iFixit was known in Japan more for our iPhone teardowns than for our repair guides. And while thousands of English language repair guides were available on the iFixit website, none were available in Japanese.\n  \u201cWhen I started the translation work I felt as though I was walking through a vast desert all alone. However, over the past six years, thanks to the massive help of so many volunteers and repair lovers from around the world, the translation work has advanced tremendously and the Japanese pages have been greatly enriched,\u201d Midori said.\n Her passion for repair has its roots in the popular Japanese expression, \u201c mottainai!\u201d which means, \u201cwhat a waste!\u201d Midori says this expression is passed on from generation to generation to remind us about the importance of minimizing waste. \u201cWe have been using an old washing machine for more than 10 years\u2026we have done a few simple repairs along the way to keep it working\u2026I think about the money we have saved by repairing our machine with parts that cost a total of $50,\u201d Midori said.\n  Midori once demonstrated how anyone can do repairs on the spot, next to  CEO Kyle Wiens. Just before a talk about iFixit product design and e-waste at a Super Science High School in Tokyo, her MacBook Pro\u2019s hard drive cable stopped working. Wiens suggested they repair the laptop during the presentation. \u201cMy hands got sweaty, as I had never done a computer repair,\u201d Midori said. \u201cFollowing the instructions from the iFixit repair guide, and with Kyle\u2019s guidance, I was able to successfully replace the part\u2014and it took only 15 minutes!\u201d\n That unplanned, live demonstration showed students that anyone can do repairs. Midori\u2019s commitment to growing the Japanese repair community, and shifting the collective mindset from replace to repair, has garnered her 202K in reputation. \u201cTake it from this repair amateur, you do NOT need to be a technological whiz/professional in order to do repairs. And the more you do repair, the better you will get at it,\u201d Midori said.\n Many Ladies of iFixit have been repairing things for a long time, before fully realizing its environmental and intellectual benefits. iFixit\u2019s Community Manager,  Amber Taus, has always been interested in how things work.\n  \u201cWhen I was 4, I took the case off our VCR, and I would sit and watch the tapes play while everyone else watched the movie,\u201d said Taus. The majority of her reputation is actually on our  Meta site, rather than on the  Answers Forum or through  guide making. Meta is a dedicated space for fixers to talk about iFixit. There, Taus has fostered an open environment, where she connects with our volunteer moderators and community members who are seeking answers related to iFixit itself.\n Amber\u2019s unique position in managing both communities has earned her significant reputation since starting at iFixit earlier this year. On Meta she\u2019s earned 3,177 in reputation and provided 164 solutions; on iFixit, she\u2019s earned 2,864 in reputation and provided 35 solutions. Taus takes time out of her day to look around the site and enjoy content that predated her arrival.\n  \u201cMy favorite guide is a  teardown of an orange. It\u2019s so funny and there was so much attention to detail,\u201d Amber said. \u201cThe  final step with the components of the orange laid out is just so  beautiful.\u201d Humor aside, Amber insists that the best guides are the ones that are easy to follow and that make a repairer feel comfortable, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize it wasn\u2019t normal for people to take care of their own stuff until I had to teach my sister-in-law how to change a tire on her car.\u201d\n No matter the reputation count, each one of us is pushing the needle forward for repair, and doing what we can to reduce (and one day eliminate) the harsh effects that poor design and e-waste have on the planet.\n So keep up the good work ladies! There is still plenty of fixing to do!", "posttime": "2022-01-11 03:09:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5973\u58eb\u4eec,ifixit", "title": "ifixit\u7684\u5973\u58eb\u4eec\u8d62\u5f971\u7c73\u7684\u58f0\u8a89", "title_en": "Ladies of iFixit Earn 1M Reputation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ifixit.com/News/56520/ladies-of-ifixit-earn-1-million-in-reputation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5973\u58eb\u4eec", "ifixit"]}]
