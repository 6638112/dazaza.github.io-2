It had to be a throat-clearing, lapel-grabbing, hey-what’s-that-sound number that could open what was shaping up to be one of the most anticipated albums of 1970: the debut of the super group to end all super groups, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. “We don’t have that song where you know that a listener will not take that needle off the record,” Graham Nash told Stephen Stills sometime in the fall of 1969, after they’d already labored for countless hours in a recording studio in San Francisco. “We need that song where we’ve got them from the very beginning.”</p><p>他们需要一首歌，但不仅仅是任何歌。它必须是一个喉咙清除，翻领劫掠，嘿 - 什么可以打开什么是塑造的东西，成为1970年最令人预期的专辑之一：超级小组的首次亮相结束所有超级团体，克罗斯比，剧照，纳什＆amp;年轻。 “我们没有那首歌，你知道听众不会把那个针头从记录中拿走，”格雷厄姆纳什告诉斯蒂芬剧照在1969年秋天的某个时候，在他们已经在录音工作室努力工作了无数个小时后旧金山。 “我们需要那首歌，我们从一开始就得到了他们。”</p><p>  Nash, a skinny, shaggy former member of the British group The Hollies, and Stills, a soulful, straw-haired survivor of Buffalo Springfield, knew plenty about grabbing listeners by the ear. A year earlier, they’d discovered — at Joni Mitchell’s house in California, maybe, or Cass Elliot’s, no one’s quite sure — that they could create heavenly harmonies with David Crosby, the ex-Byrds singer who wore a droopy mustache, and the amused grin of a man who was in on some cosmic joke. They released an album,  Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, that was filled with instant classics like the soaring “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.” Then, at the urging of Ahmet Ertegun, the owlish Atlantic Records honcho, the trio turned themselves into a quartet, adding — with some reluctance — Neil Young’s reedy voice, barbed-wire guitar playing, and unpredictability to the mix. After the four of them played in front of 400,000 swaying, stoned people at Woodstock, their own concerts started to take on the feel of what  Rolling Stone described as “ mini-Woodstocks” that unleashed “effortless good vibes.”</p><p>  纳什，一个瘦，毛茸茸的英国人的前成员，仍然是一个灵芝斯普林菲尔德的一个灵魂，一个深情，稻草发幸存者，耳朵抓住了听众。一年来，他们发现了 - 在加利福尼亚州joni Mitchell的房子里，也许是Carriot的，没有人肯定 - 他们可以用David Crosby，歌手们扮演Dvoopy Mustache的歌手，以及一个人在一些宇宙笑话的男人的逗乐笑容。他们发布了一张专辑，Crosby，剧照和amp;纳什，充满了即时经典，就像飙升的“套房：朱迪蓝眼睛”。然后，在奥海兰大西洋纪录的奥海兰埃特列森的催促，三重奏将自己变成四重奏，加入 - 尼尔年轻的瑞耶的声音，铁丝网吉他演奏，对混合的不可预测。在四个中的四个之后，在400,000次摇曳的前面播放，在伍德斯托克扔石头，他们自己的音乐会开始接受滚石被描述为“迷你樵夫”，释放出“毫不费力的好振动”的感觉。</p><p>    Expectations for their debut album were through the roof. Atlantic reported millions of pre-orders. But the recording process was far from smooth. Crosby was drowning in grief for his girlfriend, Christine Hinton, who’d died in a car crash. Young proved to be only an occasional presence, playing on just half the album’s tracks. Stills worked at a manic pace. Nash was driven to tears, one night, over the widespread dysfunction that threatened to derail the band, which was proving to be highly combustible as a quartet. Oh, and there was too much cocaine.</p><p>    对他们的首饰专辑的期望是通过屋顶。大西洋报告数百万预订。但录音过程远非光滑。克罗斯比在克里斯汀·滨州克斯汀·林顿队溺爱，他在车祸中丧生。年轻人被证明只是偶尔的存在，只有一半的专辑的曲目。剧照以躁狂节奏为工作。一天晚上，纳什被泪流满面，威胁到威胁要脱轨的功能障碍，这被证明是作为四重奏的高燃烧。哦，可卡因太多了。</p><p>    Kickstart your weekend reading by getting the week’s best Longreads delivered to your inbox every Friday afternoon.</p><p>    每周五天点下午送到您的收件箱，通过送到您的收件箱的最佳Longreads，通过播放周末阅读。</p><p>      Then Stills came up with something. He played a jangly, chugging riff for Nash. “He sang me ‘Carry On,’” Nash told me one March afternoon. We spoke over the phone, while Nash sheltered inside his New York City apartment, trying to avoid what was the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. “And I said, ‘That’s it! We’ve got it. If we cook that the way you just sang it to me, we’ve got that opening track where we know that nobody will take the needle off the record after that.”</p><p>      然后仍然想出了一些东西。他打了一个jangly，纳什的喧嚣riff。 “他唱着我继续，'”纳什下午告诉我。我们通过电话交谈，而纳什在他的纽约市公寓里面遮住了，试图避免冠状病毒大流行的第一波。 “我说，'就是这样！我们有了它。如果我们烹饪那样，你只是对我唱歌，我们已经知道开放轨道，我们知道没有人会在此之后取消记录。“</p><p>  Sure enough, “Carry On” was the perfect lead track for  Déjà Vu, the album they released in March 1970. Fueled by a blend of plaintive acoustic songs, paeans to domesticity, and occasionally snarling guitars, it went to No. 1 on the Billboard charts and ultimately sold eight million copies. While this success seemed to announce the arrival of the music industry’s Next Big Thing, other once-harmonious superstar acts were simultaneously cracking under the weight of infighting and simmering resentments, and releasing their final albums together: Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel’s  Bridge Over Troubled Water, and the Beatles’  Let It Be. Could Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young be to the ‘70s what the Beatles had been to the ‘60s — a musical guidepost for millions of people? For most bands, that would have been an impossible proposition. But a few months after  Déjà Vu hit record store shelves, CSNY channeled the horror of the Kent State massacre into a generational anthem, the defiant and urgent single “Ohio,” proving they were more than capable of creating a meaningful dialogue with listeners about the turmoil of their era.</p><p>  果然，“继续”是DéjàVu的完美主动轨道，他们于1970年3月发布的专辑。由哀叹的声学歌曲的混合来推动，因为偶尔咆哮吉他，它就去了第1号广告牌图表最终销售了800万份。虽然这一成功似乎宣布了音乐行业的下一件大事的到来，但其他曾经和谐的超级巨星行为同时在内脏和煨怨恨的重量下开裂，并在一起释放他们的最终专辑：Paul Simon和Art Garfunkel在陷入困境的水中的桥梁，披头士乐队'让它成为。 Crosby，剧照，纳什＆amp;年轻人是'70年代甲壳虫乐队去过60年代 - 一个数百万人的音乐指南吗？对于大多数乐队，这将是一个不可能的主张。但是，张志史梦纪录店搁置几个月后，CSNY将肯特州大屠杀的恐怖引入了一个世代的国歌，挑衅和紧急的单一“俄亥俄州”，证明他们不仅仅是与听众创造有意义的对话他们的时代动荡。</p><p>  But the band didn’t use this promising start as a stepping stone to a second studio album together; instead, each member started working on solo records. “I had to break away,” Young would later write in his memoir,  Waging Heavy Peace. “…The band didn’t break up; it just stopped. It did not regenerate itself. It stopped functioning, like it had a lapse or a heart attack or something. No new songs came forward from anyone.”</p><p>  但乐队没有使用这一有希望的开始作为一个第二张工作室专辑的踏脚石;相反，每个成员都开始研究独奏记录。 “我不得不脱离，”年轻人稍后会在他的回忆录中写下，发动重和平。 “......乐队没有分手;它刚刚停止了。它没有再生。它停止了运作，就像它失效或心脏病发作或某种东西。没有任何新的歌曲出现在任何人身上。“ </p><p>    Three years later, in the spring of 1973, the musicians embarked on the first of what would be multiple attempted reunions, gathering in paradise: the Mala Wharf in Maui, where Young had rented a house. Everyone brought new songs. An easy camaraderie took hold, and with it, a chance to recapture what they had lost so quickly — the ability to create music that was strong enough to overcome the tensions that so easily divided them. They tentatively named their new project  Human Highway.</p><p>三年后，在1973年春天，音乐家开始了第一次尝试团聚，在天堂聚会：毛伊岛的马拉码头，年轻人租了一所房子。每个人都带来了新歌。一个简单的Camaraderie抓住了，并且有机会重新夺回他们失去的东西，这么快 - 创造音乐的能力，足以克服这么容易划分它们的紧张局势。他们暂时命名为新的项目人类高速公路。</p><p>  “We all went there and hung out for a week or so, learning the songs and trying to figure out the album,” Nash said. They even posed for a photo that was meant to grace the album cover. It showed four brothers, tanned and bearded, arranged together in front of a blue sky, looking less glum than they did on  Déjà Vu. “And then something happened. I’m not even sure what happened now, it was so long ago,” Nash said. “But those plans were shelved, and we went on with the rest of our lives.”</p><p>  “我们都去了那里，挂出了一周左右，学习歌曲并试图弄清楚专辑，”纳什说。他们甚至为镜头覆盖而造成的照片。它展示了四个兄弟，晒黑和胡子，在蓝天面前安排在一起，看起来比他们在Déjàvu上的困难。 “然后发生了一些事情。纳什说，我现在没有肯定现在发生了什么发生的事情，这很久以前。 “但那些计划是搁置的，我们继续居住的余生。”</p><p>  In the months and years that followed, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young would take several ill-fated stabs at recording  Human Highway. Fans would speculate about the lost project for years, piecing together theoretical track lists from songs that were released sporadically. The story of the album was, in a way, the story of the band — prolific but wholly different talents, drawn to each other’s music, repelled by egos and infighting and drugs, locked in a cycle that would leave them splintered and bitter even now, five decades later, as they approach the sunset of their lives. But in a surprising twist, the member most opposed to reuniting — Neil Young —  recently gave the public an intriguing glimpse of what  Human Highway could have been, and rekindled his ex-bandmates’ interest in seeing the project find some sort of late-stage redemption.</p><p>  在随后，克罗斯比，剧照，纳什＆amp;年轻人将在录制人类高速公路时采取几个不合适的刺伤。粉丝将推测丢失的项目多年，从偶尔释放的歌曲中拼凑在一起。专辑的故事是在某种程度上是乐队的故事 - 多产，而且完全不同的人才，互相吸引egos和缺陷和药物，锁定在一个循环中，甚至现在留下了僵化，五十年后，他们接近他们生命的日落。但在一个令人惊讶的扭曲中，最反对尼尔年轻人的会员 - 最近给了公众对人类高速公路的有趣瞥见，并重新推出了他对观众看到项目的兴趣找到了某种临时阶段赎回。</p><p>        The idyllic Maui brainstorming sessions were, unfortunately, a template for how the band would operate for years to come, with so many embers of magic stamped out, in a huff, by one member or another. Nash, in his memoir  Wild Tales, recalled that “some business, some cocaine thing, went down, and suddenly we weren’t talking to each other.” But within a few months, the band was back on good terms, and gathered at Young’s sprawling Broken Arrow Ranch in Redwood City, California, to tackle their new material.</p><p>        遗憾的是，田园诗般的头脑风暴会议是乐队多年来如何运作的模板，在一个成员或另一个成员中，有这么多魔术造成的魔术戒烟。在他的回忆录狂野的故事中，回忆说“有些商业，一些可卡因的东西，突然，我们不互相交谈。”但在几个月之内，乐队回归良好的术语，并聚集在加利福尼亚红木市的年轻人庞大的箭头牧场，以解决他们的新材料。</p><p>  “Human Highway” was the work of Young, in full rustic-troubadour mode, and sounded like another potential CSNY classic when they debuted it during an impromptu live performance later in 1973. Stills had “See the Changes,” an airy song about maturity that was well suited for the band’s lush harmonies. Nash, meanwhile, offered a handful of songs that were several shades darker than what he’d contributed to  Déjà Vu: “And So It Goes,” “Wind on the Water,” and “Prison Song,” which railed against criminal justice policies that unfairly punished the poor. Crosby had written “Carry Me,” a tribute to his recently deceased mother, and the meditative “Time After Time.” “We had great songs. It was going to be a great album,” Nash told me. “We had a great title.  Human Highway? Are you kidding me? That’s fabulous.”</p><p>  “人类高速公路”是年轻的工作，在全乡村 - 麻烦模式下，听起来像另一个潜在的CSNY经典，当时他们在1973年晚些时候在一个即兴的现场表现期间首次亮相。仍然“看到变化”，这是一个关于成熟的通风歌曲这非常适合乐队的郁郁葱葱的和谐。与此同时，纳什提供了少数歌曲，这些歌曲比他对Déjàvu的贡献更暗的歌曲：“所以它”，“水上的风”和“掠夺歌曲”，栏杆违反刑事司法政策不公平地惩罚穷人。克罗斯比书面了“让我，”对他最近已故的母亲和冥想的时间致敬。“ “我们有很棒的歌曲。这将是一个很棒的专辑，“纳什告诉我。 “我们有一个伟大的头衔。人类高速公路？你在跟我开玩笑吗？这很棒。“</p><p>    During the three years that followed  Déjà Vu, each of the four musicians had released solo albums — in Young’s case, two of his most critically lauded,  After the Gold Rush and  Harvest — that proved they could thrive on their own. But there was no denying that a group project still held some allure. Young later wrote with surprising fondness about how he viewed his sometime collaborators: Crosby was the catalyst who pushed everyone further; Nash, the consummate professional who wrote the group’s most recognizable songs; while Stills was Young’s conflicted “brother.”</p><p>    在三年之后，这四个音乐家中的每一个都发布了独奏专辑 - 在年轻的案件中，他最顽固地颂扬的是，在金匆匆和收获之后 - 证明他们可以自己茁壮成长。但否定群体项目仍然持有一些诱惑。年轻人后来写着惊讶的喜爱，了解他如何看待他的某个时候合作者：克罗斯比是进一步推动所有人的催化剂;纳什，完善的专业人士，他们写了这个集团最知名的歌曲;虽然仍然是年轻的冲突“兄弟”。</p><p>  Yet work on the ranch proved slow. “That studio is like a log cabin,” said drummer Johny Barbata, who’d played with the band on  4 Way Street, a live album released in 1971. “We were in there, and it was a really cool environment, but I don’t remember getting much done.” Barbata had seen how easily things could go south between the band’s four stars. He recalls one concert performance being interrupted, mid-show, by a backstage argument between Nash and Stills over the number of songs Stills had played during an acoustic set. “Boy, Graham was on him,” Barbata said, “and Stephen was bending a beer can in his hand.”</p><p>  然而，在牧场上工作被证明很慢。 “那个工作室就像一个小木屋，”鼓手·犹太巴巴塔说，他在1971年发布的一张现场专辑中播放了4路街的乐队。“我们在那里，这是一个非常酷的环境，但我不记得做得很多。“ Barbata已经看过乐队四星之间可能会南方的容易。他回忆起一次演唱会的性能，中间展示，在仍在声学集期间播放的歌曲仍在播放的歌曲数量之间。 “男孩，格雷厄姆在他身上，”巴巴塔说，“斯蒂芬在他手中弯曲了啤酒。” </p><p>  There is a certain amount of romance and mystery associated with the idea of a lost album, a sense that an artist’s career might have turned out differently if they had completed a passion project that eluded their grasp. But in his book  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: The Wild, Definitive Saga of Rock’s Greatest Supergroup, author David Browne described the rehearsals at Young’s ranch as dysfunctional and uninspired, with Stills sleeping all day while his bandmates were preoccupied by televised footage of the Watergate hearings that would presage the resignation of President Richard Nixon, the villain of “Ohio.”</p><p>有一定数量的浪漫和谜团与丢失的专辑的想法相关，这是一个感觉，如果他们已经完成了一个拼接他们掌握的激情项目，艺术家的职业生涯可能已经不同。但在他的书克罗斯比，剧烈，纳什和年轻人：岩石最伟大的超级群体的野外，作者大卫布朗将年轻的牧场的排练描述为功能失调和uninspired，仍然睡觉，而他的携带者仍然被电视镜头专注于电视镜头水头听证会展示“俄亥俄州”的恶棍主席·尼克松总统辞职。</p><p>  “I showed up to play . . . and one day we stopped playing. I just don’t know,” Stills explained to journalist Cameron Crowe in 1974. “I don’t want to talk about how incredibly famous we are or how we could set the world on fire if we got back together. I want to play. I want to sing. I want to make good records. And if that doesn’t happen, I’m gone.” The musicians had managed to overcome multiple stumbling blocks during the recording sessions for  Déjà Vu, and emerged on the other side with a cultural touchstone and enduring songs: “Teach Your Children,” “Helpless,” “Our House.” That success now seemed like a rare moment of creative symbiosis they couldn’t repeat, even with material that was worth the effort. “But this band has never played by the rules of any band that I know of,” Nash told me. “It’s always been a little strange. It’s always been a little weird.”</p><p>  “我觉得很开玩笑。 。 。有一天我们停止玩。我只是不知道，“仍然是1974年给记者卡梅伦·克鲁的剧照。”我不想谈论我们有多令人难以置信的是，如果我们一起回来，我们如何将世界着火。我要玩。我想唱歌。我想做好记录。如果这没有发生，我已经走了。“音乐家在录音期间克服了多个绊脚石，在录音会的历史记录中为DéjàVu，并在另一边出现在文化标志和持久的歌曲中：“教你的孩子，”“无助”，“我们的房子。”这种成功现在似乎是一个罕见的创意共生时刻，即使是值得努力的材料，也不能重复。 “但是这条乐队从未由我所知道的任何乐队的规则播放，”纳什告诉我。 “这总是有点奇怪。这总是有点奇怪。“</p><p>  Highway had derailed. “It’s the  Smile of the seventies,” Browne said, invoking Brian Wilson’s mythical 1960s masterpiece, which sat unfinished for decades. “They were at a point in their career where their singing was still strong. There was a lot of indulgence going on, but their singing was still strong. They hadn’t blown their voices out in ‘73 or ‘74. They were still at the top of their game. It would’ve been a more mature, wiser, beaten up  Déjà Vu. And so yeah, you’re kind of reminded all over again, what a missed opportunity.”</p><p>  高速公路出轨了。 “这是七十年代的笑容，”布朗说，援引布莱恩威尔逊的神话20世纪60年代的杰作，坐在未完成的几十年。 “他们在他们的唱歌仍然坚强的职业生涯中。还有很多放纵继续，但他们的歌声仍然很强大。他们没有在'73或'74中吹灭他们的声音。他们仍然在他们的比赛之上。这将是一个更成熟，更聪明，令人振奋的déjàvu。所以是的，你有点提醒一遍，多么错过的机会。“</p><p>  But they didn’t stay away from each other for long. In 1974, they were lured back together by a massive stadium tour that promised to generate record-setting sums of money for them, creating a template for rock star excess — fancy hotel rooms, lavish amounts of food and drugs, too many groupies to count — along the way. The band rehearsed on Young’s ranch, where they recorded several demos, including a Young song, “Through My Sails,” that he would release in 1975 on  Zuma, an album he recorded with the band Crazy Horse. Only two minutes and forty seconds long, the song is light and breezy — just an acoustic guitar and a soft beat, with Crosby, Stills, and Nash’s sweet harmonies effortlessly lifting Young’s verses into the sublime, a reminder of how good they could sound once they cut through the bullshit.</p><p>  但他们长时间没有远离彼此。 1974年，他们被一个大规模的体育场巡回赛诱导了，承诺为他们创造唱片纪录的金钱和，为摇滚明星过度的岩石过度豪华的模板，奢侈的食物和毒品，太多的群体计数- 一路上。乐队在年轻的牧场中排练，他们记录了几个演示，包括一首年轻歌曲，“通过我的风帆”，他将在1975年在祖马发布，他用乐队疯狂录制的一张专辑。只有两分钟，歌曲是轻盈的，只是一个声学吉他和一个柔软的节拍，用克罗斯比，剧照和纳什的甜蜜的谐波毫不费力地将年轻的经文升级到崇高中，提醒他们听起来有多好他们剪了胡说八道。</p><p>    “We are such different people and we write so differently that it gives us what I like to call a much wider palette out of which to paint the album, much more than most people have,” Crosby wrote, years later, in his autobiography  Long Time Gone. (He declined to be interviewed for this story; Stills couldn’t be reached.) Barbata observed a degree of competition, too. “Stephen and Neil were great writing partners, like  Lennon and McCartney, kind of trying to write better songs than the other guy,” he told me. “Crosby and Nash were like buddies together.”</p><p>    “我们是如此不同的人，我们写得如此不同，以至于它给了我们我喜欢叫出一个更广泛的调色板，以便画画专辑，比大多数人都多得多，”克罗斯比写在他的自传中时间消失了。 （他拒绝接受这个故事;仍然无法达到。）Barbata也观察到了一定程度的竞争。 “斯蒂芬和尼尔是伟大的写作合作伙伴，就像列侬和麦卡特尼一样，有点试图写得好的歌曲比另一个人，”他告诉我。 “克罗斯比和纳什在一起就像伙伴一样。”</p><p>  The ’74 tour afforded them a chance to air out some potential  Human Highway material— Crosby’s “Time After Time” and “Carry Me,” Young’s rumbling rocker “Pushed It Over The End,” Stills’ Santana-esque “My Angel”— and after the tour ended, the band gathered at Nash’s house, in San Francisco, to try to resurrect the album in his basement studio. Instead, they bickered like petulant school kids. Stills and Nash argued about a vocal part, and then Stills used a razor to slice up one of Nash’s demo tapes. Nash responded by kicking Stills out of his house. “The pressure for that group [CSNY] to happen again is a destructive force on us all,” Stills would complain years later.</p><p>  '74巡回赛是否有机会在一些潜在的人类公路材料 - 克罗斯比的“经过时间之后”和“携带我”，年轻的隆隆声“将它推到最后，”仍然是“我的天使”仍然是“我的天使”巡回赛后结束后，乐队在旧金山纳什的房子聚集在旧金山，试图在他的地下室工作室中复活专辑。相反，他们像浮雕学校的孩子一样争吵。仍然和纳什争论了一个声音部分，然后仍然使用剃刀来切片纳什的演示磁带。纳什回应了他家的速度。 “那个群体的压力[CSNY]再次发生是我们所有人的破坏力，”剧照将抱怨年后。</p><p>  Over-the-top feuds are a staple of the rock band archetype, but most successful groups find a way to tolerate each other long enough to get down to business. “With these guys,” Browne said, “things would just blow up and end.” The quartet attempted to continue on at the Record Plant, where they worked on a Crosby song, “Homeward Through the Haze,” which built to a chorus about “the blind leading the blind.” This effort soon ended with Young abandoning the sessions, without offering his bandmates an explanation. Crosby later summed things up with deadpan understatement: “We always had a fair amount of conflict between us.” But they weren’t done with each other yet.</p><p>  顶部的斗争是摇滚乐队原型的主食，但大多数成功的团体都找到了一种能够彼此容忍的方法，足以进入业务。 “与这些家伙一起，”布朗说，“事情会爆炸和结束。”四重奏试图继续在纪录厂继续，他们在歌唱歌曲上工作，“回家通过阴霾”，它建立在一个关于“盲目的盲人”的合唱中。这项努力很快结束了年轻人放弃会议，而不提供他的带人员解释。克罗斯比后来与Deadpan轻描处举起了困境：“我们始终在我们之间进行了相当数量的冲突。”但他们还没有互相完成。 </p><p>    We’re running in rhyme  In a slow easy climb  Up the road that’ll we run together</p><p>我们在慢速爬上押韵的押韵爬上我们一起跑的道路</p><p>    Crosby and Nash discovered they could have a smoother time performing as a duo, playing theaters instead of stadiums, and recorded a pair of melodic albums in the mid-70s —  Wind on the Water and  Whistling Down the Wire — that became a home for some of the songs they’d meant for  Human Highway. CSNY was firmly in their rearview mirror.</p><p>    克罗斯比和纳什发现他们可能会有一个更平滑的时间表演作为二重奏，玩剧院而不是体育场，并在70年代中期录制了一对旋律专辑 - 在水上风，吹口哨 - 这成为一些家庭他们对人类高速公路意味着的歌曲。 CSNY牢牢牢牢在他们的后视镜中。</p><p>  Then Stills called drummer Joe Vitale in 1976, inviting him to Criteria Studios in Florida. “He said, “Hey, I have two surprises. We’re gonna start a Crosby, Stills, and Nash record,’” Vitale told me. “And I said, ‘That’s really amazing. What’s the second surprise?’ And he said, ‘Neil’s coming.’ And I said, ‘Oh my God.’”</p><p>  然后在1976年仍称过鼓手Joe Vitale，邀请他到佛罗里达州的标准工作室。 “他说，”嘿，我有两个惊喜。我们会开始克罗斯比，剧照和纳什纪录，“Vitale告诉我。 “我说，'这真的很棒。第二个惊喜是什么？“他说，'尼尔来了。'我说，'哦，我的上帝。”</p><p>  Stills and Young had planned only to record an album’s worth of songs together. But when the bulk of the project was in the can, Young paid a visit to an old friend on the West Coast. Nash remembers being contacted by Young, “and he said that he was working in Miami with Stephen, and wouldn’t David and I be interested in going down and singing on some of the songs? And he sent us some of the songs, and they were great songs — ‘Midnight on the Bay,’ and stuff like that. And so we went and spent about two weeks putting vocals onto all of the tracks.”</p><p>  剧照和年轻人只计划在一起记录专辑的歌曲。但是，当该项目的大部分是罐头时，年轻人在西海岸的一位老朋友进行了访问。纳什记得是由年轻人联系的，“他说他在迈阿密与斯蒂芬一起工作，不会大卫，我有兴趣走下去，唱着一些歌曲吗？他派了我们一些歌曲，他们是歌曲 - '海湾午夜'，和那样的东西。所以我们去了大约两周的时间把人声放到所有的赛道上。“</p><p>    We count on member support to bring you thought-provoking essays.

Vitale wistfully recalled a memory from those sessions: watching Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young sit with their guitars in a circle, separated by just a few feet, as they recorded live, the years and any past grudges melting away. “It was the blend of their voices,” he said. “It was just unbelievable how good they were.”</p><p>      克罗斯比和纳什在另一首歌中加入了他们的丰富的和谐 - “海洋女孩”，“海湾午夜”，“渴望愿你跑，”甚至“人道公路” - 而且记录明确成为CSNY团聚。 Viteale渴望从这些会议上回忆起记忆：看克罗斯比，剧照，纳什和年轻人坐在圆圈中，只用几英尺分开，因为他们记录了生活，多年和任何过去掠过掠过。 “这是他们声音的混合，”他说。 “这只是令人难以置信的是他们有多好。”</p><p>  Outside the walls of Criteria Studios, Americans’ taste in music was undergoing a shift. Disco songs like “Boogie Fever” and “Love Machine” were starting to occupy a noticeable amount of pop chart real estate. But there was still an appetite for CSNY and other artists who mined similar veins of pop and folk-rock — Linda Ronstadt , James Taylor, the Eagles, and a legion of imitators.</p><p>  在标准工作室之外，美国人的音乐味道正在发生转变。迪斯科歌曲像“Boogie发烧”和“爱情机器”开始占据一个明显的流行图房地产。但仍然有一个令人兴趣的CSNY和其他艺术家，他们挖掘了流行和民间摇滚的类似血管 -  Linda Ronstadt，James Taylor，Eagles和Amitator的军团。 </p><p>  The promise of more success, and a batch of strong songs, should have been enough to persuade the band to get the project to the finish line. “It’s usually the songs that bring us together. Because if Stephen has four and Neil has four and David has four and I have four songs, we’ve all got a project to work on, and we’ll get it done,” Nash said. “So it usually comes down to, the songs drive our relationship in many ways.”</p><p>承诺更多成功，以及一批强大的歌曲，应该足以说服乐队将项目置于终点线。 “通常是把我们带到一起的歌曲。因为如果斯蒂芬有四个，尼尔有四个和大卫有四个，我有四首歌，我们都有一个项目来工作，我们会完成它，“纳什说。 “所以它通常会归结为，歌曲以多种方式推动我们的关系。”</p><p>  Yet the cooperative atmosphere once again soured. As Nash tells it, he and Crosby were due back in Los Angeles, to finish  Whistling Down the Wire. When they explained that they had to leave, the reunion came to a screeching halt. Stills and Young were committed to a looming tour, and needed the album of songs they were recording in Florida to be ready; they couldn’t wait for the other two to return. The news apparently rankled Young. The musicians had been staying in Miami, at the appropriately-named Mutiny Hotel. Nash, who described the hotel as “seventeen floors of cocaine dealers,” learned from an employee that Young had checked out abruptly and headed back to California.</p><p>  然而，合作氛围再次毒品。随着纳什告诉它，他和克罗斯比在洛杉矶来了，完成了吹口哨。当他们解释说他们不得不离开时，重逢暂停了尖叫。剧照和年轻人致力于迫在眉睫的旅游，并需要他们在佛罗里达州录制的歌曲专辑才能准备好;他们不能等待另外两个返回。这个消息显然是一个年轻的年轻人。音乐家在适当的名录叛变酒店留在迈阿密。纳什将酒店描述为“可卡因经销商十七层”，从员工那里学到，年轻人突然检查并回到加利福尼亚州。</p><p>  In what could only be read as a spiteful move, Young stripped Nash’s and Crosby’s vocals off the songs they’d recorded, and released the tracks on an album called  The Stills-Young Band. “I never should have erased that,” Young would later tell an interviewer. “But I thought I was doing the right thing at the right time.”</p><p>  在什么只能被读为恶意的举动，年轻的剥离的纳什和克罗斯比的声音在他们录制的歌曲中，并发布了一个名为剧情幼小乐队的专辑的曲目。 “我从来不应该抹去，”年轻人稍后会告诉面试官。 “但我以为我在合适的时间做了正确的事情。”</p><p>      Nash still puzzles over it. “And to this day, I still have no idea whether they actually wiped me and David’s tracks, or whether they were smart enough to make a 16-track copy of that and then do overdubs to the copy,” he said. “So I still don’t know where any of those vocal tracks went to. I do have rough mixes that were made on the last couple of days that we were there, and they sound fabulous to me.” When we spoke in the spring, Nash had no way of knowing that the mystery surrounding those missing vocals would be resolved months later — 44 years after things had ended so badly in Florida.</p><p>      纳什仍然困惑它。 “到这一天，我仍然不知道他们是否实际擦拭我和大卫的曲目，或者他们是否聪明，以便制作一个16轨副本，然后对副本进行超越，”他说。 “所以我仍然不知道任何那些声道都去过哪里。我确实有粗略的混合物，这是我们在那里的最后几天所做的，他们对我来说很棒。“当我们在春天说话时，纳什没有知道那些失踪的人声的神秘，几个月后会得到解决 - 在佛罗里达州的事情如此严重结束后44年。</p><p>      The quartet made no other attempt to complete the studio album they first started toying with in 1973. “We tried to put it together with Neil, but it wasn’t happening. Let’s be diplomatic and say that it was a conflict between me and Stephen or me and Nash and Stephen,” Crosby would later explain. “For whatever reason, it didn’t work. The rapport between us did not transcend our personal problems. … We have traditionally gotten too drunk or too loaded or too high or too screwed up to keep our shit together.”</p><p>      四重体没有其他尝试完成他们首先在1973年开始玩耍的工作室专辑。“我们试图将它与尼尔一起放在一起，但它没有发生。让我们成为外交，并说我和斯蒂芬或我和纳什和斯蒂芬之间存在冲突，“克罗斯比稍后会解释一下。 “无论出于何种原因，它都没有用。美国之间的融洽关系并没有超越我们的个人问题。 ......我们传统上已经喝醉了或太高或太高或太高了，以保持我们的狗屎。“</p><p>  But CSNY’s on-again, off-again relationship soon became the least of Crosby’s problems. While getting high had been as much a staple of his life during the ‘60s and ‘70s as writing and singing songs, the 1980s found him consumed by even more dangerous addictions: he freebased cocaine, then began using heroin. To Nash and Stills, Crosby became a friend they couldn’t reach, and a partner upon whom they couldn’t rely. “I would take my life’s steering wheel and turn it to the right and my life would veer sharply to the left,” Crosby would later recall. He was arrested on multiple occasions, and ultimately did time in a Texas state prison. Young made a public promise that was intended to lure his old bandmate out of the darkness: If Crosby could get clean, Young would commit to a CSNY reunion.</p><p>  但CSNY再次，再次又是克罗斯比的问题。在20世纪80年代，在60年代和70年代的70年代来看，他的生命中的一系列充满了一系列，而20世纪80年代发现他消耗了更加危险的成瘾：他自由禁止可卡因，然后开始使用海洛因。纳什和剧照，克罗斯比成为他们无法触及的朋友，他们无法依赖的伙伴。 “我会拿走我的生命的方向盘，把它转向右边，我的生命将急剧转向左侧，”克罗斯比稍后会回忆起来。他在多次被捕，最终在德克萨斯州监狱做了时间。年轻人旨在引起黑暗中的旧的带兄弟：如果Crosby可以变得干净，那么年轻人会承诺一个CSNY团聚。</p><p>  To Young’s credit, he made good on his vow. In 1986, CSNY played together at a charity concert, and then began working on a studio album,  American Dream, which was released in 1988 . It sold well, but found the band trapped in glossy ‘80s production, with little of the yearning or magic that flowed so freely from  Déjà Vu. Eleven years later, CSNY recorded another surprise reunion album,  Looking Forward. On songs like Young’s tender “Slowpoke,” Crosby, Stills, and Nash added harmonies that came close to approximating the sweet sound of their youth. But they were not the same band anymore, not really. “They</p><p>  对年轻的信誉，他发誓善于发誓。 1986年，CSNY在慈善音乐会上一起播放，然后开始在1988年发布的一家工作室专辑，美国梦。它销售良好，但发现乐队陷入了光泽的80年代生产，少数人从DéjàVu自由流动。十一年后，CSNY记录了另一个惊喜的团聚专辑，期待着。关于杨等歌曲等歌曲“慢速，”克罗斯比，剧照和纳什加入了近距离的和谐，以逼近他们年轻人的甜美声音。但他们不再是同一个乐队，而不是真的。 “他们 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://longreads.com/2021/03/30/crosby-stills-nash-youngs-lost-album-human-highway/">https://longreads.com/2021/03/30/crosby-stills-nash-youngs-lost-album-human-highway/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/专辑/">#专辑</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/stills/">#stills</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/歌曲/">#歌曲</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
