I could also use &#34;modern&#34; board games like Puerto Rico, Dominion, Terra Mystica,  ASL etc., but the set of people who played in rated games is very low, which makes the argument less convincing (perhaps people who play in rated games are much worse than people who don&#39;t -- unlikely, but difficult to justify without comparing gameplay between rated and unrated games, which is pretty deep into weeds for this post).</p><p>我99%的游戏背景来自90年代的电子游戏，但我&#39；我不打算以这些为例，因为熟悉这些游戏的读者相对较少。我也可以用&#34；现代&#34；波多黎各、多米尼克、神秘地、ASL等棋盘游戏，但参与分级游戏的人数非常少，这使得这个论点不那么有说服力（也许玩分级游戏的人比不玩&#39；t的人差得多——不太可能，但如果不比较分级游戏和未分级游戏的游戏性，就很难证明这一点，这在本文中相当深入）。</p><p>  There are numerous activities that would be better to use than Overwatch, but I&#39;m not familiar enough with them to use them as examples. For example, on reading a draft of this post, Kevin Burke noted that he&#39;s observed the same thing while coaching youth basketball and multiple readers noted that they&#39;ve observed the same thing in chess, but I&#39;m not familiar enough with youth basketball or chess to confidently say much about either activity even they&#39;d be better examples because it&#39;s likely that more readers are familiar with basketball or chess than with Overwatch.</p><p>有很多活动比监视更好，但我&#39；我对它们不够熟悉，不能用它们作为例子。例如，在阅读这篇文章的草稿时，凯文·伯克指出他&#39；s在指导青少年篮球时也观察到了同样的情况，许多读者注意到他们&#39；我在国际象棋中也观察到了同样的情况，但我&#39；我对青少年篮球或国际象棋还不太熟悉，所以我不敢自信地谈论这两项运动，即使它们是#39；我会是更好的例子，因为它&#39；It’熟悉篮球或国际象棋的读者可能比熟悉《守望》的读者多。</p><p>   [return]</p><p>[返回]</p><p>  When I first started playing Overwatch (which is when I did that experiment), I ended up getting rated slightly above 50%-ile (for Overwatch players, that was in Plat -- this post is going to use percentiles and not ranks to avoid making non-Overwatch players have to learn what the ranks mean). It&#39;s generally believed and probably true that people who play the main ranked game mode in Overwatch are, on average, better than people who only play unranked modes, so it&#39;s likely that my actual percentile was somewhat higher than 50%-ile and that all &#34;true&#34; percentiles listed in this post are higher than the nominal percentiles.</p><p>当我第一次开始玩Overwatch（也就是我做那个实验的时候）时，我最终得到了略高于50%的评分（对于Overwatch玩家，这是在Plat中——这篇文章将使用百分位数而不是等级，以避免让非Overwatch玩家必须了解等级的含义）。它&#39；人们普遍认为，而且可能是真的，在《守夜》中玩主要排名游戏模式的人，平均而言，比只玩非排名模式的人要好，所以它&#39；很可能我的实际百分位数略高于50%-百分位数，而这一切&#34；正确&#34；本文中列出的百分位数高于名义百分位数。</p><p>    Supports (healers) will heal someone who&#39;s at full health (which does nothing) while a teammate who&#39;s next to them is dying and then dies</p><p>支持（治疗者）会治愈那些&#39；当队友&#39；他们旁边的人就快死了</p><p>  Players will not notice someone who walks directly behind the team and kills people one at a time until the entire team is killed</p><p>玩家不会注意到有人直接走在队伍后面，一次只杀一个人，直到整个队伍被杀</p><p>  Players will shoot an enemy until only one more shot is required to kill the enemy and then switch to a different target, letting the 1-health enemy heal back to full health before shooting at that enemy again</p><p>玩家将射杀一个敌人，直到只需要再射杀一次敌人，然后切换到另一个目标，让1-health敌人恢复到完全健康，然后再射杀该敌人</p><p>  After dying, players will not wait for their team to respawn and will, instead, run directly into the enemy team to fight them 1v6. This will repeat for the entire game (the game is designed to be 6v6, but in ranks below 95%-ile, it&#39;s rare to see a 6v6 engagement after one person on one team dies)</p><p>死后，玩家不会等待他们的队伍重生，而是直接冲向敌人的队伍与他们战斗。这将在整个游戏中重复（游戏设计为6v6，但在等级低于95%的情况下，在一个团队中有一人死亡后，很少看到6v6订婚）</p><p>  Players will clearly have no idea what character abilities do, including for the character they&#39;re playing</p><p>玩家显然不知道角色能力是什么，包括他们所扮演的角色&#39；我们在玩</p><p>  Players go for very high risk but low reward plays (for Overwatch players, a classic example of this is Rein going for a meme pin when the game opens on 2CP defense, very common at 50%-ile, rare at 95%-ile since players who think this move is a good idea tend to have generally poor decision making).</p><p>玩家会选择高风险但低回报的游戏（对于守夜玩家来说，一个典型的例子是当游戏以2CP防守开始时，勒因会选择一个模因密码，这在50%-ile时非常常见，在95%-ile时非常罕见，因为认为这是一个好主意的玩家通常会做出糟糕的决策）。</p><p>  People will have terrible aim and will miss four or five shots in a row when all they need to do is hit someone once to kill them</p><p>人们会有很糟糕的目标，当他们需要做的只是击中某人一次来杀死他们时，他们会连续错过四五枪</p><p>  If a single flanking enemy threatens a healer who can&#39;t escape plus a non-healer with an escape ability, the non-healer will probably use their ability to run away, leaving the healer to die, even though they could easily kill the flanker and save their healer if they just attacked while being healed.</p><p>如果一个侧面的敌人威胁到一个可以&#39；t逃跑加上一个具有逃跑能力的非治疗者，非治疗者可能会使用他们的能力逃跑，让治疗者死亡，即使他们在治疗过程中只是攻击，也可以轻易杀死侧翼并拯救治疗者。</p><p>  Having just one aspect of your gameplay be merely bad instead of atrocious is enough to get to 50%-ile. For me, that was my teamwork, for others, it&#39;s other parts of their gameplay. The reason I&#39;d say that my teamwork was bad and not good or even mediocre was that I basically didn&#39;t know how to play the game, didn&#39;t know what any of the characters’ strengths, weaknesses, and abilities are, so I couldn&#39;t possibly coordinate effectively with my team. I also didn&#39;t know how the game modes actually worked (e.g., under what circumstances the game will end in a tie vs. going into another round), so I was basically wandering around randomly with a preference towards staying near the largest group of teammates I could find. That&#39;s above average.</p><p>游戏中只有一个方面是糟糕的，而不是残酷的，这就足够让你达到50%了。对我来说，这是我的团队合作，对其他人来说，这是&#39；这是他们游戏的其他部分。我&#39；我说我的团队合作不好，不好，甚至平庸，是因为我基本上没有&#39；我不知道怎么玩这个游戏，不是吗；我不知道角色的优点、缺点和能力是什么，所以我不能&#39；我不可能与我的团队有效协调。我也没有&#39；我不知道游戏模式实际上是如何运作的（例如，在什么情况下，比赛将以平局结束，而不是进入下一轮），所以我基本上是随机游荡，倾向于待在我能找到的最大的队友群体附近。那&#39；这高于平均水平。</p><p>  You could say that someone is pretty good at the game since they&#39;re above average. But in a non-relative sense, being slightly above average is quite bad -- it&#39;s hard to argue that someone who doesn&#39;t notice their entire team being killed from behind while two teammates are yelling &#34;[enemy] behind us!&#34; over voice comms isn&#39;t bad.</p><p>你可以说有人非常擅长这个游戏，因为他们&#39；你高于平均水平。但在非相对意义上，略高于平均水平是相当糟糕的——它&#39；很难说一个不&#39；我没有注意到他们的整个团队都在后面被杀，而两个队友在大喊#34；[敌人]在我们后面&#34; 通过语音通信不是&#39；不错。</p><p>  After playing a bit more, I ended up with what looks like a &#34;true&#34; rank of about 90%-ile when I&#39;m using a character I know how to use. Due to volatility in ranking as well as matchmaking, I played in games as high as 98%-ile. My aim and dodging were still atrocious. Relative to my rank, my aim was actually worse than when I was playing in 50%-ile games since my opponents were much better and I was only a little bit better. In 90%-ile, two copies of myself would probably lose fighting against most people 2v1 in the open. I would also usually lose a fight if the opponent was in the open and I was behind cover such that only 10% of my character was exposed, so my aim was arguably more than 10x worse than median at my rank.</p><p>在玩了多一点之后，我最终得到了一个看起来像&#34；正确&#34；当我&#39岁时，排名在90%左右；我正在使用一个我知道如何使用的角色。由于排名和配对的波动性，我玩的游戏高达98%。我的瞄准和躲闪仍然很残忍。相对于我的排名，我的目标实际上比我打50%的比赛时更糟糕，因为我的对手比我强得多，而我只是稍微好一点。在90%的情况下，我的两个复制品可能会在公开场合输给大多数人。如果对手是公开的，而我处于掩护之下，只有10%的角色暴露在外，那么我通常也会输掉一场比赛，因此我的目标可以说比我级别的中位数差10倍以上。</p><p>  My &#34;trick&#34; for getting to 90%-ile despite being a 1/10th aimer was learning how the game worked and playing in a way that maximized the probability of winning (to the best of my ability), as opposed to playing the game like it&#39;s an  FFA game where your goal is to get kills as quickly as possible. It takes a bit more context to describe what this means in 90%-ile, so I&#39;ll only provide a couple examples, but these are representative of mistakes the vast majority of 90%-ile players are making all of the time (with the exception of a few players who have grossly defective aim, like myself, who make up for their poor aim by playing better than average for the rank in other ways).</p><p>我的&#34；把戏&#34；为了达到90%的目标，尽管我是十分之一的目标玩家，但我正在学习游戏的运作方式，并以最大化获胜概率的方式（尽我所能）进行游戏，而不是像这样玩游戏&#39；这是一款FFA游戏，你的目标是尽快获得杀戮。这需要更多的语境来描述这在90%-ile中意味着什么，所以我&#39；我只举几个例子，但这些都代表了绝大多数90%的球员一直在犯的错误（除了像我这样有严重缺陷的少数球员，他们通过在其他方面比平均水平打得好来弥补他们糟糕的目标）。</p><p>  Within the game, the goal of the game is to win. There are different game modes, but for the mainline ranked game, they all will involve some kind of objective that you have to be on or near. It&#39;s very common to get into a situation where the round timer is ticking down to zero and your team is guaranteed to lose if no one on your team touches the objective but your team may win if someone can touch the objective and not die instantly (which will cause the game to go into overtime until shortly after both teams stop touching the objective). A concrete example of this that happens somewhat regularly is, the enemy team has four players on the objective while your team has two players near the objective, one tank and one support/healer. The other four players on your team died and are coming back from spawn. They&#39;re close enough that if you can touch the objective and not instantly die, they&#39;ll arrive and probably take the objective for the win, but they won&#39;t get there in time if you die immediately after taking the objective, in which case you&#39;ll lose.</p><p>在游戏中，游戏的目标是获胜。有不同的游戏模式，但对于主线排名的游戏，它们都将涉及某种你必须在或接近的目标。它&#39；这是一种很常见的情况，在这种情况下，整轮计时器将滴答作响到零，如果你的团队中没有人触碰目标，你的团队肯定会输，但如果有人触碰目标，而不是立即死亡，你的团队可能会赢（这将导致比赛进入加时赛，直到双方都停止触碰目标后不久）一个具体的例子是，敌人有四名队员在目标上，而你的队伍有两名队员在目标附近，一辆坦克和一名支援/治疗人员。你们队的其他四名队员已经死亡，他们将从“繁殖”中归来。他们&#39；距离足够近，如果你能触摸到目标，而不是立即死亡，他们&#39；我会来的，可能会为胜利设定目标，但他们赢了&#39；如果你在完成目标后立即死亡，你就不能及时赶到那里，在这种情况下，你&#39；我会输的。</p><p>  If you&#39;re playing the support/healer at 90%-ile to 95%-ile, this game will almost always end as follows: the tank will move towards the objective, get shot, decide they don&#39;t want to take damage, and then back off from the objective. As a support, you have a small health pool and will die instantly if you touch the objective because the other team will shoot you. Since your team is guaranteed to lose if you don&#39;t move up to the objective, you&#39;re forced to do so to have any chance of winning. After you&#39;re killed, the tank will either move onto the objective and die or walk towards the objective but not get there before time runs out. Either way, you&#39;ll probably lose.</p><p>如果你&#39；当你在90%-95%-ile的范围内重新扮演支持/治疗者时，这场游戏几乎总是以如下方式结束：坦克将朝目标移动，被射中，决定他们不&#39；我不想承受伤害，然后从目标上后退。作为支持，你有一个小的健康池，如果你触碰目标，就会立即死亡，因为其他团队会向你开枪。因为如果你不&#39；不要朝着目标前进，你&#39；我们被迫这么做是为了有任何获胜的机会。在你之后&#39；如果坦克再次被击毙，它将要么移动到目标上死亡，要么朝目标走去，但在时间耗尽之前无法到达目标。不管怎样，你&#39；我可能会输。</p><p>  If the tank did their job and moved onto the objective before you died, you could heal the tank for long enough that the rest of your team will arrive and you&#39;ll probably win. The enemy team, if they were coordinated, could walk around or through the tank to kill you, but they won&#39;t do that -- anyone who knows that will cause them to win the game and can aim well enough to successfully follow through can&#39;t help but end up in a higher rank). And the hypothetical tank on your team who knows that it&#39;s their job to absorb damage for their support in that situation and not vice versa won&#39;t stay at 95%-ile very long because they&#39;ll win too many games and move up to a higher rank.</p><p>如果坦克完成了他们的任务，在你死前移动到目标上，你可以治愈坦克足够长的时间，你的团队的其他人会到达，你&#39；我可能会赢。敌人的队伍，如果他们配合的话，可以绕过或穿过坦克杀死你，但他们赢了&#39；不要这样做——任何知道这将使他们赢得比赛，并且能够瞄准足够好的目标以成功完成比赛的人都可以&#39；（我不得不在更高的职位上结束工作）。还有你团队中的假想坦克谁知道它&#39；在这种情况下，他们的工作是为自己的支持承担损失，反之亦然；不要在95%的水平上停留太久，因为他们&#39；我会赢太多比赛，升到更高的级别。</p><p>  Another basic situation that the vast majority of 90%-ile to 95%-ile players will get wrong is when you&#39;re on offense, waiting for your team to respawn so you can attack as a group. Even at 90%-ile, maybe 1/4 to 1/3 of players won&#39;t do this and will just run directly at the enemy team, but enough players will realize that 1v6 isn&#39;t a good idea that you&#39;ll often 5v6 or 6v6 fights instead of the constant 1v6 and 2v6 fights you see at 50%-ile. Anyway, while waiting for the team to respawn in order to get a 5v6, it&#39;s very likely one player who realizes that they shouldn&#39;t just run into the middle of the enemy team 1v6 will decide they should try to hit the enemy team with long-ranged attacks 1v6. People will do this instead of hiding in safety behind a wall even when the enemy has multiple snipers with instant-kill long range attacks. People will even do this against multiple snipers when they&#39;re playing a character that isn&#39;t a sniper and needs to hit the enemy 2-3 times to get a kill, making it overwhelmingly likely that they won&#39;t get a kill while taking a significant risk of dying themselves. For Overwatch players, people will also do this when they have full ult charge and the other team doesn&#39;t, turning a situation that should be to your advantage (your team has ults ready and the other team has used ults), into a neutral situation (both teams have ults)  at best, and instantly losing the fight at worst.</p><p>另一个基本情况是，绝大多数90%-ile到95%-ile玩家都会出错，那就是当你&#39；你在进攻，等待你的队伍重生，这样你就可以作为一个整体进攻。即使在90%的水平上，也可能有1/4到1/3的球员获胜&#39；但足够多的玩家会意识到1v6不是&#39；你&#39；我通常会打5v6或6v6，而不是你看到的50%的1v6和2v6。无论如何，在等待车队重生以获得5v6时，它&#39；很可能是一个球员意识到他们不应该&#39；Don’t just run in the the middle of the敌方团队1v6将决定他们应该尝试用远程攻击1v6来打击敌方团队。即使敌人有多个狙击手进行即时杀伤远程攻击，人们也会这样做，而不是躲在墙后的安全地带。当人们&#39；我们扮演的角色不是&#39；他不是狙击手，需要击中敌人2-3次才能杀死敌人，因此他们极有可能获胜&#39；不要冒着死亡的巨大风险而被杀。对于替补队员，当他们全副武装，而另一队没有&#39；t、 将一个本应对你有利的情况（你的团队已经准备好了ults，而另一个团队已经使用了ults）转变为一个中立的情况（两个团队都有ults），并在最坏的情况下立即输掉比赛。</p><p>  If you ever read an Overwatch forum, whether that&#39;s one of the reddit forums or the official Blizzard forums, a common complaint is &#34;why are my teammates so bad? I&#39;m at [90%-ile to 95%-ile rank], but all my teammates are doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time, like [an example above]&#34;. The answer is, of course, that the person asking the question is also doing obviously stupid game-losing things all the time because anyone who doesn&#39;t constantly make makor blunders wins too much to stay at 95%-ile. This also applies to me.</p><p>如果你曾经读过一个Overwatch论坛，是否&#39；它是reddit论坛或暴雪官方论坛之一，常见的投诉是#34；为什么我的队友如此糟糕？我&#39；我的排名是[90%-ile到95%-ile]，但我所有的队友都在做明显愚蠢的比赛，总是输球，比如[上面的例子]&#34；。答案当然是，问这个问题的人也在做明显愚蠢的游戏，总是输掉一些东西，因为任何不&#39；Don’不要总是犯错误，要想保持95%的利润率，就得赢太多。这也适用于我。</p><p>  People will argue that players at this rank  should be good because they&#39;re better than 95% of other players, which makes them relatively good. But non-relatively, it&#39;s hard to argue that someone who doesn&#39;t realize that you should step on the objective to probably win the game instead of not touching the objective for a sure loss is good. One of the most basic things about Overwatch is that it&#39;s an objective-based game, but the majority of players at 90%-ile to 95%-ile don&#39;t play that way.</p><p>人们会说，这个级别的球员应该是优秀的，因为他们&#39；我们比95%的其他球员都要好，这使他们相对来说表现得更好。但非相对而言，它&#39；很难说一个不&#39；I don’我没有意识到你应该站在目标上可能会赢得比赛，而不是不触及目标，因为肯定输球是好事。守夜最基本的一点是它&#39；这是一个基于目标的游戏，但大多数玩家在90%-ile到95%-ile-don&#39；别那样玩。</p><p>  For anyone who isn&#39;t well into the 99%-ile, reviewing recorded games will reveal game-losing mistakes all the time. For myself, usually ranked 90%-ile or so, watching a recorded game will reveal tens of game losing mistakes in a close game (which is maybe 30% of losses, the other 70% are blowouts where there isn&#39;t a single simple mistake that decides the game).</p><p>对于任何不在&#39；在99%的时间里，回顾记录的比赛会发现比赛失败的错误。对于我自己来说，通常排名在90%左右，观看一场记录在案的比赛会发现在一场势均力敌的比赛中有几十个输球错误（这可能是输球的30%，其他70%是爆发，没有一个简单的错误决定比赛）。</p><p>  It&#39;s generally not too hard to fix these since the mistakes are like the example above: simple enough that once you see that you&#39;re making the mistake, the fix is straightforward because the mistake is straightforward.</p><p>它&#39；It’一般来说，纠正这些错误并不太难，因为这些错误就像上面的例子：足够简单，一旦你看到你&#39；如果你犯了错误，解决方法很简单，因为错误很简单。</p><p>   [return]</p><p>[返回]</p><p>  There are probably some people who just want to be angry at their teammates. Due to how infrequently you get matched with the same players, it&#39;s hard to see this in the main rated game mode, but I think you can sometimes see this when Overwatch sometimes runs mini-rated modes.</p><p>可能有些人只是想对他们的队友生气。由于你很少与同一名球员比赛，因此&#39；在主分级游戏模式下很难看到这一点，但我认为当Overwatch有时运行迷你分级模式时，你有时可以看到这一点。</p><p>  Mini-rated modes have a much smaller playerbase than the main rated mode, which has two notable side effects: players with a much wider variety of skill levels will be thrown into the same game and you&#39;ll see the same players over and over again if you play multiple games.</p><p>与主分级模式相比，迷你分级模式的玩家基础要小得多，后者有两个显著的副作用：技能水平差异更大的玩家将被扔进同一个游戏，而你&#39；如果你玩多个游戏，我会一次又一次地看到相同的玩家。</p><p>  Since you ended up matched with the same players repeatedly, you&#39;ll see players make the same mistakes and cause themselves to lose in the same way and then have the same tantrum and blame their teammates in the same way game after game.</p><p>由于你最终与同一名球员反复比赛，你&#39；我会看到球员们犯同样的错误，以同样的方式输掉比赛，然后又以同样的方式发脾气，一场接一场地指责队友。</p><p>  You&#39;ll also see tantrums and teammate blaming in the normal rated game mode, but when you see it, you generally can&#39;t tell if the person who&#39;s having a tantrum is just having a bad day or if it&#39;s some other one-off occurrence since, unless you&#39;re ranked very high or very low (where there&#39;s a smaller pool of closely rated players), you don&#39;t run into the same players all that frequently. But when you see a set of players in 15-20 games over the course of a few weeks and you see them lose the game for the same reason a double digit number of times followed by the exact same tantrum, you might start to suspect that some fraction of those people really want to be angry and that the main thing they&#39;re getting out of playing the game is a source of anger. You might also wonder about this from how some people use social media, but that&#39;s a topic for another post.</p><p>你&#39；在正常的比赛模式下，你也会看到发脾气和队友指责，但当你看到它时，你通常可以&#39；不知道这个人是否&#39；s发脾气只是过了糟糕的一天，或者如果是&#39；除非你&#39；重新排名非常高或非常低（在排名相近的球员人数较少的情况下），你不会&#39；I don’我没那么频繁地碰到同一个选手。但是，当你看到一组球员在几周的时间里打了15-20场比赛，你看到他们因为同样的原因输掉了比赛，两位数的输球次数和完全相同的发脾气时，你可能会开始怀疑这些人中有一小部分人真的想生气，而他们&#39；你退出游戏是愤怒的来源。你可能还想知道一些人是如何使用社交媒体的，但那&#39；这是另一篇文章的主题。</p><p>   [return]</p><p>[返回]</p><p>  For example, there will also be players who have some kind of disability that prevents them from improving, but at the levels we&#39;re talking about, 99%-ile or below, that will be relatively rare (certainly well under 50%, and I think it&#39;s not unreasonable to guess that it&#39;s well under 10% of people who choose to play the game). IIRC, there&#39;s at least one player who&#39;s in the top 500 who&#39;s deaf (this is severely disadvantageous since sound cues give a lot of fine-grained positional information that cannot be obtained in any other way), at least one legally blind player who&#39;s 99%-ile, and multiple players with physical impairments that prevent them from having fine-grained control of a mouse, i.e., who are basically incapable of aiming, who are 99%-ile.</p><p>例如，也会有一些球员有某种残疾，这阻碍了他们的进步，但在我们&#39；我们说的是，99%或更低，这将是相对罕见的（当然远低于50%，而且我认为猜测它远低于10%选择玩游戏的人并不不合理）。IIRC，那里&#39；至少有一名球员&#39；在世界卫生组织500强中&#39；s聋哑人（这是非常不利的，因为声音提示提供了许多以任何其他方式都无法获得的细粒度位置信息），至少有一名法律上失明的玩家&#39；s 99%-ile，以及多个身体有缺陷的玩家，他们无法精细地控制鼠标，也就是说，他们基本上无法瞄准，99%-ile。</p><p>  There are also other kinds of reasons people might not improve. For example, Kevin Burke has noted that when he coaches youth basketball, some children don&#39;t want to do drills that they think make them look foolish (e.g., avoiding learning to dribble with their off hand even during drills where everyone is dribbling poorly because they&#39;re using their off hand). When I spent a lot of time in a climbing gym with a world class coach who would regularly send a bunch of kids to nationals and some to worlds, I&#39;d observe the same thing in his classes -- kids, even ones who are nationally or internationally competitive, would sometimes avoid doing things because they were afraid it would make them look foolish to their peers. The coach&#39;s solution in those cases was to deliberately make the kid look extremely foolish and tell them that it&#39;s better to look stupid now than at nationals.</p><p>人们可能无法改善的原因还有其他方面。例如，凯文·伯克（Kevin Burke）指出，当他执教青少年篮球时，有些孩子不&#39；I don’我不想做他们认为让自己看起来很愚蠢的训练（例如，即使在训练中，每个人都因为使用副手而运球不佳，也要避免学习用副手运球）。当我和一位世界级教练在一个攀岩馆里度过了很多时间，他会定期把一群孩子送到国家队，有些则送到世界队，我&#39；d在他的课堂上观察到同样的事情——孩子们，即使是那些在国内或国际上有竞争力的孩子，有时也会避免做事情，因为他们担心这会让他们在同龄人面前显得愚蠢。教练&#39；在这些情况下，孩子的解决办法是故意让孩子看起来非常愚蠢，并告诉他们这是#39；It’与其看着国民，不如现在就装傻。</p><p>   [return]</p><p>[返回]</p><p>  note that, here, a skilled coach is someone who is skilled at coaching, not necessarily someone who is skilled at the activity.
