K-punk accrued a devoted following, becoming a hub of various music and philosophy blog networks. Yet his literary energies were chiefly expended on the short-form: he only published three books in his lifetime. Two of these –  Ghosts of My Life and  The Weird and the Eerie (2016) – remix material that originally appeared on k-punk. A huge, though not exhaustive, anthology of Fisher’s blog writings and other occasional essays –  K-Punk (2018) – appeared posthumously. He was at work on a fourth book, “Acid Communism”, when he died; an unfinished introduction appears in the anthology.  Postcapitalist Desire is perhaps most fruitfully read as an accompaniment to this. The questions with which Fisher began his last lectures – about what we are capable of wanting and envisioning – are questions of consciousness. Their roots can be traced to the concept for which Fisher is most famous: “capitalist realism”, the title of his first, bestselling pamphlet, published in 2009. The original definition – “the widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to  imagine a coherent alternative to it” – is not, Fisher would later say, “quite accurate”. Capitalist realism is less a conviction than “a set of behaviours and affects that arise from [it]”. It entails a “deep embedding in a world – or set of worlds – in which capitalism is massively naturalised”. “The best way to think about capitalist realism,” Fisher told an audience in 2016, “is as a form of what I’d call consciousness-deflation.” Fisher relates the rise of capitalist realism in the late 1970s (coterminous with the rise of neoliberalism) to the “receding of the concept of consciousness from culture”, particularly “class consciousness”, “consciousness-raising”, and “psychedelic consciousness” – “psychedelic” because it made reality seem contingent and mutable. This is what the “acid” of “Acid Communism” denotes: Fisher is not advocating the mass use of hallucinogens but gesturing to the “perception that social reality [is] provisional, plastic, subject to transformation by ­collective desire”. Neoliberalism was able to suppress these emancipatory forms of consciousness and to hijack modernity, Fisher contends, because of a failure of leftist politics: where the hippies were experimenting with communal living and alternative family units, all the left could muster was a fusty statism. The contemporary left, then, must be relentlessly modern. For Fisher, this means accepting our entanglement in the infrastructures of advanced capitalism. Escaping from the bind expressed in Louise Mensch’s criticism of Occupy protesters means recognising both the luxuries and privations of modern technologies – the convenience and gratifications offered by an iPhone, as well as its encroachments on privacy and time. This was why, Fisher explained to his students, he was taken with the term “postcapitalism”. It suggests “a victory that will come  through capitalism”. “It starts from where we are. It’s not some entirely separate space… we’re not required to imagine a  sheer alterity, a  pure outside.” Speaking at his memorial, Jeremy Gilbert described Fisher as “a model of the public intellectual in the internet age”; the music critic Simon Reynolds, writing Fisher’s obituary in the  Guardian, similarly described him as “an exemplary engaged intellectual”. “Popular intellectual” may be another suitable title, befitting Fisher’s dedication to popular culture, and a body of work that was in the best sense popularising. This epithet has the added merit of ­being literally true. Indeed, Fisher’s popularity, which appears only to have grown since his death, demands explanation. *** Fisher spent most of his career on the periphery of the academy and mainstream journalism. Despite his rising fame, he was “utterly broke”, as Gilbert puts it, “eking out a living… from sessional teaching… and from freelance writing”. It was only late on that he held a permanent, full-time lecturing position at Goldsmiths. But Fisher’s marginality was not reclusive in spirit. He was deeply committed to collectivity: “Encountering Fisher was like joining a band; you shared a sense of purpose before you knew whether you were even going to like each other,” his friend, the novelist Tariq Goddard, reflected at his memorial. Fisher had a gift for bringing people together in a purposeful – and ultimately political – way, especially those who felt similarly confined to the outskirts of official culture. The irony, given the breadth of Fisher’s appeal, is that alienation is clearly a mainstream condition. The enthusiastic reception of Fisher’s writing also has much to do with its style – its ingenuity, charisma and distinctiveness. “Capitalist realism” was not a new idea – it was in part an updated version of Fredric Jameson’s concept of “postmodernism” – but originality, as Gilbert has written, was not the point. The book’s “primary concern” was rather “to effect a direct change in the affective disposition and cognitive outlook of the reader”. This ethos bears the imprint of the CCRU, whose writings, “boast[ing] an extravagant concentration of ideas per sentence”, as Reynolds put it in a 1999 profile of the research centre, sought to produce a “hallucinatory rush” in readers. But it may also have been something Fisher absorbed from the irreverent synthesis of the mass-cultural and the high-theoretical he encountered in the music press in the 1980s and 1990s. In a k-punk post on Michael Jackson after the singer’s death in 2009, Fisher – playfully provocative and yet utterly sincere – writes that “‘Billie Jean’ is not only one of the best singles ever recorded, it is one of the greatest art works of the 20th century”: Sometimes, the weariness brought on by hearing it so many times will make you twitch the dial when “Billie Jean” comes on the radio. But let it play, and you’re soon bewitched by its drama… Listening is like stepping onto a conveyor belt… as the implacable, undulating sinuous cakewalk of the synthetic bass takes over the massive space opened up by the crunching snares… insouciantly hijacked from hip hop. “Describing one’s experience of art is itself a form of art; the burden of describing it is like the burden of producing it,” the late philosopher Stanley Cavell wrote. Taking this principle to heart, Fisher’s music criticism makes you want to return to the songs his virtuosic lyricism echoes and celebrates: “Let it play,” Fisher enjoins. *** Political writing that aims to produce an affective response in readers is often described as ­“polemic”, but another way of thinking about Fisher’s writing is as “consciousness-raising”. This, Fisher explains in a 2015 k-punk post, is a process of “people sharing their feelings, especially their feelings of misery and desperation, and together attributing the sources of these feelings to impersonal structures”. “The chief obstruction to all of these steps,” Fisher goes on, is “time poverty.” He adds: “The problem is absolutely immanent – writing this and the other posts I have completed this week has meant that I have fallen enormously behind on my work, which is storing up stress for the next week or so.” His confession to be suffering from the very “obstruction” he identifies is characteristic of Fisher, who had a gift for the casual, illuminating application of autobiography, and for finding everyday analogues for abstract forces. He strove to attend to everyday experience, whether mundane – the fathomless bureaucracy of his teaching job – or private: the depression that eventually led to his suicide. Fisher’s attention to aspects of daily life that might seem too boring or personal to be worthy of collective interest was, I think, propelled by an intuition that part of what sustains our acquiescence to the status quo is our inattention to it. Capitalist realism “naturalises” capitalism by desensitising us to it – requiring and encouraging a kind of heedlessness towards our experience. Fisher’s attention to the details of his life licenses our attention to the details of our own – a precondition for elucidating and resisting the political forces that shape them. [See also:  How Augustus rebuilt Rome] “To reclaim a real political agency means first of all accepting your insertion at the level of desire in the remorseless meat-grinder of Capital,” Fisher wrote in  Capitalist Realism. The denial of our participation in the world, he implies – the disavowal of our desire for iPhones even as we diligently think anti-capitalist thoughts – is incapacitating. It leads to a regressive utopianism that cannot envision going through capitalism, but only retreating or escaping from it, into a primitive past or fictional future. The licence to attend provided by Fisher’s approach feels liberating – particularly for millennials whose inability to imagine alternatives to neoliberalism arises in part from their having never known anything else. Fisher’s writing may resonate with those who came of age in the thick of capitalist realism, and who, unlike Fisher’s generation, have no memory of social democracy, precisely because it theorises a loss they can’t remember or measure, but which they’ve nevertheless inherited. Although it aims at a release from the personal, consciousness-raising also involves personal risk. At Fisher’s memorial, Robin Mackay spoke of Fisher’s “wagering on the potential of shared experience and shared understanding, sometimes at the cost of a self-exposure that was perilous for him”. Following Fisher’s example therefore involves a degree of courage or – another key word for Fisher – confidence. “It’s very difficult, in our more deflated times, to re-create the counterculture’s confidence” that things might be otherwise. “We don’t need hope; what we need is confidence and the capacity to act.”</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/mark-fisher-postcapitalist-desire-review">https://www.newstatesman.com/mark-fisher-postcapitalist-desire-review</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/费舍尔/">#费舍尔</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/mark/">#mark</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
