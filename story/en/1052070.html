Apple is not new to the processor game, they have been producing some of the best mobile processors for iPhones and iPads for a while, but this was their first time doing that for full size computers. There was a lot of hype on the internet before the processor even came out, and some of the claims seemed unreal and impossible. After the public release, lot of reviewers got their hands on the new MacBooks and were surprised to find out that the rumors were not only correct, but the processor  broke a lot of barriers most people were not expecting. The single core performance was  faster than anything out there, the system used  way less power than any other processors in that class and the system stayed cool even under heavy loads with no fans kicking in for a long time. In fact, Apple was so confident about this processor that they completely removed the fan on the MacBook Air. Pair that with 17-20 hours of battery life, this was looking like the perfect processor for computers on paper.</p><p>如果您在过去的6个月内骑在互联网上并对技术有任何兴趣，您可能会遇到一篇关于Apple的新MacBook的文章，他们在House Apple Silicon M1处理器上。 Apple对处理器游戏并不新建，他们已经为iPhone和iPad生产了一些最佳的移动处理器，但这是他们第一次为全尺寸计算机做这一点。在处理器甚至出来之前，互联网上有很多炒作，其中一些索赔似乎是不真实的。公开发布后，很多审稿人都掌握了新的MacBook，并且惊讶地发现谣言不仅正确，但处理器打破了大多数人不期待的障碍。单核性能比那里的任何东西更快，系统使用的方式比任何其他处理器都少于该类的任何其他处理器，即使在重负荷下也保持冷却，没有粉丝长期以来踢进入。事实上，Apple对这个处理器非常有信心，他们完全从MacBook Air上拆下了风扇。对17-20小时的电池寿命，这看起来像纸上电脑的完美处理器。</p><p>  I have always admired Apple products,  specially in the last 4-5 years, and this was no different. Although my 2019 16 inch MacBook Pro with Intel i9 processor had more than enough power for my needs as a software developer, I was never a fan of how hot it got under heavy loads, and how quickly I could kill the battery if I was doing anything CPU / GPU intensive. It was hard not to impulse buy and pre-order the computer, but when I saw that my local Apple Store had the exact configuration I wanted in stock, I couldn’t hold my impulsiveness and got a brand new Apple M1 MacBook Pro with 1TB SSD, 16GB Ram. I still remember giggling like a little kid at the candy store while driving to the Apple store to pick it up.</p><p>  我一直羡慕苹果产品，特别是在过去的4  -  5年中，这并不不同。虽然我的2019年16英寸MacBook Pro具有英特尔I9处理器的需求作为软件开发人员的需求超过了足够的力量，但我从来没有粉丝在重量负荷下有多热，如果我在做的话，我可以杀死电池的速度任何CPU / GPU密集型。很难冲动购买和预订电脑，但是当我看到我当地的Apple商店有我股票的确切配置时，我无法阻止我的冲动，并获得一个全新的Apple M1 MacBook Pro，其中1TB SSD，16GB RAM。我还记得像糖果商店的一个小孩一样咯咯地笑，同时开车到苹果商店捡起它。</p><p>  I finally got it in my hands, and I had a million things going in my head. I was happy and excited, that I got a new computer, kind of sad and angry at myself, because it was an impulse purchase, and curious, because I was excited to experience the next generation of computing. See the thing is that this new processor was not just new in the sense that it was made by a new company, but also new in the sense that it used a new architecture ARM64 and an all new internal structure. I am no expert in processors and their inner workings, but I knew enough to know that this meant there were going to be compatibility issues with applications and external devices. That being said, all the reviews I had read and seen on YouTube pointed to the fact that Apple had thought that through and it was not going to be an issue. And they were right, Apple’s binary translation layer, Rosetta 2 is amazing, and we will be touching on that more later.</p><p>  我终于掌握在我手中，我脑子里有一百万件事。我很开心，兴奋，我有一台新电脑，悲伤和生气，因为它是一种冲动购买，好奇，因为我很高兴能够体验下一代计算。看到这件事是，这个新的处理器不仅仅是一种新的公司，也不是新的公司，也是新的架构ARM64和所有新的内部结构的感觉。我在处理器和内部工作中没有专家，但我知道足以知道这意味着应用程序和外部设备有兼容性问题。据说，我在youtube上看到和看到的所有评论指出，苹果已经认为通过并且不会成为一个问题。他们是对的，Apple的二进制翻译层，罗萨斯2是惊人的，我们将稍后再触摸。</p><p>  The primary purpose of me getting this new MacBook was to develop software. I have to work with a lot of different technology stacks and having proper compatibility was going to be a huge deal breaker for me. My stack currently is primarily Node.js / Typescript, React for frontend, Postgres for database, Docker for managing containers and deployment, VSCode as an editor and other tools like Webpack, SASS, HomeBrew and more. My experience has been all over the place when it comes to compatibility, but at the end things have been working well and I am happy I made the switch. Let’s dig a bit more:</p><p>  我获得这个新MacBook的主要目的是开发软件。我必须使用很多不同的技术堆栈，并且有适当的兼容性将是我的巨大交易。我的堆栈目前主要是Node.js / typeScript，对Frontend，数据库Postgres作出反应，用于管理容器和部署的Docker，vscode作为编辑器和其他工具，如webpack，sass，homebrew等工具和其他工具。我的经历在兼容性方面已经到处了，但最终的事情一直在运作良好，我很高兴我开了交换机。让我们更多地挖一点：</p><p>  Since I knew that the native arm64 versions of everything I use would take some time to appear, I had planned to use the Rosetta 2 versions of everything till native things got more stable. Rosetta 2 is an translation layer that converts Intel x86 instructions to the Arm64 instruction set being used in M1.  According to benchmarks there is no significant drop in performance, and the processor is so fast that even things running under Rosetta 2 run faster than in most Intel based processors out there. And since it is a translation layer and not an emulation layer, binaries are translated the first time you load an app, adding about 2 seconds on the initial launch. But after the initial launch things start up as quickly as native applications.</p><p>  由于我知道我使用的所有东西的本机ARM64版本，因此我计划使用Rosetta 2版本的所有东西，直到原生的东西变得更加稳定。 Rosetta 2是将英特尔X86指令转换为M1中使用的ARM64指令集的翻译层。根据基准测试，性能没有显着下降，处理器如此之快，即使在Rosetta 2下运行的东西也比在那里的大多数英特尔基础的处理器中运行得更快。由于它是翻译层而不是仿真层，因此第一次加载应用程序时，二进制文件将在初始启动时添加大约2秒钟。但是在初始启动后，事件开始快速启动作为本机应用程序。</p><p> Most apps will automatically run in Rosetta when the OS detects that it is using x86 architecture. So things like VSCode etc were as easy to get up and running as installing them like you would normally. I use  HomeBrew as the package manager, and that one was a bit different to setup. I had to setup my terminal of choice iTerm to run under Rosetta so all the command line tools I had would run under Rosetta too, including brew. Here is how you set that up:</p><p> 当OS检测到它使用x86架构时，大多数应用程序将在Rosetta自动运行。因此，像vsode等的情况一样易于起床并运行，因为你通常会安装它们。我使用Homebrew作为包管理器，其中一个与设置有点不同。我不得不设置我的首选终端iterm以在Rosetta下运行，所以我所在的所有命令行工具都会在Rosetta下运行，包括酿造。以下是您将其设置的方式：</p><p> Copy iTerm or another terminal, and make a duplicate. Rename it to call it something like Rosetta iTerm.</p><p> 复制ITERM或其他终端，并进行重复。将其重命名以称之为Rosetta Iterm。 </p><p>   That’s it, now you have a terminal that will always run under Rosetta.</p><p>就是这样，现在你有一个终端，总是在Rosetta下运行。</p><p> Tip: You can change the default icon by dragging a new icon image (not file, the image) to the icon on top left corner of this dialog box.</p><p> 提示：您可以通过将新图标图像（不是文件，图像）拖动到此对话框的左上角的图标来更改默认图标。</p><p>  Everything you run on this new copy of the app will now run using Rosetta. Then you can just install brew or any other tools normally in this terminal.</p><p>  您在该应用程序的新副本上运行的一切都将使用Rosetta运行。然后，您可以在此终端中正常安装BREW或任何其他工具。</p><p>  I had almost no issues with this part of my stack initially. I was running Node.js under Rosetta 2, and the installation was really straightforward with brew and  nvm, which is a Node.js version manager. Later a native arm64 version of Node.js was released for M1 Macs, which I installed right away. Things felt much faster, even npm install commands seemed to be faster than before but I am not sure if that is just placebo. But I realized that there were times where long running processes would crash intermittently. I still haven’t been able to pinpoint what is causing it, but it seems it be related to fswatcher which uses native bindings under the Node.js layer. It only happens once in a while, so it has not bothered me much.</p><p>  我最初几乎没有关于这部分堆栈的问题。我在Rosetta 2下运行Node.js，并且安装真的很简单，用BREW和NVM非常简单，这是一个Node.js版本管理器。稍后为M1 Mac发布了Node.js的本机ARM64版本，我立即安装。事情感到更快，甚至NPM安装命令似乎比以前更快，但我不确定这是一个只是安慰剂。但我意识到有时间长时间运行过程会间歇性的。我仍然无法确定导致它的原因，但似乎与fswatcher相关，它在node.js层下使用本机绑定。它只偶尔会发生一次，所以它还没有困扰我。</p><p>  This is the big one, if you are using a Mac and are a software developer, you are most likely using brew already. Initially I was running brew under Rosetta and things were perfect, I had no issues at all. Later the native arm64 version was released, and me being me, I installed it right away. Things were pretty good for the most part, and they keep getting better. Some packages did not have the pre-compiled native bottles, so they had to be compiled on the machine, but that has been changing over time as more package vendors have been adding bottles for M1. Since it was a one time thing, and since this computer was so fast, compiling things from source was not a huge deal to me.</p><p>  这是一个大的，如果您使用的是Mac并是软件开发人员，您已经最有可能使用BREW。最初我在Rosetta和Rosetta跑了酿造，事情完美，我根本没有问题。后来颁布了本机ARM64版本，我就是我，我马上安装了。事情对大多数部分都非常好，他们一直越来越好。有些包没有预编译的本机瓶，因此他们必须在机器上编译，但随着时间的推移，随着更多的包装供应商已经为M1添加瓶子而变化。由于这是一个持续的事情，因为这台电脑如此速度，从来源编制的东西对我来说并不是一个巨大的交易。</p><p>  No issues here, my initial install through Rosetta brew ran perfectly, and later when I switched to native brew, things were still stable.</p><p>  这里没有问题，我的初步安装通过罗萨塔酿造完美，后来当我切换到原生酿造时，事情仍然稳定。</p><p>  Ok this one was where things broke, initially docker did not run on M1’s at all, not even under Rosetta. Since Docker was mostly being used in my stack for deployments and packaging of containers, it was not a huge issue for me. But if your workflow depended on Docker, you would have to hold off on getting the M1.  Docker released a tech preview later, but I have not gotten around to testing it.</p><p>  好的，这是事情破坏的地方，最初的码头没有在M1上运行，甚至在Rosetta下。由于Docker大多用于我的堆栈以进行容器的部署和包装，因此对我来说不是一个巨大的问题。但是，如果您的工作流程依赖Docker，则必须撤销获得M1。 Docker稍后发布了技术预览，但我没有围绕测试它。 </p><p>  Microsoft has been doing an amazing job developing  VSCode and it reflects even in this case. They were one of the first ones to release a native preview version for M1 Macs, and I had been using that since the first release. I have had no issues, but they recently released a stable M1 version which works really well.</p><p>微软一直在做一个惊人的工作开发vsode，即使在这种情况下也反映了它。它们是第一个为M1 Mac发布本机预览版本的首次版本之一，并且我已经使用了第一个版本以来。我没有问题，但他们最近发布了一个稳定的M1版本，它真的很好。</p><p>   I haven’t had too many issues with other parts of my stack. Sass was throwing errors randomly at the beginning but it started working after reinstalling node.</p><p>   我没有太多的问题与我的堆栈的其他部分。 Sass在开始时随机抛出错误，但重新安装节点后开始工作。</p><p>  My experience with this computer has been nothing but amazing. I knew it was going to be a great computer before I even got it, but it beat all of my expectations in every way possible.</p><p>  我对这台电脑的经验只令人惊讶。我知道在我甚至得到它之前将成为一台很棒的电脑，但它以各种可能的方式击败了我的所有期望。</p><p>  This one is life changing, not having to think about charging the computer lifts a huge mental block. This computer is insane, Apple advertises 20 hours of battery life and I have gotten pretty close to that with medium – heavy usage. Even with consistent heavy usage, I get around 10 hours, which is more than what I was expecting. I rarely think about charging anymore, and I don’t remember the last time my battery went below 20%.</p><p>  这个是生活变化，不必考虑充电电脑抬起一个巨大的心理障碍。这台电脑很疯狂，Apple宣传了20个小时的电池寿命，我已经相当于中等沉重的使用。即使是始终如一的沉重用法，我也会得到10个小时，这比我期待的更多。我很少想想收费了，我不记得我最后一次我的电池低于20％。</p><p>  The looks have not changed from the previous version, and the computer still has touchbar, same trackpad and a pretty good keyboard. I switched from a 16 inch model to 13 inch, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I am now able to use the computer in airplanes, and it’s a lot more portable to carry around. I take my computer to more places now allowing me to get work done with more flexibility, compared to my 16 inch which mostly used to sit in my desk. The display is good as always, and stays bright even in direct daylight.</p><p>  看起来没有从以前的版本改变，计算机仍然具有触摸栏，同样的触控板和一个相当良好的键盘。我从16英寸的型号转换为13英寸，结果表明是伪装的祝福，因为我现在能够在飞机中使用电脑，并且携带更多的便携式便携式。我把电脑带到了更多的地方，现在让我以更大的灵活性完成工作，而我的16英寸大多用于坐在我的桌子里。显示器与始终保持不错，即使在直接的日光下也保持亮。</p><p> When it comes to how it feels, it is night and day. The thermals are incredible, the fans almost never come on. It’s a weird feeling to not have your palms get sweaty because of heat, which was a normal thing in my last computer. The computer stays cool to the touch all the time, but the downside is you will no longer have a lap-top heater with you when it’s cold out. The keyboard is amazing, since it is the updated version that fixes a lot of flaws from the previous version.</p><p> 当谈到它的感受，是昼夜。热量令人难以置信，粉丝几乎从未来过。由于热量，这是一种奇怪的感觉，因为热量是因为热量，这是我最后一台电脑中的正常事。电脑一直保持凉爽到触摸，但下行的是，当它冷却时，你将不再与你有一个懒盖式加热器。键盘是惊人的，因为它是更新的版本，可以从上一个版本中修复大量缺陷。</p><p>  This was a surprising side effect of the changes on this computer. I have realized that I have been much more productive after I made the switch. I dismissed it initially thinking my increased output was just because it was a new computer and I was just trying to use it more because it was a new toy. But the more I used it, the more I realized that it was not just the new toy syndrome, I was actually getting more shit done.</p><p>  这是这台计算机上变化的令人惊讶的副作用。我已经意识到我制作开关后的生产力更高。我驳回了最初认为我的产出增加只是因为它是一台新电脑，我只是想使用它，因为这是一个新玩具。但我越多，我越是意识到它不仅仅是新的玩具综合症，我实际上已经变得更加糟糕了。 </p><p> Turns out, this computer removes a lot of friction associated with using a computer, which in turn translates to productivity increase. First one is speed, and this is one of those things that you don’t realize till you actually use this computer. Everything feels so smooth and snappy, that it does not feel like you have to wait for anything. I always felt that Mac’s were snappy and smooth no matter what hardware config they came in, but after using this M1 even my old 16 inch version feels jittery in places. I did not expect those micro jitters that only last milliseconds to cause that much difference in productivity, but our brains work in a weird way and even minor changes to reduce micro-friction in everyday work reduces your cognitive load significantly. Everything from opening applications to switching workspaces to browsing the web feels super snappy, and there are no slowdowns or jitters whatsoever. I even tried launching all the apps I had installed in my computer at once, just to see how far I could push this computer, and was pleasantly surprised to find that Affinity Photo was still usable with close to 100 other apps running actively on the computer. This list included some heavy softwares like all of Affinity suite, Final Cut Pro, bunch of IDE’s, Logic Pro, Apple Pages, Numbers, Slides and so much more. I know that is an unlikely use case for anyone who will buy this computer, but it just shows that this computer will not break a sweat no matter what you throw at it.</p><p>结果，这台电脑消除了与使用计算机相关的大量摩擦，这反过来转化为生产力增加。第一个是速度，这是你实际上使用这台电脑的那些事情之一。一切都感觉如此平滑和笨拙，它不觉得你必须等待任何事情。无论他们进入哪些硬件配置我不指望那些只有刚刚毫秒的微笑者造成生产力的大量差异，但我们的大脑以奇怪的方式工作，甚至在日常工作中减少微摩擦的微小变化会显着降低认知负荷。从打开应用程序到切换工作空间浏览Web的一切都感觉超级旋转，并且没有任何速度或钝纱。我甚至试过推出一下我在电脑中安装的所有应用程序，只是看看我可以推动这台电脑，并且很惊喜地发现亲和力照片仍然可以使用，靠近100个在计算机上积极运行的其他应用程序。此列表包括一些沉重的软件，如所有亲和套件，最终切割专业，群IDE，逻辑专业，苹果网，数字，幻灯片等。我知道这是一个购买这台电脑的人的不太可能的情况，但它只是表明这台电脑不会在你扔的东西中脱去汗水。</p><p> Next productivity gain was from the instant on feature, which I bet most people don’t even think about. See, Apple has changed the way the computer wakes up, so now as soon as you lift the lid of the MacBook you are greeted with the login screen. Before, there was a second or two delay for the computer to wake up, and even more if you were plugged in to an external monitor. While that might not seem like a large amount of time to wait, having instant on changes your behavior in a subtle way where you want to grab the computer and open it really quickly to get something done and close it immediately. I have had instances where I come up with a solution to something I was working on randomly, and would immediately open my computer to update it. In the past, I would hold it off till I can sit down, settle properly with the computer then use it. Pair this instant turn on with quick authentication with Touch ID or Apple Watch login, you will start using the computer a lot more with minimal effort even for little things, sort of like how you use your phone to quickly check on something.</p><p> 下一个生产力增益来自于特征的即时，我敢打赌大多数人甚至没有想到的。看，苹果已经改变了电脑醒来的方式，所以现在一旦你抬起了MacBook的盖子，你就会与登录屏幕打招呼。之前，计算机唤醒了第二个或两个延迟，如果您已插入外部监视器，则甚至更多。虽然这可能看起来不太需要等待，但在你想要抓住电脑的微妙方式并立即打开它的微妙方式，瞬间更加改变你的行为并立即关闭它。我有一个实例，我想到了一个解决我随机工作的东西的解决方案，并将立即打开电脑来更新它。在过去，我会把它拿走，直到我坐下来，用电脑妥善解决，然后使用它。对此即时打开快速身份验证使用触摸ID或Apple Watch登录，您将在最小的努力中开始使用计算机，即使是小事，也可以像如何使用手机快速检查某些东西。</p><p> Last but not the least, not having a hot computer in your lap really helps you use it for a long period of time. I remember having to walk away from my old 16 inch MacBook few times because it got too hot to use it comfortably, specially while doing processor intensive things like compiling large codebases or rendering video. That is not a problem anymore, but it has spoiled me to a point where when my work MacBook which is Intel based gets even a little hot, it starts feeling uncomfortable. Also being able to downsize from the 16 inch to 13 but still have the same amount of power makes this computer perfect for getting things done on the go. The whole reason I chose 16 inch MacBook was for the faster processor options, but we are no longer restricted to that form factor anymore.</p><p> 最后但并非最不重要的是，没有在你的膝盖里有热电脑真的可以帮助你在很长一段时间内使用它。我记得几次远离我的16英寸MacBook，因为它太热了，无法舒适地使用它，特别是在进行编译大号代码库或渲染视频等处理器密集型的东西时。这不再是问题了，但它已经让我到了一个点在我的工作MacBook是基于英特尔的甚至有点热的地方，它开始感到不舒服。也能够从16英寸到13缩小到13，但仍然具有相同的功率使这台计算机完美地完美地完成了在随时随地完成的事情。我选择16英寸MacBook的整个原因是更快的处理器选项，但我们不再限制到该形式因素了。</p><p>   Even though this computer is amazing at most things, it does not mean that it is flawless. I have dealt with my fair share of issues with this MacBook, and here are some of them:</p><p>   即使这台电脑在大多数事情都很惊讶，它并不意味着它是完美的。我已经处理了这个MacBook的展会的公平份额，这里有一些问题：</p><p> Only two USB C ports which are both on left side means I cannot charge the computer from either side like I used to be able to. I understand that this problem will not be an issue in the future iterations of the computer, but as of now this is something I miss from my old computer.</p><p> 只有两个左侧侧面的USB C端口，我不能从我曾经能够的任何一方向计算机充电。我知道这个问题不会是未来的计算机迭代的问题，但截至目前，这是我从旧电脑中错过的东西。</p><p> I have noticed random freezes here and there. I had a couple instances where the computer completely froze out to a point where I had to hard reset it to get it working again. That being said this has not happened recently after the new updates, so I am crossing my fingers on this one.</p><p> 我注意到这里和那里的随机冻结了。我有几个实例，计算机完全冻结到我必须硬重置它以便再次工作的地方。据说这一点在新的更新之后尚未发生，所以我在这一边穿过手指。</p><p> The screen, while being amazing at reproducing colors and rendering things well, is a dirt magnet and gets dirty quickly. There is no easy way to clean it either. The anti glare coating Apple uses on the new MacBooks works really well against glares, and allows you to use the computer in bright daylight, but makes it easy to get it dirty and harder to clean. This has been an issue for a few generations of MacBooks, and is not specific to M1 models. You win some, you lose some, I guess.</p><p> 屏幕，虽然在再现颜色和渲染方面令人惊讶的时候，是一种污垢磁铁，快速变脏。也没有简单的方法可以清洁它。 Apple在新MacBook上使用的反眩光涂布涂抹于耀眼，并允许您在明亮的日光中使用计算机，但可以轻松地弄脏，更难以清洁。这是几代MacBooks的问题，并且没有特定于M1模型。我猜你赢了一些，你会失去一些。 </p><p> It still has the TouchBar. Oh you thought I was going to complain about the TouchBar, weren’t you? I freaking love this TouchBar, and after a bit of customization it adds more things that speed up my workflow. I’m sad they are removing it in the future versions. I feel like the people that complain about this are the ones who have a hard time changing their workflows to use the TouchBar, and still do things the old school way using function keys, but who am I to complain if it works for them.</p><p>它仍然有触摸栏。哦，你以为我要抱怨触摸栏，不是吗？我吓坏了这个触摸杆，并且经过一点定制它会增加更多的东西加速我的工作流程。我很伤心他们在未来的版本中删除它。我觉得抱怨这是一个抱怨的人是那些难得改变他们的工作流程来使用触摸栏的人，并且仍然使用功能键进行旧学校方式的事情，但是如果它为他们工作，我就会抱怨。</p><p>  Apple has really shown the world that there is a better way to go about computing in general by not being afraid to dive down to the fundamentals of processor design and change things that most of us thought were set in stone. This ground up approach to innovation has pushed Apple ahead of the pack in multiple product areas, and this new MacBook is just another example of that. If you are a software developer and are thinking about getting the new M1 MacBook, I would highly recommend it. I am very excited to see the direction Apple is heading in, and will keep an close eye on the future iterations of this processor. I would love to hear what you think about the M1 and your experience with it in the comment section.</p><p>  Apple真正向世界展示了一个更好的方法，通过不害怕潜入处理器设计的基本原则和改变我们大多数我们认为在石头上的东西的基础上，有更好的方法。这种对创新的基础已经推动了多个产品领域的包装前推动了苹果，这款新MacBook只是另一个例子。如果您是软件开发人员并正在考虑获取新的M1 MacBook，我会强烈推荐它。我很高兴看到苹果的方向前进，并将密切关注这个处理器的未来迭代。我很想听到你对M1的看法以及你在评论部分中的经验。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://subedi.co/blog/2021/03/12/experience-with-apple-silicon-m1-macbook-as-a-software-developer">https://subedi.co/blog/2021/03/12/experience-with-apple-silicon-m1-macbook-as-a-software-developer</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/开发/">#开发</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/macbook/">#macbook</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012 - 2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
