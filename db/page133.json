", "note_en": "GoPro has just announced a new open API for 3rd party companies/apps to use, called  Open GoPro, allowing them to integrate with their cameras, starting with the GoPro Hero 9. The API (Application Programming Interface) allows a slew of functions over wireless interfaces, including control as well as transfer of media. Most notably, the API is not \u2018gated\u2019 behind some corporate partnership deal, instead, anyone can get to work creating apps to integrate with it.\n If a GoPro API sounds familiar to you, it might be. It was a mere half a decade ago that GoPro announced their GoPro Developer Program. In theory, it covered many of the same features as today\u2019s program. But in practice, it wasn\u2019t open. So we saw some companies,  like Polar, actually implement it in their products (ok, a handful of products). So did some drone companies,  including 3DR &amp;  AirDog. But it required GoPro to set up a partnership there with all the complexities that brought with it. Other companies, such as Wahoo though, couldn\u2019t get into the program (they tried, hoping to integrate it with the Wahoo bike computers).\n Whereas, this new open program resolves that, as there\u2019s no longer a gatekeeper to the program. It\u2019s just an open interface anyone can use.\n And the potential is massive for people wanting to develop Really Cool Stuff\u2122. For example, in reading through all the documents, in the sports realm, one could develop:\n \u2013 A Garmin Connect IQ App for your bike computer or watch to control the GoPro \u2013 A desktop app to automatically connect wirelessly to your GoPro and offload all the content to a local computer or NAS device \u2013 FPV drone control integration, without having to hack things apart\n And in fact, at launch, there are five specific scenarios that are being lit-up by 3rd party companies:\n \u2013 Amazfit watches will have GoPro camera control from the wrist. \u2013 Sena cycling helmets will have voice control of your GoPro \u2013 Centurion Boats: wirelessly control a GoPro from the boat\u2019s helm control screen \u2013 Orqa: FPV goggle control (drones) to see camera status in goggles \u2013 Pixellot: They do sports broadcasting, this controls all the GoPro\u2019s and handles content transfer\n However, there are some limitations that, at least in this first iteration, mean the world isn\u2019t entirely your oyster. There\u2019s no support for capturing the video stream live, nor is there any API connectivity into GoPro\u2019s online platform, formerly known as GoPro Plus (to access your stored media there). Still, maybe later.\n For the geeks in the crowd, press on. For everyone else, fear not, I\u2019ll circle back when I find some cool apps down the road worth mentioning (after developers have a chance to develop them).\n   Obviously, this is gonna get geeky\u2026really geeky. But not as geeky as it could be. I\u2019ll leave it to you to dive into the full code examples and demos, as well as actual API documentation. Instead, I figured I\u2019d get the highlights out of the way. Invariably though, like any development project, it takes a bit of coding to really start to understand the potential (and limitations).\n GoPro says that for this iteration, they\u2019re focused on these key camera areas, all at the device layer. Meaning, talking directly to the camera (versus talking to the GoPro app or GoPro cloud):\n \u2013 Wireless connectivity \u2013 Camera status \u2013 Camera command and control \u2013 Preview \u2013 SD card access\n At present, this is launching on the Hero 9, but I\u2019m gonna take a guess we\u2019ll see it expand backwards to other cameras, just like they did with GoPro Labs (now supported on the Hero 7, Hero 8, Hero 9, and Max). It makes sense to start small. Plus, they even have a table in their documentation that lists just a single entry. No point in having a table for listing one item.\n  Now GoPro\u2019s media e-mail states both wired and wireless connectivity, though all the documentation just mentioned wireless. So my guess is wired is coming soon too. For the wireless side, there\u2019s two ways to interact with the camera:\n  However, in order to get access to WiFi, you\u2019ll need to enable it via Bluetooth Smart. This is how GoPro cameras have worked for years, in that your phone typically initializes the connection via BLE, turning on the WiFi (thus, saving battery). Back in the \u2018old school days\u2019, pre-BLE, WiFi was just on all the time (and, then, the cause of some interference issues with certain bike computers too\u2026). As usual, a GoPro keeps its BLE service running in the background for 8 hours after the last button press/going to sleep (meaning, even after you power it off, it\u2019s still sending BLE advertisements for 8 hours, which is  how you can find it when you lose it).\n In order to connect to BLE, your app (or device, like watch) will establish a pairing with the camera, in the same way you pair the GoPro app. It\u2019ll save this pairing for subsequent pairings.\n Meanwhile, for the WiFi side, authentication to the camera merely requires inputting the GoPro\u2019s unique WiFi SSID &amp; password, making it relatively easy to connect to for apps and/or devices. However, based on everything I can understand right now in the documentation, the limitation is that you can\u2019t have the GoPro connect directly to your own home network and leverage the API that way. That would have been very useful for offloading footage directly onto your network (akin to what it does for GoPro\u2019s cloud solution, but to them). With the way it\u2019s implemented today (assuming I\u2019ve understood everything correctly), an app connects directly to the GoPro, and then pulls data via that direct WiFi connection over a small HTTP server that the GoPro runs.\n   However, within those, you can access tons of settings or file operations. For example, there\u2019s a table of some 113 different status codes at present that you can query to find the state of the camera. Here\u2019s a small snippet of those:\n  The proper snarky answer to status code 6 is always \u20181\u2019. I kid, I kid\u2026mostly.\n Now, in a nutshell, all the comments that GoPro has exposed essentially allow you to pretend to be a user on the device itself. That means you can change settings, start/stop recording, change resolutions, look at file properties (like videos or photos), and even download those videos. In fact, you can even trigger so-called \u2018Turbo\u2019 mode for faster WiFi downloads of media.\n The company has  published all of this over on GitHub, including walk-through tutorials in Python and Bash. And then demos in C/C++, C#, Python, and Swift.\n    And then they dive through each step of what\u2019s going on, and are chunked into different chapters. Here\u2019s\u00a0 a tiny snippet of one chapter:\n  Lastly, for fun, it\u2019s worth noting that in the documentation there\u2019s plenty of cleverly worded implications about what a GoPro Hero 10 might look like feature-wise (assumed for ~September). For example, in the \u2018Chapters\u2019 section, there\u2019s this seemingly innocuous tidbit:\n  Except, as one that has written plenty of technical documentation on how things work when you know the next version will change it (but want this document to still be valid when you forget about it later), you say stuff like this. Otherwise, you\u2019d simply say \u201cAll GoPro Cameras limit file sizes\u2026\u201d, which is true, till today anyway.\n Of course, even that\u2019s a bit untrue, as one of the GoPro Labs options is to tweak this setting and do  far larger file sizes, which is available on a number of past cameras. In any case, my suspicion here is that the Hero 10 will finally do away with requiring 4GB file chunking, which is frankly just a solid annoyance in 2021.\n Oh, and remember you\u2019ll  need to ensure your Hero 9 is on the latest firmware, which just came out today, in order to support this.\n     This is awesome. Simply put. Sure, I\u2019d love to see it on more cameras (hopefully soon, as the documents seem to imply), but having this at all is a huge step forward for the company. While GoPro labs was  great for power users last year (and some of those features grew up to normal features, and  new Labs features in 2021 too), this API is actually great for normal consumers too \u2013 even if they don\u2019t realize it yet. With GoPro launching today with companies like Amazfit doing watch control, and even a boat company (Centurion Boats) enabling GoPro control directly from the boat\u2019s helm, these are real-world solutions that people will actually use.\n  A) Garmin Connect IQ app to control a GoPro (or, even better, native integration): Sure, native integration is great since it appears Garmin is done with their VIRB foray. But Connect IQ wouldn\u2019t require any Garmin intervention at all, any random developer could do this. Hit me up if you do, and I\u2019ll write about it, pronto! This would be killer within the  newer GoPro Hindsight feature on the Hero 9, since it\u2019s doing a rolling 30-second buffer, so that I could tap something on my bike computer to grab whatever crazy event just happened.\n B) File offloading to a NAS: Within their press kit, they mention that Pixellot is using this for offloading of content into their sports broadcasting platform. I want basically that, but at my office. I want to be able to walk into the DCR Cave with a pile of GoPro\u2019s, plug them in, and have the content offload quickly via WiFi to my NAS server. Or at worst, a directory on a computer. I don\u2019t want to use my phone to do this. A Mac or PC driven app is where this would live (well, ideally it\u2019d automatically do this without any app driving it, but that\u2019s not plausible here).\n I\u2019m sure other folks will have other ideas. But those are the big ones for me, especially the file offloading bit. Even right now, coming back from a run, I\u2019m sitting here wishing the videos from that run were already accessible to my Mac &amp; PC, rather than dealing with fiddling with the GoPro app to get them synced over to my phone (taking up space, where the GoPro app currently occupies 80GB of storage on my phone), then duplicating that content into the phone\u2019s Photos, and having my phone be preoccupied while it\u2019s doing all that.\n Of course, I probably could just write this app myself. Or, I could eat ice cream. Both are valid choices.\n  At the end of the day, I\u2019m an athlete just like you looking for the most detail possible on a new purchase.

providing a minimal environment for me to build on and play with. I hope that for others it can be a distro which provides a working environment to use alongside various texts I have in mind, allowing the reader to focus on study of the material at hand rather than trying to get their environment setup right. The idea came about through having to side step from study to investigate broken stack traces and wondering about the level of pain when having to make build changes system-wide on a distribution which doesn\u2019t provide infrastructure to rebuild at mass with ease. When I first started writing about my experiments with  LFS it was suggested that I look at several different established distributions which were the answer to what I was looking for. I was aware of these distributions already and had even used some in the distant past, however I decided not to go down this path as there was either new tooling to learn which would drive system management or components were adapted (local changes and features). I was not interested in having to detour to learn another set of tools which are non-transferable between operating systems nor making use of derivatives before setting up the system how I needed it so that I could practice what I was studying, hence Viewpoint Linux strives to be innovationless in this regard.\n Viewpoint currently lacks a framework to ease building the system hence everything has been built slowly by hand with a specific idea of how the system should be.\n  It should work out of the box for texts in mind e.g full working stack traces for instrumenting with bpftrace and debugging using GDB\n its concept of base system is a subset of the utilities installed by the LFS guide, containing general utilities for users and tools for administration. Components which are purely build dependencies are installed to a separate prefix ( /osbt (os build tools)) so that they can be removed if desired. Everything else is satisfied from user installed packages which is currently provided by pkgsrc. Dependencies can grow out of hand, for example,  dwarves has a  cmake build dependency, dwarves provides the  pahole utility which is used as a kernel build dependency to generate  BTF but it\u2019s also a useful utility for inspecting system data structures by itself. This was a grey area where I chose to include dwarves in base but to satisfy its build dependency (cmake) from external sources, in this case, the cmake project provides prebuilt binaries.\n A repository ( monorepo) of all components shipped. Not such a good idea because of fighting autotooled builds and timestamps, see  Living with CVS in Autoconfiscated Projects. But it makes tracking changes in the distro easy which is more important for me.\n It is safe to assume that I\u2019ve run configure, make, make install a bunch of times with  CFLAGS set to \u2018 -fno-omit-framepointer -g\u2018 or some variation of (such as you have to enable optimisation also for build glibc otherwise it fails).\n Viewpoint is an inovationless distro, see previous point (there are no new methods or tooling on offering, just stock components from upstream built a certain way with differing flags)\n  Mercurial for source repo (because one piece of Linusware at a time).  There is a git mirror.\n Primarily intended for use as a guest vm though it is possible to install on hardware, the distinction here is because nothing has been done to cater for differing hardware in the kernel config so manual intervention may be required to prep and get everything working e.g it booted fine on my ThinkPad x230 but I had no wifi. There is also no UEFI support currently, nor any additional firmware included.\n Development of features to 3rd party components happen outside of the tree (because it\u2019s inovationless)\n Patches from LFS have not been applied, again because inovationless e.g their provided i18n patches to coreutils which are marked as rejected by upstream. The LFS guide  states \u201cIn the past, many bugs were found in this patch. When reporting new bugs to Coreutils maintainers, please check first if they are reproducible without this patch.\u201d\n Versioning is going to be a sequencing number meaning nothing beyond an indication of a new release\n Viewpoint doesn\u2019t follow the  FHS spec strictly &amp;  LSB at all. Perl &amp; Python are not part of base (because I did not want to maintain them in base).\n Currently intended to be used alongside  Brendan Gregg\u2018s  BPF Performance Tools book and  Diomidis Spinellis\u2018  Effective Debugging book for learning two different debugging workflows. Other texts are in mind for accomodation in the future. Would liked to have included DTrace but that currently requires running a fork of the kernel. While the fork is kept up to the date with upstream, as part of being inovationless, it is easier to swap components fresh from upstream and saves on having to eliminate another avenue where an issue could have been introduced when debugging problems.\n  Source repository is currently 5.1GB (1.8GB .hg directory, 3.3GB of source), 1.8GB .hg/git conversion directory, so as you can tell, that\u2019s a lot of value add \ud83d\ude42 . On deciding whether to strip components down to the essential minimum I opted not to as running test suites is part of the LFS workflow when building things up and it would make CI integration easier. AMD Firmware included in Linux aside, the test suites from GCC and Binutils for example take up the most space in the repo.\n Lots todo to smooth things over but some key features that I intend to work on to include in a future release\n Build framework to automate the configure, make, make install routine and allow customisation with ease ala BSDs. There is a framework in LFS project called  ALFS but I didn\u2019t want to go down the literate programming route and maintain my own fork of the LFS guide (you feed it the XML source of the guide and it builds the distro from that).\n  I listened to a lot Alan Kay lectures (a nod to  Viewpoints Research,  ViewPoint OS from Xerox, though this distro is in no way a great feat in achievement)\n

Times bought 60 inches of Subway tuna sandwiches from three different Subway locations in Los Angeles.\n A reporter for the newspaper then removed and froze the tuna and sent it to an unidentified commercial food testing lab. The newspaper said it paid roughly $500 for the lab to conduct a PCR test to see if the substance had one of five different tuna species.\n  After a month, the lab said it found \u201cno amplifiable tuna DNA was present in the sample and so we obtained no amplification products from the DNA.\u201d\n  Elaborating on the results, a spokesperson for the lab told\u00a0the Times that there were two different conclusions.\n \u201cOne, it\u2019s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out, we couldn\u2019t make an identification,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cOr we got some and there\u2019s just nothing there that\u2019s tuna.\u201d\n Subway declined to comment to the Times on the lab results.\u00a0 The Hill has reached out to the company.\n The Times noted that the Food and Drug Administration identifies 15 species of nomadic saltwater fish that can be labeled \u201ctuna.\u201d\n The test comes as Subway faces a class-action lawsuit alleging that its tuna sandwich is not actually made of tuna. The suit was first filed in a California federal court in January.\n In an amended complaint\u00a0  dated June 7, the plaintiffs allege that Subway claims to sell sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna but was instead selling \u201canything less than healthy stocks.\u201d\n  Subway has been \u201cselling and continuing to sell some mixture that is deceptively and dishonestly being passed off as in line with their representations to purchasers but are not actually compliant,\u201d the suit states.\n Inside Edition did   its own test\u00a0of the tuna sandwich in February, in which it had a Florida-based lab test sandwiches from three Subway locations in New York. That test confirmed that tuna was in the sandwiches.\n Subway maintained in an email to the Times that it &#34;delivers 100 percent cooked tuna to its restaurants, which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches, wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:45:56", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c,tuna", "title": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u5730\u94c1\u7684\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c\u4e09\u660e\u6cbb\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7cDNA ", "title_en": "NY Times test finds no identifiable tuna DNA in Subway's tuna sandwich", "transed": 1, "url": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/559745-nyt-test-finds-zero-tuna-dna-in-subways-tuna-sandwich", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91d1\u67aa\u9c7c", "tuna"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "691659c56da0c02cf0d3c5eb2ca6a4a9.jpeg", "infoid": 1067639, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5b98\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u51e0\u5e74\u91cc\uff0c\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u5bf9\u5979\u7684\u751f\u547d\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u5173\u7403\u8ff7\u8d28\u7591\u6cd5\u9662\u5982\u4f55\u7ee7\u7eed\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5979\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7167\u987e\u81ea\u5df1\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5979\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u6f14\u6d41\u884c\u660e\u661f\u3002\n \u5979\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u4e0e\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u6cbb\u7684\u4eba\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u7a33\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4e\u70b9\u6551\u51fa\u4e86\u5979\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5979\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u5979\u53ef\u4ee5\u642c\u5230\u5b83\u3002\n    \u4f46\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6cd5\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u77db\uff0c39\uff0c\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5bf9\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u8868\u793a\u4e25\u91cd\u53cd\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ee5\u524d\u6240\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf4\u5b83\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5979\u65e5\u671f\u4e3a\u5979\u53a8\u623f\u989c\u8272\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u6a71\u67dc\u3002\n \u201c\u5979\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5979\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u7edf\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5979\u7684\u538b\u8feb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u201d\u57282016\u5e74\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u5979\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u7684\u6cd5\u5ead\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5199\u9053\u3002\u6839\u636e\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5bf9\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u8bf4\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u201c\u592a\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u201d\u3002 \u201c\u592a\u8fc7\u5206\u4e86\uff01\u201d\n \u77db\u901a\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\uff0c\u5979\u5e0c\u671b\u4fdd\u5b88\u515a\u5c3d\u5feb\u7ec8\u6b62\u3002 \u201c\u5979\u538c\u5026\u4e86\u88ab\u5e26\u8d70\u7684\u4f18\u52bf'\uff0c\u5979\u8bf4\u5979\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u8d5a\u94b1\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u5979\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u5355\u4f4d\u4e0a\uff0c\u201d\u8c03\u67e5\u5458\u5199\u9053\u3002\n 2019\u5e74\uff0c\u77db\u961f\u544a\u8bc9\u6cd5\u9662\uff0c\u5979\u66fe\u611f\u5230\u8feb\u4f7f\u4fdd\u62a4\u8005\u9677\u5165\u5fc3\u7406\u536b\u751f\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdd\u80cc\u5979\u7684\u610f\u5fd7\u3002\n \u5728\u6b4c\u624b\u7684\u638c\u8235\u5904\uff0c\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u662f\u5979\u66fe\u7ecf\u662f\u5979\u66fe\u7ecf\u758f\u8fdc\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u5f6d\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u3002\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u6770\u7c73\u7684\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u4e8e2008\u5e74\u88ab\u4efb\u547d\u4e3a\u4fdd\u5b88\u515a\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u516c\u5171\u6597\u4e89\u548c\u6697\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u540d\u516c\u5171\u6597\u4e89\u548c\u8650\u5f85\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u77db\u5728\u4e24\u53ea\u4e0d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u88ab\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u4e24\u540d\u4e0d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u7cbe\u795e\u75c5\u60a3\u8005\u3002 \n\u65b0\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u77db\u5df2\u547c\u5401\u63d0\u95ee\u4ed6\u5bf9\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u3002\u65e9\u57282014\u5e74\uff0c\u5728\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a\u4e0a\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u516c\u4f17\uff0c\u77db\u961f\u4efb\u547d\u7684\u5f8b\u5e08\u585e\u7f2a\u5c14D.

", "note_en": "In the years since a judge gave the father of Britney Spears broad control over her life and finances, concerned fans have questioned how the court could continue to deem her unable to protect and care for herself despite the fact that she was still a performing pop star.\n Her father and others involved in the conservatorship maintained that it was a smooth-running machine that had rescued her from a low point and benefited Spears, and that she could move to end it whenever she wanted.\n    But now, confidential court records obtained by The New York Times reveal that Spears, 39, expressed serious opposition to the conservatorship earlier and more often than had previously been known, and said that it restricted everything from whom she dated to the color of her kitchen cabinets.\n \u201cShe articulated she feels the conservatorship has become an oppressive and controlling tool against her,\u201d a court investigator assigned to her case wrote in a 2016 report. The system had \u201ctoo much control,\u201d Spears said, according to the investigator\u2019s account of the conversation. \u201cToo, too much!\u201d\n Spears informed the investigator that she wanted the conservatorship terminated as soon as possible. \u201cShe is \u2018sick of being taken advantage of\u2019 and she said she is the one working and earning her money but everyone around her is on her payroll,\u201d the investigator wrote.\n In 2019, Spears told the court that she had felt forced by the conservatorship into a stay at a mental health facility and to perform against her will.\n At the helm of the singer\u2019s life and finances for most of that time was her once-estranged father, James P. Spears. James Spears, known as Jamie, was appointed conservator in 2008, shortly after Spears was placed in two involuntary psychiatric holds amid a series of public struggles and concerns around her mental health and substance abuse.\n  The newly obtained court records show that Spears has called into question his fitness for the role. As early as 2014, in a hearing closed to the public, Spears\u2019 court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, said his client wanted to explore the removal of her father as conservator, citing his drinking, among other objections she had raised in what he called a \u201cshopping list\u201d of grievances.\n Last year, Ingham brought these issues to the fore, telling the judge that Spears was \u201cafraid of her father,\u201d who remains a steward of her nearly $60 million fortune.\n On Wednesday, Spears is scheduled to address the Los Angeles court directly \u2014 a rare move she requested on an expedited basis. It is unclear whether her remarks will be made in public, but her relationship with her father is expected to be a central topic.\n Representatives for Jamie Spears, 68, declined to comment, citing the pending court hearing. But they have previously said the conservatorship was necessary to protect Spears from exploitation and harm and that Jamie Spears has been a dutiful father, acting out of love for his daughter.\n \u201cAny time Britney wants to end her conservatorship, she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it; she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,\u201d Vivian Lee Thoreen, a lawyer for Jamie Spears, said in a statement to People earlier this year. \u201cBritney knows that her Daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been \u2014 conservatorship or not.\u201d\n Theirs has long been a difficult and dysfunctional relationship, according to the court records and interviews with many people who know the family. But that dynamic grew even more complicated after Jamie Spears \u2014 a recovering alcoholic who has faced accusations of physical and verbal abuse \u2014 took the lead in wrestling what he saw as his adult daughter\u2019s demons.\n Spears said her father was \u201cobsessed\u201d with her in the sense that he wanted to control everything about her, according to the investigator\u2019s report. She could not make friends without his approval.\n Even as she earned millions from a successful Las Vegas residency, she said she was limited to a $2,000 weekly allowance, according to the records.\n Any mistakes resulted in \u201cvery harsh\u201d consequences, Spears added, according to the report. The conservatorship \u201ccomes with a lot of fear,\u201d she said.\n After consulting with Spears, her conservators and her doctors, the probate investigator concluded in 2016 that the conservatorship remained in Spears\u2019 best interests based on her complex finances, susceptibility to undue influence and \u201cintermittent\u201d drug issues, though the report called for \u201ca pathway to independence and the eventual termination of the conservatorship.\u201d\n The records provide only an incomplete snapshot of Spears\u2019 sentiments and situation throughout a 13-year saga. Still, they present in great detail her discontent with the arrangement, in particular her concerns that her views about her father and his own behaviors were not being appropriately considered.\n Experts say conservatorships should prioritize the wishes of the conservatee and help them regain their independence. The arrangements are supposed to be a last resort for people who cannot take care of their basic needs, such as those with significant disabilities or older people with dementia, yet Spears has been able to perform and profit for more than a decade.\n  What the court records make clear is that the battle over the conservatorship is rooted in the family\u2019s troubled history.\n Debbie Sanders Cross, Jamie Spears\u2019 first wife, who remains his friend, said his own \u201cvery difficult upbringing\u201d had influenced his perspective. \u201cI really think that\u2019s why he\u2019s trying to be so protective of Britney,\u201d she said.\n Jamie Spears had spent much of his life in Kentwood, a tiny Louisiana town where he was a star quarterback. His father, a boilermaker, was strict and demanding. \u201cHis daddy was so hard on him, but Jamie loved him and respected him,\u201d Jamie Spears\u2019 former football coach, Elton Shaw, recalled.\n Jamie Spears\u2019 youth was marked by tragedy: His mother died by suicide on the grave of her infant son when Jamie Spears was 13, according to the local paper. Jamie Spears survived a car accident that killed a football teammate four years later. At 22, he was arrested on drug and driving while intoxicated charges, according to a news report.\n When Lynne Spears, his second wife and Britney\u2019s mother, filed for divorce in 1980, she requested a temporary restraining order, citing a fear that he would \u201cbecome angry when he is served with these papers\u201d and harass or harm her, \u201cespecially if he has been drinking alcoholic beverages, as he has done in the past.\u201d\n The couple reconciled, but Jamie Spears\u2019 instability haunted Spears\u2019 childhood, the family has said. In her 2008 memoir, Lynne Spears recalled years of \u201cverbal abuse, abandonment\u201d and \u201cerratic behavior.\u201d\n The family struggled financially, and in 1998, just months before the release of Spears\u2019 blockbuster first album, the Spearses filed for bankruptcy. The couple divorced in 2002. Spears said later that it was the \u201cbest thing that ever happened to our family.\u201d\n Jamie Spears was present only intermittently during his daughter\u2019s rise to pop stardom. In 2004, according to a court filing, he went to rehab for alcoholism at the urging of his daughter.\n But by 2007, Spears was struggling herself. Humiliation by the press, stalking by the paparazzi, speculation around her mental health and substance abuse and a custody battle over her two young sons helped lead Spears to a breaking point.\n Jamie Spears reappeared for what he and his ex-wife, Lynne Spears, viewed as an urgent rescue mission.\n Along with his business manager, Louise M. Taylor, he prayed and fasted before he petitioned a judge for a temporary conservatorship of Spears, Lynne Spears wrote in her memoir. Taylor later became a business manager of Spears\u2019 estate and an architect of her comeback.\n The singer stressed that she did not want her father in charge, a lawyer she consulted at the time has said. But the judge overseeing the case, Reva Goetz, deemed Spears incapable of hiring her own counsel and appointed Ingham, the lawyer who represents her to this day.\n In February 2008, according to court records, Goetz deemed Jamie Spears \u201ca suitable and qualified person\u201d and granted him broad control over his daughter\u2019s daily life and, alongside a co-conservator, her finances.\n \u201cEverything he does, he feels is in the best interest of his daughters and his family,\u201d said Mitch Covington, a friend of Jamie Spears\u2019.\n Spears quickly went back to work. Within a year of being deemed unable to care for herself, she guest-starred on national television, released a No. 1 album and was preparing to embark on a run of almost 100 shows around the world.\n Aside from his salary as conservator \u2014 now about $16,000 per month, plus $2,000 a month for office space rent \u2014 Jamie Spears was approved by the court to receive a percentage of various deals signed for his daughter.\n In 2011, he received a 2.95% commission for his work on Spears\u2019 successful Femme Fatale tour. And in 2014, he was granted 1.5% of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to her Las Vegas residency, \u201cPiece of Me,\u201d which went on to earn a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows.\n The dual role of looking out for Spears\u2019 best interests as conservator and reaping more profits each time she performed was \u201cfraught with conflict,\u201d according to W. Michael Hensley, a probate lawyer in California who works as a fee examination expert and is not involved in the Spears case.\n  Court records reveal Spears\u2019 concerns that her father was hardly the person to be setting, and enforcing, the rules that governed her life.\n Spears\u2019 first tour under the conservatorship, The Circus Starring Britney Spears, was designed to be a dry one, with cast and crew forbidden from drinking alcohol \u2014 or even energy drinks \u2014 around Spears, according to three people who worked on it.\n During this period, a former nanny and housekeeper for Spears claimed Jamie Spears engaged in \u201cverbal abuse, tirades, inappropriate behavior and alcoholic relapses,\u201d according to a legal letter sent in 2010 that threatened a lawsuit.\n In 2014, Ingham told the court that Spears believed her father was drinking, according to a transcript of the closed hearing. Lawyers representing the conservatorship responded that Jamie Spears had voluntarily submitted to regularly scheduled alcohol tests and never failed. Jamie Spears\u2019 lawyer said he took one random test, but refused to take any more, calling the request inappropriate.\n \u201cAbsolutely inappropriate,\u201d the judge replied. \u201cAnd who is she to be demanding that of anybody?\u201d\n Ingham told the court that his client was upset that it was not taking her concerns seriously. \u201cShe said to me, when she gave me this shopping list, that she anticipates that, as it has been done before, the court will simply sweep it under the carpet and ignore any negative inferences with regard to Mr. Spears,\u201d Ingham said, according to a transcript.\n Ingham also raised Spears\u2019 urgent desire to terminate the conservatorship altogether. She had even mentioned the possibility of changing her lifestyle and retiring, but believed the conservatorship precluded that, he said, according to a transcript.\n In response to Spears\u2019 request to end the arrangement, the judge said that if she established a healthy relationship with a therapist and returned one year\u2019s worth of clean drug tests, she would take the matter under consideration. But she would not guarantee it.\n Those gathered, including the judge and lawyers on both sides, raised the possibility that Spears\u2019 boyfriend was provoking her discontent.\n  In 2016, Spears released her ninth studio album and performed more than 50 times in Las Vegas. But in private, she was again protesting the conservatorship, according to a report written by a probate investigator. (In California conservatorships, a court investigator is tasked with conducting periodic reviews for the judge.)\n Spears told the investigator that she was \u201cvery angry\u201d about the way her life was being run, and described security around her at all times. She was also being tested for drugs numerous times weekly, and her credit card was held by her security team or assistant and used at their discretion, the report said.\n Spears wanted to make cosmetic changes to her home, like re-staining her kitchen cabinets, she told the investigator, but was forbidden by her father, who told her too much money was being spent.\n The public image of Spears\u2019 life gave little sense of the turmoil she was expressing privately. An Instagram feed presented her as playfully approachable, and a new, lucrative Las Vegas show was set to begin in February 2019.\n Then, a month before the opening, Spears announced an \u201cindefinite work hiatus,\u201d canceling the residency. Jamie Spears had \u201calmost died\u201d after suffering a ruptured colon, according to a statement, which noted the pair\u2019s \u201cvery special relationship.\u201d\n That spring, Spears appeared at a closed-door hearing and read a statement. According to a transcript, she asserted that she had been forced into a mental health facility against her will on exaggerated grounds, which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself and making an objection during a rehearsal.\n She also claimed she had been forced to perform while sick with a 104-degree fever, calling it one of the scariest moments of her life.\n Spears ran down a list of her recent accomplishments, including tours and album releases. She told those present there was nothing wrong with her.\n A transcript of the hearing was mistakenly unsealed, and portions were first reported by TMZ.\n That summer brought further tumult. In August, there was an alleged physical altercation between Jamie Spears and Spears\u2019 13-year-old son. No charges were filed in the incident, but the child\u2019s father, Kevin Federline, was granted a restraining order barring Jamie Spears from seeing the children.\n Two weeks later, Jamie Spears, citing health problems, temporarily stepped down from his position as conservator of Spears\u2019 person and was replaced by a licensed professional. He remained in control of Spears\u2019 money.\n By September 2020, a flurry of courtroom activity indicated publicly that something had shifted. Ingham filed court papers saying that Spears \u201cis vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret.\u201d\n Ingham then filed complaints about the ways Jamie Spears managed the singer\u2019s money, asserting that he paid excessive fees of over $300,000 to the firm of her then-business manager, Taylor. (In court, a lawyer for Jamie Spears called the fees reasonable.)\n As the fight drags on, the bills are piling up \u2014 and, in a quirk of the conservatorship system, Spears has to pay for lawyers on both sides, including those arguing against her wishes in court. A recent $890,000 bill from one set of Jamie Spears\u2019 lawyers, covering about four months of work, included media strategizing for defending the conservatorship.\n At a public court hearing in November, Spears\u2019 mother moved to support the removal of Jamie Spears as conservator. Through a lawyer, she called the father-daughter relationship \u201ctoxic\u201d and said it was \u201ctime to start fresh,\u201d adding that Jamie Spears had referred to his daughter as \u201ca racehorse who has to be handled like one.\u201d\n That day, Judge Brenda Penny, who had replaced Goetz on the case, declined a request from Ingham to suspend Jamie Spears immediately, but left the door open to consider removing him in the future. Penny approved a wealth management firm to serve as co-conservator of the estate alongside Jamie Spears.\n  Jamie Spears has recently been back home in Kentwood, where he is known to host crawfish boils and stop by the town\u2019s Veterans of Foreign Wars bar. But he mostly keeps to himself. \u201cHe is just the same old Jamie,\u201d his former football coach, Shaw, said.\n Jamie Spears recently sold the house Spears grew up in. He has been staying down a winding country road on the outskirts of town, in a recreational vehicle parked at a warehouse that has stored the boxed-up relics of his daughter\u2019s megawatt career.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 13:45:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7ed3\u675f,spears,\u5f8b\u5e08", "title": "\u5e03\u5170\u59ae\u65af\u76ae\u5c14\u65af\u6084\u7136\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u7ed3\u675f\u5979\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u7edf\u4e00\u4f53 ", "title_en": "Britney Spears Quietly Pushed for Years to End Her Conservatorship", "transed": 1, "url": "https://news.yahoo.com/britney-spears-quietly-pushed-years-190423835.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7ed3\u675f", "spears", "\u5f8b\u5e08"]}]
