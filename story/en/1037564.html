The COVID-19 pandemic has only added to public fears about surveillance and data sharing. As tech tools are being used to track who&#39;s infected with the virus and who they&#39;ve come in contact with, local government officials are facing a crucial question: Who gets to know?</p><p>对于任何现代化城市的市长来说，工作中越来越大的一部分需要管理公众对在这些城市中部署的新技术的强烈反对。 COVID-19大流行只会增加公众对监视和数据共享的担忧。随着技术工具被用来跟踪谁感染了该病毒以及与谁接触过，地方政府官员面临着一个关键问题：谁知道？</p><p>  For this year&#39;s virtual Web Summit, Protocol spoke with Mayor Sadiq Khan of London, Mayor John Tory of Toronto and Mayor Fernando Medina of Lisbon about how they&#39;re adopting new technologies in their cities — from the London police&#39;s new real-time facial recognition pilot to Toronto&#39;s failed smart city partnership with Alphabet&#39;s Sidewalk Labs — and what new challenges COVID-19 poses. The mayors discussed how they&#39;re grappling with public expectations and trying to fend off tech&#39;s many unintended consequences.</p><p>  在今年的虚拟Web峰会上，Protocol与伦敦市长Sadiq Khan，多伦多市长John Tory和里斯本市市长Fernando Medina进行了交谈，探讨了他们如何在其城市中采用新技术-来自伦敦警察局。 39岁的新的实时面部识别飞行员参加了与Alphabet的人行道实验室失败的多伦多智能城市合作伙伴关系-以及COVID-19面临的新挑战。市长讨论了他们如何应对公众的期望并试图抵制技术带来的许多意想不到的后果。</p><p>   This summer, the city of London announced a new emerging technology charter that is going to dictate standards and protocols around how new technologies get introduced in the city. I think that&#39;s an interesting framework that other cities could learn from. What spurred that idea and how do you hope that charter will be applied?</p><p>   今年夏天，伦敦市宣布了一项新的新兴技术宪章，该宪章将就围绕如何引入新技术的城市规定标准和协议。我认为这是其他城市可以借鉴的有趣框架。是什么激发了这个想法，您希望如何应用宪章？</p><p> London Mayor Sadiq Khan: One of the things that we know is for good reasons or bad, some members of the public are a bit nervous, cynical, scared, frightened about some of the downsides of technology. And what we&#39;re trying to do is give Londoners and others confidence about emerging technologies, but also to give advance notice to those in this area about what our expectations are.</p><p> 伦敦市长萨迪克·汗（Sadiq Khan）：我们知道的一件事是有好有坏的，一些公众对技术的某些弊端有些紧张，愤世嫉俗，害怕和害怕。我们正在努力做的是使伦敦人和其他人对新兴技术充满信心，同时也要提前通知该领域的人们我们的期望是什么。</p><p> We use technology in lots of ways in our city. We, for example, have data that looks at people&#39;s journey patterns that&#39;s anonymized. We know which stations and undergrounds are busy. We know, for example, that there is a new emerging technology around facial recognition that can be used for crime-fighting tools. We also have the National Health Service and other health services across the world looking at how they use health data. So what my Chief Digital Officer Theo Blackwell has been doing is working with colleagues on our Smart board on what would be a tech charter that would be transparent and that would give the public confidence about addressing the concerns they&#39;ve got. The reality is: The genie&#39;s out of the bottle. When it comes to some amazing technology, some disruptive technologies, what we want to do is to make sure in the absence of national regulation, we have clear rules of the game. And the Emerging Tech Charter is one example of London leading the way in this new area.</p><p> 我们在城市中以多种方式使用技术。例如，我们拥有的数据可以查看匿名的人的出行方式。我们知道哪些车站和地下车站很忙。例如，我们知道，围绕面部识别的新兴技术可以用于打击犯罪的工具。我们还在世界各地设有国家卫生服务局（National Health Service）和其他卫生服务机构，以研究他们如何使用卫生数据。因此，我的首席数字官西奥·布莱克韦尔（Theo Blackwell）一直在与我们的Smart Board上的同事合作，这将是一个透明的技术章程，这将使公众对解决他们所担心的问题充满信心。现实是：精灵从瓶子里出来了。当涉及到一些惊人的技术，一些破坏性技术时，我们要做的就是确保在没有国家法规的情况下，我们拥有明确的游戏规则。新兴技术宪章就是伦敦引领这一新领域的一个例子。</p><p>  How much input will Londoners have in how those emerging technologies get deployed in their city under this charter?</p><p>  在此宪章下，伦敦人将对这些新兴技术如何在其城市中使用有多少投入？</p><p> Khan: We&#39;ll do lots of work listening to Londoners, talking to experts, talking to those in the private sector, innovators, about what they&#39;re planning and what Londoners expect. I&#39;ll give you one example: During this pandemic, the government wanted to introduce an app on people&#39;s phone to track and trace. If you are in close proximity to somebody who may have the virus, or has been in contact with somebody who&#39;s had the virus in the last 14 days, your phone will let you know about that. There was a big concern, though, about who would have that data, who would own that data, and concern about &#34;Big Brother.&#34; By talking to and listening to Londoners and others across the country, what the government agreed to do is to make sure there&#39;s no central ownership of the data. The data&#39;s being pinged from people to people, rather than people to the government. And so it really is a good example of us engaging with and listening to Londoners.</p><p> 汗：我们会做很多工作，听听伦敦人的声音，与专家交谈，与私营部门的人，创新者讨论他们的计划和伦敦人的期望。我举一个例子：在这种大流行期间，政府希望在人们的手机上引入一个应用程序来进行跟踪。如果您与可能感染该病毒的人非常接近，或者在过去14天内一直与感染该病毒的人保持联系，则您的电话会告知您。但是，对于谁将拥有这些数据，谁将拥有这些数据以及对＆＃34; Big Brother的担忧，引起了很大的关注。通过与伦敦人和全国其他地方居民进行交谈和倾听，政府同意要做的就是确保数据没有中央所有权。数据从人到人，而不是从人到政府。因此，这确实是我们与伦敦人互动和倾听的一个很好的例子。 </p><p> You brought up facial recognition in your first answer. Facial recognition is something that a lot of privacy advocates are concerned about, and research has shown that there are discrepancies between how facial recognition tools detect faces of people of different ethnicities, different races. I know you have expressed concern, yourself, about facial recognition technology in the past. But this year, the Metropolitan Police did begin rolling out the live use of facial recognition technology to catch criminal suspects in London. So I&#39;m interested to hear a little bit more from you about how this particular application of that technology addressed your personal concerns, addressed the public concerns and how you guys will be vetting it long term.</p><p>您在第一个答案中提到了面部识别。面部识别是许多隐私权倡导者所关注的问题，研究表明，面部识别工具如何检测不同种族，不同种族的人的面部之间存在差异。我知道您自己曾经对面部识别技术表示关注。但是今年，大都会警察确实开始推出面部识别技术，以在伦敦抓获犯罪嫌疑人。因此，我很想听听您更多有关该技术的特殊应用如何解决您的个人问题，解决公众问题以及你们将如何长期对其进行审核的信息。</p><p>  Khan: Aside from the fact that I used to be a human rights lawyer, I&#39;m a big fan of Tom Cruise&#39;s &#34;Minority Report.&#34; On the one hand, I want the police service to evolve and find new ways of detecting and fighting crime, just like criminals evolve and find new ways to commit crime. But we&#39;ve got to make sure that technology that isn&#39;t foolproof has proper checks and balances.</p><p>  汗：除了我曾经是一名人权律师外，我还是汤姆·克鲁斯《少数派报告》的忠实拥护者。一方面，我希望警察部门能够发展并找到侦查和打击犯罪的新方法，就像罪犯正在发展并找到实施犯罪的新方法一样。但是我们必须确保并非万无一失的技术具有适当的制衡能力。</p><p> What the police service has been doing in the absence of national legislation is piloting the use of facial recognition when it comes to big crowds where they know somebody is &#34;wanted.&#34; Skilled trackers can be aided by the use of facial recognition. What&#39;s clear to us is there are some false positives in relation to using the facial recognition technology by itself. So we aren&#39;t relying just on that. It&#39;s a combination of human beings checking against the technology.</p><p> 在没有国家立法的情况下，警察部门一直在试行使用面部识别技术，以应对那些知道有人想要的大人群。熟练的跟踪器可以通过使用面部识别来辅助。对我们清楚的是，与单独使用面部识别技术有关，存在一些误报。因此，我们不仅仅依赖于此。它是人类检验技术的结合。</p><p>  We&#39;ve seen in London, and across the U.K., a massive increase in the last 20 to 30 years of closed-circuit TV that we call CCTV. And the challenge is using the new technologies in a way that reassures the public and also deals with concerns they&#39;ve got about ownership, about false positives, about inadvertently discriminating against people who are Black. There&#39;s a big concern about technology and people&#39;s skin color in relation to false positives. So it&#39;s really important that we give the public confidence before this technology is rolled out even more. That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to test these pilots before there are mass rollouts.</p><p>  我们已经在伦敦以及整个英国看到了闭路电视在过去20到30年中的巨大增长，我们称之为CCTV。挑战在于使用新技术的方式可以使公众放心，并解决他们对所有权，假阳性，无意歧视黑人的担忧。与假阳性相关的技术和人们的肤色备受关注。因此，在进一步推广这项技术之前，让公众充满信心是非常重要的。这就是为什么在大规模部署之前测试这些飞行员​​很重要的原因。</p><p> Mayor Tory, Toronto undertook maybe the boldest experiment that we&#39;ve seen in trying to deploy smart city technology in your city through your partnership with Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet. Earlier this year, Sidewalk Labs pulled out of that project. They cited complications due to the pandemic. This is a project that had gotten international attention and tons of public scrutiny. So I&#39;m wondering if you can talk a little bit about the lessons you learned from your partnership with the Sidewalk Labs?</p><p> 多伦多市市长托里市进行了也许是我们尝试过的最大胆的实验，目的是通过与Alphabet的子公司Sidewalk Labs合作，在您的城市中部署智能城市技术。今年早些时候，Sidewalk Labs退出了该项目。他们列举了由于大流行引起的并发症。这是一个引起国际关注和公众审查的项目。因此，我想知道您是否可以谈谈与Sidewalk Labs合作所学到的教训？</p><p> Toronto Mayor John Tory: I should say, first of all, that [project] didn&#39;t go forward because of an inability to reach a business deal. Everybody had their own reason, and it was all very polite, and so on, and Sidewalk and Google still have a very substantial presence employing thousands of people here. But that deal didn&#39;t proceed in the end because we couldn&#39;t reach terms of a business deal.</p><p> 多伦多市长约翰·托里（John Tory）：首先，我应该说，[项目]没有进展是因为无法达成商业交易。每个人都有自己的理由，这都是非常有礼貌的，依此类推，Sidewalk和Google仍然有相当大的影响力，雇用了数千名员工。但这笔交易最终没有进行，因为我们无法达成一项商业交易的条款。</p><p>  But I will say we made a huge amount of progress because the one thing I think we had more or less put to bed was the question of data, which was a huge concern for people. Because there is this kind of fear with respect to outside multinational companies collecting data. Without boring you with all the details, we had basically designed a mechanism whereby that data would all go into a public trust. And there would be trustees there who would decide on and safeguard on the use of the data, so that any fear that existed — for example, that a multinational company would exploit or transfer it to other people — was going to be put to rest. Interestingly enough, while the business deal didn&#39;t go forward, it gave us a model that I think had a lot of public confidence that we will be able to use going forward with respect to future dealings of that kind. And I think it has made the public more comfortable with the fact that we can do these kinds of deals.</p><p>  但是我会说我们取得了巨大的进步，因为我认为我们或多或少地搁浅的一件事是数据问题，这是人们非常关心的问题。因为对于外部跨国公司收集数据有这种担心。在不让您烦恼所有细节的情况下，我们基本上设计了一种机制，使数据全部进入公众信任。那里将有受托人来决定和保护数据的使用，以使存在的任何恐惧（例如，一家跨国公司将其利用或转让给他人）都将得到解决。有趣的是，虽然交易没有进展，但它为我们提供了一个模型，我认为该模型具有很多公众信心，我们可以在未来的此类交易中继续使用。我认为这使公众对我们可以进行此类交易的事实更加满意。 </p><p> And that piece of land [that Sidewalk Labs was going to develop], by the way, is still there. And we&#39;re about to have a new [request for proposals] to get somebody new to develop it. So the good news when a land deal goes away is that the land is still there. We regret the fact that that deal didn&#39;t happen. But we learned from it on the data side.</p><p>顺便说一下，这块土地（Sidewalk Labs将要开发）仍然存在。而且我们即将有一个新的[提案请求]，以吸引新的人来开发它。因此，当土地交易消失时，好消息是土地仍在那儿。对于该交易没有发生，我们感到遗憾。但是我们从数据方面学到了东西。</p><p>  I know a big concern in Toronto was this Silicon Valley company coming in with all of its swagger, and its big promises and then pulling out just as easily. Did you feel like this was a company leaving the city high and dry? And if you could do it over, what would you do differently?</p><p>  我知道在多伦多存在的一个最大问题是，这家硅谷公司大张旗鼓地加入进来，并寄予厚望，然后又轻易退出。您是否觉得这是一家离开城市干and的公司？如果您可以解决问题，您会做些什么？</p><p> Tory: By the time we got going on [creating] the public trust for the data, it had built up into such a huge controversy that you had people that had convinced themselves no good could come from this. I would go slower in the sense that — and this is a lot of what Mayor Khan was talking about, too — you&#39;ve got to have the public confidence when you use new technology, whether it&#39;s in policing, or whether it&#39;s in development of a new neighborhood like this. You&#39;ve got to have the public&#39;s confidence in terms of what&#39;s going to be done with the data: How intrusive is this technology going to be in this data collection in their lives? And in this case, we were trying to fix that after the debate had broken out, as opposed to having that all in place.</p><p> 托里（Tory）：当我们继续[建立]公众对数据的信任时，它已经引起了巨大的争议，以至于有些人已经说服自己没有好处。从某种意义上讲，我会走得更慢-这也是汗市长谈论的话题-使用新技术时，无论是在警务方面，您都必须具有公众的信心，或者是否正在开发像这样的新社区。您必须对数据的处理方式拥有公众的信心：这项技术在他们的生活中将如何侵入数据收集中？在这种情况下，我们试图在辩论结束后解决这一问题，而不是全部解决。</p><p> I&#39;m being very honest in saying that I think the announcement was rushed. When the announcement was rushed, all these t&#39;s weren&#39;t crossed, and the i&#39;s weren&#39;t dotted on things like a public trust for the data, which somebody would have thought of, as we did. But by then, you know, the negative momentum built up. Sometimes the negative momentum becomes difficult to deal with.</p><p> 我很老实地说，我认为公告很紧急。公告发布时，所有这些都没有被删除，也没有出现在公众对数据的信任之类的东西上，有人会想到，和我们一样。但是到那时，负面势头逐渐增强。有时，负面势头变得难以应对。</p><p>  But the notion that we&#39;re gonna get away without private public partnerships, including with the nonprofit sector? I mean, government knows how to do certain things very well. But the expertise and the ingenuity and the money, quite frankly, often rests outside of government. And well it should. And the notion that we&#39;re going to sort of do all the things we have to do in the public domain without the help of partnership with the private and nonprofit sector is just not happening. So we&#39;ve got to find ways to make sure we maintain public confidence when we form those partnerships. And that means careful consultation as Mayor Khan referred to.</p><p>  但是，如果没有私人公共合作伙伴关系，包括与非营利部门的合作，我们会摆脱困境的想法吗？我的意思是，政府知道如何做好某些事情。但是，坦率地说，专业知识，创造力和金钱常常落在政府之外。而且应该。而且，没有与私有和非营利部门建立伙伴关系的帮助，我们将在公共领域中做所有事情的想法是没有发生的。因此，我们必须找到方法，以确保在建立这些合作伙伴关系时保持公众的信心。就像汗市长提到的那样，这意味着要认真咨询。</p><p> Toronto is also using data as part of its Equity Action Plan to address COVID-19. Can you talk a little bit about how data is factoring into that?</p><p> 多伦多还在其股权行动计划中使用数据来解决COVID-19。您能否谈谈数据是如何影响因素的？</p><p> Tory: The provincial government said they weren&#39;t going to collect data based on demographic characteristics. And we said from the beginning, we were, because we knew this was going to be a treasure trove of information for us to try to not only deal with the virus, but address some of the root causes. The virus has hit harder in lower-income neighborhoods that tend to disproportionately have racialized communities in them, and so on. And so by having all the data that showed that was absolutely the truth — and I&#39;m not proud of that, it&#39;s just a fact — it allowed us to target our resources and to say we were targeting our resources to fight the virus. It gave us great guideposts as to where we should do it and with whom, but it also allowed the rest of the population to understand why we were doing that. We were able to achieve some goals that we had in terms of trying to produce equity for those neighborhoods to begin with. But also it was going to be more effective in our fighting of the virus.</p><p> 托里（Tory）：省政府表示，他们不会根据人口统计学特征来收集数据。我们从一开始就说我们是，因为我们知道这将成为信息的宝库，我们不仅可以尝试应对病毒，而且可以解决某些根本原因。该病毒在低收入社区遭受重创，这些社区往往不成比例地拥有种族化社区，依此类推。因此，通过拥有所有表明绝对是事实的数据-我并不为此感到自豪，这只是事实-它使我们能够定位我们的资源，并说我们定位了我们的资源对抗病毒。它为我们提供了指导，指明了我们应该在哪里以及与谁一起做，但同时也使其他人群可以理解为什么要这样做。我们能够实现一些目标，从而为这些社区起初创造公平。但这也将在我们对抗病毒方面更加有效。 </p><p>  Mayor Medina, there was a lot of hype at the beginning of this pandemic about the role that technology was going to play in helping fight the virus, whether it&#39;s with contact tracing apps or data analysis to better deploy resources, as Mayor Tory mentioned. I know you&#39;re experiencing a resurgence now. In your experience, what is working in terms of technology&#39;s role in all of this? And what is not? What were the over-promises?</p><p>市长麦迪纳（Medina），在这场大流行初期，人们大肆宣传技术将在帮助抵抗病毒方面发挥作用，无论是通过联系人跟踪应用程序还是通过数据分析来更好地部署资源，提到保守党。我知道您现在正在复兴。根据您的经验，在所有这些方面，技术在起作用吗？那不是什么？有什么过分的承诺？</p><p> Lisbon Mayor Fernando Medina: We are using a lot of data now that we were not using some months ago. For instance, I have, in my cell phone, a geo-referential map about every new infection that happens in the city. It&#39;s an amazing technology that was developed for this pandemic. We mobilized mobile teams — physicians or social services — just to see if people are OK, if they need anything to be confined and [told them] to stay at home. It was very important when the crisis hit — for instance, more poor areas — it was very useful to have those teams that went to their houses and asked the person: Do you need any pocket money to sustain these days confined?</p><p> 里斯本市长Fernando Medina：几个月前我们并未使用很多数据。例如，我的手机上有关于城市中每一次新感染的地理参考地图。这是为这种流行病开发的惊人技术。我们动员了流动团队-医生或社会服务人员-只是为了看看人们是否还好，是否需要约束他们并告诉他们留在家里。当危机袭来时（例如，更多的贫困地区），这一点非常重要，让那些团队去他们家问问这个人是非常有用的：您是否需要零用钱来维持这些日子？</p><p>  But the big issue was not a question about technology in itself. It was the question of: Are we institutionally organized to give the public safeguards so that only the right people had the right access to information? And there was a strong debate inside national authorities and local authorities. How do we use this information? How do we share it? And it was difficult.</p><p>  但是最大的问题不是技术本身的问题。问题是：我们是否在体制上进行组织以提供公共保障，以便只有合适的人才有权获得信息？国家主管部门和地方主管部门之间进行了激烈的辩论。我们如何使用这些信息？我们如何共享它？这很困难。</p><p> The system that we designed was that only physicians and nurses had the addresses of people and individual information about the person. The city can have access to some information. So we know the neighborhood, but the private information is in the hands of the physician only. These institutional arrangements — how we deal with information and protect information from each other — was probably the most difficult thing, it was not having the technology. A lot of companies were very quick on developing solutions. But finding these arrangements of institutional protection was the most difficult part to tackle.</p><p> 我们设计的系统是只有医生和护士才能获得人员地址和有关人员的个人信息。该城市可以访问一些信息。因此，我们知道邻居，但是私人信息仅在医生手中。这些制度安排（我们如何处理信息并保护彼此之间的信息）可能是最困难的事情，因为它没有技术。许多公司在开发解决方案方面非常快。但是找到这些制度保护安排是最难解决的部分。</p><p> You also announced a plan, related to what you&#39;ve seen in the decline of tourism, to turn a lot of these Airbnb-style rentals in Lisbon into affordable housing for frontline workers. What kind of pushback or response have you gotten from Airbnb and these other companies that I imagine very much do not want to be pushed out?</p><p> 您还宣布了一项计划，该计划与您在旅游业衰退中看到的情况有关，可将里斯本的这些Airbnb风格的租金中的许多变成一线工人的经济适用房。您对Airbnb以及我想象中的其他许多公司不希望被推出的情况有何回馈或回应？</p><p>  Medina: We had, before the pandemic, and we still have, and we are going to have after the pandemic, a very big problem with affordable housing for the middle class and young people. In the beginning of the crisis, we had 20,000 to 25,000 apartments that were in the Airbnb system. This raised dramatically in the last five years. We are trying to solve this problem structurally. We are building thousands of new houses of affordable housing. But building takes time. So what we saw in the crisis was that we had an opportunity. We decided to launch a program where we go to the owners who have their houses on Airbnb, and we rent those houses and then we sub-rent those houses to young people and the middle class for a price that is lower than what we rent. The maximum they will pay is one-third of their net income per month.</p><p>  麦地那：在大流行之前，我们曾经有过，现在仍然，而且在大流行之后，我们将会有一个很大的问题，那就是为中产阶级和年轻人提供经济适用房。危机开始时，我们有20,000至25,000套位于Airbnb系统中的公寓。在过去的五年中，这一数字急剧上升。我们正在尝试从结构上解决这个问题。我们正在建造数千套经济适用房。但是建设需要时间。因此，我们在危机中看到的是我们有机会。我们决定启动一项计划，向在Airbnb上拥有房屋的业主提供服务，然后出租这些房屋，然后以低于我们所租价格的价格将这些房屋分租给年轻人和中产阶级。他们将支付的最高金额是他们每月净收入的三分之一。</p><p> For the first time in many years, we have thousands of houses that were available, they were completely operational, they were up to date, they had furniture. We have 300 apartments that we started with in July. And now we are on the second phase of the program, which will stay open during next year. Each month we&#39;re putting more houses in our program.</p><p> 多年来，我们有成千上万的房屋可供首次使用，它们已经完全投入使用，它们已经过时，还拥有家具。我们从7月开始拥有300套公寓。现在我们处于计划的第二阶段，该阶段将在明年开放。每个月我们都会在我们的计划中放置更多房屋。 </p><p>   Medina: At the moment, no. I think they are occupied dealing with losses all around the world. Our biggest difficulty is the owners that think this pandemic is short term. They think that soon they are going to return to profitability. I don&#39;t think they are right, I think we will take some time to recover.
