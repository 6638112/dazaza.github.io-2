I was in pain, preoccupied by fears of root canals in a  pandemic, and as a result, when the receptionist who met me at the door wielding a thermometer like a gun asked me about my sense of smell, I flubbed my answer.</p><p>在加州COVID锁定期间的某个时候，我紧急去看牙医。当时由于担心大流行的根管而使我感到痛苦，结果，当我在门口见到我的接待员像拿着枪一样手持温度计询问我的嗅觉时，我感到困惑。</p><p>  As the poor receptionist backed away from me in panicked horror, I realized my error. “But it’s OK,” I tried to reassure her. “I lost it long before the pandemic.”</p><p>  当可怜的接待员惊慌失措地从我身边退缩时，我意识到自己的错误。 “但是没关系，”我试图向她保证。 “我在大流行之前很早就失去了它。”</p><p> Anosmia, or the loss of the sense of smell, emerged early on as a striking  symptom of COVID-19. Many patients recover the sense as they clear the virus, but as many as 35% according to Dr. Eric Holbrook, the chief of rhinology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and associate professor at Harvard University’s Medical School, suffer long-term loss. How long? Scientists aren’t yet sure.</p><p> 早期，COVID-19的一个明显症状就是出现了厌食症或嗅觉丧失。马萨诸塞州眼与耳研究所鼻科主任，哈佛大学医学院副教授埃里克·霍尔布鲁克（Eric Holbrook）博士说，清除病毒后，许多患者都恢复了感觉，但多达35％的人遭受了长期损失。多久？科学家还不确定。</p><p> I lost my sense of smell 20 years ago, following sinus surgery. It was sudden and shocking, especially because for the first two decades or so of my life, my sense of smell was almost too keen. Like some kind of human bloodhound, I often caught scents before anyone around me. A hint of chlorine wafting on a summer breeze from the public pool down the street. The slightest trace of chocolate lingering in my childhood kitchen that meant one of my siblings had snuck a sweet. The smell of the ocean, when it was still too far away to see or hear. I knew the smell of all my friends, and I also could describe the smell of most of their houses, and many of their hometowns. I was one of those people who had to avoid certain places, not just because of the odors but because of the feelings they invoked in me. Other scents lifted me up, flooding me with secret joy or comfort. My mother’s rose perfume. The way the earth smells just after it rains. Cinnamon toast.</p><p> 窦手术后20年前，我失去了嗅觉。这是突然而令人震惊的，尤其是因为在我生命的前二十年左右，我的嗅觉几乎太敏锐了。就像某种人类的猎犬一样，我经常在周围的人面前闻到气味。夏日风从街上的公共游泳池吹来一阵氯气。我童年时代的厨房里残留的丝丝巧克力残留痕迹，这意味着我的一个兄弟姐妹已经闻到了甜食。海洋的气味，当它仍然遥不可及时，看不见或听不到。我知道我所有朋友的气味，我也可以描述他们大多数房屋和许多家乡的气味。我是那些不得不避开某些地方的人之一，这不仅是因为有异味，还因为他们在我身上引起了感情。其他气味使我振作起来，使我充满秘密的喜悦或安慰。我母亲的玫瑰香水。雨后大地的气味。肉桂面包。</p><p>  For many years, I could still clearly conjure those scents in my mind, but now that has faded too, like the echo of a sound that reverberates away and away and away until there is almost nothing left.</p><p>  多年以来，我仍然可以清晰地想到这些气味，但是现在它已经消失了，就像声音的回声不断回荡，直到几乎没有剩余。</p><p> Until the arrival of this deadly pandemic, we didn’t hear much talk about the most primal, but least understood of our five senses — but its loss affects people profoundly.</p><p> 在这场致命的大流行病到来之前，我们还没有听到太多关于最原始但对我们的五种感官知之甚少的谈论，但是它的丧失对人们产生了深远的影响。</p><p>    First and foremost, you can’t  really taste food without a sense of smell. You can pick up sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. Hot chile peppers too. But that’s really it. There are basic health risks, too: Without a sense of smell you can put yourself in danger with kitchen gas or poison yourself with cleaning products, or by cheerfully eating rancid food without a clue that you have done so. I’ve done all three things. You can also, as I did last month, burn up an entire triple batch of holiday cookies and not notice the flames licking out of the oven a few feet away until the smoke alarm blares and the neighbor shows up with a fire extinguisher.</p><p>    首先，没有异味，您无法真正品尝到食物。您可以选择甜，酸，咸，苦和鲜的味。辣椒也一样。但这是真的。也存在基本的健康风险：如果没有嗅觉，您可能会因使用厨房气体而处于危险之中，或者因使用清洁产品而中毒，或者在不知所措的情况下高高兴兴地吃掉腐烂的食物。我已经完成了所有三件事。您也可以像我上个月那样，烧掉整整三批节日饼干，而不会注意到火焰从几英尺外的烤箱中舔出来，直到烟雾警报器起火，邻居用灭火器露面。 </p><p> There are also hygiene issues: Some doctors report that some patients have to be counseled about  deodorant and gently reminded that while they can no longer smell anything, most of the rest of the world can still smell  them. Some people — that would be me — fail to register when their dogs get sprayed by a skunk, and let them into the bedroom. (This can lead to relationship issues, if your spouse comes home and wakes you up demanding to know what the hell you have done.)</p><p>还有卫生问题：一些医生报告说，必须向一些患者提供有关除臭剂的建议，并温和地提醒他们，尽管它们无法再闻到任何气味，但世界上大多数其他地区仍然可以闻到它们的气味。当他们的狗被臭鼬喷出并让他们进入卧室时，有些人-就是我-无法注册。 （如果您的配偶回家并唤醒您，要求您知道自己到底做了什么，这可能会导致恋爱关系问题。）</p><p> And for some patients, the effects are more debilitating still. Some lose interest in food, and wither like plants moved away from the sun. Some grow  deeply, inexplicably depressed, almost as though they have been cut off from the world in some powerful and ineffable way.</p><p> 对于某些患者来说，效果仍然使人更虚弱。一些人对食物失去兴趣，并且像植物一样从太阳移走而枯萎。有些人变得深深而莫名其妙地沮丧，仿佛他们已经以某种强大而无法言喻的方式与世界隔绝了。</p><p> I’ve been in this place of blankness for a long time. It was the very beginning of the 21st century — before September 11, before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, before Facebook and QAnon — the last time my nose was good for much besides sniffling and sneezing.</p><p> 我在这个空白地方已经很久了。那是21世纪的开始-9月11日之前，在伊拉克和阿富汗战争之前，在Facebook和QAnon之前-上一次我的鼻子除了打喷嚏和打喷嚏以外，对很多人都有益。</p><p> But now, in this awful pandemic moment, I wonder if my nose may finally be useful again. Because over the years, I have picked up some wisdom on how to live with a nonworking nose. This wisdom hasn’t been much in demand: Anosmia is rare, particularly in young people, although some older people start to lose their sense of smell after about age 65.</p><p> 但是现在，在这个可怕的大流行时刻，我想知道我的鼻子是否可能再次有用。因为多年来，我已经学会了如何用不工作的鼻子生活。这种智慧的需求并不多：厌食症很少见，尤其是在年轻人中，尽管一些老年人在65岁左右后开始失去嗅觉。</p><p> People can also lose their sense of smell thanks to chronic sinus problems, or because they have sustained a head injury, or due to something called postviral smell loss, which is just what it sounds like: losing your sense of smell after a virus. That’s what scientists think is going on with people with COVID-19. What’s remarkable about COVID-19 patients experiencing anosmia as opposed to other postviral patients, however, is that they tend to be younger, in their twenties and thirties. And while doctors are hopeful many will recover this sense, it could take months to years, because the neurons in your nose have to replace themselves, and then they have grow new axons that extend up and connect to the brain. And this takes time.</p><p> 人们还可能由于慢性鼻窦问题，由于遭受头部受伤或由于所谓的病毒后气味消失而失去嗅觉，这就是听起来的样子：在感染病毒后失去嗅觉。这就是科学家认为与COVID-19相关的人正在发生的事情。然而，与其他病毒后患者相比，COVID-19发生厌氧症的患者值得注意的是，他们往往年龄在20岁到30岁之间。尽管医生希望许多人能恢复这种感觉，但可能要花费数月至数年的时间，因为鼻子中的神经元必须自我替换，然后它们会长出新的轴突，并延伸至大脑。这需要时间。</p><p> Here then, is a user’s guide to living with a nose that doesn’t work.</p><p> 然后，这里是一个指导用户如何使用不起作用的鼻子的指南。</p><p>  If you ask someone with a working nose how often in the course of a day they talk about what they are smelling, or have smelled, or look forward to smelling in the future, chances are they will answer that it is not very often.</p><p>  如果您问鼻涕的人在一天中多久谈论一次他们在闻，闻到或闻到的气味，或期望将来闻到气味，他们很可能会回答说这不是经常出现。 </p><p> They are mistaken. One of the first things you notice when you lose your sense of smell is that other people talk about how things smell  all the time. Like, more often than they talk about the weather in New York or traffic in Los Angeles or possibly even bad behavior on Twitter. Often (pre-pandemic anyway), when they do it, they will approach you and shove some flower or herb or allegedly pungent piece of cheese under your nose.</p><p>他们错了。当您失去嗅觉时，您会注意到的第一件事就是其他人一直在谈论事物的气味。就像，他们经常谈论纽约的天气或洛杉矶的交通，甚至在Twitter上的不良行为。通常（无论是大流行前），当他们这样做时，他们会接近您，并在您的鼻子下推一些花或香草或据说刺鼻的奶酪。</p><p>  You will explain (maybe even somewhat apologetically, even though really why are you apologizing?) that you can’t smell it, because in fact you can’t smell anything.</p><p>  您会解释（尽管实际上为什么道歉，甚至有些道歉？）您无法闻到它的气味，因为实际上您闻不到任何气味。</p><p> At this point, I’ve noticed, the world divides itself into two groups of people.</p><p> 我注意到，在这一点上，世界将自己分为两组。</p><p> One group won’t believe you. They might even shove the herb or the flower or the cheese closer at you, sometimes even  up into your poor nonworking nose. “No, this is really strong,” they will insist, looking at you expectantly.</p><p> 一群人不会相信你。他们甚至可能将草药，花朵或奶酪推近您，有时甚至伸入您不工作的不良鼻子中。 “不，这真的很强大。”他们会坚持地看着你。</p><p> People in the other group believe you instantly, and in many cases, a look of profound pity will come over their faces. “I’m so sorry,” they will say, as if they themselves had done something to knock you down to four senses instead of five.</p><p> 另一组中的人会立即相信您，在许多情况下，他们的脸上会充满深切的同情。他们会说：“我很抱歉。”仿佛他们自己所做的事情使您将感觉降到了四种而不是五种。</p><p> They will often continue apologizing and expressing sorrow until you change the subject. The next time they forget (and they will, usually, since no one can ever remember this about you, and also because it is so natural to talk about how things smell), they will apologize even more profusely.</p><p> 他们通常会继续道歉并表示悲伤，直到您更改主题为止。下次他们忘记时（他们通常会，因为没有人会记住有关您的信息，而且因为谈论事物的气味很自然），他们会更加道歉。</p><p> Then, if you happen to be at a restaurant or a dinner party (again, this part may not apply during the pandemic), they will stare at you while you eat, as though you are a robot going through the motions of being human, eating food when you cannot possibly enjoy it.</p><p> 然后，如果您碰巧在餐馆或晚宴上（同样，这一部分可能在大流行期间不适用），那么当您吃饭时，它们会盯着您，就像您是一个正在经历人类动作的机器人一样，在您可能无法享用时食用食物。 </p><p>  I think the people in the second group tend to be more considerate, but I also find them a little harder to take. The reason, of course, is because they are right: Losing your sense of smell is something to be sorry about. It  is a huge loss.</p><p>我认为第二组的人比较体贴，但是我也觉得他们很难接受。原因当然是因为它们是正确的：失去嗅觉是令人遗憾的事情。这是巨大的损失。</p><p> I am one of the lucky ones. I didn’t get depressed when I lost my sense of smell.</p><p> 我是幸运者之一。当我失去嗅觉时，我没有感到沮丧。</p><p> Even so. Sometimes the absence hits hard. In the first weeks after my daughter was born, our house was filled with people coming to meet her. Several of them did the exact same thing: They held her in their arms and they kissed her beautiful head and then looked up at me with wonder and joy in their eyes. “Don’t you just love how she smells?” It broke my heart every time. If I think really hard about it, I can remember the particular smell of roses in the summer rain and woodsmoke in the fall and lots of other stupid odors, too, like hot dogs, and tennis balls and wet towels left too long on the bathroom floor. But I have no idea how my own children smell.</p><p> 尽管如此。有时，缺勤会很困难。我女儿出生后的头几周，我们的房子里满是来见她的人。他们中的几个人做着完全相同的事情：他们将她抱在怀中，亲吻她美丽的头，然后用惊奇和喜悦的眼神看着我。 “你不就爱她的气味吗？”每次都伤透了我的心。如果我真的想一想，我会记得夏天雨中玫瑰的特殊气味和秋天的烟熏味，还有许多其他愚蠢的气味，例如热狗，网球和湿毛巾在浴室上放置的时间过长地板。但是我不知道我自己的孩子如何闻。</p><p> Lesson Three: Supermarket Sell-By Dates Are Your Friends — and So Are Friends Who Will Tell You When You Smell</p><p> 第三课：超市按日期卖出是您的朋友-闻到气味的朋友也一样</p><p> I grew up with parents who didn’t necessarily believe in supermarket sell-by dates. When I got married, I acquired a wonderful father-in-law who has, on more occasions than I can count, pulled something out of my kitchen trash and put it into a bowl or a cup, and from there into his mouth.</p><p> 我与父母长大，他们不一定会相信超级市场的​​销售日期。当我结婚时，我得到了一位出色的岳父，他曾在不胜枚举的情况下，从厨房的垃圾桶里拿出一些东西放进碗里或杯子里，再从那里放进他的嘴里。</p><p> But I am here to tell you: When you lose your sense of smell, sell-by dates become your friends. Heed them. And then — and this part is trickier — try to get yourself a food-tester.</p><p> 但是我在这里告诉您：当您失去嗅觉时，卖空日期将成为您的朋友。注意他们。然后-这部分比较棘手-尝试让自己成为食物测试员。</p><p> For a long time my husband was my food-tester, but since he spent his childhood eating out of the trash, I am not sure he is fully qualified. My children have turned out to be perfect for this. Young people tend to have keener senses of smell then older people, and since I prepare most of their food, they have a vested interest in helping me out.</p><p> 我的丈夫很长时间以来一直是我的食物测试员，但由于他的童年是在垃圾桶里吃饭，所以我不确定他是否完全合格。我的孩子们证明是完美的。与老年人相比，年轻人倾向于对气味有更敏锐的感觉，并且由于我准备了大多数食物，因此他们对帮助我很有兴趣。 </p><p> You also, on occasion, will need a personal smell-tester. Children are useful here, too, since they will not hesitate to tell you if you stink.</p><p>您有时也需要一个个人的气味测试仪。孩子们在这里也很有用，因为他们会毫不犹豫地告诉你你是否发臭。</p><p>  It’s a funny thing. Go into the world with a smudge of frosting on your face, or a tiny fleck of cabbage or cake on your shirt, and perfect strangers will run at you to help you remove it. (Again, this is pre-pandemic. These days, hopefully they won’t touch you.) But even your best friends, the ones who almost cry at the thought of you not being able to smell, even they will have trouble telling you when you need to shower.</p><p>  这很有趣。进入您的世界时，脸上会蒙上一层结霜，或者衬衫上出现一小撮白菜或蛋糕，完美的陌生人会冲着您来帮助您将其清除。 （再次，这是大流行前期。这些天，希望他们不会碰你。）但是，即使是你最好的朋友，那些几乎以为你不闻到气味而哭泣的朋友，甚至他们也很难告诉你当您需要淋浴时。</p><p>  Really, there are — although this may be particularly true in my line of work.</p><p>  确实有，尽管在我的工作中可能尤其如此。</p><p> When I was a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, I once did a story on graft in the local housing authority. I won’t bore you with the details, but as part of investigating a bid-rigging scheme, I went door to door through a housing project and asked residents to let me examine their toilets. If they said yes, I had to climb down underneath and behind their commodes to try to read the labels. Most of these bathrooms, I should note, were sparkling clean, but a few of them were not. It didn’t bother me a bit.</p><p> 当我在《洛杉矶时报》（Los Angeles Times）担任记者时，我曾在当地住房管理局撰写过有关嫁接的故事。我不会向您介绍这些细节，但是作为调查投标计划的一部分，我挨家挨户通过了一个住房项目，并请居民让我检查一下他们的厕所。如果他们回答“是”，我必须爬下他们的马桶下方和下方以尝试阅读标签。我应该指出，这些浴室大多数都是干净整洁的，但其中一些却不是。一点也没有打扰我。</p><p> Speaking of toilets. (Sorry, but this is a story about smells.) Let’s talk about port-a-potties. Before I lost my sense of smell, I simply could not use them. It was impossible. Untenable. And many a concert, festival, and other large venue was ruined for me as a result. Now? Not a problem at all. This is particularly useful in a pandemic in California, because public port-a-potties are suddenly everywhere.</p><p> 说到厕所。 （对不起，但这是一个有关气味的故事。）让我们谈谈便壶。在失去嗅觉之前，我简直无法使用它们。这是不可能的。站不住脚。结果，许多音乐会，音乐节和其他大型场所对我来说都毁了。现在？完全没有问题。这在加利福尼亚的大流行中特别有用，因为公共港口便车突然间到处都是。</p><p> Same goes for scented candles, and rooms that are full of them. Before I lost my sense of smell, I am not sure I had any close friends who loved scented candles. The smell was too much. I couldn&#39;t go to their homes, and thus it was hard to nurture the friendship. The same goes double for patchouli. I went to UC Berkeley in the 1990s, which instilled in me a love of books and a deep aversion for the smell of patchouli. By the time I graduated, the smell made me angry. But not anymore.</p><p> 香薰蜡烛和装满香薰蜡烛的房间也是如此。在我失去嗅觉之前，我不确定是否有亲密朋友喜欢香薰蜡烛。气味太大了。我不能去他们的家，因此很难建立友谊。广patch香同样如此。 1990年代，我去了加州大学伯克利分校，这使我对书本的热爱和对广patch香的气味产生了深深的反感。当我毕业时，这种气味使我生气。但现在不再。</p><p> You get the idea: A whole dimension of the world has been taken from you. But you get a consolation prize. You can go places and do things that might have been impossibly uncomfortable for you before.</p><p> 您会明白：您已经掌握了整个世界。但是你会得到安慰奖。您可以去一些地方做一些以前对您来说不舒服的事情。 </p><p> I am sorry that I am using port-a-potties and patchouli oil as a metaphor for this, but bear with me. I think losing a sense can make you, for lack of a better word, slightly less sensitive. The loss is lamentable — heartbreaking at times and awkward and even dangerous at others. (And we haven’t even talked that much about the cooking disasters.) But it can also, maybe, if you let it, make you a little more open to the world.</p><p>抱歉，我使用内裤和广patch香油作为隐喻，但是请耐心等待。我认为失去理智可以使您（因为缺少更好的单词）而变得不太敏感。损失是可悲的—有时令人心碎，尴尬，对其他人甚至是危险的。 （而且我们甚至没有谈论太多烹饪灾难。）但是，如果您允许的话，它也可以使您对世界更加开放。</p><p>  One of the weirdest aspects of the pandemic for me is that suddenly, everyone, or a lot more people anyway, are talking about the sense of smell, and what it’s like to live without it.</p><p>  对我来说，这场大流行最怪异的方面之一是，突然之间，每个人，或者更多的人，都在谈论嗅觉，以及没有嗅觉的生活。</p><p> But of course, that pales in comparison to the sickness and death the pandemic has wrought, not to mention the businesses that shuttered, the jobs that vaporized, the lonely isolation.</p><p> 但是，与流行病造成的疾病和死亡相比，这当然是苍白的，更不用说关闭的业务，蒸发的工作，孤独的孤立了。</p><p> Sometime during this period, I started making cinnamon toast again. I had stayed away from it after I lost my sense of smell. It used to be one of my favorite things to eat. I loved the smell of cinnamon, and the way it mixed with the sugar and then melted into the butter on a piece of warm bread. Of all the eating experiences I lost when I lost my sense of smell, I mourned cinnamon toast the most — not just the flavor, but also the comfort the flavor gave me: It tasted of my childhood, of being warm inside on a gray day, curled up with a book watching the rain streak the window, feeling safe and cared for.</p><p> 在这段时间的某个时候，我又开始做肉桂烤面包。失去嗅觉后，我远离了它。它曾经是我最喜欢吃的东西之一。我喜欢肉桂的味道，喜欢它与糖混合，然后融化在一块热面包上的黄油中的味道。在失去嗅觉后失去的所有饮食经历中，我最哀悼的是肉桂烤面包-不仅是风味，而且是风味给我带来的舒适感：这是我童年的味道，在灰色的日子里温暖着我，ed缩着一本书，看着雨溅在窗户上，感到安全并受到照顾。</p><p> But here I am now, taking the time to mix cinnamon powder into sugar until it is just the right shade of light brown, and then sprinkling it very precisely onto perfectly toasted-bread. There’s something crazy about this, I know — after all, I could skip the spice entirely and just dump sugar on butter and it would taste the same to me.</p><p> 但是现在我在这里，花时间将肉桂粉混入糖中，直到恰好是浅褐色，然后将其精确地撒在完美烤面包上。我知道这有点疯狂-毕竟，我可以完全跳过香料，而只是把糖倒在黄油上，对我来说味道也一样。</p><p> But I don’t care. I eat it, and with every bite, I feel the comfort and joy of being alive. And that is the last lesson: Life may not be the same with no sense of smell. You may be surrounded by people who don’t believe you, and the world may be full of reminders of what you have lost. And you may even go through it smelling like a skunk, unable to fully protect yourself from dangerous gases and patchouli oil.
