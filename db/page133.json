They&#39;re already known to withstand freezing ( even in liquid nitrogen), boiling, desiccation, and  radiation, and the group has persisted for millions of years without having sex. The humble yet remarkably hardy bdelloid rotifer has now surprised researchers yet again\u2014a  recent study unearthed 24,000-year-old Siberian permafrost and found living (or at least revivable) rotifers there. Surviving 24,000 years in deep-freeze is a new record for the species.\n Rotifers aren\u2019t the only living organisms to emerge from permafrost or ice. The same researchers behind this latest discovery had previously found roughly 40,000-year-old  viable roundworms in the region\u2019s permafrost. Ancient moss, seeds, viruses, and bacteria have all shown impressive longevity on ice, prompting  legitimate concern about whether any potentially harmful pathogens may also be released as glaciers and permafrost melt.\n Given that bdelloids are generally only a threat to bacteria, algae, and detritus, however, there\u2019s not much need for concern regarding this particular discovery. But as key players in the bottom of the food chain, newly re-emerged rotifers indicate that maybe we should think about how species that haven\u2019t been seen for millennia might reintegrate into modern ecosystems.\n  The Soil Cryology Lab in Pushchino, Russia, has been digging up Siberian permafrost in search of ancient organisms for roughly a decade. The group estimates the age of the organisms it finds by radiocarbon dating the surrounding soil samples (evidence has shown that there is no vertical movement through layers of permafrost). For example, last year, the researchers reported a \u201c frozen zoo\u201d of 35 viable protists (nucleus-containing organisms that are neither animal, plant, nor fungus), that they calculated ranged from hundreds to tens of thousands of years in age.\n In their most recent discovery, the cryology researchers found the living bdelloids after culturing the soil samples for about one month. Among rotifer classes, bdelloids have the fairly unusual ability to reproduce parthenogenetically\u2014i.e., by cloning\u2014and so the original specimens had already begun to do so. Although the clones made identifying the ancient parent challenging, this did greatly facilitate further investigation of the characteristics and behavior of the unfrozen strain.\n    Throughout all of the above permafrost studies, there is always the concern of sample contamination by modern-day organisms. Besides using techniques designed to prevent this, the team also addressed this issue by looking at the DNA present in the soil samples, confirming that contamination was highly unlikely. Phylogenetic analysis furthermore showed that the species didn\u2019t match any known modern rotifers, although there is a closely related species found in Belgium.\n  The team was naturally interested in better understanding the freezing process and gaining insight into just how these rotifers survived for so long. As a first step, the researchers subsequently froze a selection of the cloned rotifers at -15\u00b0 C for one week and captured videos (see above) of the rotifers reviving.\n The researchers found that not all of the clones survived. Surprisingly, the clones generally weren\u2019t much more freeze-tolerant than contemporary rotifers from Iceland, Alaska, Europe, North America, and even the Asian and African tropics. They were a little more freeze-tolerant than their closest genetic relative, but the difference was marginal.\n The researchers did find that the rotifers could survive a relatively slow freezing process (~45 minutes). This is noteworthy because it was gradual enough that ice crystals formed inside of the animals\u2019 cells\u2014a development that is usually catastrophic for living organisms. In fact, protective mechanisms against this are highly sought-after by anyone in the business of cryo-preservation, making this latest finding especially enticing from that perspective.\n Although the authors aren\u2019t quite in that business, they do plan additional experiments to better understand cryptobiosis\u2014the state of almost completely arrested metabolism that made the rotifers\u2019 survival possible. As for research into cryo-preservation of larger organisms, the authors suggest that this becomes trickier as the organism in question becomes more complex. That said, rotifers are among the most complicated cryo-preserved species so far\u2014complete with organs such as a brain and a gut.\n Which returns us to the questions of what other organisms might reappear with a warming climate and what impacts they might have. Evidence so far shows that multiple types of organisms are still alive in the ice. At least on a microscopic level, it seems possible that intact micro-ecosystems may thaw together (nematodes, rotifers, protists, viruses, bacteria, etc.). How these long-dormant species will compete or coexist with modern ecosystems is difficult to predict at this point, but it\u2019s probably worth further consideration.\n  K.E.D.

", "note_en": "Mitiga, unlike other companies in the  cybersecurity space, isn\u2019t looking to prevent cyberattacks, which the startup claims are inevitable no matter how much protection is in place. Rather, it\u2019s looking to help organizations manage their  incident response, particularly as they transition to hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\n The early-stage startup, which raised $7 million in seed funding in July last year, says its incident readiness and response tech stack accelerates post-incident bounce back from days down to hours. \u00a0Its subscription-based offering automatically detects when a network is breached and quickly investigates, collects case data, and translates it into remediation steps for all relevant divisions within an organization so they can quickly and efficiently respond. Mitiga also documents each event, allowing organizations to fix the cause in order to prevent future attacks.\n  Mitiga\u2019s Series A was led by ClearSky Security, Atlantic Bridge, and DNX, and the startup tells TechCrunch \u00a0that it will use the funds to \u201ccontinue to disrupt how incident readiness and response is delivered,\u201d as well as \u201csignificantly\u201d increasing its cybersecurity, engineering, sales, and marketing staff.\n The company added that the funding comes amid a \u201cchanging mindset\u201d for enterprise organizations when it comes to incident readiness and response. The pandemic has accelerated cloud adoption, and it\u2019s predicted that spending on cloud services will surpass $332 billion this year alone. \u00a0This acceleration, naturally, has provided a lucrative target for hackers, with cyberattacks on cloud services increasing 630% in the first four months of 2020, according to McAfee.\n \u201cThe cloud represents new challenges for incident readiness and response and we\u2019re bringing the industry\u2019s first incident response solution in the cloud, for the cloud,\u201d said Tal Mozes, co-founder and CEO of Mitiga.\n \u201cThis funding will allow us to further our engagements with heads of enterprise security who are looking to recover from an incident in real-time, attract even more of the most innovative cybersecurity minds in the industry, and expand our partner network.

State mandates require that he and other Nome,  Alaska, crabbers travel at least 15 miles from their town\u2019s shore to drop their pots, but as the number of successful crustacean catches dwindled in recent years, they\u2019d often go farther and farther afield.\n Farley could track his distance from home from GPS, but after a long day at sea, it didn\u2019t feel like he was really back until he could see the four ghostly structures atop Anvil Mountain. \u201cOn a clear day you can see them at least five or six miles out,\u201d Farley says. \u201cThey were always there, part of Nome.\u201d\n Colloquially, they\u2019re known as \u201cNomehenge\u201d or simply \u201cthe billboards,\u201d though, given their concave shape, one could easily mistake them for unfinished skate ramps. Sitting on the summit of the otherwise-bald 1,200-foot mountain that looms behind the town, they\u2019re useful wayfinding aids for aircraft pilots, boat captains, hikers, and snowmobilers\u2014particularly in the winter, when it\u2019s dark much of the day and the snow is deep enough to obscure most other landmarks.\n However, during the Cold War, the structures were antennas, conceived to serve as an important early warning system for Soviet attack. Then, the array and its now-extinct peers were known as the White Alice Communications System.\n  At the beginning of the Cold War, development of the Arctic was one of the primary objectives of the U.S. Air Force. At the time, Alaska had inadequate infrastructure to support those missions, with insufficient roads, ports, and railroads and the bulk of military bases located in areas meant to meet a southern rival, not one coming over the  North Pole. Still, the biggest challenge was communication. If residents wanted to make a long-distance call, they needed to make a reservation to use the only circuit in town. Getting news across or outside of Alaska wasn\u2019t an easy process, and was astronomically expensive. The White Alice Communications System changed that. It made it easier for locals to stay connected, and allowed the Air Force to warn the mainland of any incoming Russian bombers.\n When the four towers in Nome accepted their first transmission in January 1958, the tropospheric antennas (a type of technology that sends and receives signals by bouncing them off layers in the atmosphere) were ahead of their time. The Nome site was a part of a larger system of 71 sites that operated by receiving radio waves from 200 miles away and hot-potatoing the message down the line to the next site. A single site required the work of dozens or hundreds of people, and called for near-constant tinkering. Most sites were supplemented with dorms, cafeterias, guard posts, and other amenities. Many sit on the coast, as close as possible to the adversary that the country was trying to watch. The strategic value of their presence  helped bolster Alaska\u2019s bid for statehood in 1959.\n But following the advancements made in satellite communications in the 1970s, White Alice quickly became obsolete. In the years that have followed, all but the Nome antennas were torn down. Many of the sites had become targets for vandalism and were contaminated with petroleum, lead, and asbestos (all of which were used in the construction and maintenance of the sites). The Nome site alone saw more than 8 million pounds of contaminated soil shipped from the mountaintop to Arlington,  Oregon, for treatment. \u201cGenerally if there\u2019s a potential liability, whoever owns it is going to want to limit that,\u201d says Bill O\u2019Connell, who worked as an environmental consultant doing clean-up for the White Alice sites in the early 2000s. \u201cNome had to lobby pretty hard to get the structures retained.\u201d\n  While the towers, the most recognizable element of the White Alice system, have vanished elsewhere in Alaska, there are some support facilities\u2014largely the original control rooms\u2014quietly standing in the vast landscape. Though these no longer use radio waves, they still serve the purpose of keeping Alaska connected. Now, they hold the networks that make up the internet, phone systems, cellular, and more, allowing roadless villages to connect (digitally, at least) to the rest of the world. The bulk of the sites are now owned by the telecommunications company AT&amp;T, which is tasked with running the next-generation systems.\n While the White Alice system needed teams of workers monitoring it around the clock, today one person can do the job alone. \u201cOur remote [former White Alice] sites can run for an entire year without a visit,\u201d says Casey Anderson, an Outlying Area Technician for Core Network Operations with the telecommunications company. \u201cMany times that\u2019s all I do: an annual check-up. Check that everything is fine, turn off the lights, lock the door, fly to the next one.\u201d\n In the years post-White Alice, much of the original equipment in the support buildings was replaced by its modern equivalent and some of the buildings have been spruced up, but still, they\u2019re \u201ca little spooky,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cBecause they were built to withstand a nuclear blast, the aesthetics of the buildings weren\u2019t particularly important,\u201d Anderson adds. \u201cThey\u2019re largely nondescript buildings, in the middle of nowhere, with no windows.\u201d\n  Because the White Alice sites are the ancestors to the modern communications that make up the bulk of his job, Anderson looks forward to visiting them\u2014he even has a map of Alaska in his home where he\u2019s circled the sites he\u2019s been to. In 2016, Nome recognized that others might be similarly interested in the communications antennae and fought to not only save them but also make them  a tourism spot.\n In 2012, the land the Anvil Mountain White Alice site sits on was supposed to be given to the Sitnasuak Native Corp, a for-profit company that voted to have the structure dismantled so they  wouldn\u2019t be on the hook for any liability. To keep the antennas, the Nome City Council offered to trade Sitnasuak for a significantly more valuable plot of land in town. Sitnasuak accepted and the antennas stayed.\n \u201cI think people like the history behind it\u2014it makes them feel like Nome matters to the outside world,\u201d says longtime Nome resident Russell Rowe, adding that often Nomehenge appears on local T-shirts, like an unofficial mascot. \u201cWhen it was brought up that it might go away, there were a lot of people that were opposed to it.\u201d\n For now, the city seems content to leave the site as is, allowing locals to use the surrounding area for recreation. Rowe brings his young sons up to the summit a dozen or so times a year to geocache, pick blueberries, and bike along the trails in the shadow of the 120-foot antennas. There are often other locals up there, hiking with their dogs, picnicking, or gathering the ultra-soft, incredibly warm fibers shed by musk oxen, which make great yarn. Occasionally, busloads of tourists will attempt to traverse the bumpy road to get closer to the site.\n \u201cThere are 360-degree views of the landscape around Nome from the White Alice site\u2014all the rolling tundra hills, the bigger peaks to the north, and then out to the ocean,\u201d Rowe says. \u201cIt might sound strange, but it\u2019s a nice place to be.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 18:55:27", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82cf\u8054,\u6765\u5230,home,\u7f51\u7ad9", "title": "\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230Alaska\u7684\u82cf\u8054\u65f6\u4ee3\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u5bb6\u56ed ", "title_en": "Welcome to Nomehenge, Home to Alaska\u2019s Soviet-Era Antennas", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/alaska-soviet-history-nomehenge", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82cf\u8054", "\u6765\u5230", "home", "\u7f51\u7ad9"]}]
