I was minding my own business in California working for Google. Although I had volunteered for the Obama campaigns, I had no other connection to the Administration and no government experience at all.</p><p>HealthCare.gov刚刚上线，如果你还记得的话，它进行得并不是很顺利。我在加州为谷歌工作，当时我在打理自己的生意。虽然我是奥巴马竞选团队的志愿者，但我与政府没有其他联系，也完全没有从政经验。</p><p> I was visiting some friends from the campaign in Chicago when through some complicated series of connections that I still don’t understand, I heard that the White House was looking to organize some kind of assessment of the website, and was asked to call in to a phone conference where I would get more information. The phone call was at 8:30 Eastern, so 5:30AM for me, so I was not too happy but I did it anyway.</p><p>我在芝加哥拜访一些竞选团队的朋友时，通过一系列复杂的联系，我仍然不明白，我听说白宫正在寻求组织对该网站的某种评估，并被邀请参加一个电话会议，在那里我将获得更多信息。电话是在东部时间8：30打的，所以对我来说是早上5：30，所以我不太高兴，但我还是照做了。</p><p> On the phone was a guy named Todd Park. I had never met Todd; I looked him up on Wikipedia while on the phone. With a couple more phone calls, I was talked into flying to Washington, D.C. for a few days to evaluate the situation.</p><p>打电话的是一个叫托德·帕克的人。我从未见过托德；我打电话时在维基百科上查过他。又打了几个电话，我被说服飞往华盛顿特区几天，以评估情况。</p><p>  The government shutdown was over, and the failure of Healthcare.gov was the lead story on cable news all day every day. The original estimate from the Congressional Budget Office had been that 7 million people would enroll in this first enrollment period, but Todd said that given the circumstances if we could manage 4 million, that would be a home run.</p><p>政府关门已经结束，Healthcare.gov的失败成为每天有线电视新闻的头条新闻。国会预算办公室(Congressional Budget Office)最初的估计是，第一个注册期将有700万人注册，但托德表示，考虑到目前的情况，如果我们能管理好400万人，那将是一个本垒打。</p><p> He said they needed an independent outside team to figure out how bad the problems were and if they could be fixed to save the site this year. Also that if it couldn’t be fixed, then it would be a catastrophe for the policy, with the 2014 election coming and the unpopular law having failed to launch. Democrat support would probably fracture, the election would be a disaster, the President would be a lame duck two years early, and nobody would try again for a generation. But you know, we want your honest assessment.</p><p>他说，他们需要一个独立的外部团队来弄清楚问题有多严重，以及是否可以修复这些问题，以在今年拯救网站。此外，如果它不能得到修复，那么这将是这项政策的一场灾难，因为2014年大选即将到来，而这项不受欢迎的法律未能推出。民主党人的支持可能会崩溃，选举将是一场灾难，总统将提前两年成为跛脚鸭，一代人都不会再尝试。但你知道，我们需要你诚实的评估。</p><p> “The whole system had worked as normal and produced the expected result, which was a web site that was overpriced by hundreds of millions of dollars and did not work, at all.”</p><p>“整个系统运行正常，产生了预期的结果，那就是一个网站定价过高，高出数亿美元，完全不起作用。”</p><p>  We looked around and found some really surprising things. One was that there was no monitoring of the production system. For those of you that run large distributed systems, you will understand that this is as if you are driving a bus with the windshield covered. Second was that there were hundreds of people and dozens of companies involved, but nobody in charge. Third was that there was no particular urgency about the situation. As I would come to understand, nobody was acting like there was anything out of the ordinary because there was nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>我们环顾四周，发现了一些非常令人惊讶的东西。其一是没有对生产系统进行监控。对于那些运行大型分布式系统的人来说，您会明白这就像是在驾驶一辆挡风玻璃被遮盖的公交车。其次，有数百人和数十家公司参与其中，但没有人负责。第三，情况并不特别紧迫。据我所知，没有人表现得像是有什么不寻常之处，因为没有什么不寻常之处。</p><p> The whole system had worked as normal and produced the expected result, which was a web site that was overpriced by hundreds of millions of dollars and did not work, at all.</p><p>整个系统正常运行，产生了预期的结果，那就是一个网站定价过高，高出数亿美元，完全不起作用。</p><p> Since there were so many really basic problems, we ended up recommending that the site could probably be fixed to work well enough to enroll the 4 million people. Of course, we were then asked to stay to follow through and implement those recommendations. (This is called commitment escalation, and we will do it to you. This is the only time I will warn you.)</p><p>由于有这么多非常基本的问题，我们最终建议，这个网站很可能可以修复得足够好，足以招收400万人。当然，我们随后被要求留下来贯彻和实施这些建议。(这称为承诺升级，我们将对您进行升级。这是我唯一一次警告你。)。</p><p>  I submitted an invoice for the nine week period ending December 31, 2013, and the mean hours per day worked was 17.5. I was hallucinating and having other problems from not having slept enough for three months. This was the hardest thing I have ever done and I hope nothing ever comes close to it again.</p><p>我提交了截至2013年12月31日的9周期间的发票，平均每天工作时间为17.5小时。我出现了幻觉，并出现了其他问题，原因是我三个月没有睡够觉。这是我做过的最难的一件事，我希望再也没有比这更难的事了。</p><p> “Things did not go back to normal for me; they only continued to get weirder.”</p><p>“对我来说，事情并没有恢复正常；它们只会继续变得更奇怪。”</p><p>  When I went home, other people had taken over the day to day operations and helped finish the enrollment period, which went to March 31. But things did not go back to normal for me; they only continued to get weirder. There had already been media interest in the people from the “tech surge,” and in March the final enrollment number of over 8 million was announced, and three of us from the “tech surge” team were on the cover of   Time Magazine. In May I went back one more time for an event where we met the President.</p><p>当我回到家时，其他人已经接管了日常运营，并帮助完成了注册期限，一直持续到3月31日。但对我来说，事情并没有恢复正常；它们只会继续变得更加奇怪。媒体已经对“科技热潮”的人产生了兴趣，今年3月，最终报名人数超过800万人，我们三个“科技热潮”团队的成员登上了“时代”周刊(Time Magazine)的封面。今年5月，我又一次回去参加会见总统的活动。</p><p> I tell you all this not to prove how amazing we were, but exactly the opposite.</p><p>我告诉你这一切不是为了证明我们有多了不起，而是恰恰相反。</p><p> Nothing we did was technically difficult by any standard we are used to. There were simple problems with simple solutions. The solution to the lack of monitoring was to install monitoring. The solution to nobody being in charge was to make everybody come to the same room where we could coordinate. And so on. It was not a hard engineering problem, and any of you could have done it, and it was also more important and meaningful than anything I could have accomplished in a lifetime working at my old job.</p><p>从我们习惯的任何标准来看，我们所做的一切在技术上都不是困难的。有一些简单的问题和简单的解决方案。缺乏监控的解决方案是安装监控。没有人负责的解决方案是让每个人都来到同一个房间，在那里我们可以进行协调。诸若此类。这不是一个困难的工程问题，你们中的任何一个人都能做到，而且它也比我在以前的工作岗位上毕生能完成的任何事情都更重要和更有意义。</p><p> Beyond the 8 million people that got access to health care for the first time, which for many of them was a matter of life or death, I don’t think we are ever going back to the time when people who actually need health insurance are not allowed to buy it.</p><p>除了800万人首次获得医疗保健，对他们中的许多人来说，这是生死攸关的问题，我认为我们永远不会回到真正需要医疗保险的人不被允许购买医疗保险的时代。</p><p> So I went back to my old job and tried to care about it. I was not successful. On one hand the company does not need me; there are thousands of other engineers that are as good or better. On the other hand, if I succeeded beyond anybody’s wildest dreams the net effect is that some extra billions of dollars would go to one billionaire instead of a different billionaire. It was hard to see why I should bother, and still is.</p><p>所以我回到了原来的工作岗位，试着去关心它。我没有成功。一方面，公司不需要我；还有成千上万的其他工程师和我一样优秀，甚至更好。另一方面，如果我取得了超出任何人最疯狂的梦想的成功，净效果是额外的数十亿美元将流向一位亿万富翁，而不是另一位亿万富翁。我很难理解我为什么要费心，现在仍然如此。</p><p>  People that had been working on government technology reform for years had received a huge boost from the Healthcare.gov meltdown. So pretty soon Todd Park was calling me again, asking me to come work for a group that has now become known as the  U.S. Digital Service. It took a few months to convince me, but in August I finally left Google forever and moved to Washington.</p><p>多年来一直致力于政府技术改革的人们从Healthcare.gov的崩溃中获得了巨大的提振。所以很快托德·帕克又给我打来电话，让我来为一个现在被称为美国数字服务(U.S.Digital Service)的组织工作。我花了几个月的时间才说服我，但在8月份，我最终永远离开了谷歌，搬到了华盛顿。</p><p> “I expected that the difficult problems would be recruiting 10 more engineers to make this questionable life decision, and getting agencies to accept outside help.”</p><p>“我预计困难的问题将是再招募10名工程师来做出这个有问题的人生决定，并让机构接受外部帮助。”</p><p> The basic theory of the  U.S. Digital Service is to replicate the ingredients that were successful on turning around Healthcare.gov, for a few other high priority projects. With the money we basically had left over in an IT oversight fund, I expected to hire about 10 to 12 people and take on three projects, which I thought would be the Affordable Care Act, the VA, and immigration. I expected that the difficult problems would be recruiting 10 more engineers to make this questionable life decision, and getting agencies to accept outside help.</p><p>美国数字服务(U.S.Digital Service)的基本理论是复制成功扭转Healthcare.gov局面的成分，用于其他几个高度优先的项目。用我们基本上留在IT监督基金中的钱，我预计将雇佣大约10到12个人，并承担三个项目，我认为这三个项目将是平价医疗法案、退伍军人事务部和移民。我预计困难的问题将是再招募10名工程师来做出这个有问题的人生决定，并让机构接受外部帮助。</p><p>   Where I was worried about recruiting 10 people, I actually got over a thousand applications. The demand from the agencies is also more than we could ever satisfy. We have met with 22 of them and identified around 60 projects that need attention.</p><p>在我担心招聘10个人的地方，我实际上收到了1000多份申请。代理机构的需求也超出了我们所能满足的范围。我们已经与其中22个人会面，确定了大约60个需要关注的项目。</p><p> And possibly the most surprising thing was that Congress passed an omnibus spending bill in December, and it included the full $20M funding request to operate the  U.S. Digital Service. This will allow us to grow to about 40 people and take on 10 projects in 2015.</p><p>可能最令人惊讶的是，国会在12月通过了一项综合性支出法案，其中包括运营美国数字服务(U.S.Digital Service)所需的2000万美元全额资金申请。这将使我们能够发展到大约40人，并在2015年承担10个项目。</p><p>  Right now, at least, in this moment, we have overwhelming demand for engineers like yourself in the federal government. And we have overwhelming supply of people that want to come help.</p><p>现在，至少在此时此刻，联邦政府对像你这样的工程师有着压倒性的需求。我们有大量的人想来帮忙。</p><p> For these reasons, we have proposed in the President’s 2016 budget a total of $105 million to create copies of the  U.S. Digital Service team inside all of the 24 major agencies, for a total of around 500 people. The artificial barrier that has kept the technology industry and the public sector separated on different evolutionary paths is porous right now, and if enough people cross over, it can be destroyed.</p><p>出于这些原因，我们在总统2016年的预算中提议拨款1.05亿美元，在所有24个主要机构中创建美国数字服务团队的副本，总共约500人。将科技行业和公共部门分隔在不同进化路径上的人为壁垒现在漏洞百出，如果有足够多的人跨过，它就可以被摧毁。</p><p> Some of you, not all of you, are working right now on another app for people to share pictures of food or a social network for dogs. I am here to tell you that your country has a better use for your talents.</p><p>你们中的一些人，并不是所有人，现在正在开发另一款供人们分享食物图片或狗狗社交网络的应用程序。我在这里告诉你们，你们的国家可以更好地利用你们的才华。</p><p> “All of these are design and information processing problems and all of these are matters of life or death to millions of citizens and all of them are things you can fix if you choose to.”</p><p>“所有这些都是设计和信息处理的问题，所有这些对数百万公民来说都是生死攸关的问题，如果你愿意的话，所有这些都是你可以解决的问题。”</p><p> The Affordable Care Act, I just told you about. The Social Security Administration mails checks from a mainframe running COBOL, which might kind of be OK except that more than half of the workforce that maintains it is at or near retirement age. What happens then? The Department of Veterans Affairs has a serious backlog of disability claims. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service processes permanent resident applications and everything else on paper. If you lose your green card, it will take you 6–8 months to get a new one and in the meantime you will not be able to prove you have the right to be in the country or get a job.</p><p>“平价医疗法案”，我刚刚跟你说过。美国社会保障管理局(Social Security Administration)从运行COBOL的大型机邮寄支票，这可能是可以接受的，但维护它的劳动力中有一半以上处于或接近退休年龄。然后会发生什么呢？退伍军人事务部(Department Of Veterans Affairs)的伤残申请严重积压。美国公民和移民局处理永久居民申请和其他书面申请。如果你丢失了你的绿卡，你将需要6-8个月的时间才能拿到新的绿卡，在此期间，你将无法证明你有权在这个国家或找到一份工作。</p><p> All of these are design and information processing problems and all of these are matters of life or death to millions of citizens and all of them are things you can fix if you choose to.</p><p>所有这些都是设计和信息处理的问题，所有这些对数百万公民来说都是生死攸关的问题，如果你愿意的话，所有这些都是你可以解决的问题。</p><p>   This is a market economy and you — and your talents — are the crucial capital. Whether you know it or not, you are making decisions about how we allocate resources. We can solve any of these problems but we have to choose to do it.</p><p>这是一个市场经济，你们--以及你们的才华--是至关重要的资本。不管你们知不知道，你们正在就我们如何分配资源做出决定。我们可以解决这些问题中的任何一个，但我们必须选择这样做。</p><p> The most sobering thing about my time in government is to really understand on an emotional level that this country belongs to you and me and it is exactly as good as we make it. Grownups are not going to fix it for us and billionaires are not going to fix it for us. We either do it ourselves, or nobody does. I will take questions.</p><p>我在政府任职期间最发人深省的一件事是，在情感层面上真正理解了这个国家属于你和我，它完全像我们创造的那样美好。成年人不会为我们解决这个问题，亿万富翁也不会为我们解决这个问题。我们要么自己做，要么没人做。我将回答问题。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/mikey-dickerson-to-sxsw-why-we-need-you-in-government-f31dab3263a0">https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/mikey-dickerson-to-sxsw-why-we-need-you-in-government-f31dab3263a0</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/政府/">#政府</a></button></div></div><div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded clearfix"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033929.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/11/thumb_c09e3bff8577b6f02978fd6dcd6f455b.jpeg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1033929.html">提醒人们特朗普是什么样的商人</a></div><span class="my_story_list_date">2020-11-9 4:46</span></div><div class="col-sm"><div><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032934.html"><img src="http://img2.diglog.com/img/2020/11/thumb_1f4d407dcbcbe1dce7165a8ba5e7e76e.jpg" class="img-fluid" onerror="this.style.display='none'"></a></div><div class="item_title"><a target="_blank" href="/story/1032934.html">
