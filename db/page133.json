", "note_en": "Certain suppliers are asked to give Amazon the right to buy shares at potentially lower-than-market rates as part of their contract\n   Suppliers that want to land  Amazon.com    AMZN  -0.53%  as a client for their goods and services can find that its business comes with a catch: the right for Amazon to buy big stakes in their companies at potentially steep discounts to market value.\n  The technology-and-retail giant has struck at least a dozen deals with publicly traded companies in which it gets rights, called warrants, to buy the vendors\u2019 stock in the future at what could be below-market prices, according to corporate filings and interviews with people involved with the deals.\n  Amazon over the past decade also has done more than 75 such deals with privately held companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In all, the tech titan\u2019s stakes and potential stakes amount to billions of dollars across companies that provide everything from call-center services to natural gas, and in some cases position Amazon among the top shareholders in those businesses.\n  The unusual arrangements offer another window into how Amazon uses its market heft to increase its wealth and clout. The company has been under growing  scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its competitive practices,  including with companies it partners with.\n  While the deals can benefit the suppliers by locking in big contracts, which can also boost their share prices, executives at several of the companies said they felt they couldn\u2019t refuse Amazon\u2019s push for the right to buy the stock without risking a major contract. The deals in some cases also give Amazon rights such as board representation and the ability to top any acquisition offers from other companies.\n  For Amazon, the arrangements give it a piece of the potential upside their vendors can get from doing business with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\n  Amazon routinely leverages its size and power to force terms that benefit itself, including by getting  partners in one business to sign on to its other services; learning about  up-and-coming technology companies through its venture-capital fund; or  creating top selling Amazon branded goods that compete with small sellers on its site. It has aggressively competed to wrest market share from rivals, which Amazon says results in better deals for shoppers.\n  In its supplier deals that include warrants, Amazon throws its weight around to exact lucrative terms, knowing many companies won\u2019t refuse, according to former Amazon executives who worked on the deals.\n  An Amazon spokeswoman said the warrants it obtains in commercial agreements are typically tied to milestones that Amazon has to meet, such as large purchases from the supplier. The company declined to comment on specific deals, or say how many warrants it has exercised or the amount of money it has made from such agreements. The spokeswoman said it has warrant deals in fewer than 1% of the commercial agreements it enters into.\n  Grocery distributor  SpartanNash  last year amended a contract with Amazon to deliver groceries to its Amazon Fresh arm. The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company had been supplying Amazon with food since 2016, but this time Amazon added a condition: if it bought $8 billion worth of groceries over seven years, it could get warrants to purchase around 15% of SpartanNash\u2019s stock at a price potentially lower than the market. Amazon also said it wanted to be notified of any takeover offers for SpartanNash and have a 10-day window to offer a counterbid.\n    SpartanNash executives were taken aback, said people familiar with the matter. No customer had requested such terms before. Executives ultimately decided they didn\u2019t want to haggle with one of SpartanNash\u2019s biggest customers, and that being tied to Amazon could raise their company\u2019s profile, one of the people said. Amazon received warrants in the company when the deal was announced that would amount to 2.5% of its stock if exercised. If it receives and exercises warrants for the additional 12.5%, according to the contract terms, it would be SpartanNash\u2019s second-largest shareholder after mutual-fund manager BlackRock Inc.\n    Amazon has been doing such deals with vendors for about a decade but has aggressively increased the practice in the past few years, said former Amazon executives and lawyers who worked on structuring the deals. In its latest quarterly report, the company valued its warrants at $2.8 billion, more than five times the level three years ago. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the value of stakes it owns as a result of exercising its warrants.\n  A broader measure of its warrants and the stakes it holds in companies through warrants, direct investment or other ways increased 10 times to $8.4 billion in that period, according to Amazon\u2019s quarterly filings.\n  Like stock options, warrants let the holder buy a company\u2019s shares at a set price during a set period. If the stock surpasses that strike price, the warrant holder can buy shares at a below-market price.\n  Corporate executives in a range of industries and lawyers said Amazon\u2019s push to get warrants as part of vendor deals is highly unusual. Warrant deals have more commonly been used by investors who back companies in financial trouble, in deals deemed high risk.\n    Former Amazon executives who worked on warrant deals said they found no direct precedent before the company began striking them. For a guide, an Amazon team sleuthed through financial documents from the 2008 financial crisis to find information about bank bailouts that involved warrants, one of the people said.\n  The Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a few examples of other companies striking warrant arrangements. In 2017,  Walmart  obtained warrants in  Plug Power  a few months after Amazon struck a commercial deal tied to warrants with the company. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company very infrequently obtains warrants in other companies. Plug Power declined to comment.\n  Some suppliers see granting Amazon warrants as a worthwhile competitive advantage.  Clean Energy Fuels  struck a deal with Amazon earlier this year that could give the larger company a 20% stake over the next decade, making it the No. 2 shareholder. Management had never done a commercial deal where it gave the customer warrants, according to a person familiar with the matter, but Amazon had put out a large request for proposals from other natural-gas companies, and Clean Energy determined that accepting the terms of warrants would keep Amazon from choosing to do more business with competitors, the person said. As part of the terms, Clean Energy must notify Amazon if it receives a takeover offer, the person said. Clean Energy declined to comment.\n  Amazon\u2019s first major warrants deal with a publicly traded vendor came in 2016. Amazon was seeking a partner with cargo planes to help build out its massive logistics network. Executives reasoned that the company\u2019s potential partners were all smaller, lesser-known companies with stagnant growth, and that a major contract from Amazon would invigorate their stocks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon wanted some of that potential upside, the person said.\n  Amazon proposed a deal, with warrants, to Wilmington, Ohio-based  Air Transport Services Group  The aircraft-leasing company initially pushed back on the warrant stipulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Its team flew to Seattle and had \u201cintense, protracted negotiations\u201d where Amazon got ATSG to agree to the structure, one of the people said. \u201cIt took a lot of convincing,\u201d the person said. Amazon currently owns around 19.5% of ATSG, making it the biggest shareholder.\n      Amazon executives knew it would need to lease many more planes to handle explosive growth in its delivery operation, and the initial warrant deal emboldened them to demand similar terms from other companies, said one of the people involved.\n  In talks with  Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Amazon broached a 10-year leasing deal, with similar terms. This time Amazon demanded warrants that would amount to up to 20% of Atlas\u2019s equity over five years\u2014with an option for 10% more later\u2014depending on how much business it gave Atlas. Amazon also wanted the right to elect a director to Atlas\u2019s board, after meeting certain milestones.\n  People involved on both sides said that warrants were a condition of Amazon partnering with Atlas. \u201cThere was definitely a sense that if it wasn\u2019t agreed to there wouldn\u2019t be a deal,\u201d said one of the people. Atlas executives didn\u2019t want to pass up the revenue opportunity from Amazon and viewed giving up the warrants as the price of doing business with Amazon, said the person.\n  When it announced the deal in May 2016, Atlas lauded the deal, including the equity arrangement. Its share price soared 27% that day. Such jumps have been common when Amazon has done warrant deals with publicly traded suppliers\u2014SpartanNash\u2019s stock rose 26% on the day it announced its agreement.\n  The strike price for the Atlas warrants was $37.50, slightly below where the shares were trading before the deal was announced. Amazon later exercised warrants for 9% of Atlas\u2019 stock and sold the shares, according to an Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon declined to comment on how much it made on its sale of Atlas stock.\n    Atlas has never done a similar deal, according to the Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon never named a director to Atlas\u2019s board, she said.\n    Amazon also signed a vendor deal with  Cargojet  that included warrants. Cargojet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Amazon often ties its warrants to how much business it gives a supplier. In a deal with Startek Inc., the Colorado-based call-center company agreed to give Amazon the right to acquire 20% of its shares if Amazon does $600 million of business with Startek over eight years. That would make Amazon Startek\u2019s second-largest shareholder, if it were to obtain the warrants and exercise them.

Amsterdam-based Flow Traders will provide liquidity to the platform.\n TP ICAP has broadened its footprint in global capital markets by offering new data and analytics services and rolling out new products.\n Dedicated crypto funds have seen record flows this year but major banks offering access must balance growing interest with the compliance headaches long associated with the cryptocurrency sector and increasing scrutiny by regulators.   read more\n Still, the move is the latest endorsement of the sector by Standard Chartered, whose venture capital unit said earlier this month it will set up a separate crypto brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, with Hong Kong&#39;s BC Technology Group  (0863.HK).   read more\n &#34;Investor interest in this new asset class has exploded dramatically in the last six to eight months,&#34; Duncan Trenholme, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP, told Reuters. &#34;In most of our conversations with clients, they want a separation of custodial roles from execution capabilities which is opposite to the models that exist currently.&#34;\n TP ICAP launched bitcoin futures and options on CME in 2019 and now plans to launch other derivative products including total return swaps and non-deliverable forwards.\n The platform is awaiting approval by Britain&#39;s financial regulator. Neither Standard Chartered nor Fidelity Investments have invested in the platform, TP ICAP said.\n (This story refiles to add dropped letters to name in headline, 9th and 11th paragraphs)",

"note_en": "The 400-person company,  which we explored in great detail in our EC-1, was co-founded by Luis von Ahn, the inventor of CAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, and Severin Hacker. One of the most revealing bits of its story? It\u2019s a route to monetization as a then rare edtech consumer business based outside of Silicon Valley. The company has had a somewhat circuitous journey \u2014 full of trial and error \u2014 on finding the perfect business model. It eventually landed on subscriptions, despite an original distaste for it thanks to its mission to provide free education.\n   The vast majority of Duolingo\u2019s revenue comes from subscriptions. In the most recent calendar year, for example, the edtech giant generated 73% of its total top line from subscription incomes. That revenue was followed by advertising incomes and the Duolingo English Test (DET), which represented 17% and 10% of its top line in 2020. (Notably, von Ahn hoped that  the DET would be 20% of Duolingo\u2019s revenue by 2019, a figure that it failed to reach by some margin.)\n  Its multi-part business model appears to be paying off. The company\u2019s revenue grew from $70.8 million in 2019 to $161.7 million in 2020, a 129% increase. Of course some of that growth would have happened sans the recent global pandemic, but it\u2019s not hard to see some COVID-related acceleration in the figures. Duolingo also reported $55.4 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2021, representing a 97% growth from the year-ago period.\n  But in more strict accounting terms, net losses have grown for Duolingo. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, for example, the company had net losses of 13.5 million, a sharp increase compared to the same period last year when it had net losses of $2.2 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s GAAP net losses expanded from $13.6 million to $15.8 million.\n It should be noted that the company\u2019s net margin improved in 2020, as its revenue more than doubled and its losses barely crept higher. The company\u2019s profitability or lack thereof should not prove to be a problem during its impending listing.\n In its S-1 filing, Duolingo provided a placeholder $100 million figure for the funds it expects to raise; we\u2019ll get a better idea of how much capital the edtech unicorn may onboard during its IPO when it sets an IPO price range after its roadshow.\n The former startup is effectively the kick-off to the Q3 2021 IPO season, one that several inventors have told TechCrunch will be more than active.\n Duolingo has raised $183.3 million in venture capital to date. Investors that have meaningful stakes in the company include NewView Capital, Union Square Ventures, CapitalG, Kleiner Perkins, and General Atlantic, which  recently got a spot on the cap table through a secondary transaction.\n At a run rate of around $220 million today and growth of more than 100%, Duolingo should not have a problem clearing its privately set $2.4 billion price tag. Unless public-market investors are concerned that the edtech market\u2019s growth is mostly behind it. That Duolingo grew by nearly 100% in the first quarter could temper such concerns.\n   TechCrunch is still digging its way through Duolingo\u2019s IPO filing, but we\u2019ve found a number of details that add more than a little color to its recent growth and business results. Here are some standouts:\n A \u201crecord low\u201d attrition rate in 2020 in which only four employees, or 2% of its workforce left the company.\n The company eventually plans to launch a \u201cDuolingo Proficiency Score\u201d across its offered languages, with the hopes of creating a \u201cwidely accepted indicator of language proficiency level and make Duolingo a global proficiency standard.\u201d\n It cited Apple\u2019s \u201cTranslate\u201d tool, an iOS app launched in 2020 that allows users to translate text sentences or speech between several languages, as a competitor in the \u2018risk factors\u2019 section.\n And finally,  it confirmed that it is seeking potential acquisition candidates to add complementary services to its startup.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:14:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "2020,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6587\u4ef6,revenue,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u6587\u4ef6\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fdIPO\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e862020\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e86129\uff05\uff0c\u5e76\u57282021\u5b63\u5ea6\u62a5\u544a\u4e8655.4\u7c73\u7684\u6536\u5165 ", "title_en": "Duolingo files for US IPO, reveals revenue growth of 129% YoY in 2020, and reports $55.4M in revenue during Q1 2021", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/28/duolingo-s-1/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u6587\u4ef6", "revenue", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "dbc11a87287f30bad92adbdda938a83e.jpeg", "infoid": 1068544, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u60e0\u666e\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4eadAero 13\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339; S\u6700\u8f7b\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u5f0f\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u3002\u8be5\u5668\u4ef6\u91cd\u91cf\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4e00\u5343\u514b\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u5ea7\u4ead\u5b50\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u5177\u670990\uff05\u7684\u5c4f\u5e55\u5230\u8eab\u4f53\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u3002\n 13.3\u82f1\u5bf8\u673a\u5668\u5177\u67092.5K\u663e\u793a\u5668\uff0c16:10\u7eb5\u6a2a\u6bd4\uff0c400\u4e2a\u4eae\u5ea6\u548c100\uff05\u7684SRGB\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u3002 Pavilion Aero 13\u5177\u6709WiFi 6\u652f\u6301\u548cAI\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u8bdd\u7684\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u58f0\u97f3\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u7d22\u8d54\u60a8\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u5145\u7535\u8fbe\u523010.5\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u7531AMD Ryzen 5000\u7cfb\u5217\u5904\u7406\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5185\u7f6eRadeon Graphics\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u8fbeRyzen 7 5800U\u3002\n   Pavillion Aero 13\u7531\u6d88\u8d39\u540e\u518d\u751f\u548c\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u6210\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u6c34\u6027\u6d82\u6599\u3002\u60e0\u666e\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53f0\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u662fEPEAT\u91d1\u724c\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u4e4b\u661f\uff0c\u88ab\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62e5\u6709\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4e16\u754c\uff06\uff0339;\u6700\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684PC\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; LL\u4e8e7\u6708\u4efd\u901a\u8fc7HP.com\u83b7\u5f97\uff0c\u5b83\u59cb\u4e8e749\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u4f60\uff06\uff0339; ll\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u79cb\u5929\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u6361\u8d77\u6765\u3002\n  \u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u60e0\u666e\u5c06\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e3a\u5176M\u7cfb\u5217\u663e\u793a\u5668\u9635\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u6b21\u8865\u5145\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5728CES\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u6761\u7ebf\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Eyesafe\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0cHP\u7d22\u8d54\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u84dd\u8272\u5149\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u989c\u8272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u6536\u7684\u6d77\u6d0b\u5851\u6599\u5236\u9020\u7684\u76d1\u89c6\u5668\u73b0\u5728\u5305\u62ec24\u548c27\u82f1\u5bf8\u578b\u53f7\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u97f3\u9891\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339; 7\u6708\u4efd\u53ef\u7528\uff0c24\u82f1\u5bf8\u663e\u793a\u5668\u8d77\u4ef7\u4e3a230\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u51e1\u4eba\u552e\u4ef7\u4e3a290\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n   ENGADGET\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u7531\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u56e2\u961f\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6bcd\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6545\u4e8b\u5305\u62ec\u8054\u76df\u94fe\u63a5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u94fe\u63a5\u8d2d\u4e70\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u8054\u76df\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u3002\n   \u7531\u4e8e\u60a8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u6b64\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5904\u66f4\u65b0\u60a8\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u8f7d\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b83\u3002 ", "note_en": "HP has unveiled the Pavilion Aero 13, which is the company&#39;s lightest consumer laptop yet. The device weighs less than a kilogram and it&#39;s the first Pavilion laptop with a 90 percent screen-to-body radio.\n The 13.3-inch machine has a 2.5K display with a 16:10 aspect ratio, 400 nits of brightness and a 100 percent sRGB color palette. The Pavilion Aero 13 has  WiFi 6 support and AI noise removal to reduce unwanted background sounds on video calls. HP claims you&#39;ll get up to 10.5 hours of use from a single charge. The laptop is powered by an  AMD Ryzen 5000 series processor with built-in Radeon graphics, up to Ryzen 7 5800U.\n   The Pavillion Aero 13 is made with post-consumer recycled and ocean-bound plastics and it uses water-based paint. HP says the laptop is  EPEAT Gold registered and Energy Star certified as part of its goals of having the &#34;world&#39;s most sustainable PC portfolio.&#34; It&#39;ll be available through HP.com in July and it starts at $749. You&#39;ll be able to pick it up from other retailers by the fall.\n  Meanwhile, HP announced two more additions to its M-Series  monitor lineup. The company  revealed the line at CES. They use Eyesafe-certified tech, which HP claims reduces blue light without affecting color accuracy. The monitors, which are made using recycled ocean-bound plastics, now include 24- and 27-inch models with built-in audio. They&#39;ll be available in July, with the 24-inch monitor starting at $230 and the larger variant starting at $290.\n   All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

", "note_en": "Accel and Canapi Ventures co-led the round, which also included participation from existing backers Bain Capital Ventures, Inspired Capital, Homebrew, Acrew, Primary, Clocktower and Box Group. The financing comes barely three months after Orum announced a $21 million Series A, and brings  its total raised to over $82 million.\n Orum CEO Stephany Kirkpatrick launched the company in 2019 after working for  several years at LearnVest, a personal finance site founded by Alexa von Tobel that was acquired by Northwestern Mutual in 2015 for an estimated $375 million. Tobel went on to form Inspired Capital, a venture capital firm that put money in Orum\u2019s   $5.2 million seed round  last August. Prior to that, the firm also provided Orum  with an \u201cinspiration check\u201d that was the first money into the business.\n  As a certified financial planner, Kirkpatrick says she saw firsthand what she describes as \u201cdeep cracks\u201d in this country\u2019s financial infrastructure. The fact that it takes days for money to move from one bank to another is not only inconvenient for many, but unnecessary, she believes.\n \u201cMost Americans are not familiar with the intricacies of ACH [automated clearing house) or why it takes multiple business days to move money between accounts,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cBut none of us can allow money to wait 5-7 days to hit our accounts. It needs to be instant.\u201d\n Her mission with Orum is straightforward even if the technology behind it is complex. Put simply, Orum aims to use machine learning-backed APIs to \u201cmove money smartly across all payment rails, and in doing so, provide universal financial access.\u201d\n Orum\u2019s first embeddable product, Foresight, launched in September of 2020. It\u2019s an automated programming interface designed to give financial institutions a way to move money in real time. The platform uses machine learning and data science to  predict when funds are available and to identify any potential risks. Its Momentum product \u201cintelligently\u201d routes funds across payments rails and is powered by banking providers JPMorgan Chase and Silicon Valley Bank.\n \u201cThey power the back end of our Momentum platform that allows the money to move on a multirail basis,\u201d Kirkpatrick told TechCrunch. \u201cThey power our access to real-time payments.\u201d\n Orum says it serves a range of enterprise partners, including Alloy, HM Bradley, First Horizon Bank and Zero Financial (which was   recently acquired by Avant ).\n The volume of transactions being conducted with Orum is growing 100% month over month, Kirkpatrick said. Most of its early growth has come from word of mouth.\n The remote-first company prides itself on diversity \u2014 in both its employee and investor base. For one, 48% of its 55-person headcount are female, and 48% are \u201cnonwhite,\u201d according to Kirkpatrick. Orum also recently joined the   Cap Table Coalition  \u2014 a partnership between high-growth startups and emerging investors who want to work to close the racial wealth gap \u2014 to allocate over 10% of its Series B round to underrepresented founders. For example, the financing includes investors such as the Neythri Features Fund, a group of South Asian women investing in the next generation of female founders and diverse teams.\n Jeffrey Reitman, partner at Canapi Ventures (a firm whose LPs mostly consist of banks), told TechCrunch that those bank LPs  conduct hundreds of millions of ACH transactions annually,\n \u201cThey need a path to achieving a state where funds can be transferred instantly,\u201d he said. \u201cOrum\u2019s product paves the path for many players in financial services and fintech \u2014 and beyond \u2014 to partake in faster money movement without compromising key risk principles.\u201d\n To Reitman, the company\u2019s major differentiators are its team, which he describes as consisting of \u201cthe best group of data scientists and engineers in the space.\u201d\n \u201cMany of their customers consider the team to be instrumental in helping to set the risk dials on how they fund transactions by teasing out key data and insights from historical transaction data,\u201d he said. \u201cSecond, Orum is building one of the densest and most comprehensive data sets around the risks of money movement. Better data means better risk models, and it will be hard for other offerings to match Orum\u2019s approach to building this rich data set.\u201d\n Accel Partner Sameer Gandhi, who joined Orum\u2019s board as part of the latest financing, agrees. He believes that in an 18-month period, Orum has built \u201cgame-changing technology and an exceptional team.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:13:48", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u603b\u91cf,bringing", "title": "ORUM\u63d0\u4f9bAPI\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5b9e\u65f6\u642c\u8fd0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad85600\u4e07\u7cfb\u5217B\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u603b\u91cf\u5347\u81f382\u7c73+ ", "title_en": "Orum, which provides an API to help financial institutions move money in real time, raises $56M Series B, bringing its total raised to $82M+", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/orum-raises-52m/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u603b\u91cf", "bringing"]}]
