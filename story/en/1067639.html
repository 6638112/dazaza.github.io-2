The system had “too much control,” Spears said, according to the investigator’s account of the conversation. “Too, too much!”</p><p> “她阐述了她认为保护统统已成为对她的压迫和控制工具，”在2016年报告中分配给她的案件的法庭调查员写道。根据调查员对谈话的说法，该系统具有“太多控制”。 “太过分了！”</p><p> Spears informed the investigator that she wanted the conservatorship terminated as soon as possible. “She is ‘sick of being taken advantage of’ and she said she is the one working and earning her money but everyone around her is on her payroll,” the investigator wrote.</p><p> 矛通知调查员，她希望保守党尽快终止。 “她厌倦了被带走的优势'，她说她是一个工作和赚钱的人，但她周围的每个人都在她的工资单位上，”调查员写道。</p><p> In 2019, Spears told the court that she had felt forced by the conservatorship into a stay at a mental health facility and to perform against her will.</p><p> 2019年，矛队告诉法院，她曾感到迫使保护者陷入心理卫生设施，并违背她的意志。</p><p> At the helm of the singer’s life and finances for most of that time was her once-estranged father, James P. Spears. James Spears, known as Jamie, was appointed conservator in 2008, shortly after Spears was placed in two involuntary psychiatric holds amid a series of public struggles and concerns around her mental health and substance abuse.</p><p> 在歌手的掌舵处，大部分时间都是她曾经是她曾经疏远的父亲詹姆斯·彭斯皮尔斯。詹姆斯皮尔斯被称为杰米的詹姆斯于2008年被任命为保守党，在一系列公共斗争和暗示中，在两名公共斗争和虐待问题中，矛在两只不自主的精神病患者中被占据了两名不自主的精神病患者。 </p><p>  The newly obtained court records show that Spears has called into question his fitness for the role. As early as 2014, in a hearing closed to the public, Spears’ court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D. Ingham III, said his client wanted to explore the removal of her father as conservator, citing his drinking, among other objections she had raised in what he called a “shopping list” of grievances.</p><p>新获得的法院记录表明，矛已呼吁提问他对角色的健康。早在2014年，在听证会上关闭了公众，矛队任命的律师塞缪尔D. Ingham III表示，他的客户希望探索她的父亲作为保守派，抓住他的饮酒，以及她所提出的其他反对意见他称之为申诉的“购物清单”。</p><p> Last year, Ingham brought these issues to the fore, telling the judge that Spears was “afraid of her father,” who remains a steward of her nearly $60 million fortune.</p><p> 去年，Ingham将这些问题带到了前面，告诉法官，矛是“害怕她的父亲”，谁仍然是她近6000万美元的财富的管家。</p><p> On Wednesday, Spears is scheduled to address the Los Angeles court directly — a rare move she requested on an expedited basis. It is unclear whether her remarks will be made in public, but her relationship with her father is expected to be a central topic.</p><p> 周三，矛计划直接向洛杉矶法院致辞 - 这是一个罕见的举动，她要求加急赛。目前还不清楚她的言论是否将在公共场合，但她与父亲的关系预计将成为一个核心主题。</p><p> Representatives for Jamie Spears, 68, declined to comment, citing the pending court hearing. But they have previously said the conservatorship was necessary to protect Spears from exploitation and harm and that Jamie Spears has been a dutiful father, acting out of love for his daughter.</p><p> 杰米矛的代表68，拒绝发表评论，引用了待定的法院听证会。但他们此前表示，保护卫生学生是为了保护长矛免受剥削和伤害，杰米矛一直是一个忠实的父亲，从事对他的女儿的爱。</p><p> “Any time Britney wants to end her conservatorship, she can ask her lawyer to file a petition to terminate it; she has always had this right but in 13 years has never exercised it,” Vivian Lee Thoreen, a lawyer for Jamie Spears, said in a statement to People earlier this year. “Britney knows that her Daddy loves her, and that he will be there for her whenever and if she needs him, just as he always has been — conservatorship or not.”</p><p> “任何时候布兰妮希望结束她的保护统统，她可以要求她的律师提交请愿书终止它;她一直这样做，但在13岁以上，从未行使过，“杰米·斯皮尔斯律师律师·李····莱昂·莱昂·莱昂在今年早些时候对人民的一份声明说。 “布兰妮知道她的爸爸爱她，当她需要他的时候，他会在她身边，就像他总是一直 - 保护统统一样。”</p><p> Theirs has long been a difficult and dysfunctional relationship, according to the court records and interviews with many people who know the family. But that dynamic grew even more complicated after Jamie Spears — a recovering alcoholic who has faced accusations of physical and verbal abuse — took the lead in wrestling what he saw as his adult daughter’s demons.</p><p> 根据法院记录和对知识家庭的许多人的访谈，他们的关系长期以来一直是困难和功能失调的关系。但是，在杰米矛之后，这种动态变得更加复杂 - 一种恢复的酗酒者面临着身体和言语虐待的指责 - 在摔跤时，他认为他被认为是他的成年女儿的恶魔。</p><p> Spears said her father was “obsessed” with her in the sense that he wanted to control everything about her, according to the investigator’s report. She could not make friends without his approval.</p><p> 根据调查员的报告，她父亲与她有“痴迷于”痴迷于她的意义上的意义上的意义上。未经他的批准，她无法交朋友。 </p><p> Even as she earned millions from a successful Las Vegas residency, she said she was limited to a $2,000 weekly allowance, according to the records.</p><p>据记载，她表示，即使她从一个成功的拉斯维加斯居住居住，她都表示，她的每周津贴为2,000美元。</p><p> Any mistakes resulted in “very harsh” consequences, Spears added, according to the report. The conservatorship “comes with a lot of fear,” she said.</p><p> 根据该报告，任何错误都会导致“非常苛刻”后果，矛补充。她说，保护统一体“带来了很多恐惧”。</p><p> After consulting with Spears, her conservators and her doctors, the probate investigator concluded in 2016 that the conservatorship remained in Spears’ best interests based on her complex finances, susceptibility to undue influence and “intermittent” drug issues, though the report called for “a pathway to independence and the eventual termination of the conservatorship.”</p><p> 在与矛盾，她的保护商和医生咨询后，遗嘱调查员于2016年结束，即根据她的复杂财务，对不当影响和“间歇性”毒品问题的矛盾，保守党仍然是矛盾的最佳利益，尽管报告呼吁“a独立的途径和保护统治的最终终止。“</p><p> The records provide only an incomplete snapshot of Spears’ sentiments and situation throughout a 13-year saga. Still, they present in great detail her discontent with the arrangement, in particular her concerns that her views about her father and his own behaviors were not being appropriately considered.</p><p> 记录只提供了一个不完整的长矛的情绪和整个13年的佐贺的情境。尽管如此，她们仍然存在与这种安排不满，特别是她担心她对父亲和他自己行为的看法并没有被适当考虑。</p><p> Experts say conservatorships should prioritize the wishes of the conservatee and help them regain their independence. The arrangements are supposed to be a last resort for people who cannot take care of their basic needs, such as those with significant disabilities or older people with dementia, yet Spears has been able to perform and profit for more than a decade.</p><p> 专家称，保护统统应优先考虑保守律师的愿望，并帮助他们重新获得独立性。该安排应该是无法照顾其基本需求的人的最后一个手段，例如具有痴呆症的严重残疾或老年人的人，但矛已经能够履行和利润十多年。</p><p>  What the court records make clear is that the battle over the conservatorship is rooted in the family’s troubled history.</p><p>  法院记录明确的是，保护统治的战斗植根于家庭的陷入困境的历史中。</p><p> Debbie Sanders Cross, Jamie Spears’ first wife, who remains his friend, said his own “very difficult upbringing” had influenced his perspective. “I really think that’s why he’s trying to be so protective of Britney,” she said.</p><p> Debbie Sanders Cross，Jamie Spears的第一任妻子留在他的朋友，他说自己的“非常困难的教养”影响了他的观点。 “我真的认为这就是为什么他试图对布兰妮如此保护，”她说。 </p><p> Jamie Spears had spent much of his life in Kentwood, a tiny Louisiana town where he was a star quarterback. His father, a boilermaker, was strict and demanding. “His daddy was so hard on him, but Jamie loved him and respected him,” Jamie Spears’ former football coach, Elton Shaw, recalled.</p><p>Jamie Spears在肯特伍德的生活中很多，这是一个小小的路易斯安那镇，他是星期六。他的父亲是一家锅炉，严格要求。 “他的爸爸对他来说太困难了，但杰米爱他并尊重他，”杰米矛的前足球教练，埃尔顿肖，回忆道。</p><p> Jamie Spears’ youth was marked by tragedy: His mother died by suicide on the grave of her infant son when Jamie Spears was 13, according to the local paper. Jamie Spears survived a car accident that killed a football teammate four years later. At 22, he was arrested on drug and driving while intoxicated charges, according to a news report.</p><p> 根据当地纸张，贾米斯皮尔斯的青年被悲剧标志着悲剧：他的母亲在她的婴儿儿子的坟墓上被自杀死亡。杰米矛在四年后杀死了一辆车祸，杀死了足球队友。根据新闻报道，在22岁时，他因毒品和戒毒而驾驶时被捕。</p><p> When Lynne Spears, his second wife and Britney’s mother, filed for divorce in 1980, she requested a temporary restraining order, citing a fear that he would “become angry when he is served with these papers” and harass or harm her, “especially if he has been drinking alcoholic beverages, as he has done in the past.”</p><p> 当他的第二个妻子和布兰妮的母亲在1980年提起离婚时，她要求临时限制秩序，引起了恐惧，他担心他会“当他与这些论文提供服务时生气”，骚扰或伤害她，“特别是他一直在喝酒饮料，因为他过去所做的那样。“</p><p> The couple reconciled, but Jamie Spears’ instability haunted Spears’ childhood, the family has said. In her 2008 memoir, Lynne Spears recalled years of “verbal abuse, abandonment” and “erratic behavior.”</p><p> 这对夫妻和解的夫妻，但杰米矛的不稳定闹鬼的童情，这个家庭说道。在她的2008年的回忆录中，Lynne Spears召回了多年的“辱骂，遗弃”和“不稳定行为”。</p><p> The family struggled financially, and in 1998, just months before the release of Spears’ blockbuster first album, the Spearses filed for bankruptcy. The couple divorced in 2002. Spears said later that it was the “best thing that ever happened to our family.”</p><p> 该家庭在经济上挣扎，1998年，仅仅几个月在释放矛的大片第一个专辑之前，这是破产的矛。这对夫妇于2002年离婚。矛队后来表示，这是“我们家庭发生的最好的事情”。</p><p> Jamie Spears was present only intermittently during his daughter’s rise to pop stardom. In 2004, according to a court filing, he went to rehab for alcoholism at the urging of his daughter.</p><p> 杰米矛在女儿崛起的流行明星崛起期间只是间歇性存在。 2004年，根据法院申请，他在敦促他的女儿康复康复。</p><p> But by 2007, Spears was struggling herself. Humiliation by the press, stalking by the paparazzi, speculation around her mental health and substance abuse and a custody battle over her two young sons helped lead Spears to a breaking point.</p><p> 但到2007年，矛正在努力。受到媒体的羞辱，狗仔队的追踪，围绕着她的心理健康和物质滥用，并在她的两个年轻儿子的监护权中，帮助牵引矛转到一个突破点。 </p><p> Jamie Spears reappeared for what he and his ex-wife, Lynne Spears, viewed as an urgent rescue mission.</p><p>Jamie Spears重新出现了他和他的前妻Lynne Spears，被视为紧急救援任务。</p><p> Along with his business manager, Louise M. Taylor, he prayed and fasted before he petitioned a judge for a temporary conservatorship of Spears, Lynne Spears wrote in her memoir. Taylor later became a business manager of Spears’ estate and an architect of her comeback.</p><p> 与他的商业经理Louise M. Taylor一起祈祷并禁食，然后在他向临时保守主义的矛队申请审判员之前，Lynne Spears在她的回忆录中写道。泰勒后来成为矛的遗产和她复出的建筑师的业务经理。</p><p> The singer stressed that she did not want her father in charge, a lawyer she consulted at the time has said. But the judge overseeing the case, Reva Goetz, deemed Spears incapable of hiring her own counsel and appointed Ingham, the lawyer who represents her to this day.</p><p> 这位歌手强调，她在当时咨询的律师并不希望她的父亲负责。但是，监督案件的法官，Reva Goetz认为，矛不能雇用自己的律师并被任命为代表她今天的律师的伊赫姆。</p><p> In February 2008, according to court records, Goetz deemed Jamie Spears “a suitable and qualified person” and granted him broad control over his daughter’s daily life and, alongside a co-conservator, her finances.</p><p> 2008年2月，根据法院记录，Goetz被视为杰米矛“一个合适的合格的人”，并授予他对他女儿日常生活的广泛控制，以及她们的财务。</p><p> “Everything he does, he feels is in the best interest of his daughters and his family,” said Mitch Covington, a friend of Jamie Spears’.</p><p> “他所做的一切，他觉得他的女儿和他的家人的最佳利益，”杰米矛的朋友Mitch Covington说。</p><p> Spears quickly went back to work. Within a year of being deemed unable to care for herself, she guest-starred on national television, released a No. 1 album and was preparing to embark on a run of almost 100 shows around the world.</p><p> 矛很快就回去工作了。在被视为无法照顾自己的一年内，她在国家电视台上主演，发布了一张专辑，并准备踏上世界各地的近100个展示。</p><p> Aside from his salary as conservator — now about $16,000 per month, plus $2,000 a month for office space rent — Jamie Spears was approved by the court to receive a percentage of various deals signed for his daughter.</p><p> 除了他的薪水作为保守主义者 - 现在每月约16,000美元，加上2,000美元的办公空间租金 - 杰米矛被法院批准，以获得为他的女儿签署的各种交易百分比。 </p><p> In 2011, he received a 2.95% commission for his work on Spears’ successful Femme Fatale tour. And in 2014, he was granted 1.5% of gross revenues from the performances and merchandising tied to her Las Vegas residency, “Piece of Me,” which went on to earn a reported $138 million across nearly 250 shows.</p><p>2011年，他收到了2.95％的委员会，他的矛盾成功的Femme Fatale Tour。在2014年，他获得了与她拉斯维加斯居住的表演和商品的总收入的1.5％，“我的一块”，才能赢得近250次节目的1.38亿美元。</p><p> The dual role of looking out for Spears’ best interests as conservator and reaping more profits each time she performed was “fraught with conflict,” according to W. Michael Hensley, a probate lawyer in California who works as a fee examination expert and is not involved in the Spears case.</p><p> 根据加利福尼亚州的加利福尼亚州的遗嘱认定律师的守则律师，根据W. Michael Hensley，作为保守派的守护者和收获更多的利润，以“冲突充满了冲突，”的双重作用是“充满冲突。参与矛案。</p><p>  Court records reveal Spears’ concerns that her father was hardly the person to be setting, and enforcing, the rules that governed her life.</p><p>  法院记录揭示了矛的担忧，她的父亲几乎不会成为制定的人，并实施治国的规则。</p><p> Spears’ first tour under the conservatorship, The Circus Starring Britney Spears, was designed to be a dry one, with cast and crew forbidden from drinking alcohol — or even energy drinks — around Spears, according to three people who worked on it.</p><p> Spears在Carryatorship下的第一次巡回赛，马戏团主演Britney Spears，被设计为一个干燥的人，禁止饮酒和甚至能量饮料 - 矛盾，根据这三个工作的人。</p><p> During this period, a former nanny and housekeeper for Spears claimed Jamie Spears engaged in “verbal abuse, tirades, inappropriate behavior and alcoholic relapses,” according to a legal letter sent in 2010 that threatened a lawsuit.</p><p> 在此期间，根据2010年威胁诉讼的法律信件，一位前保姆和管家们宣称，爪子矛队从事“口头虐待，提三，不恰当的行为和酗酒者”。</p><p> In 2014, Ingham told the court that Spears believed her father was drinking, according to a transcript of the closed hearing. Lawyers representing the conservatorship responded that Jamie Spears had voluntarily submitted to regularly scheduled alcohol tests and never failed. Jamie Spears’ lawyer said he took one random test, but refused to take any more, calling the request inappropriate.</p><p> 根据封闭式听证会的成绩单，Ingham告诉法院告诉法院认为，矛相信矛相信她的父亲正在喝酒。代表保守党的律师回应说，杰米矛自愿提交定期安排的酒精测试，从未失败。 Jamie Spears的律师表示，他拍了一个随机的测试，但拒绝需要多，呼吁请求不合适。</p><p> “Absolutely inappropriate,” the judge replied. “And who is she to be demanding that of anybody?”</p><p> “绝对不合适，”法官回答道。 “谁是谁要求任何人？” </p><p> Ingham told the court that his client was upset that it was not taking her concerns seriously. “She said to me, when she gave me this shopping list, that she anticipates that, as it has been done before, the court will simply sweep it under the carpet and ignore any negative inferences with regard to Mr. Spears,” Ingham said, according to a transcript.</p><p>ingham告诉法院，他的客户很难认真对待她的担忧。 “当她给我这个购物名单时，她对我说，她预计这一点，就像之前完成一样，法院将只是将其扫过地毯并忽略了矛先生的任何负面推论，”Ingham说，根据转录物。</p><p> Ingham also raised Spears’ urgent desire to terminate the conservatorship altogether. She had even mentioned the possibility of changing her lifestyle and retiring, but believed the conservatorship precluded that, he said, according to a transcript.</p><p> Ingham还提高了矛的迫切希望完全终止保护统治者。她甚至提到了改变她生活方式和退休的可能性，但相信保护统一体妨碍了，他说，根据成绩单。</p><p> In response to Spears’ request to end the arrangement, the judge said that if she established a healthy relationship with a therapist and returned one year’s worth of clean drug tests, she would take the matter under consideration. But she would not guarantee it.</p><p> 为了回应矛盾的要求结束安排，法官表示，如果她与治疗师建立了健康的关系并返回了一年的清洁药物测试，她将采取正在考虑的此事。但她不会保证。</p><p> Those gathered, including the judge and lawyers on both sides, raised the possibility that Spears’ boyfriend was provoking her discontent.</p><p> 那些聚集的人包括法官和双方的律师，提出了矛的男朋友引起她不满的可能性。</p><p>  In 2016, Spears released her ninth studio album and performed more than 50 times in Las Vegas. But in private, she was again protesting the conservatorship, according to a report written by a probate investigator. (In California conservatorships, a court investigator is tasked with conducting periodic reviews for the judge.)</p><p>  2016年，矛队发布了第九张工作室专辑，在拉斯维加斯进行了50多次。但是，根据遗嘱认证调查员撰写的一份报告，她再次抗议保护统统。 （在加利福尼亚州的Carramatorships中，法院调查员负责对法官进行定期审查。）</p><p> Spears told the investigator that she was “very angry” about the way her life was being run, and described security around her at all times. She was also being tested for drugs numerous times weekly, and her credit card was held by her security team or assistant and used at their discretion, the report said.</p><p> 矛队告诉调查员，她对她的生命正在运行的方式“非常生气”，并始终描述她周围的安全。该报告称，她还每周每周都有许多徒次对毒品进行毒品进行测试，而她的信用卡由她的安全团队或助理持有，并酌情酌情使用。</p><p> Spears wanted to make cosmetic changes to her home, like re-staining her kitchen cabinets, she told the investigator, but was forbidden by her father, who told her too much money was being spent.</p><p> 她告诉调查员，矛的矛想让她的家中的装饰变化成为她的家，就像重新染色她的厨柜一样，但她父亲禁止被禁止的父亲，他告诉她太多的钱被花了。 </p><p> The public image of Spears’ life gave little sense of the turmoil she was expressing privately. An Instagram feed presented her as playfully approachable, and a new, lucrative Las Vegas show was set to begin in February 2019.</p><p>矛的生活的公众形象对她私下表达的动荡感到很少。 Instagram Feed呈现出熟悉的平易近人，而新的Laucrift Las Vegas展会于2019年2月开始。</p><p> Then, a month before the opening, Spears announced an “indefinite work hiatus,” canceling the residency. Jamie Spears had “almost died” after suffering a ruptured colon, according to a statement, which noted the pair’s “very special relationship.”</p><p> 然后，开幕前一个月，矛宣布了“无限期的工作中断”取消居住。根据一份声明，杰米矛在遭受破裂的冒号后，“几乎死了”，这指出了这对“非常特殊的关系”。</p><p> That spring, Spears appeared at a closed-door hearing and read a statement. According to a transcript, she asserted that she had been forced into a mental health facility against her will on exaggerated grounds, which she viewed as punishment for standing up for herself and making an objection during a rehearsal.</p><p> 那个春天，矛在一个闭门的听觉中出现并阅读了一个陈述。根据一份成绩单，她断言，她被迫进入夸张的理由上的精神卫生设施，她被认为被视为惩罚自己并在排练期间做出反对。</p><p> She also claimed she had been forced to perform while sick with a 104-degree fever, calling it one of the scariest moments of her life.</p><p> 她还声称她被迫在104度发烧时患病，称为她生命中最可怕的时刻之一。</p><p> Spears ran down a list of her recent accomplishments, including tours and album releases. She told those present there was nothing wrong with her.</p><p> 矛队在她最近的成就列表下落下了一系列成就，包括旅游和专辑发布。她告诉那些礼物，她没有任何问题。</p><p> A transcript of the hearing was mistakenly unsealed, and portions were first reported by TMZ.</p><p> 听力的转录物被错误地未密封，TMZ首先报道了部分。</p><p> That summer brought further tumult. In August, there was an alleged physical altercation between Jamie Spears and Spears’ 13-year-old son. No charges were filed in the incident, but the child’s father, Kevin Federline, was granted a restraining order barring Jamie Spears from seeing the children.</p><p> 那个夏天带来了进一步的肿瘤。八月，杰米长矛和矛的13岁儿子之间存在据称的身体争斗。事件中没有提交费用，但是孩子的父亲Kevin Federline被授予禁止贾米·矛的约束命令看到孩子们。 </p><p> Two weeks later, Jamie Spears, citing health problems, temporarily stepped down from his position as conservator of Spears’ person and was replaced by a licensed professional. He remained in control of Spears’ money.</p><p>两周后，杰米矛，引用健康问题，暂时从他的位置逐步下降，作为矛的人，被持牌专业取代。他仍然控制了矛的钱。</p><p> By September 2020, a flurry of courtroom activity indicated publicly that something had shifted. Ingham filed court papers saying that Spears “is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret.”</p><p> 到2020年9月，一系列法庭活动，公开表明有些东西已经转移了。 Ingham提出的法庭论文说，矛“被父亲强烈反对这项努力，以使她作为家庭秘密将她的法律斗争隐藏在壁橱里。”</p><p> Ingham then filed complaints about the ways Jamie Spears managed the singer’s money, asserting that he paid excessive fees of over $300,000 to the firm of her then-business manager, Taylor. (In court, a lawyer for Jamie Spears called the fees reasonable.)</p><p> Ingham然后提起贾米·斯皮尔斯管理歌手的钱的申诉，断言他为她的当时的公司泰勒的公司支付了超过300,000美元的费用。 （在法庭上，杰米矛的律师称为费用合理。）</p><p> As the fight drags on, the bills are piling up — and, in a quirk of the conservatorship system, Spears has to pay for lawyers on both sides, including those arguing against her wishes in court. A recent $890,000 bill from one set of Jamie Spears’ lawyers, covering about four months of work, included media strategizing for defending the conservatorship.</p><p> 随着战斗拖累，账单正在堆积起来 - 并且在保守主义制度的怪物中，矛必须支付双方的律师，包括在法庭上争论愿望的人。最近从一套890,000美元的比尔从一套杰米矛盾的律师，涵盖了大约四个月的工作，包括媒体战略，用于捍卫保护统治。</p><p> At a public court hearing in November, Spears’ mother moved to support the removal of Jamie Spears as conservator. Through a lawyer, she called the father-daughter relationship “toxic” and said it was “time to start fresh,” adding that Jamie Spears had referred to his daughter as “a racehorse who has to be handled like one.”</p><p> 在11月的公共法院听证会上，矛的母亲搬迁支持杰米矛作为保守派。通过律师，她叫父亲的关系“毒性”，并说是“开始新鲜的时候”，加入杰米矛已提到他的女儿是“一个必须像一个人处理的赛马。”</p><p> That day, Judge Brenda Penny, who had replaced Goetz on the case, declined a request from Ingham to suspend Jamie Spears immediately, but left the door open to consider removing him in the future.
