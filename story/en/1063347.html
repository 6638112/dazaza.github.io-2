The  staff reacted by refusing to publish for a day.</p><p>   一个很好的例子是最近由华盛顿的首席执行官撰写的一个op-ed，即杂志，建议工人可能会失去医疗保健等福利，如果他们坚持继续循环地作为Covid-19大流行后退。工作人员通过拒绝发布一天来作出反应。</p><p> While the CEO  later apologized, she isn’t alone in appearing to bungle the transition back to the office after over a year in which tens of millions of employees were forced to work from home. A recent survey of full-time corporate or government employees found that two-thirds say their employers either  have not communicated a post-pandemic office strategy or have only vaguely done so.</p><p> 虽然首席执行官后来道歉，但在一年多的时间之后，她并不孤单地击退到办公室，其中数千万名员工被迫在家工作。最近对全职企业或政府雇员的调查发现，三分之二表示，其雇主要么没有传达大流行后的办公室战略，要么含糊地完成。</p><p> As  workforce  scholars,  we are interested in teasing out how workers are dealing with this situation. Our recent research found that this failure to communicate clearly is hurting morale, culture, and retention.</p><p> 作为劳动力学者，我们有兴趣取消工人如何处理这种情况。我们最近的研究发现，这种未能明确沟通正在损害士气，文化和保留。</p><p>  We first began investigating workers’ pandemic experiences in July 2020 as  shelter-in-place orders shuttered offices and remote work was widespread. At the time, we wanted to know how workers were using their newfound freedom to potentially work virtually from anywhere.</p><p>  我们首先开始在2020年7月调查工人的大流行经验，因为理性订单百次办公室和遥控工作普遍存在。当时，我们想知道工人如何使用他们的新发现自由，以便在任何地方几乎努力工作。</p><p> We analyzed a data set that a business and technology newsletter attained from surveying its 585,000 active readers. It asked them whether they planned to relocate during the next six months and to share their story about why and where from and to.</p><p> 我们分析了一种数据集，即通过调查其585,000个活跃读者获得的商业和技术通讯。它询问他们是否计划在未来六个月内重新安置并分享他们的故事，以及为什么和到哪里。</p><p> After a review, we had just under 3,000 responses, including 1,361 people who were planning to relocate or had recently done so. We systematically coded these responses to understand their motives and, based on distances moved, the degree of ongoing remote-work policy they would likely need.</p><p> 在审查后，我们刚刚在3,000次响应下，其中包括1,361人，计划搬迁或最近这样做。我们系统地编写了这些反应，了解他们的动机，并根据距离移动，持续的遥控政策的程度，他们可能需要。 </p><p>  We found that a segment of these employees would require a full remote-work arrangement based on the distance moved from their office, and another portion would face a longer commute. Woven throughout this was the explicit or implicit expectation of some degree of ongoing remote work among many of the workers who moved during the pandemic.</p><p>我们发现这些员工的一部分将需要一个完整的遥控器安排，基于从办公室移动的距离，另一部分将面临更长的通勤。在此过程中编织的是，在大流行期间移动的许多工人之间的某些持续偏远工作的明确或隐含期望。</p><p> In other words, many of these workers were moving on the assumption—or promise—that they’d be able to keep working remotely at least some of the time after the pandemic ended. Or they seemed willing to quit if their employer didn’t oblige.</p><p> 换句话说，许多这些工人都在继续假设 - 或承诺 - 他们能够至少在大流行结束后的一些时间远程工作。或者他们似乎愿意退出，如果他们的雇主没有责任。</p><p>  We wanted to see how these expectations were being met as the pandemic started to wind down in March 2021. So we searched online communities in Reddit to see what workers were saying. One forum proved particularly useful. A member asked, “Has your employer made remote work permanent yet or is it still in the air?” and went on to share his own experience. This post generated 101 responses with a good amount of detail on what their respective individual companies were doing.</p><p>  我们希望看到这些期望如何在2021年3月开始风化。所以我们在Reddit中搜查了在线社区，看看有什么工作人员。一个论坛被证明特别有用。提出的成员，“你的雇主让遥远的工作永久工作，还是它仍然在空中？”并继续分享自己的经历。这篇文章在其各自的个别公司在做什么时生成101个响应。</p><p>  While this qualitative data is only a small sample that is not necessarily representative of the U.S. population at large, these posts allowed us to delve into a richer understanding of how workers feel, which a simple stat can’t provide.</p><p>  虽然这种定性数据只是一个小型样本，不一定是大众人口的代表，这些帖子使我们能够深入了解工人感觉如何，这是一个简单的数据无法提供。</p><p> We found a disconnect between workers and management that starts with but goes beyond the issue of the remote-work policy itself. Broadly speaking, we found three recurring themes in these anonymous posts.</p><p> 我们发现从工人和管理之间的脱离，以外的工作人员和超越遥控程序本身问题。广泛地说，我们在这些匿名职位中发现了三个重复的主题。</p><p>  Others have also found that people are taking advantage of pandemic-related remote work to relocate to a city at a distance large enough that it would require partial or full-time remote work after people return to the office.</p><p>  其他人也发现人们正在利用大流行相关的遥控工作，以便在足够大的距离到一个城市搬迁到城市，因为人们返回办公室后需要部分或全职偏远的工作。</p><p>  A recent survey by consulting firm PwC found that  almost a quarter of workers were considering or planning to move more than 50 miles from one of their employer’s main offices. The survey also found 12% have already made such a move during the pandemic without getting a new job.</p><p>  咨询公司普华永道最近的一项调查发现，几乎四分之一的工人正在考虑或计划距离雇主的主要办公室超过50英里。该调查还发现12％的人已经在大流行期间已经这样一个举动，而不会获得新的工作。 </p><p> Our early findings suggested some workers would quit their current job rather than give up their new location if required by their employer, and we saw this actually start to occur in March.</p><p>我们的早期调查结果表明，如果雇主要求，一些工人将辞职，而不是放弃新的位置，我们看到这实际上开始发生在3月。</p><p> One worker planned a move from Phoenix to Tulsa with her fiancé to get a bigger place with cheaper rent after her company went remote. She later had to leave her job for the move, even though “they told me they would allow me to work from home, then said never mind about it.”</p><p> 一名工人计划从菲尼克斯到塔尔萨的举动，她的未婚夫在她的公司偏僻后获得更倾向于更便宜的租金。后来她不得不离开她的工作，即使“他们告诉我他们会允许我从家工作，然后说不介意它。”</p><p>  Another worker indicated the promise to work remotely was only implicit, but he still had his hopes up when leaders “gassed us up for months saying we’d likely be able to keep working from home and come in occasionally” and then changed their minds and demanded employees return to the office once vaccinated.</p><p>  另一名工人表示远程工作的承诺只是隐含，但当领导人“持续了几个月时，他仍然希望他仍然希望，我们可能能够继续在家工作并偶尔来”然后改变他们的思想要求员工送回办公室一次接种疫苗。</p><p>  Another constant refrain we read in the worker comments was disappointment in their company’s remote-work policy—or lack thereof.</p><p>  另一个持续的避免我们在工人评论中读到的是他们公司的遥控政策或缺乏的失望。</p><p> Whether workers said they were staying remote for now, returning to the office, or still unsure, we found that nearly a quarter of the people in our sample said their leaders were not giving them meaningful explanations of what was driving the policy. Even worse, the explanations sometimes felt confusing or insulting.</p><p> 无论工人是否表示，他们现在保持遥控，返回办公室或仍然不确定，我们发现我们样本中的近四分之一的人表示，他们的领导者并没有给他们有意义的对推动该政策的原因。更糟糕的是，解释有时会感到困惑或侮辱。</p><p>  One worker complained that the manager “wanted butts in seats because we couldn’t be trusted to [work from home] even though we’d been doing it since last March,” adding: “I’m giving my notice on Monday.”</p><p>  一名工人抱怨经理“想要坐在座位上，因为我们不能被信任[从家里工作]，即使我们自去年3月以来一直在这样做，”补充说：“我星期一发出通知。”</p><p> Another, whose company issued a two-week timeline for all to return to the office, griped: “Our leadership felt people weren’t as productive at home. While as a company we’ve hit most of our goals for the year. . . . Makes no sense.”</p><p> 另一个，公司发布了两周的时间表，以返回办公室，抓住：“我们的领导者觉得人们不会在家里富有成效。虽然作为一家公司，我们达到了今年的大部分目标。 。 。 。没有意义。” </p><p> After a long period of office shutterings, it stands to reason workers would need time to readjust to office life, a point expressed in  recent survey results. Employers that quickly flip the switch in calling workers back and do so with poor clarifying rationale risk appearing tone-deaf.</p><p>经过长时间的办公室窗口，它应该推理工作人员需要时间重新调整办公室生活，在最近的调查结果中表达了一点。雇主快速翻转交换机，在呼叫工人返回并澄清理由风险较差，出现色调聋。</p><p>  It suggests a lack of trust in productivity at a time when  many workers report putting in more effort than ever and being  strained by the increased digital intensity of their job—that is, the growing number of online meetings and chats.</p><p>  它建议在许多工人报告的时间缺乏生产力，而许多工人报告比以往任何时候的努力，并且正在增加他们的工作的数字强度增加 - 即在线会议和聊天。</p><p> And even when companies said they wouldn’t require a return to the office, workers still faulted them for their motives, which many employees described as financially motivated.</p><p> 甚至当公司表示他们不需要回到办公室时，工人仍然因其动机而导致他们的动机，许多员工被描述为经济上的动机。</p><p> “We are going hybrid,” one worker wrote. “I personally don’t think the company is doing it for us. I think they realized how efficient and how much money they are saving.”</p><p> “我们正在发挥混合动力，”一名工人写道。 “我个人不认为公司为我们这样做。我认为他们意识到他们节省了多少钱和多少钱。“</p><p>  Only a small minority of workers in our sample said their company asked for input on what employees actually want from a future remote work policy. Given that leaders are rightly concerned about  company culture, we believe they are missing a key opportunity to engage with workers on the issue and show their policy rationales aren’t only about dollars and cents.</p><p>  我们的示例中只有少数工人表示，他们的公司要求输入员工实际上从未来的远程工作政策。鉴于领导人正确地关注公司文化，我们相信他们缺少与工作人员有关的关键机会，并展示他们的政策理由不仅仅是美元和美分。</p><p>  Management gurus such as  Peter Drucker and other scholars have found that corporate culture is very important to binding together workers in an organization, especially in  times of stress.</p><p>  Peter Drucker等学者等管理大师发现，企业文化对组织的工人在一起非常重要，特别是在压力时期。</p><p> A company’s culture  is essentially its values and beliefs shared among its members. That’s harder to foster when everyone is working remotely.</p><p> 公司的文化基本上是其成员之间共享的价值观和信仰。当每个人远程工作时，促进这更难。 </p><p>  That’s likely why corporate human resource executives rank  maintaining organizational culture as their top workforce priority for 2021.</p><p>这可能是企业资源管理人员为2021年维持组织文化的劳动力优先权。</p><p> But many of the forum posts we reviewed suggested that employer efforts to do that during the pandemic by orchestrating team outings and other get-togethers were actually pushing workers away, and that this type of “culture building” was not welcome.</p><p> 但是，我们审查的许多论坛帖子都表明，通过协调团队郊游和其他聚会在大流行期间，雇主努力实际推动工人，而这种类型的“文化建设”是不欢迎的。</p><p> One worker’s company “had everyone come into the office for an outdoor luncheon a week ago,” according to a post, adding: “Idiots.”</p><p> 一位工人的公司“每个人都在一周前进入室外午餐办公室，”根据一篇文章，补充说：“白痴”。</p><p>  Surveys have found that  what workers want most from management, on the issue of corporate culture, are more remote-work resources, updated policies on flexibility, and more communication from leadership.</p><p>  调查发现，在企业文化问题上，大多数工作人员都有更多的工作人员是更加偏远的资源，更新了灵活性的政策，以及更多领导地位的沟通。</p><p> As another worker put it, “I can tell you, most people really don’t give 2 flips about ‘company culture’ and think it’s BS.”</p><p> 作为另一个工人所说，“我可以告诉你，大多数人真的没有给出2条关于'公司文化'的翻转，并认为这是BS。”</p><p>  Kimberly Merriman is a professor of management at the Manning School of Business,  University of Massachusetts Lowell;  David Greenway is a doctoral candidate in leadership/organization studies at the  University of Massachusetts Lowell; and  Tamara Montag-Smit is an assistant professor of business at the  University of Massachusetts Lowell.</p><p>  Kimberly Merriman是Manisachusetts洛厄尔大学曼宁商学院管理教授;大卫绿道是马萨诸塞大学领导/组织研究的博士候选人;而Tamara Montag-Smit是马萨诸塞大学洛厄尔大学助理商业教授。</p><p>  This article is republished from  The Conversation  under a Creative Commons license.
