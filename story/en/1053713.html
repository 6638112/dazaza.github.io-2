There was no flipping around to choose what to watch, and everyone watched the same things, unless you were rich enough to have a satellite dish. The television superstars of my childhood were of local origin, with foreign programs (mostly reruns) interspersed between.</p><p>在1962年的我的家园到1991年，只有一个可用的渠道：TTT，或Trinidad和Tobago电视。没有翻转以选择观看的内容，每个人都看着同样的事情，除非你富有足够的卫星盘。我童年时代的电视超牌是当地的，外国计划（大多数重新训练）穿插。</p><p>        Most shows were made by Trinis for Trinis. In the 1980s, Hazel Ward-Redman hosted  Twelve and Under and another program called  Teen Talent, where contestants competed for a trip to Disneyland in Orlando, Florida. On  Scouting for Talent, Holly Betaudier showcased the singing and dancing skills of courageous locals. &#34;Uncle&#34; Ian Ali hosted  Rikki Tikki, a weekday program for children. And on Monday afternoons before the nightly news, there was  At Home with Sylvia Hunt, a cooking show that celebrated local cuisine.</p><p>        大多数表演是由Trinis为Trinis的。在20世纪80年代，Hazel Ward-Redman举办了十二个和下方，另一个名为青少年人才的计划，参赛者在佛罗里达州奥兰多竞争迪士尼乐园旅行。在侦察人才上，Holly Betaudier展示了勇敢的当地人的歌唱和舞蹈技巧。 ＆＃34;叔叔＆＃34;伊恩阿里托管了Rikki Tikki，是儿童的平日计划。在夜间新闻之前，在夜间新闻之前，在Home With Hylvia Hunt，一个烹饪秀，庆祝当地美食。</p><p>    I grew up watching Sylvia Hunt. She was mature, gentle, precise. She had that old-school Trini polish and elegance in her manners. The dishes she made were proudly local, using our traditional ingredients and methods. Her first cookbook became an essential item in every Trinidadian home. She was our equivalent to Julia Child; her book was our  Joy of Cooking. If you lived in Trinidad and Tobago before 1988, you knew her as a consistent presence in our culinary world.</p><p>    我长大了看着西尔维亚狩猎。她成熟，温柔，精确。她有那种老学校的Trini波兰和优雅的举止。她制造的菜肴自豪地是当地的，使用我们的传统成分和方法。她的第一个食谱成为每个特立尼迪迪人家中的重要项目。她与朱莉娅孩子相当;她的书是我们烹饪的快乐。如果您在1988年之前住在特立尼达和多巴哥，您将在我们的烹饪世界中保持始终如一。</p><p>        If you never watched TTT before 1988, unfortunately, you missed out; Hunt died on June 13, 1987, and today, no film clips of her program can be found. Her most popular book hasn&#39;t been reprinted since 1985. Despite decades of success in her lifetime, Hunt has posthumously become one of the Caribbean&#39;s cultural hidden figures, a multitalented pioneer who deserved far more acclaim and long-term remembrance than she has so far received.</p><p>        如果你在1988年之前从未看过TTT，不幸的是，你错过了;亨特于1987年6月13日去世，今天没有找到她的程序的电影剪辑。她最受欢迎的书籍并于1985年被重印。尽管她的一生数十年来，但亨特已经追索了一个加勒比地区的文化隐藏数字，这是一个值得更赞誉和长期的多重宣传者纪念比她到目前为止收到的纪念。</p><p>    Sylvia Hunt was born in Trinidad in 1912 to Miriam and George Dryce. Her love for Trini cuisine and cultural traditions began early in her life. The back of her first cookbook,   Sylvia Hunt&#39;s Cooking: Proud Legacy of Our People, reveals that making  sugar cake with her mother was a transformative childhood moment, and her aunt, Mrs. Lydia Gittens, taught her traditional home economics, needlepoint, wine-making, and other domestic skills. She attended my alma mater, Bishop Anstey High School, and in 1935 she married Elliot Hunt. Together they had eight children: five girls and three boys.</p><p>    Sylvia Hunt于1912年出生于特立尼达，到了Miriam和George Detce。她对Trini美食和文化传统的热爱在她的生命中开始。她的第一张食谱，西尔维亚狩猎＆＃39;烹饪：骄傲的遗产，揭示了与她的母亲一起制作糖蛋糕是一个变革的童年时刻，而她的阿姨，Lydia Gittens夫人教授她的传统家庭经济学，教针尖，酿酒和其他国内技能。她参加了我的母校，主教Anstey高中，1935年，她结婚了艾略特狩猎。他们一起有八个孩子：五个女孩和三个男孩。</p><p>    Hunt leaned into her talents to support her growing family, winning prizes for her skills in food presentation, floral arrangements, and needlework. In the late 1930s, she ran a shop from her home in Belmont, selling all kinds of fashionable knickknacks of the era: buttons, buckles, buttons she covered herself. She sold artificial flower arrangements and decorations, she made dresses, and, when fashions changed, she started selling local goodies and snacks.</p><p>    亨特倾向于她的才能支持她的成长家庭，为她的食物演示，花卉安排和针线服装赢得奖品。在20世纪30年代后期，她在贝尔蒙特跑了一家商店，销售各种时尚的knickknacks：按钮，扣，她覆盖的按钮。她卖掉了人造花安排和装饰，她制作了衣服，当时时装改变时，她开始销售当地的好吃和小吃。</p><p>    World War II ushered in an era of austerity, limiting Trinidadians&#39; reliance on imported goods.  Calypso music during this time revealed a lean lifestyle, where Trinis were forced to consider growing their own food as much as possible. This was a time for adaptation and appreciation of local resources. Hunt was a master at that.</p><p>    第二次世界大战迎来了紧缩时代，限制了三角思人＆＃39;依赖进口货物。在此期间，Calypso音乐揭示了一个精益的生活方式，而Trinis被迫尽可能地考虑以自己的食物生长。这是适应当地资源的适应和欣赏的时间。狩猎是一个主人。 </p><p>    &#34;What I really admire and think she needs to be really celebrated for is that she used everything local,&#34; said Wendy Rahamut, a Caribbean cooking titan and cookbook author. &#34;She was the real pioneer and trailblazer for that, because in those days we had a big negative list. We didn&#39;t have an open market like we do now. Imports weren&#39;t as freely available as they are now. I mean, my mother used to have to buy butter and stash it. Sylvia Hunt really did use everything local, which is exactly what we should be doing now. Absolutely, I see her as a blueprint.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;我真正钦佩的是什么，认为她需要真正庆祝，是她使用的一切当地，＆＃34; Wendy Rahamut说，加勒比烹饪泰坦和烹饪作者。 ＆＃34;她是真正的先锋和拓拓，因为在那些日子里，我们有一个大的否定名单。我们没有像现在这样开放的市场。进口Weren＆＃39; t，因为它们现在可以自由使用。我的意思是，我的母亲曾经要买黄油并藏起它。 Sylvia Hunt真的确实使用了本地的一切，这正是我们现在应该做的事情。绝对，我认为她是一个蓝图。＆＃34;</p><p>    At home, Hunt would cook with her daughters, dishes like &#34;stuffed breadfruit roll, coconut cream mould, coconut drops and coconut sweetbread, and preserved shaddock (grapefruit) peel candy,&#34; recalled her daughter Diana Sambrano. In those days, the family lived in an expansive suburb of Trinidad called Valsayn, on a property liberally studded with fruit trees. Her granddaughter Patricia &#34;Pam&#34; Hunt remembers her grandmother&#39;s shed being filled with bottles of homemade wine and jars of homemade preserves. When the family moved to Stone Street, Port of Spain, a similar, smaller shed was built to manufacture and house the jams, jellies, and chutneys she sold. In later years, the family moved to the hills of Cascade.</p><p>    在家里，狩猎会和她的女儿一起做饭，喜欢和＃34;塞满面的面包果卷，椰子奶油模具，椰子滴和椰子甜味，并保存了沙德克（葡萄柚）剥皮糖果，＆＃34;回忆起她女儿戴安娜·桑布兰。在那些日子里，家庭住在一个叫做Valsayn的三角洲郊区，位于与果树之上镶嵌的物业。她的孙女Patricia＆＃34; Pam＆＃34;狩猎记得她的祖母＆＃39; s shed充满了自制葡萄酒和罐子的自制蜜饯。当家人搬到石街街时，西班牙港，类似，较小的棚子建造了制造和屋宇，果冻和她卖出的果酱。在晚年，家庭搬到了级联的山丘。</p><p>    In a time of modern conveniences like virtual meetings, working from home, and online school, it is astounding to reflect on the productivity of Hunt&#39;s life. As a business woman and mother of eight, she was elected to city council for northeast Port of Spain, serving as Alderman for two succeeding terms. She opened My-T-Fine Novelty Products in 1947, located in downtown Port of Spain. Her first standalone establishment showed off all of her skills: it was an eatery, a dress and floral shop, patisserie, and training school.</p><p>    在像虚拟会议这样的现代便利的时代，在家里和在线学校工作，令人惊讶地反映了亨特的生产力。作为八的商业女性和母亲，她当选为市议会西班牙东北部港口，作为市议员的两个成功的条件。她于1947年开设了My-T-Fine新颖的产品，位于西班牙市中心。她的第一个独立的建立展示了她的所有技能：这是一家餐馆，连衣裙和花卉商店，糕点和培训学校。</p><p>    &#34;Anything my mother thought of that could have been done there, was done,&#34; said Sambrano. My-T-Fine remained open until around 1985, a thriving establishment for almost 40 years. &#34;I remember my cousins would walk to school and they would have to open up the shop until [Sylvia] was able to come in. I remember the cash register had a little key and I remember cashing in a soft drink for 13 cents,&#34; said Pam, one of the grandchildren to be raised at home with Hunt.</p><p>    ＆＃34;我母亲想到这一点可以在那里完成，做了，＆＃34;桑布兰说。 My-T-Fine仍然持续到1985年左右，一个蓬勃发展的建立近40年。 ＆＃34;我记得我的堂兄弟会走路上学，直到[Sylvia]能够进来，他们必须开店。我记得收银台有一点钥匙，我记得13岁的软饮料兑现美分，＆＃34;帕姆说，孙子孙女之一被狩猎在家里举起。</p><p>    Hunt&#39;s roles in local government, her family of eight, and her popular business kept her busy enough, but in addition to all of that, she became a teacher at some of Trinidad&#39;s best schools, teaching home economics, sewing, and domestic science. She wrote recipes that were regularly featured in the  Trinidad Guardian. The recipes she developed during this time stood in great stead for her television show and cookbooks in later years.</p><p>    在当地政府的角色，她的八口之家和她的流行商家追捕，她的流行企业一直忙碌，而是除了所有的人，她都成为一些特立尼达的老师＆＃39;最好的学校，教学家庭经济学，缝纫和国内科学。她在特立尼达守护者中写了经常出现的食谱。她在此期间开发的食谱在以后在后期为她的电视节目和烹饪书籍站起来的替代。</p><p>    Television began in Trinidad and Tobago in 1962, and  At Home with Sylvia Hunt began in the early sixties. The program aired weekly for over two decades, with reruns broadcast after her death in 1987.  Ann Winston, who worked at TTT as program director and commercial production director, has fond memories of working on  At Home with Sylvia Hunt, as well as visiting Hunt&#39;s establishment.</p><p>    电视于1962年开始在特立尼达和多巴哥，在六十年代初期开始，在家狩猎始于西尔维亚。该计划每周播出超过二十年，在1987年死后，重新播出。曾在TTT担任计划主任和商业生产总监的安温斯顿，在家里与Sylvia Hunt一起工作，以及参观狩猎以及访问亨特和访问亨特建立＃39;</p><p>    &#34;In those times we wouldn&#39;t have called it a restaurant, we would say we going for food by Sylvia Hunt on Frederick Street! You sat down wherever they had a little seat,&#34; she said. &#34;You could get a lunch at lunchtime on a plate, whatever the menu of the day was –  coocoo and  callaloo, stew pork, very tasty.&#34; Winston remembers Hunt as a welcoming, encouraging, generous person who was comfortable working in her studio kitchen and would often share her wares with the crew.</p><p>    ＆＃34;在那些时候，我们将叫做一家餐馆，我们会说我们在弗雷德里克街上狩猎食品！无论他们有一点座位，你都坐下来，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;你可以在午餐时间吃午饭，无论一天菜单是什么 -  Coocoo和Callaloo，炖猪肉，非常好吃。＆＃34;温斯顿记得狩猎作为欢迎，鼓励慷慨的人在她的工作室厨房里舒适，经常与船员分享她的商品。 </p><p>    &#34;During her programs, she would make more than enough for the entire crew, which was sometimes as much as 12, so that we could all get something,&#34; said V. Dave Surajdeen, former cameraman and board member at TTT. &#34;At  Christmas however, it was a feast with ham, turkey, pastelles, macaroni pies, Spanish rice, [pigeon] peas, etcetera.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;在她的课程中，她会对整个船员来说，这是一个有时多达12的人员，所以我们都可以得到一些东西，＆＃34;戴夫Surajdeen，前摄影师和TTT的董事会成员说。 ＆＃34;在圣诞节时，它是一个盛宴，火腿，火鸡，蜡烛，通心粉馅饼，西班牙米饭，[鸽子]豌豆，等等。</p><p>  From the early 1960s through the mid-eighties,  At Home with Sylvia Hunt brought a specialized style of cooking into Trini living rooms across changing eras, offering comforting, consistent instructions on how to prepare foods known and beloved by a Caribbean audience. Her recipes involved ingredients like eddoes, cassava, and dasheen, coconut in all mediums (from liquid and jelly to shredded chunks), breadfruit (fried, roasted, or served in flavorful sauces), plantain, pigeon peas, and local vegetables cooked down with salted cod or pig foot.</p><p>  从20世纪60年代初到八十年代中期，在Home With Sylvia Hunt将专门的烹饪方式带入Trini Living Rooms横跨改变的Eras，提供舒适，一致的指示如何准备由加勒比观众所知和心爱的食物。她的食谱涉及Eddoes，Cassava和Dasheen等成分，在所有媒介中（从液体和果冻到切碎的大块），面包果（炒，烤，或在美味的酱汁中服务），植物，鸽子豌豆和当地蔬菜一起煮熟盐渍鳕鱼或猪脚。</p><p>      &#34;She was like an auntie,&#34; recalled Franka Phillip, former BBC producer, founder of  Trini Good Media, and writer of  Caribbean Beat&#39;s food column. &#34;I remember her quite patrician way of speaking and of course the famous way she said &#39;salt.&#39; She was the only local person on TV at the time, cooking. She became the reference point for a lot of people in terms of advertising and just in everyday speaking about food.&#34;</p><p>      ＆＃34;她就像一个阿姨，＆＃34;召回法兰卡菲利普，前BBC生产商，Trini良好媒体的创始人，以及加勒比击败的作家和食物柱。 ＆＃34;我记得她非常贵族的发言方式，当然是她说的着名方式和＃39;盐。＆＃39;她当时是电视上唯一的本地人，烹饪。在广告方面，她成为很多人的参考点，并在日常发言中。＆＃34;</p><p>    Regrettably, no video clips from twenty-plus years of  At Home with Sylvia Hunt can be found, just a few photos from the family collection. &#34;I&#39;m not sure what happened to the  At Home footage, as I think that the video tape recorders were recycled weekly. These were in the days of two-inch tapes that were not just costly, but bulky and heavy,&#34; said Surajdeen. &#34;Back in those days home recorders were not necessarily commonplace,&#34; added Phillip.</p><p>    令人遗憾的是，可以找到与Sylvia Hunt在家中二十多年的视频片段，只需几张来自家庭收藏的照片。 ＆＃34;我不确定在主页镜头上发生了什么，因为我认为视频录像机是每周回收的。这些是两英寸胶带的日子，不仅是昂贵的，而且笨重和沉重的，＆＃34; Surajdeen说。 ＆＃34;回到那些日子录像机不一定是普遍的，＆＃34;添加了菲利普。</p><p>    In 1985, Sylvia published her first cookbook.   Proud Legacy of Our People  quickly became ubiquitous in Trinidadian households, and the bold cover stood out among the weather-beaten foreign books in my mother&#39;s collection. Her intent with the red, white, and black cover was to showcase the cultural heritage of the people of Trinidad and Tobago with the flag&#39;s colors, but over time, the self-published books faded to a burnt orange. TTT alumni Ann Winston holds an autographed copy among her most prized possessions. &#34;One of my favorite recipes is her black fruit cake,&#34; she said. &#34;That recipe to me is the best recipe for making the black fruit cake. She has old-time things like  tooloom,  covity pocham,  salt paime; hers is a very good recipe.&#34;</p><p>    1985年，西尔维亚发表了她的第一张食谱。我们人民的骄傲遗产迅速在特立尼亚家庭中无处不在，而且大胆的封面在母亲的天气殴打外国书中脱颖而出。她与红色，白色和黑色封面的意图是展示特立尼达和多巴哥的文化遗产，旗帜＆＃39;颜色，但随着时间的推移，自我发表的书籍褪色为烧焦的橙色。 TTT校友安温斯顿在她最珍贵的财产中持有纯粹的副本。 ＆＃34;我最喜欢的食谱之一是她的黑色水果蛋糕，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;我给我的食谱是制作黑色水果蛋糕的最好的食谱。她有古老的事情，如of tool，covity pocham，盐尖瓜;她是一个非常好的食谱。＆＃34;</p><p>    Her second book,   Sylvia Hunt&#39;s Sweets, was a slender volume dedicated to local candies and childhood snacks made from shredded coconut, molasses, and fruit rinds, relics of delights abandoned once Western imports began to flow more freely. She was responsible for her own publishing, and consequently these books were available in limited edition. Her second and third books are even harder to find online. On forums across the internet, people lament that their copy of her first book was misplaced or stolen, desperately searching for a new one.</p><p>    她的第二本书，Sylvia亨特＆＃39; S糖果是一种苗条的体积，致力于当地糖果和儿童零食，由切碎的椰子，糖蜜和水果外皮，曾经遗弃的喜悦遗传遗传遗弃，曾开始流动更自由流动。她对自己的出版负责，因此这些书籍在限量版中提供。她的第二和第三本甚至更难在网上找到。在互联网上的论坛上，人们哀叹他们的第一本书的副本被放错了或被盗，拼命寻找一个新的。</p><p>    Sylvia Hunt lived to see two of her books published and was eager for the third. That book,   Sylvia Hunt&#39;s Menus for Festivals and Daily Use, was released posthumously in 1989. The back cover description goes into further detail: &#34;This third book was being compiled at the time of her death and was of particular interest to her, hence her family&#39;s wishes to have it published. Her collection of menus and recipes, published and unpublished, represent a lifetime dedicated to her country&#39;s cooking heritage.&#34;</p><p>    Sylvia亨特住在一起，看到她的两本书出版并渴望第三名。这本书，Sylvia Hunt＆＃39;节日和日常使用的菜单，于1989年发布。返回封面描述进一步详细说明：＆＃34;第三本书正在死亡时期正在编制对她来说特别感兴趣，因此她的家庭＆＃39;希望它发表。她的菜单和食谱，出版和未发表的收集，代表了致力于她的国家的一生＆＃39;＆＃34; </p><p>    Her third book offered ideas for celebrations like weddings, cocktail parties, christenings, and Christmas, as well as uniquely Trinidadian occasions like Carnival, Independence Day, Emancipation Day, and Indian religious festivals celebrated as public holidays in Trinidad and Tobago, like Divali and Eid al-Fitr. Her eldest son, John Hunt, wrote a foreword for her final book that reveals ambition deferred and muted by pragmatism: &#34;Sylvia Hunt&#39;s dream was to produce a book on Trinidad and Tobago&#39;s cooking that could rival the classic cookbooks of the English language. She realized the market and the time was not ripe to make such a venture viable, thus she contented herself in producing works which would gain popular acceptance.&#34;</p><p>她的第三本书为婚礼，鸡尾酒会，克里斯滕和圣诞节等庆祝活动提供了想法，以及狂欢节，独立日，解放日和印度宗教节等独特的特立独文的场合，以及作为波尔提和塔布戈的公众假期，如Divali和EID al-fitr。她的老年人约翰亨特为她的最后一本书写了一份前言，揭示了令人争议的救助和用实用主义静音：＆＃34;西尔维亚狩猎＆＃39;梦想是在特立尼达和多巴哥制作一本书和烹饪的书对竞争对手的英语烹饪书。她意识到市场，时间并不成熟，使如此风险可行，因此她满足了自己生产的作品，这将获得受欢迎的接受。＆＃34;</p><p>    Perhaps now, the market and time might be ripe for her return. We live in an era when pioneering Black women are being honored years after their time, in print and on film. People are more interested in growing their own produce, creating from local resources, and experimenting with recipes from far-flung places in a way that they weren&#39;t in Hunt&#39;s day. Maybe now an international readership and the ready audience of Trinidadians and Tobagonians around the world can appreciate the unique flavors and perspectives of her recipes. Perhaps now, an unassuming titan like Sylvia Hunt can be lauded for her groundbreaking and tireless work. Her surviving relatives have finally regained the rights to her intellectual property, and they are figuring out next steps on re-testing her recipes before bringing the book back to print.</p><p>    也许现在，市场和时间可能会成熟她的回归。我们生活在一个时代，当时的黑人女性在他们的时间经历了几年后，在印刷和电影中。人们对越来越多的人，从当地资源创造自己的产品，以及从猎人＆＃39;星期一天的方式尝试从当地资源创造出来的食物，并从事佛罗里达地区的食谱。也许现在是一个国际读者和世界各地特立尼亚人和飞机的准备观众可以欣赏她食谱的独特风味和观点。也许现在，像Sylvia Hunt这样的巨人泰坦可以为她的突破性和不懈的工作而引人注目。她幸存亲属终于恢复了她的知识产权的权利，并且他们正在弄清楚在将书籍带回打印之前重新测试她的食谱。</p><p>    &#34;We&#39;re in discussions with a publisher and our hope is for them to work with my mom to update the book over the next 12 months,&#34; said her grandson Christopher Sambrano. &#34;My cousins and I are excited about the prospect of honoring our grandmother&#39;s legacy. She made an indelible mark on all our lives.&#34; Sambrano has been put in place of managing the family trust, and all the surviving relatives are working together to make this dream a reality.</p><p>    ＆＃34;我们在与出版商的讨论中讨论，我们的希望是他们与妈妈合作，在接下来的12个月内更新书籍，＆＃34;她说她的孙子克里斯托弗·桑布兰。 ＆＃34;我的堂兄弟和我对纪念祖母的前景感到兴奋。在我们所有的生活中，她做了一个不可磨灭的标记。＆＃34; Sambrano已经置于管理家庭信任，所有幸存亲属都在一起工作，使这个梦想成为现实。</p><p>    The Hunt children and grandchildren view the republishing of her first book as a testimony to her legacy as a culinary figure, as well as a matriarch. &#34;After she died, I took it really hard,&#34; said Pam Hunt. &#34;I cooked no more. I baked no more. I grieved a long, long time. But now I&#39;m so happy. We have a What&#39;s App cousins chat, [and] now that we&#39;re moving forward on this project, we are so happy. People have been looking for the book. People want it. It&#39;s long in the making.&#34;</p><p>    狩猎儿童和孙子们看着她的第一本书的重新发布为她的遗产作为烹饪人物的证词，以及母系。 ＆＃34;她去世后，我真的很难，＆＃34;帕姆狩猎说。 ＆＃34;我不再煮熟了。我不再烤了。我悲伤了很长时间。但现在我很开心。我们有一个＆＃39; s app cousins聊天，[和]现在我们在这个项目上前进，我们很开心。人们一直在寻找这本书。人们想要它。 ＆＃39;在制作中。＆＃34;</p><p>    Hunt&#39;s path blazed a trail for many to follow. Wendy Rahamut credits Hunt for inspiring her own career in Trinidad as a television presenter, cookbook author, and leader of her own culinary school. &#34;She appeared on TV every week and her recipes actually appeared in the [ Trinidad]  Guardian newspaper the following week. My mom had clippings of her recipes, way back when,&#34; she said. &#34;So, fast-forward a little bit to when I started doing Caribbean Flavors,  a television show I started in 1998, I thought about her. I sort of did the same thing, air it on TV and then put it in the paper the next week. That idea actually came from what she did, and it worked really well.&#34;</p><p>    Hunt＆＃39; S路径吹过一个小径，以便许多人遵循。 Wendy Rahamut Credits寻求激励她自己的特立尼达自己作为电视演示者，烹饪作者和她自己的烹饪学校领导者的职业生涯。 ＆＃34;她每周出现在电视上，她的食谱实际上出现在[特立尼达]守护报纸上。我的妈妈剪了她的食谱，回到何时，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;所以，当我开始做加勒比风味时，快进一点，我想到了1998年的电视节目，我想到了她。我有点做了同样的事情，它在电视上透气然后在下周把它放在纸上。那个想法实际上来自她所做的事情，它的工作真的很好。＆＃34;</p><p>    Today&#39;s new crop of chefs and food influencers may not have grown up watching  At Home with Sylvia Hunt, but her legacy endures. The pandemic has forced more and more people around the world to recognize the importance of local cuisine, and the need to reduce food waste. More of us recognize the benefits of eating, drinking, and growing as locally as possible, just as Hunt did back in her day.</p><p>    今天＆＃39;新的厨师和食物影响者的新作物可能没有在家中观看在家中，但她的遗产持续。大流行迫使世界各地越来越多，以认识到当地美食的重要性，以及减少食物垃圾的需要。我们更多的人认识到饮食，饮酒和在当地尽可能地生长的好处，就像在她那天的狩猎一样。</p><p>    &#34;Now we need more people to do cooking not just of local dishes, but of dishes that use local products,&#34; said Franka Phillip. &#34;I don&#39;t think we exploit enough the possibilities that exist for Trinidadian food, and I think we need to do more of that.&#34;</p><p>    ＆＃34;现在我们需要更多的人不只是当地菜肴，而是使用当地产品的菜肴，而＃34;法兰卡菲利普说。 ＆＃34;我认为我们认为我们利用了特立尼亚菜的食物所存在的可能性，我认为我们需要做更多的事情。＆＃34; </p><p>  There&#39;s an old expression that we must give the greats their flowers while they are here, and make no mistake: Hunt got hers. She won awards for her homemade wines, jams, and jellies. She was awarded the national award, the Humming Bird Medal, in 1986 by the late President of Trinidad and Tobago, Sir Ellis Clarke. Despite it all, she remained grounded and diligent. Pam Hunt remembers a woman who worked hard for her family and her country. &#34;She gave her grandchildren high standards, and when I think of her, I feel so proud,&#34; she said. &#34;My grandmother had a TV show! She won a Hummingbird Award! But even though she achieved all that she achieved; she was so humble. I would never hear her bragging about accomplishments or anything like that.
