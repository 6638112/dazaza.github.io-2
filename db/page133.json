of the Vienna Medical Society\u2019s lecture hall. It was a grand and ornately decorated room where some of medicine\u2019s greatest discoveries were first announced. The evening of May 15 would hardly be different \u2014 even if those present (and many more who merely read about it) did not acknowledge Semmelweis\u2019s marvelous discovery for several decades.\n  What, exactly, was the doctor\u2019s advice to his colleagues on that long ago night? It could be summed up in three little words: wash your hands!\n At this late date, we all expect our doctors to wash their hands before examining us or performing an operation in order to prevent the spread of infection. Surprisingly, physicians did not begin to acknowledge the lifesaving power of this simple act until 1847\n It was then that Dr. Semmelweis began exhorting his fellow physicians at the famed Vienna General Hospital (Allgemeines Krankenhaus) to wash up before examining women about to deliver babies. His plea was far more than aesthetic; it was a matter of life and death and helped to prevent a deadly malady known as \u201cchildbed\u201d or puerperal (from the Latin words for child and parent) fever.\n In the mid-19th century, about five women in 1,000 died in deliveries performed by midwives or at home. Yet when doctors working in the best maternity hospitals in Europe and America performed deliveries, the maternal death rate was often 10 to 20 times greater. The cause was, invariably, childbed fever. And a miserable end it was: raging fevers, putrid pus emanating from the birth canal, painful abscesses in the abdomen and chest, and an irreversible descent into an absolute hell of sepsis and death \u2014 all within 24 hours of the baby\u2019s birth.\n The reason seems readily apparent today, if not back then. Medical students and their professors at the elite teaching hospitals of this era typically began their day performing barehanded autopsies on the women who had died the day before of childbed fever. They then proceeded to the wards to examine the laboring women about to deliver their babies.\n Dr. Semmelweis was brilliant but had two strikes against him when applying for a position at the Vienna General Hospital in 1846: he was Hungarian and Jewish. Medicine and surgery were considered to be the premier specialties in Vienna but because of his background and religion Semmelweis was relegated to running the less desirable division of obstetrics. Nevertheless, his claim to immortality was the result of an obsession with finding the means to end the childbed fever epidemics that were killing nearly a third of his patients. (The hospital ward run by midwives, without autopsy duties, had far better outcomes with their deliveries).\n Every day he heard the heart-rending pleas of women assigned to his care begging to be discharged because they believed these doctors to be the harbingers of death. Fortunately, Dr. Semmelweis was smart enough to listen to his patients.\n The obstetrician made the vital connection that puerperal fever was caused by the doctors transferring some type of \u201cmorbid poison\u201d from the dissected corpses in the autopsy suite to the women laboring in the delivery room. That morbid poison is now known as the bacteria called Group A hemolytic streptococcus.\n  Historians are quick to remind that Semmelweis was not the first physician to make this clinical connection, one that many expectant mothers of the era called \u201cthe doctors\u2019 plague.\u201d For example, the obstetrician Alexander Gordon of Aberdeen, Scotland, suggested in his 1795 Treatise on the Epidemic of Puerperal Fever that midwives and doctors who had recently treated women for puerperal fever spread the malady to other women. More famously, in 1843 Oliver Wendell Holmes, the Harvard anatomist and self-proclaimed \u201cautocrat of the breakfast table,\u201d published \u201cThe Contagiousness of Puerperal Fever,\u201d in which he discerned that the disease was spread by physicians and recommended that actively practicing obstetricians abstain from performing autopsies on women who died of puerperal fever as one of their \u201cparamount obligations to society.\u201d\n That said, it was Dr. Semmelweis who ordered his medical students and junior physicians to wash their hands in a chlorinated lime solution until the smell of the putrid bodies they dissected in the autopsy suite was no longer detectable. Soon after instituting this protocol in 1847, the mortality rates on the doctor-dominated obstetrics service plummeted.\n Unfortunately, Semmelweis\u2019s ideas were not accepted by all of his colleagues. Indeed, many were outraged at the suggestion that they were the cause of their patients\u2019 miserable deaths. Consequently, Semmelweis met with enormous resistance and criticism.\n A remarkably difficult man, Semmelweis refused to publish his \u201dself-evident\u201d findings until 13 years after making them despite being urged to do so repeatedly by those who supported him. To make matters worse, he hurled outrageously rude insults to some of the hospital\u2019s most powerful doctors who deigned to question his ideas. Such outbursts, no matter how well deserved, never go unnoticed, let alone unpunished, in the staid halls of academic medicine.\n Becoming more shrill and angry at each detractor\u2019s critique, Semmelweis lost his clinical appointment at the Vienna General Hospital and in 1850 abruptly left for his native Budapest without even telling his closest colleagues. In 1861, he finally published his work, \u201cDie Aetiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxis des Kindbettfiebers\u201d (\u201cThe Etiology, the Concept, and the Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever\u201d), in which he explained his theories on childbed fever, the ways to avoid spreading it by means of vigorous hand-washing and an attack on every one of his critics with a vitriol that still leaps off the page.\n Dr. Semmelweis\u2019s behavior became more and more erratic and he was finally committed to an insane asylum on July 30, 1865. He died there, two weeks later, on Aug. 13, 1865, at the age of 47. Historians still argue over what caused Semmelweis\u2019s mental health breakdown and subsequent death. Some point to an operation Semmelweis performed, wherein he infected himself with syphilis, which may also explain his insanity. Others believe he developed blood poisoning and sepsis while imprisoned in the asylum for what may have been an unbridled case of bipolar disease. More recently, some have claimed that the obstetrician had an early variant of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and was beaten to death in the asylum by his keepers.\n Semmelweis\u2019s professional timing could not have been worse. He made his landmark discovery between 1846 and 1861, long before the medical profession was ready to accept it.\n Although Louis Pasteur began exploring the role of bacteria and fermentation in spoiling wine during the late 1850s, much of his most important work initiating the germ theory of disease occurred between 1860 and 1865. A few years later, in 1867, the Scottish surgeon  Joseph Lister, who apparently had never heard of Semmelweis, elaborated the theory and practice of antiseptic surgery, which included washing the hands with carbolic acid to prevent infection. And in 1876, the German physician  Robert Koch successfully linked a germ, Bacillus anthracis, to a specific infectious disease, anthrax.\n Since the early 1900\u2019s, however, physicians and historians have heaped up high praise for Semmelweis\u2019s work and expressed sympathy for his emotional troubles and premature death. Today, in every school of medicine and public health, his name is uttered with great reverence whenever the critical topic of hand washing is taught. Sadly, in real time, he was derided as eccentric at best and, at worst, as an angry, unstable man who ought to be drummed out of the profession.\n The real truth of the matter is that his detractors were wrong and he was right. Dr. Semmelweis paid a heavy price as he devoted his short, troubled life to pushing the boundaries of knowledge in the noble quest to save lives.\n On the 165th anniversary of publicly announcing his landmark medical discovery, it seems fitting that we pay grand tribute to the great Dr. Semmelweis. Perhaps the gesture he might appreciate the most, however, is for us all to simply wash our hands often and well.\n  Dr. Howard Markel writes a  monthly column for the PBS NewsHour, highlighting the anniversary of a momentous event that continues to shape modern medicine. He is the director of the  Center for the History of Medicineand the George E. Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan.\n He is the author or editor of 10 books, including \u201cQuarantine!

It\u2019s another for millennials to move there in 2021.\n  Miami, Phoenix, L  as Vegas, and to a lesser degree Austin and Salt Lake City, have one big thing in common: From a human survival standpoint, they\u2019re terrible bets.\n Miami is one of the worst-positioned cities with regard to climate change \u2014 and the rising seas and heat that come with it. Miami is already the hottest major city in the U.S. year-round.\n Phoenix, located in the same spot where the Hohokam people  died from drought (and named for the city\u2019s hubristic ability to rebuild itself), is the hottest U.S. city in the summer.  Average (not high) June, July, and August temperatures hover around 103, 106, and 104\u00b0F, respectively.\n Typically a few degrees behind Phoenix,  Las Vegas is one of the hottest cities in the U.S. and depends on water from Lake Mead, a man-made water supply currently at its lowest level since the 1930s.\n Though less ticking time bomb and more slow burn,  Austin \u2014 the fastest growing city in America in 2020\u2014 sources 100% of its water from the Colorado River, a stressed water source that supplies a fast-growing population currently around  40 million people. Austin is also the nation\u2019s southernmost capital.\n Salt Lake City, another fast-growing Western city, also finds itself at the heart of the West\u2019s 2021 drought. Salt Lake City has one of the highest birth rates in the U.S. and is increasingly attracting a tech-focused crowd.\n  Drought and heat are largely perceived as ephemeral future inconveniences rather than everyday realities. Few Americans go thirsty or hungry compared to other arid regions around the world.\n  By the time I am in my 50s, these places will all be hotter, have more frequent droughts, more strained resources, higher crime rates, and lower economic output.\n  In the upcoming decades, the chances of an extreme heatwave in Phoenix will become increasingly likely. In such an event, water, transportation, and energy infrastructure would crumble, creating the  \u201cHurricane Katrina of Heat.\u201d\n The  risk of drought will triple by 2050. Note that Phoenix is already a desert with an average rainfall of 9.2 inches a year.\n There will be 115 days per year with a high potential for fires by 2050.\n  Miami is considered the  most vulnerable coastal city   in the world. What were once called \u201c100-year floods\u201d could occur regularly \u2014 meaning every couple of years.\n Miami is predicted to see 6 inches of sea-level rise by 2030 and 2 ft by 2060.\n Miami, which is built on silt, is also sinking into the sea. When sea levels rise, saltwater also infiltrates water supplies and septic systems.\n Miami, already the warmest city in the U.S. year-round, has warmed over 2.3\u00b0F since 1970. By 2050, expect 151 days/year to feel like 105\u00b0F or higher.\n Neither Miami, Phoenix nor any Southern or Western city will be abandoned overnight. Instead, growing heat will hurt economies, increase crime, and lower quality of life until people \u2014 slowly and then all at once \u2014 start to leave.\n  Unlike South Africa, which has experienced country-wide drought for the past three years, America has many places with excess water.\n Americans have options \u2014 but they choose to put themselves at risk for climate change?\n   It\u2019s no coincidence that the cities with the most tantalizing marketing campaigns have the worst long-term climate outlooks.\n Phoenix and Miami have to get creative if they\u2019re going to attract millennials to places that will be decidedly less pleasant in 20 years.\n With self-preservation (and real estate prices) in mind, these places have thought of some pretty compelling narratives to get you and me to move there against our better judgment.\n Phoenix has pitched itself as the West\u2019s affordable, sunny millennial city that\u2019s cleaner and more conservative (think: fewer homeless people) than San Francisco and Los Angeles. A person from San Francisco who rents a one-bedroom in San Fran can buy a house in Phoenix \u2014 or so the narrative goes.\n Miami is the crypto, tech hub of the future if you can forget that Miami is sinking and will not have much of a future. Miami is Wall Street South: New York with better weather, prices, and color.\n Austin is a version of Texas palatable enough for Californian migrants. The weather is sunny; the people are liberal; the tacos are great.\n Las Vegas is California without income taxes, great restaurants, and cheap enough for you to afford a house, rather than an apartment. It\u2019s also right next door.\n  Just like Las Vegas created the \u201csin city\u201d brand and the New York State Department of Economic Development owns the \u201cI Love New York\u201d slogan, Austin = big tech and Miami = crypto thanks to marketing dollars.\n One of the silver linings of excellent P.R. campaigns from climate insecure locations is that they\u2019ve done their research:  Northern cities should follow Miami and Phoenix\u2019s examples to become desirable millennial and tech hot spots.\n  Though much of Miami/Austin/Phoenix/Las Vegas\u2019 appeal is cultural, one fact does set them apart: They are notably cheaper than the larger cities to which they oppose themselves.\n    Though real estate investment groups are often blamed for the lack of affordable housing, the real problem is restrictive building laws \u2014 especially in desirable, liberal, and highly regulated cities.\n The above-listed places are cheap because they have lots of land and few regulations (to a fault, considering the aftermath of the Texas storm). By contrast, California is estimated to need  3.5 million additional homes by 2025.\n For the climate-friendly but less glamorous northern cities like Albany, Worcester, and Pittsburg, a successful marketing campaign could make them the climate-proof cities of the future. For New York, Boston, and Seattle, continuing to build affordable housing will be critical to attracting young people.\n  People moving West and South will affect your life, too \u2014 even if you live in Minnesota or Maine.\n Within my lifetime, we will see a mass migration from the South and West toward the North, not because these places will become unlivable hellholes overnight. Rather, the descent into heat-fueled economic uncertainty and discomfort will be slow \u2014 then all at once.\n Even if you are among the climate savvy who lives in a place with fresh water and liveable temperatures, you\u2019ll bear the cost of climate migration, too. For one, before people move North and inland, the federal government will subsidize living in these danger zones for as long as possible.\n The federal government has already agreed to help subsidize a   $6 billion  sea wall to help protect high-rise waterfront condos in Miami.\n Before you move South or West, consider the forces propelling you to do so \u2014 and the cost to you and your country of migrating later in life.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 07:31:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u505c\u6b62,stop,\u57ce\u5e02", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u505c\u6b62\u79fb\u52a8\u897f\u65b9 ", "title_en": "America, Stop Moving West", "transed": 1, "url": "https://burgesspowell.medium.com/america-stop-moving-west-9cda6a8d92d7", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u505c\u6b62", "stop", "\u57ce\u5e02"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "24b443fdf49e97e6dc0e97eeca4646dc.png", "infoid": 1066793, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "Two decades ago, before social media existed, Zygmunt Bauman articulated a perfect description of how it would soon shape our behavior and frame our relationships to one another. In his 2000 book  Liquid Modernity, Bauman wrote: \u201cSeen from a distance, (other people\u2019s) existence seems to possess a coherence and a unity which they cannot have, in reality, but which seems evident to the spectator. This, of course, is an optical illusion. The distance (that is, the paucity of our knowledge) blurs the details and effaces everything that fits ill into the Gestalt. Illusion or not, we tend to see other people\u2019s lives as works of art. And having seen them this way, we struggle to (make our lives) the same.\u201d The conditions Bauman described had already emerged in other media environments, such as television, but the participatory nature of the internet and specifically social media would compel everyone involved to develop an online identity, intentionally or not, that would correspond to their offline identity but would never quite mirror it perfectly. The personal brand, that groan-inducing pillar of digital existence, only occasionally amounts to the refined display that its most sophisticated instances embody. For most people, though, a personal brand is an accidental side effect of their digital presence, something they assume to be a faithful reflection of their \u201creal\u201d selves whether it really is or not.\n Even poorly constructed online identities, however, somehow manage to cohere into consistent wholes, thanks to the medium that transmits them. Every social media feed is an endless parade of these fragmentary identities, disaggregated into units of content and passing by quickly enough to evade the scrutiny that would detect their incompleteness. As Bauman presciently realized, the constraints of these digital environments and the sheer volume of users endows even the flimsiest online presences with an illusion of unity. Showing up frequently enough in the feed might elevate one\u2019s presence to a work of art, at least from everyone else\u2019s distracted perspective, and this in turn motivates us all to present our own selves more artfully. The speed of the information flow is essential to the entire illusion: A platform like Twitter makes our asynchronous posts feel like real-time interaction by delivering them in such rapid succession, and that illusion begets another more powerful one, that we\u2019re all actually  present within the feed. If you and I are both present, moreover, that implies that we\u2019re together, something that is always almost true within these social networks but never quite achieved. On Twitter every relationship is thus parasocial, even if bidirectionally so, and perhaps that\u2019s why digital relationships continue to demand in-person reification.\n Something I frequently joke about\u2014a dark truth that begs for humor\u2014is how social media requires continuous posting just to remind everyone else you exist. I once  said that if Twitter was real life our bodies would always be slowly shrinking, and tweeting more would be the only way to make ourselves bigger again. We can always opt out of this arrangement, of course, and live happily in meatspace, but that is precisely the point: Offline we exist by default; online we have to post our way into selfhood. Reality, as Philip K. Dick said, is that which doesn\u2019t go away when you stop believing in it, and while the digital and physical worlds may be converging as a hybridized domain of lived experience and outward perception, our own sustained presence as individuals is the quality that distinguishes the two. As I  wrote in January, silence is effectively impossible on the contemporary internet, where \u201cvoids are just filled by other people\u2019s content, and thus vanish instantly.\u201d The illusions that enable social media to feel like a primary reality (rather than a medium that supplements that reality) have become increasingly seamless and less likely to be broken, but  as Venkatesh Rao has observed, many users are sacrificed at the altar of this reality, slipping through the cracks and becoming \u201cdigitally homeless.\u201d This phenomenon, he writes, flourishes in \u201conline zones where, for whatever reasons, psychologically plausible and inhabitable personas have failed to cohere for a significant subset of people.\u201d The feed algorithms and interfaces treat these users the same way the actual homeless are frequently treated: by pushing them to the margins and concealing them from view. For the online homeless, as digital reality matures, maybe nonexistence is no longer an option.\n  This newsletter is supported by paid subscriptions, so consider\u00a0 signing up\u00a0to get the full experience.\u00a0If you\u2019re curious about the paid issues but hesitant to subscribe without reading one first, let me know and I\u2019ll forward you one to check out.\n Last week\u00a0I wrote about how the tech industry has subsidized \u201cpod life\u201d (and what happens when those subsidies end), the architectural interiorization of the built environment, and why the internet feels like an airport.\n   Measuring McCities: Mapping the \u201cchaininess\u201d of American cities\u2019 restaurant scenes, or \u201cfoodscapes where the food offerings in the landscape can be found just as easily in one place as in many other (often distant) places\u201d (thanks  Dan!)\n The British pursuit of the perfect football pitch, which transformed the sport globally and turned groundskeepers into stars.", "posttime": "2021-06-19 07:30:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53ef\u884c,minimum,warning", "title": "\u6700\u4f4e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u81ea\u6211 ", "title_en": "Minimum Viable Self", "transed": 1, "url": "https://kneelingbus.substack.com/p/162-minimum-viable-self", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53ef\u884c", "minimum", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9c9564ec6b4c72efeed52466ec517708.png", "infoid": 1066792, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Tmallphile\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u98de\u76f4\uff0cdammit\uff01\u201d\u5f53\u7ed8\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u521d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u516d\u5341\u4e09\u4e07\u516b\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u77ac\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\n \u8fd9\u542c\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u5f2f\u66f2\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7edf\u6cbb\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff01\n  \u7ed8\u5236\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u201c\u98de\u76f4\uff0c\u8fbe\u7c73\u7279\u201d\u7684\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528J\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u662f\u8feb\u5207\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\n A =\uff1aMonad\u5b9a\u4e49if\u3002 y\uff06lt;

2 do. 1 else. py =. a y - 1 gcd =. y +. py if. 1 = gcd do. 1 + y + py else. py % gcd end. end.)\n We\u2019ve defined our   a monadic verb to return   1 if we pass in a \u201cbase case\u201d value of   0 or   1. Otherwise, we recursively execute   a on   y  -  1 to get our   py, or \u201cprevious   y\u201d. Next, we check if the   gcd of   y and   py equals   1. If it does, we return   1  +  y  +  py. Otherwise, we return   py divided by   gcd.\n     This works, but it\u2019s very slow. We know that our recursive calls are doing a lot of duplicated work. If we could memoize the results of our calls to   a, we could save quite a bit of time. Thankfully, memoizing a verb in J is as simple as adding   M. to the verb\u2019s declaration:\n    While our initial solution works and is fast, it\u2019s not taking advantage of what makes J a unique and interesting language. Let\u2019s try to change that.\n The meat of our solution is computing values in two cases. In the case when   y and   py have a greatest common divisor equal to   1, we\u2019re computing   1 plus   y plus   py. Our imperative, right to left implementation of this computation looks like this:\n  We could also write this as a  \u201cmonadic noun fork\u201d that basically reads as \u201c  1 plus the result of   x plus   y:\n  Similarly, when we encounter the case where the greatest common divisor between   y and   py is greater than   1, we want to compute   py divided by that   gcd. This can be written as a  \u201cdyadic fork\u201d:\n  We can read this fork as \u201c  x divided by the greatest common divisor of   x and   y.\u201d\n Now that we\u2019ve written our two computations as tacit verbs, we can use the  \u201cagenda\u201d verb (  @.) to decide which one to use based on the current situation:\n a_a =: 1 + +a_b =: [ % +.a =: monad define M. if. y &lt; 2 do. 1 else. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y end.)\n If   has_gcd is   0, or \u201cfalse\u201d, we\u2019ll return the result of   py  a_b  y. Otherwise, if   has_gcd is   1, we\u2019ll return the result of   py  a_a  y.\n  We can elaborate on the idea of  using agenda to conditionally pick the verb we want to apply to help simplify out base case check.\n I find myself producing lots of ranging content from books and articles, like the one you&#39;re reading now, to open source software projects. If you like what I&#39;m doing,  nothing shows your support more than signing up for  my mailing list.\n First, let\u2019s define our base case and recursive case as verbs that we can combine into a gerund. Our base case is simple. We just want to return   1:\n   recursive_case =: monad define M. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y)\n Our function,   a wants to conditionally apply either   base_case or   recursive_case, depending on whether   y is greater or less than one. We can write that using agenda like so:\n  And because our   base_case verb is so simple, we can just inline it to clean things up:\n a_a =: 1 + +a_b =: [ % +.recursive_case =: monad define M. py =. a y - 1 has_gcd =. 1 = y +. py py (a_b ` a_a @. has_gcd) y)a =: 1: ` recursive_case @. (1&amp;&lt;)\n Using agenda to build conditionals and pseudo-\u201ccase statements\u201d can be a powerful tool for incorporating conditionals into J programs.\n  It\u2019s conceivable that you might want to implement a tacit version of our   recursive_case. Unfortunately, my J-fu isn\u2019t strong enough to tackle that and come up with a sane solution.\n That said, Raul Miller came up with a one-line solution (on his phone) and  posted it on Twitter.
