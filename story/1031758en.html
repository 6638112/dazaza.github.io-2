They wended through hobbled tables piled high with papers, walked past cubbies so chaotically stuffed with scrolled proofs no outsider could guess the system. The reporters reeked of five-alarm smoke, or had coat pockets bulky with notes and a pistol from the front, or were tipsy from a gala ball, or dusty from a horse race. If they held important news in those notebooks, a copy boy would crowd by their elbow as they wrote, snatch the ink-wet sheets from their hands, and rush them off to the copyholder to “put them into metal.”</p><p>记者们会气喘吁吁地爬上五段楼梯才能到达他们昏暗昏暗的新闻编辑室，那里的光线从蒙着灰尘的窗户勉强照进来，油灯上的绿色窗帘被烧得千疮百孔。他们摇摇晃晃地走过堆满文件的摇摇晃晃的桌子，走过杂乱无章的小隔间，里面堆满了卷轴校样，局外人猜不到。记者们散发着五级警报的烟雾的恶臭，或者上衣口袋里装满了纸币和前排的手枪，或者因为盛大的舞会而喝醉了，或者因为赛马而浑身是灰。如果他们在笔记本上记着重要的新闻，当他们写作时，一个抄写员会挤在他们的手肘旁，从他们的手中抢走墨水湿透的纸张，然后冲到版权持有人那里，把它们“放进金属里”。</p><p> The center of news in the nineteenth century lined the streets around City Hall Park, only a short sprint to Wall Street, close to the harbor. News sailed in on the wind. Newspaper schooners cut through the waves and fog to land their men onboard the arriving European steamers before the less affluent New York newspapers could get out there with their rowboats.</p><p>19世纪的新闻中心排列在市政厅公园周围的街道上，距离靠近港口的华尔街只有很短的距离。消息是顺风传进来的。报纸纵帆船穿过海浪和雾，在不太富裕的纽约报纸带着划艇离开那里之前，让他们的人登上抵达的欧洲轮船。</p><p> Amid recent renovations on Park Row, construction workers discovered artifacts of news reporters inside the walls—papers and typewriters. Who knows what ghosts might lurk there still?</p><p>在公园街最近的翻修中，建筑工人在墙上发现了新闻记者的文物-报纸和打字机。谁知道那里还会潜伏着什么鬼魂呢？</p><p> “Journalism is the real Minotaur,” nineteenth-century reporter Stephen Fiske remarked, looking back on his career. “It demands every year a fresh supply of young men and women: devours them, destroys them, and is ready for another batch of tender victims from colleges or country towns.” He had begun as a columnist at age twelve. Other reporters jumped in audaciously in their twenties, such as Henry Villard, a German immigrant who rapidly taught himself English so as to cover the Lincoln–Douglas debates.</p><p>“新闻业才是真正的牛头人，”19世纪的记者斯蒂芬·菲斯克(Stephen Fiske)在回顾自己的职业生涯时说。它要求每年都有新的青年男女供应：吞噬他们，摧毁他们，并准备迎接另一批来自大学或乡村城镇的年轻受害者。他十二岁就开始当专栏作家了。其他记者在20多岁的时候大胆地跳了进来，比如德国移民亨利·维拉德(Henry Villard)，他迅速自学了英语，以便报道林肯和道格拉斯的辩论。</p><p> They were almost entirely anonymous. Inherited British etiquette dictated that to claim a byline would be immodest. It would risk encouraging flamboyance, even spark recklessness. Instead, they represented their team: the  New York Times, the  New-York Tribune, the  New York Herald, and on. Like a priest of the same era forbidden to use  I, reporters denied themselves the honor of possessing their writing. They seeded their identity into the words themselves.</p><p>他们几乎完全是匿名的。继承的英国礼仪规定，要求署名是不谦虚的。这可能会鼓励炫耀，甚至会引发鲁莽行为。相反，他们代表自己的团队：“纽约时报”、“纽约论坛报”、“纽约先驱报”等等。就像同时代的牧师被禁止使用I一样，记者们否定了自己拥有自己作品的荣誉。他们把自己的身份植入单词本身。</p><p> They wrote well to impress the reporter seated next to them, or rivals at the other papers. They strove to create in words the moving image of an event or the quirks of an important person. Photographic evidence was scant at that time. Reporters needed to be the eyes for those too far away to see. They wrote well to lasso in the readers who constantly strayed. Three-quarters of a newspaper’s customers faded away each year, and newspapers needed to lure fresh ones.</p><p>他们写得很好，以打动坐在他们旁边的记者，或者其他报纸的竞争对手。他们努力用语言创造一个事件的动人形象或一个重要人物的怪癖。当时的摄影证据很少。记者需要成为那些太远而看不见的人的眼睛。他们在不断迷途的读者中写得很好。一家报纸每年有四分之三的客户流失，报纸需要吸引新的客户。</p><p> The reporters wrote fast. They fed the street-level, steam-driven presses that each inked some fifty miles of paper each day. They wrote to feed the conveyor belt of hooks that ran along the ceiling, from the editor to the foreman to the typographer. Stories hung like cow carcasses headed to butchery. “The fevered pencil flies, every nerve is strained, every brain-cell is clear,” wrote one reporter of that time. “Comment, description, reminiscence, dialogue, and explanation flow upon the impatient sheets in short paragraphs, like slivers of crystal,” wrote Julian Ralph, a British reporter who worked in New York City, in 1893.</p><p>记者们写得很快。他们供给街道水平的蒸汽驱动的印刷机，每台印刷机每天为大约50英里的纸张墨水。他们写信给沿着天花板延伸的吊钩传送带，从编辑到工头再到排字工人。故事就像要去屠宰的牛的身体一样悬而未决。当时的一位记者写道：“发烧的铅笔飞舞，每条神经都紧张，每一个脑细胞都是清晰的。”1893年，在纽约市工作的英国记者朱利安·拉尔夫(Julian Ralph)写道：“评论、描述、回忆、对话和解释就像水晶条一样，在不耐烦的小段落上流动。”</p><p> They focused even amid the clicking of the telegraph, the shouting of the editors, the joking of the office boy, and the copy cutters pressing their deadlines. The only relief came when the Associated Press marked the final delivery of the day’s breaking news. “Over the wires and at the end of the last sheet of flimsy has come the welcome message, ‘Good-night,’ ” one editor, Melville Philips, recalled.</p><p>即使在电报的滴答声，编辑的叫喊声，勤杂工的玩笑声，以及赶着最后期限的剪贴工的声音中，他们仍然专注于此。当美联社(Associated Press)标志着当天突发新闻的最终送达时，唯一的解脱出现了。一位名叫梅尔维尔·菲利普斯的编辑回忆说：“通过电线，在薄薄的最后一张纸的末尾传来了欢迎语，‘晚安，’ ”，编辑梅尔维尔·菲利普斯(Melville Philips)回忆道。</p><p> The reporters mixed among the rich for sources or dared to knock at the most squalid crime dens. They heard out their critics; one tall, thin writer bent like a hook to politely listen to the manager of the theater whose production he had unflatteringly dissected, begged repetition (indicating bad hearing), and then, having failed to make out the tirade a second time, asked again and again, until wrath had withered.</p><p>记者混杂在富人中寻找消息来源，或者敢于敲打最肮脏的犯罪窝点。他们听完了批评者的话；一个又高又瘦的作家像钩子一样礼貌地弯下腰，礼貌地听着他不讨好地剖析了剧院经理的演出，恳求重复(表明听力不好)，然后，由于第二次听不懂长篇大论，他再三询问，直到愤怒平息。</p><p> They competed to file. News lay out in distant towns and the reporter would pluck it like a giant’s eye and race back with the prize to send over the closest telegraph. Julian Ralph remembered competing with a  Tribune man when out on assignment. “We had to run three miles over a plain that was one great glare of ice. He was the faster runner and appeared to have everything his own way, but suddenly he slipped and rolled down the side of a gully to fetch up at the bottom badly hurt. The tearing of his clothes and peeling of his face did not bother him, but his ankle was sprained and he could not walk without help. ‘I give up,’ said he. ‘Will you help me to the village?’ ‘I don’t know,” I replied. “Is the wire mine?’ ”</p><p>他们争先恐后地提交文件。新闻散布在遥远的城镇，记者会像巨人的眼睛一样把它挖出来，然后带着奖品跑回来，把最近的电报发过来。朱利安·拉尔夫(Julian Ralph)记得在执行任务时与一名论坛报人竞争。“我们不得不在一片冰光灿烂的平原上跑了3英里。他是跑得最快的人，似乎一切都随心所欲，但突然他滑了一跤，滚下了沟壑，从谷底爬了上来，伤得很重。衣服的撕裂和脸部的脱皮并没有打扰到他，但他的脚踝扭伤了，没有人帮助他无法行走。“我放弃了，”他说。“你能帮我到村子里去吗？”“我不知道，”我回答。“这根电线是我的吗？‘ ’”</p><p> Though readers rarely knew who wrote what, the reporters knew each other well. Journalists scuffled in the streets, smacked each other with canes. They celebrated in private gathering spots. A few might be sufficiently bohemian enough to share a beer at Pfaff’s on Broadway near Bleecker with Walt Whitman, the former editor of the  Brooklyn Eagle, or have angled into respectability at the Lotos Club. But they more likely visited the Bread and Cheese Club on Broadway and Reade Streets or the Sketch Club.</p><p>虽然读者很少知道谁写了什么，但记者们彼此都很了解。记者们在街上扭打，用手杖打对方。他们在私人聚会场所庆祝。有些人可能足够放荡不羁，在布利克附近百老汇的Pfaff‘s与布鲁克林鹰(Brooklyn Eagle)的前编辑沃尔特·惠特曼(Walt Whitman)喝上一杯啤酒，或者已经在洛托斯俱乐部(Lotos Club)获得了尊敬。但他们更有可能去百老汇和里德街的面包奶酪俱乐部或素描俱乐部。</p><p> They understood how to dowse for a story, to identify the vibrating image that could stir emotion. A reporter remembered a day with nothing but fourth-rate news unfolding, when he scanned every line of the afternoon paper with the managing editor, hunting for the next day’s feature. The managing editor yelled out, “I have it!” A tiny baby girl had been found buried in Harlem. “The only uncommon item was that the infant was richly dressed.”</p><p>他们知道如何探寻故事，识别能够激起情感的振动图像。一位记者回忆起那一天，除了四流的新闻，他和执行主编一起浏览了下午报纸的每一行，寻找第二天的专题。主编大声喊道：“我拿到了！”一名小女婴被发现埋在哈莱姆区。“唯一不寻常的是这个婴儿衣着华丽。”</p><p> The managing editor gave the orders: “See the place where the baby was found, the policeman who found it; follow it to Matron Webb’s room in the police headquarters, where all foundlings are first taken, and get a long full account from the matron of … the most remarkable, the strangest, most pathetic, moving or stirring experiences she has had… Then … go to the asylum where these babies are brought up, and to the Potter’s Field where they are buried.”</p><p>执行主编发出命令：“看看婴儿被发现的地方，找到它的警察；跟着它到警察总部的韦伯护士长的房间，所有的弃婴都是在那里第一次被带走的，然后从…的护士长那里得到一份详细的长篇报告。…她经历过的最不寻常的、最奇怪的、最可悲的、感人的或激动人心的经历。然后是…。到抚养这些婴儿的精神病院去，到埋葬他们的陶工地里去。“。</p><p> William Cullen Bryant, editor at the  Evening Post and a poet, hung on the newsroom wall his “Index Expurgatorious” for writers, his commandments for striking out words that failed to chime the way others could: “Jeapordize should not be used.” “Gratuitous means ‘without payment.’ ” “Jewelry for jewels.” Don’t use “bulls and bears” for Wall Street.</p><p>“晚邮报”(The Evening Post)编辑、诗人威廉·卡伦·布莱恩特(William Cullen Bryant)把他为作家们写的“无可挑剔的索引”(Index Expurgatous)挂在编辑室的墙上，这是他的戒律：“不应该使用Jeapordize。”“无偿的意思是‘免费’。”“珠宝换珠宝。”不要用“牛市和熊市”来形容华尔街。</p><p> They sacrificed human comforts, like Gerald Hallock who stayed in the city to run the  Journal of Commerce while his family lived in New Haven. He collapsed onto a cot in the office each night, took lonely dinners in restaurants, and “slept on his arms,” the image of a man devoted to his desk. When reporting a fire, he fell into a newly dug cellar in the dark streets. “I sat down on the curbstone to rub myself, and, seeing the light of the fire brighten up, I started for it,” he told a friend.</p><p>他们牺牲了人类的舒适，比如杰拉尔德·哈洛克(Gerald Hallock)，当他的家人住在纽黑文时，他留在了这座城市经营《商业日报》(Journal Of Commerce)。他每天晚上瘫倒在办公室的小床上，孤独地在餐厅用餐，“双臂睡觉”，这是一个专心致志于办公桌的人的形象。在报告火灾时，他掉进了黑暗街道上新挖的地窖里。他告诉一位朋友：“我坐在路边石上摩擦自己，看到火光亮了，我就出发了。”</p><p> Julian Ralph remembers the wealthiest man in the country, baffled, observing to him after an interview: “You mastered the intricacies of financial matters in hours and yet you persist in this profession with no pecuniary gain unless one’s aim is to run a paper?” Ralph had no satisfactory answer. His desire to use his intellect to fill newspaper columns was inexplicable except as a relationship with fellow journalists and the dead ones.</p><p>朱利安·拉尔夫(Julian Ralph)记得美国最富有的人，在一次采访后困惑地对他说：“你在几个小时内就掌握了错综复杂的金融事务，但除非你的目标是经营一家报纸，否则你坚持这一职业，没有任何金钱上的收益？”拉尔夫没有令人满意的答案。他想用自己的才智填满报纸专栏的愿望令人费解，除了与同行记者和已故记者的关系。</p><p> Because of their anonymous voices, we know about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, and Lincoln’s sorrows, and the draft riots, when violent white mobs beat passersby, lynched and mutilated Black people, and torched homes. The anonymous journalists reported those incidents including peculiar details, such as expensive pianos smashed with pickaxes, mirrors shattered by stones. “One fellow appeared at a window with a picture of the President, spat on it, split it over his knee and hurled it into the street, where it was quickly trampled into atoms. Then, in a half a dozen places at once, the flames burst forth. So rapidly did they spread that some of the plunderers in the house had to escape from the windows by means of ladders.”</p><p>因为他们的匿名声音，我们知道了三角短裙厂大火，林肯的悲伤，以及征兵骚乱，当时暴力的白人暴徒殴打路人，私刑处死和肢解黑人，烧毁房屋。匿名记者报道了这些事件，包括奇怪的细节，比如昂贵的钢琴被锄头砸碎，镜子被石头砸碎。“一个人拿着总统的画像出现在窗户前，朝上面吐口水，把它扔到膝盖上，扔到街上，很快就被践踏成了原子。然后，六个地方同时冒出了大火。它们蔓延得如此之快，以至于房子里的一些掠夺者不得不通过梯子从窗户逃脱。“。</p><p> They covered the heat wave of 1896 during which fifteen hundred New Yorkers perished. “The spot that was perhaps hottest of all was the glaring asphalted pass in front of the City Hall. A man threw up his hands and fell there shortly before noon. A thermometer on the steps at the time held mercury that was at the 112-degree mark.”</p><p>他们报道了1896年的热浪，在那次热浪中，1500名纽约人丧生。“最热的地方可能是市政厅前耀眼的沥青路。中午前不久，一名男子举起双手摔倒在那里。当时台阶上的温度计显示水银达到112华氏度。“。</p><p> Or those that survived: “The close structure of the lower part of the Third Avenue Elevated Railroad was a boon to the east side all day. Under it was real shade and were it not for the humidity the shelter would have been perfect. Hundreds of boys sat along the curbs, too listless for play or mischief. Men came out of the broiling sun above Canal Street or below the City Hall and stopped to rest and breathe beneath the rumbling trains.”</p><p>或者那些幸存下来的人：“第三大道高架铁路下部的封闭结构对东区来说是一天的恩惠。它的下面是真正的阴凉处，如果不是因为潮湿，这个避难所就会很完美了。成百上千的男孩坐在路边，没精打采地玩耍或调皮捣蛋。人们从运河街上方或市政厅下方的烈日中走出来，在隆隆作响的火车下停下来休息呼吸。“。</p><p> They climbed the inner scaffolding of the Statue of Liberty before it was clad with copper, describing the experience in the third person. “He looked downward, and the earth seemed further than the sky. The rounds of the ladders had disappeared and there seemed to be nothing by which to descend but the iron beams of the framework. The swaying of the treetops beneath unnerved him as much as the sweeping movement of the long arm above… Just as he got to the forearm a triumphant shout reached his ears. The [cartoon] artist had both his hands clasped on Liberty’s wrist and was ‘feeling her pulse.’ He was the first that ever burst into that dizzy spot except the workmen. No such glorious view of New York bay was ever obtained before. The air was clear and there was no limit upon the human sight except human frailty. Great ships looked like sloops, schooners like sailboats, men like moving sticks. Even the Brooklyn Bridge seemed a thing of the earth’s surface, which could be touched with the hand by any one sailing under it.”</p><p>他们爬上了自由女神像的内部脚手架，在它被覆上铜之前，用第三人称描述了这一经历。“他往下看，地球似乎比天空还远。一圈圈的梯子消失了，除了框架的铁梁外，似乎没有什么可以下楼的了。下面树梢的摇摆让他感到不安，就像…上方长臂的横扫一样让他感到不安。正当他走到前臂时，一声胜利的呼喊传到了他的耳边。这位(卡通)艺术家双手紧握着利伯蒂的手腕，正在“摸摸她的脉搏”。除了工人外，他是第一个冲进那个令人眼花缭乱的地方的人。以前从来没有人看到过纽约湾如此壮丽的景色。空气清新，除了人的脆弱之外，人的视线没有限制。大船看起来像单桅帆船，纵帆船看起来像帆船，人看起来像移动的棍子。就连布鲁克林大桥也像是地球表面的东西，任何从它下面航行的人都可以用手摸到。“。</p><p> All writers contribute to humanity’s intellectual compost, nourishing future ideas, but few do so more plainly than those anonymous writers. As Edward G. P. Wilkins wrote about one of his gifted colleagues, “his writings are buried in the files of ‘The Herald,’ ‘The Saturday Press,’ and ‘the Leader,’ and they are buried forever.” Those reporters did not cherish the silly illusion that their names would echo through the ages. They skipped the stage of “I’ve never heard of him” to immediately become what might be valued forever: their words.</p><p>所有的作家都为人类的智力肥料做出了贡献，滋养了未来的想法，但很少有作家比那些匿名的作家更直截了当地做了这件事。正如爱德华·G·约翰·P·威尔金斯(Edward G. P.Wilkins)在谈到他的一位天才同事时所写的那样，“他的作品被埋葬在”先驱报“、”星期六新闻“和”领袖“的文件中，它们将永远被埋葬。”那些记者并没有抱有他们的名字会流传千古的愚蠢幻想。他们跳过了“我从未听说过他”的阶段，立即变成了可能永远有价值的东西：他们的话。</p><p> In the Cypress Hill Cemetery in Queens, on a hilltop at the “brow of a small hill, commanding a beautiful view of the country for many miles around, with Jamaica Bay and ocean in the distance,” is a graveyard, acquired in 1871 by the New York Press Club, originally for 360 graves for “friendless journalists.” The space was intended for newspaper people who “die in the city without means or inclination to be buried elsewhere.” At an 1887 ceremony, thousands gathered to dedicate a thirty-eight-foot obelisk inscribed  . Under sunny skies, Chauncey Depew, the railroad president and sought-after orator, honored the fallen: “The reporter, with no incentive but his duty, outdoes the soldier, and telegraphs to his paper an account that electrifies the world, but bears no signature.”</p><p>在皇后区的柏树山公墓，在“一座小山的额头，可以俯瞰方圆数英里的乡村美景，远处有牙买加海湾和海洋”的山顶上，有一个墓地，1871年被纽约记者俱乐部(New York Press Club)买下，最初是为了给“没有朋友的记者”修建360个坟墓。这个空间是为那些“死在城市里，没有办法或倾向于被埋葬在其他地方”的报业人士设计的。在1887年的一个仪式上，数千人聚集在一起，献身于一座刻有38英尺高的方尖碑。在晴朗的天空下，铁路总裁、备受追捧的演说家昌西·德佩(Chauncey Depew)向阵亡将士致敬：“记者除了职责之外，没有任何动机，超越了士兵，并向他的报纸发送了一份令世界兴奋的报道，但没有签名。”</p><p> An 1866 obituary for a newspaperman expressed the writer’s fervent hope of what such people might earn in the afterlife: “There he shall be able to see the immense masses of mind he has moved, all unknowing and unknown as he has been, during his weary pilgrimage on earth. There he will find all articles credited—not a clap of his thunder stolen; and there shall be no horrid typographical errors to set him in a fever.”</p><p>1866年，一位新闻记者的讣告表达了这位作家对这些人在来世可能会有什么收入的热切希望：“在那里，他将能够看到他在尘世疲惫的朝圣过程中所感动的巨大的心灵，一切都是未知的，就像他曾经做过的那样。在那里，他会发现所有记在帐上的东西--他的一声雷鸣都没有被偷过；也不会有什么可怕的印刷错误使他发烧。“。</p><p>  Elizabeth Mitchell is the author of Lincoln’s Lie: A True Civil War Caper Through Fake News, Wall Street, and the White House  (October 2020/Counterpoint Press).</p><p>伊丽莎白·米切尔(Elizabeth Mitchell)是“林肯的谎言：通过假新闻、华尔街和白宫实现真正的内战胜利”(Lincoln‘s Like：A True Civil War Caper Through Full News，Wall Street，and the White House)一书的作者。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/10/26/the-ghosts-of-newspaper-row/">https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2020/10/26/the-ghosts-of-newspaper-row/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/排行榜/">#排行榜</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/newspaper/">#newspaper</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/记者/">#记者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
