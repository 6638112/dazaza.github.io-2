A dream that came true after many years of hard work, sacrifices and a PhD in computer science under the supervision of one of the best and most well-known professors in the field.</p><p>苹果是我的第一份工作。经过多年的努力，牺牲和计算机科学博士学位，在该领域最优秀，最著名的教授之一的监督下，梦想成真。</p><p> Unfortunately, Apple became the place that I lost feeling of physical and psychological safety and the terror that it inflicted on me has impacted me on such a core level that the painful memories and flashbacks have replaced my dreams and they will hunt me until I am alive.</p><p> 不幸的是，苹果变成了我失去身心安全感的地方，它给我造成的恐怖影响了我，使我痛苦不已，痛苦的回忆和倒叙取代了我的梦想，他们将追捕我，直到我还活着。</p><p> Every second   of my time at Apple, was spent on preparing for the worst and only when I thought it cannot get any worse, something worse happened. My Apple experience not only put my career in the wrong path but also robbed me of peace, joy and hope and showed me humans at their most disgusting level of darkness, deceitfulness and cruelty.</p><p> 我在苹果公司的每一秒钟都花在了最糟糕的事情上，只有当我认为它不会变得更糟时，才发生了更糟的事情。我在苹果公司的经历不仅使我的事业走错了道路，而且使我失去了和平，喜悦和希望，并向我展示了人类处于最令人作呕的黑暗，欺骗和残酷程度。</p><p> Although time has passed by, I have not healed from the trauma. I have not found closure to the experience and I believe telling my story is an essential step in my healing journey. I no longer want to remain silent about the abuse. Silence turns abuse into a norm and enables abusers. Abusers are in minority; it is the silent majority who make the big difference and disarm them by exposing abuse.</p><p> 尽管时间已经过去，但我还没有从创伤中恢复过来。我还没有结束这段经历，我相信讲故事是我康复过程中必不可少的一步。我不再想对这种虐待保持沉默。沉默将虐待变成一种规范，并使虐待者成为可能。滥用者是少数；沉默的多数派发挥了巨大作用，并通过暴露虐待解除了武装。</p><p> Telling my story will make me free and I hope it helps others with similar workplace trauma. I hope that my story shines light on the dark and force employers like Apple to stop abuse in the workplace.</p><p> 讲故事可以让我自由，我希望它可以帮助遭受类似工作场所伤害的其他人。我希望我的故事在黑暗中发光，并迫使像Apple这样的雇主停止在工作场所中的虐待。</p><p> While I understand that this post is long and reading it might be painful, I wanted to give full details and context of what happened. I would like to use my story to initiate change. I want my readers to develop awareness about workplace abuse and if they are doing it or seeing this happening to anyone, I urge them to stop it. Workplace abuse can cost lives and at minimum it will leave major trauma needing years to recover from the invisible wounds.</p><p> 虽然我知道这篇文章很长，并且阅读起来可能很痛苦，但我想提供所发生事件的完整细节和上下文。我想用我的故事来引发改变。我希望我的读者提高对工作场所虐待的认识，如果他们正在这样做或看到任何人正在发生这种情况，我敦促他们停止这种行为。滥用工作场所可能会丧生，并且至少会造成严重的创伤，需要数年才能从无形的伤口中恢复过来。</p><p> In this post you will read about how a team at Apple fabricated results for a project, their history of abuse, scapegoating, firing and forcing out employees, nepotism and corruption in the organization and contribution of senior management and HR to further worsening the situation.</p><p> 在这篇文章中，您将了解苹果团队如何为一个项目编制结果，他们的虐待历史，替罪羊，解雇和强迫雇员，裙带关系和组织中的腐败以及高级管理人员和人力资源部门为进一步恶化情况做出的贡献。 </p><p> If you are an Apple employee, please send this story to your upper management particularly Tim Cook.</p><p>如果您是Apple员工，请将此故事发送给您的高层管理人员，尤其是Tim Cook。</p><p>  The first day of my job, I got to know that I was hired in a team of 3 including my manager. My manager and one of the team members were remote employees and living in a different city. My manager had suddenly decided to take a vacation and did not show up for my onboarding. An “iBuddy”, the other member of the team, showed up for onboarding me. She  started my onboarding at Apple by telling me that I was hired as a replacement for a guy they just fired and that  I should watch it as the company fires people left and right!</p><p>  工作的第一天，我就知道我是一个由3人组成的团队（包括我的经理）被录用的。我的经理和团队成员之一是远程员工，居住在不同的城市。我的经理突然决定去度假，没有参加我的入职培训。团队的另一名成员“ iBuddy”出现了，以加入我。她告诉我，我被聘用为他们刚刚被解雇的一个人的替补，我开始在Apple任职，当公司解雇左右人时，我应该注意这一点！</p><p> My first interaction with my manager happened when she finally showed up on my third day and  started laughing and making fun of my last name and that the last name must be the reason, I had difficulty setting up my accounts!</p><p> 我与经理的第一次互动发生在她终于在第三天出现并开始大笑并取笑我的姓氏，而姓氏一定是原因时，我很难设置帐户！</p><p> Until the third day of my employment at Apple, I had no idea what I will be working on. First two days, the iBuddy said it was a secret and confidential and she cannot tell me what I will work on even though I had already started working in the company. On the third day, my manager emailed me a deck containing slides with few lines of text as introduction of the project. No explanation, no context, no data and no code. Just a deck that was emailed.</p><p> 直到在苹果公司工作的第三天，我才知道要做什么。前两天，iBuddy说这是一个秘密和机密，即使我已经开始在公司工作，她也无法告诉我我将要从事的工作。第三天，作为项目介绍，我的经理通过电子邮件向我发送了一个甲板，其中包含几行文字的幻灯片。没有解释，没有上下文，没有数据，也没有代码。只是一个通过电子邮件发送的卡片组。</p><p> There was no code repository for our project and the page that was listed as the project page only had script names in it but no code was linked. For example, you could see name of the scripts such as garbage.py but there was no code! The page looked like a placeholder with no functionality or value.</p><p> 我们的项目没有代码存储库，被列为项目页面的页面仅包含脚本名称，但未链接任何代码。例如，您可以看到脚本的名称，例如垃圾.py，但没有代码！该页面看起来像一个占位符，没有任何功能或价值。</p><p> The guy who had done most of the work for the project had got fired, my manager and other remote teammate did not know much about the project and were often out of office on vacation. My iBuddy was the only person who had all the information and resources on a project. It was very hard to make sense of the project with no documentation and the iBuddy was my only source. Any questions I asked the iBuddy would answer by “you do it better if you know better”, “that is why we hired you”, “this is going to be your job to do that”, “ you do not get to decide that”, “You do not need to know that” or “you do not need to have that”, “I do not know”. Our conversations were very tense and upsetting and I did not gain any more information by asking questions.</p><p> 负责该项目大部分工作的那个人被解雇了，我的经理和其他远程队友对此项目了解不多，经常休假休假。我的iBuddy是唯一拥有有关项目的所有信息和资源的人。没有文档就很难理解项目，而iBuddy是我唯一的消息来源。我问iBuddy的任何问题都会回答“如果您更了解，您会做得更好”，“这就是我们雇用您的原因”，“要做这件事将是您的工作”，“您无法决定”，“您不需要知道”或“您不需要”，“我不知道”。我们的谈话非常紧张和令人沮丧，我没有通过提问来获得更多信息。</p><p> There was great amount of nepotism in my team and in the organization. My manager and the other team member had known each other as best friends for over 20 years, and they both knew the iBuddy for more than 10 years and soon there was a new hire who also was strongly connected to the iBuddy and other members in the organization. In the organization, there were many close relationships such as husband and wife who worked in the same teams and on the same projects. If you looked closer, you would see how most people have known each other for years and are a part of a clique. The attitude of the team was forming cliques and excluding whoever that does not belong to the their circle. This exclusion was very broad and included group lunch/coffee, work conversations in meetings, work meetings and after work events.</p><p> 我的团队和组织中都有大量的裙带关系。我的经理和其他团队成员彼此认识已经是20多年的挚友，并且他们都认识iBuddy已有10多年了，很快就有了新员工，他也与iBuddy和其他成员紧密联系。组织。在组织中，有许多亲密的关系，例如在同一团队和同一项目中工作的丈夫和妻子。如果您仔细观察，您会发现大多数人之间多年来相互了解的情况，并且是集团的一部分。团队的态度正在形成集团，并将不属于他们圈子的人排除在外。此排除范围非常广泛，包括集体午餐/咖啡，会议中的工作对话，工作会议和下班后的活动。 </p><p> During my first few months, I got  a lot of unnecessary information from iBuddy, the manager and the other team member  about the guy who was fired including  his name, his specific health condition and reason and full graphic description of his termination. Most faults of the project was also being blamed on him. The most disturbing part was the joy and laughter that was expressed while describing it.</p><p>在刚开始的几个月中，我从经理和其他团队成员iBuddy那里得到了很多不必要的信息，包括被解雇的那个人，包括他的名字，具体的健康状况和原因以及解雇的完整图形描述。该项目的大多数错误也都归咎于他。最令人不安的是描述它时所表达的喜悦和欢笑。</p><p> I also got to know about another  intern who also worked in the team a few months prior to my start date and was overworked up to 70 hours a week. It turns out the guy had been  falsely accused of a serious violation and while it was not proved,  he spent hours in workplace investigation and HR during his short internship.  He was also abused in the team and had a very bad experience and had suffered continuous tension. He was also blamed for faults in the project. He had lost his chance to work at Apple as the manager had given him a very negative evaluation.  Accusing people and scapegoating seemed like a pattern in this team. I started to fear that they will pull something serious on me too, then fire me and blame everything on me just like what had happened with the previous two guys only a few months before I joined.</p><p> 我还认识了另一个实习生，他在我开始工作的几个月前也曾在团队中工作，并且每周要花费多达70个小时的超负荷工作。事实证明，这名男子曾被错误地指控为严重违法行为，虽然没有得到证实，但他在短暂的实习期间花费了数小时从事工作场所调查和人力资源工作。他也被车队虐待，经历非常糟糕，并不断感到紧张。他还因项目中的错误而受到指责。由于经理给了他一个非常负面的评价，他失去了在苹果公司工作的机会。责骂人和替罪羊在这支球队中似乎是一种模式。我开始担心他们也会对我产生严重影响，然后开除我，并责怪我一切，就像我加入前几个月才发生的前两个家伙一样。</p><p>  My access to data and resources was still being limited and controlled by the iBuddy. She would give me access to a document and send an email to me and cc manager that she gave me access, then she would revoke my access when I was looking at the document. I had no interaction with my manager and she was refusing to have regular 1:1 meetings with me and was not responding to my emails.  My manager was giving indirect negative feedback through the iBuddy rather than speaking with me and did not change this despite my formal request.</p><p>  我对数据和资源的访问仍然受到iBuddy的限制和控制。她将给我访问文档的权限，并向我和抄送经理发送一封电子邮件，告知她可以访问我的权限，然后当我查看文档时，她将撤消我的访问权限。我没有与经理互动，她拒绝与我定期进行1：1的会议，也没有回复我的电子邮件。我的经理是通过iBuddy提供间接的负面反馈，而不是与我交谈，尽管我有正式要求，他也没有改变。</p><p> I was constantly being excluded from work meetings and events. There were meetings that  I would be the only one who was not invited to and considering the size of the team (4 people) and the that there was only one project we were working on, this was very upsetting and strange.  I would enter the meetings and they would stop talking and make really strange gestures. I was ignored, ridiculed and attacked in the team meetings.  I was being assigned to do tasks such as manual annotation of the data and was being forced to complete my coworker’s tasks on top of my own tasks but was not given the credit after I was done. One day the coworker would be sick, next day she would be in a car accident and next going through a breakup while the week after that she would go car shopping or get busy on her phone shoe shopping while the other teammate would have a family issue or just not in the mood to work.  I was also constantly being compared to the previously fired employee which felt terrible.</p><p> 我经常被排除在工作会议和活动之外。有会议，我将是唯一不被邀请参加的会议，并考虑到团队的规模（4人），而且我们只在进行一个项目，这非常令人沮丧和奇怪。我将参加会议，他们将停止交谈并做出非常奇怪的手势。在团队会议中，我被忽略，嘲笑和攻击。我被分配去做诸如手动注释数据之类的任务，并且被迫在自己的任务之外完成同事的任务，但完成后却没有得到我的荣誉。有一天，同事生病了，第二天她出了车祸，第二天经历了分手，而下一周她会去购物或忙于电话鞋的购物，而另一个队友则会遇到家庭问题。或只是没有心情工作。我也经常被和以前被解雇的那位员工比较，那位员工感觉很糟糕。</p><p> I had joined Apple on a  student OPT visa which was authorized by my university and was  valid for one year. It was extendable by having a valid offer by a qualified employer for another two years upon approval. To maintain this visa the employer and the student have to regularly report to USCIS and if they miss one or do not do it on time, the visa can be revoked.  This reports are signed by student’s direct manager.</p><p> 我以我的大学批准的学生OPT签证加入了Apple，有效期为一年。经合格雇主的有效报价再延长两年，可以将其延长。为了维持这种签证，雇主和学生必须定期向美国公民及移民服务局报告，如果他们错过一个签证或不按时办理签证，该签证可以被吊销。此报告由学生的直接经理签名。</p><p> As I am born in a certain country, I need an additional clearance process called obtaining  “export license” which is necessary to join majority of technical jobs in the united states. This process takes about 3–9 months and with a chance of taking more time or being rejected. Hence, many companies do not hire us on a visa and for the ones who hire, we need additional time to allow the process be completed and at times we lose the job opportunity because of delays in this process.</p><p> 当我出生在某个国家时，我需要一个额外的通关程序，称为“出口许可证”，这是加入美国大部分技术工作所必需的。此过程大约需要3到9个月，可能会花费更多时间或被拒绝。因此，许多公司没有以签证形式雇用我们，而对于雇用者，我们需要额外的时间来完成该过程，有时由于该过程的延迟而失去了工作机会。</p><p> When I joined Apple,  I had used some of the allowed unemployment time of my OPT visa waiting for my position to start and was left with very limited days of allowed unemployment. I had shared all this information with my manager right when I joined to make sure that my mandatory reporting will be on time and with no mistake as it could put me at risk.</p><p> 当我加入Apple时，我已经使用了OPT签证的部分允许失业时间来等待我的职位开始，并且所允许的失业天数非常有限。当我加入时，我已经与我的经理分享了所有这些信息，以确保我的强制性报告会及时进行，并且不会出错，因为这可能会使我面临风险。 </p><p> Given the description above, losing my position at Apple or resigning from it before being cleared for another job would technically mean I am at risk of  losing status and deportation. Also given that the  Muslim ban has been in place since 2017, if that had to happen  obtaining another visa would be practically impossible for me and if I had to leave USA at the time for any reason, it would have been a permanent decision.</p><p>根据上面的描述，从技术上失去我的职位或辞职后再辞职，从技术上来讲，这意味着我有失去地位和被驱逐出境的风险。此外，鉴于自2017年以来一直实行穆斯林禁令，如果那真的要获得另一个签证对我来说几乎是不可能的，并且如果我由于某种原因不得不当时离开美国，那将是一个永久性的决定。</p><p> So, hearing about firings in the company as an orientation and onboarding process, constantly being compared to the guy they had fired and being told I will be fired was more painful and damaging to me than people with no visa problems.</p><p> 因此，相对于没有签证问题的人，听到公司解雇是一个方向和入职过程，不断地与他们被解雇的人进行比较，并被告知我将被解雇，这对我来说更加痛苦和破坏。</p><p> The more I was seeing from the project, data or results, the more confident I was that they are seriously troubled. Anything I would try to do would achieve 50% of their accuracy and I could see that there are serious interventions such as removing particular data points to achieve the results while remained unreported and was denied even when I directly asked, multiplying by a factor somewhere in the code, mixing features, etc. This completely changed the results, trends and conclusions. I brought this up multiple times and they said that  higher ups are not technical to know this and they do not care.  It made me worried because they knew about it and did not correct. At times the real result was as good as a random guess but was reported much higher and with knowledge of it, it meant they were cheating and fabricating results. Everything up to that point was blamed on the two previous guys and they both got into serious messy situations. The team had started my onboarding with firing threats and I was the only outsider in the team. How would I know their plan is not to scapegoat me if they get caught and get me fired for misconduct?</p><p> 从项目，数据或结果中看到的越多，我就越确信它们受到了严重困扰。我尝试做的任何事情都能达到其准确度的50％，并且我可以看到有一些严重的干预措施，例如删除特定数据点以取得结果，同时保持未报告的状态，即使我直接提出要求也被拒绝，并乘以代码，混合功能等。这完全改变了结果，趋势和结论。我多次提出了这个建议，他们说更高的建议不是技术性的，他们不在乎。这让我感到担心，因为他们知道这件事并且没有纠正。有时，真实的结果和随机的猜测一样好，但是据报道更高，并且对结果的了解，意味着他们在欺骗和捏造结果。到目前为止，所有事情都归咎于前两个家伙，他们俩都陷入了严重的混乱局面。团队以开火威胁开始了我的入职，而我是团队中唯一的局外人。我怎么知道他们的计划是如果他们被抓到并因不当行为而被炒鱿鱼，就不会替我背叛？</p><p> After a few months, the constant tension in the team started to affect me very badly. I sent an email to my manager and told her that I was uncomfortable and would like her to intervene and help solve the problems that are happening in the team. In response, my manager told her manager and the senior director of the organization and then told HR. Then, she went and told the iBuddy that I have called HR on her!</p><p> 几个月后，团队中持续不断的紧张局势开始严重影响我。我给经理发了一封电子邮件，告诉她我不舒服，希望她进行干预并帮助解决团队中正在发生的问题。作为回应，我的经理告诉她的经理和该组织的高级主管，然后告诉人力资源部。然后，她去告诉iBuddy我给她打电话给HR！</p><p> HR scheduled a confrontational meeting between me, iBuddy and the manager where the HR lady looked at the evidence of all the listed issues and concluded that the iBuddy just does not know how to speak English and that she does not have to like me! Most of the evidence such as being excluded from the work meetings, not having proper access, troubled results, etc. was written and provable.  HR lady and the manager also told me that I cannot tell anyone about the abuse and that it is confidential!!</p><p> 人力资源部安排了我，iBuddy和经理之间的对抗性会议，其中人力资源女士查看了所有列出的问题的证据，并得出结论，iBuddy只是不懂英语，她不必喜欢我！大部分证据（例如，被排除在工作会议之外，没有适当的渠道，有问题的结果等）均已书面且可证明。 HR女士和经理还告诉我，我无法将虐待告知任何人，并且是保密的！！</p><p>   The first time I spoke to my manager after the HR meeting,  she started yelling at me and kept raising her voice in the meeting. I asked my manager and HR to change my office and put me in an office with a person from a different team or let me work from home for a while. The environment of my team was toxic, and I did not want to deal with that in my office too. The request was denied, and my manager told me that the senior management and HR have told that I can only be officemate with a member of the team. She told me that if I cannot come to the office, I should officially ask for accommodation which they do not have to meet and it will lead to my termination since I am not able to do my basic job functions! It was interesting to see sitting in a two person office with a team member was a basic job function and I could be terminated for not wanting to do that. She assigned the other member of the team to be my new officemate.</p><p>   人力资源会议后，我第一次与经理交谈，她开始对我大吼大叫，并在会议中不断提高自己的声音。我要求经理和人事部改变我的办公室，然后让我和其他团队的人一起进入办公室，或者让我在家工作一段时间。我的团队的环境是有毒的，我也不想在办公室里处理这种环境。该请求被拒绝，我的经理告诉我，高层管理人员和人事部门告诉我，我只能与团队成员一起成为同事。她告诉我，如果我不能来办公室，我应该正式要求他们不需要的住宿，这将导致我被解雇，因为我无法履行我的基本工作职责！有趣的是，与团队成员一起坐在两个人的办公室是一项基本的工作职能，而我可能因为不想这样做而被解雇。她指派团队的另一位成员为我的新任同事。</p><p> The new officemate had  previous harassment history at Apple as well as criminal history and arrest.  She took pride that she does what she wants, and nobody can do anything about it. She also shared that  my manager has asked her to report on when I come to the office and when I leave, what tabs I have open on my monitor, who do I talk to, if I work hard, etc. She described that she was assigned to watch the previous guy who just got fired and report all these metrics about him too.</p><p> 新上任的同事以前曾在苹果公司受到过骚扰，也有过犯罪记录和被捕。她为自己能做自己想做的事感到骄傲，没有人能做任何事。她还分享了我的经理要求她报告我何时到达办公室，何时离开，我在显示器上打开了哪些标签，与谁交谈，是否辛苦工作等。她说，被指派观看前一个被解雇的人，并报告有关他的所有这些指标。 </p><p> I was the youngest member of the team and did not have any work experience prior to Apple and I was also the only member who did not have strong connections to anyone in the team or in the organization.  The new officemate called me names, made hurtful comments about my home country, encouraged me to leave Apple, threatened to get me deported. She had claimed multiple disabilities and everything she said or did was being justified by my manager saying “X is just being X!”.</p><p>我是团队中最年轻的成员，在Apple之前没有任何工作经验，而且我也是唯一与团队或组织中的任何人没有紧密联系的成员。新上任的同事给我起了名字，对我的祖国发表了有害的评论，鼓励我离开苹果公司，扬言要驱逐我。她声称自己患有多种残疾，而她的经理说“ X就是X！”证明她所做的一切或所做的一切都是合理的。</p><p> I cannot find words to describe how sad and stressed I felt being stuck with her in that windowless office and under her watch and that my manager’s opinion of me was dependent on what she told her.</p><p> 我无法找到言语来形容我在那间无窗的办公室和她的监视之下被她困住的感觉如何而难过和压力，而且我的经理对我的看法取决于她告诉她的内容。</p><p>  “You are a skinny kid with no experience. Nobody cares about what you do. Just put your head down, shut your mouth or get yourself fired”.</p><p>  “你是一个瘦弱的孩子，没有经验。没有人关心您的工作。只需低下头，闭上嘴，否则会被解雇”。</p><p> “You escaped a war zone; it is obvious you have many mental problems. ”</p><p> “你逃离了战区；很明显，您有很多心理问题。 ”</p><p> “Just leave Apple before they kick you out. This is exactly what happened to the previous guy we fired.”</p><p> “只要离开苹果，他们就会把你踢出去。这正是我们解雇前一个家伙所发生的事情。”</p><p> “My husband worked for FBI and I can get you deported on a cargo boat if I want.”</p><p> “我的丈夫在联邦调查局工作，如果我愿意，我可以将你驱逐出货船。”</p><p> Senior manager was added to my 1:1 meeting and  my manager was doing her absolute best to point out any flaws she could find at all in my work which often meant typos. She then would send emails cc’ing senior manager and talk about the “mistakes” I have made in writing my email!</p><p> 高级经理加入了我的1：1会议，而我的经理正在竭尽全力指出她在我的工作中可能发现的所有瑕疵，这些瑕疵常常意味着错别字。然后，她将发送抄送高级经理的电子邮件，并讨论我在写电子邮件时所犯的“错误”！ </p><p> The senior manager and my manager were counting minutes and hours of my work and setting up multiple meetings for justifying why I need that time (1-day!). This is while the rest of the team were taking weeks and months to complete a task that takes an hour, were on vacation or just out of office or out of touch. The time they were out of office was more than 2 months in one year! I asked for vacation once and my manager did not respond to my request and emails. After couple of weeks of resending it and asking senior manager, I managed to take 2 days of vacation!</p><p>高级经理和我的经理正在计算我的工作时间和小时数，并召开多次会议以证明为什么我需要这段时间（1天！）。这是团队的其他成员花数周甚至数月来完成一项耗时一个小时，正在休假或刚离开办公室或失去联系的任务的过程。他们一年不在办公室的时间超过2个月！我曾要求休假一次，而我的经理没有回复我的要求和电子邮件。在重新发送几周并询问高级经理之后，我设法度过了2天的假期！</p><p> On one occasion I had to obtain data from my iBuddy and officemate, I found a serious bug that was a complete mismatch in data and labels and had to be corrected. The bug was caused by my “iBuddy” and the new officemate. I reported the bug and there was a meeting scheduled by “iBuddy” for 5:00 pm in my office to close the bug as she was going on vacation the next day. The whole team including the manager were invited to the meeting. In that meeting, I was being yelled at and the conversation was getting very heated. My manager had not joined the meeting, I texted the senior manager and asked him for help, but he had already left work.  My officemate was incredibly angry and was constantly yelling and she finally got super close to me and posed to punch me in the face. The other teammates did nothing and watched it happen. I proposed to postpone the meeting and left work that day.</p><p> 有一次，我不得不从iBuddy和办公室同事那里获取数据，我发现了一个严重的错误，它与数据和标签完全不匹配，必须予以纠正。该错误是由我的“ iBuddy”和新任办公室友引起的。我报告了该错误，“ iBuddy”计划在我的办公室下午5:00召开一次会议，以在她第二天度假时关闭该错误。包括经理在内的整个团队都应邀参加了会议。在那次会议上，我大喊大叫，谈话变得非常热烈。我的经理没有参加会议，我给高级经理发了短信，请他帮忙，但他已经下班了。我的上班族非常恼火，不断大喊大叫，她终于离我太近了，摆出拳打我的脸。其他队友什么也没做，并看着它发生了。我建议推迟会议，并于当天离开工作。</p><p> I sent a summary of the meeting to my manager and senior manager and once again asked the senior manager to help me transfer to a different team. I did not hear back on what is going on. I was worried and I scheduled a meeting with HR and described what had happened.</p><p> 我向我的经理和高级经理发送了会议摘要，并再次请高级经理帮助我转到其他团队。我没有听说发生了什么事。我很担心，我安排了与人力资源部的会议，并描述了发生的事情。</p><p> Senior director of the organization sent a meeting request out of nowhere saying he has not met me and want to meet and greet me! I went to that meeting and faced an emotionally charged person who was constantly attacking me and intimidating me. I could see on calendar that my manager had previous meetings with him prior to my meeting and it was very obvious that she had described me very negatively. He started talking about when layoffs happen in organization and he must let people go. Then he told me not to go to HR and go to him if I had any questions. He said HR does not know anything and he knows much better.  Letting people go and not going to HR was the dominant topic of my “meet and greet” meeting with the senior director.</p><p> 该组织的高级主管无意间发送了一个会议要求，说他没有认识我，想见面并向我打招呼！我去参加那个会议，面对一个情绪激动的人，他经常攻击我并吓in我。从日历上可以看出，我的经理在开会之前曾与他会面，很显然她对我的评价很消极。他开始谈论组织中何时发生裁员，他必须让员工离开。然后他告诉我不要去人力资源部，如果我有任何疑问，请去找他。他说，人力资源部门一无所知，他的知识要好得多。在我与高级主管的“见面会见”会议上，让人们去而不去HR是主要话题。</p><p>  After what had happened, I was experiencing severe panic attacks and was not able to sleep or stop thinking about what happened. I went to see a doctor at Apple wellness center. While I was waiting for the doctor in the room, my manager texted me and asked me to go to a meeting with her, senior manager and senior director. I started to have a panic attack. I was shaking, was not able to speak and my heart rate was abnormally high and it went on for more than an hour. It was bad enough that they called the director of the center and an on-call counselor to help me and eventually sent me home with beta blockers to keep my heart rate in check. My doctor gave me a note to work from home for 3 weeks and not be in the workplace.</p><p>  发生了什么之后，我经历了严重的惊恐发作，无法入睡或停止思考发生了什么。我去了苹果健康中心看医生。当我在房间里等医生的时候，我的经理给我发短信，请我去和她，高级经理和高级主管开会。我开始出现惊恐发作。我在发抖，无法说话，心律异常高，持续了一个多小时。他们叫中心主任和值班辅导员来帮助我，真是太糟糕了，他们最终用β受体阻滞剂将我送回家，以控制我的心律。我的医生给我一张纸条，要求他在家中工作三个星期，不能在工作场所工作。</p><p> In those 3 weeks, I worked from home and did not have any meetings and there was an investigation in process.  After three weeks, I heard back from an Apple investigator that he sees some frictions in the team, and  I should just assume positive intent and everything will be fine!</p><p> 在那三周的时间里，我在家工作，没有开会，正在进行调查。三个星期后，我从一位苹果调查员那里得知他在团队中遇到了一些磨擦，我应该假设自己有积极的意愿，一切都会好起来的！</p><p> Immediately after that, my manager scheduled a call with senior manager in it.  She called and read a pre-written document over the phone full of accusations with no chance for me to respond and she immediately sent it via email cc’ing the senior manager. I was sad that not only I was being abused but now I was also being blamed for it and told that I caused it! After two days, my manager sent me an email to do my first formal performance evaluation.</p><p> 此后，我的经理立即安排了与高级经理的通话。她打电话到电话上阅读了一份预先写好的文件，其中充满了指责，没有机会让我回应，她立即通过电子邮件抄送了高级经理。我不仅为自己受到了虐待而感到难过，现在也为此而受到指责，并告诉我是由我造成的！两天后，我的经理给我发送了一封电子邮件，以进行第一次正式的绩效评估。 </p><p> After that, in every meeting she would accuse me of something and send an email about it. I would reach out to ask about what happened and rather than responding to my questions they would accuse me of being argumentative, wasting their time and not being able to take feedback which would be additional  emails where HR and senior director were also bcc’d. In one occasion they cc’d them instead and in another occasion one of the bcc’d HR individuals responded to the email. I knew that they are making a paper trail as this is something  my manager had described to me as a part of my onboarding process in the first few weeks that they need paper trail to get a person fired and not get into legal trouble.</p><p>之后，在每次会议中她都会指责我一些事情，并发送一封有关此事的电子邮件。我会主动询问发生了什么事，而不是回答我的问题，他们会指控我争论不休，浪费时间并且无法获得反馈，这可能是人力资源部和高级主管也被密送的另外一封电子邮件。在一种情况下，他们抄送了他们，而在另一种情况下，密件抄送的一位HR人员回复了该电子邮件。我知道他们正在做纸质记录，因为这是经理在开始的几周内向我描述的，这是我入职流程的一部分，他们需要进行纸质记录才能解雇一个人，而不会陷入法律麻烦。</p><p> I asked HR and senior management to help me change teams since it clearly was not working, but they said you are bad at teamwork and we will not help you transfer. Teamwork with people who call me names, threaten to beat me, falsely accuse anyone who will not cover for them, get me to do their job and in return threaten me to get deported on a cargo boat and now hold power </p><p> 我要求人力资源和高级管理层帮助我更换团队，因为它显然无法正常工作，但他们说您的团队合作能力很差，我们将不帮助您调任。与叫我名字的人的团队合作，威胁要打败我，错误地指责任何不愿为他们掩护的人，让我去做他们的工作，反过来威胁要我驱逐出货船并现在拥有权力</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://ex-apple-engineer.medium.com/my-experience-apple-5d8b6205cb56">https://ex-apple-engineer.medium.com/my-experience-apple-5d8b6205cb56</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果公司/">#苹果公司</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
