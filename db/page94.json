The two companies have established three test vehicle depots in Austin, Miami and Washington D.C. in a run up to its commercialization plans. The facility in Dallas, if the location is ultimately chosen by Ford, would be similar to those operations. (Argo also has its own test fleets and facilities in Pittsburgh, Detroit and Palo Alto).\n The two companies plan to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on ride-hailing company Lyft\u2019s app in a number of cities over the next five years, beginning with Miami and Austin.\n  If the agenda item passes with Dallas\u2019s Office of Economic Development, Ford might be looking at over $3 million in proposed tax breaks over the span of five years. The city would also commit a $250,000 grant toward the construction of the facility, which is proposed to be located at a 32,361-square-foot space at 2335 Burbank Street. To meet its end of the bargain, Ford would need to create a minimum of 250 new jobs and invest a minimum of $160 million, including the AV fleet, at the property.\n The Dallas site is one of three final locations that Ford is scouting for its new AV facility,  according to city documents. The other two are in California, where Ford\u2019s AV unit already has a presence. However, Ford might see the benefits of building in Texas, a state that doesn\u2019t require permits to operate driverless autonomous vehicles. California, on the other hand,  requires separate permits for testing with a driver, testing without a driver, commercial autonomous delivery deployment and commercial robotaxi deployment.\n Ford would not comment on the Dallas City Council\u2019s agenda item, saying it has not made any decisions or chosen any additional cities to expand to, and that \u201cthis is all preliminary.\u201d\n \u201cFord is building its self-driving business for ride-hailing and goods delivery in Austin, Texas, Miami and Washington, D.C., and focused on building a profitable self-driving business,\u201d the company told TechCrunch. \u201cScaling this technology is key, driving us to explore a variety of cities in the U.S. to expand our self-driving services.

Existing investors who returned for its latest round include Quona Capital, Triodos Investment Management, Saison Capital, ACV and East Ventures. The new funds will be used for hiring about 400 new employees and scaling KoinWorks\u2019 latest suite of products, SME Neobank.\n KoinWorks is headquartered in Jakarta, with holding in Singapore and tech offices in Yogyakarta, India and Vietnam. KoinWorks was originally created to help SMEs, which are often turned away by traditional financial institutions, get access to working capital. Since then, it has also developed a comprehensive platform of financial tools to help its customers, including e-commerce vendors and social commerce sellers, increase their sales.\n  TechCrunch  first profiled KoinWorks in 2019 when it raised $12 million for its lending platform. Demand increased as more businesses went online during the COVID-19 pandemic and the startup says its user base tripled to 1.5 million customers, and a waitlist of 100,000 SMEs who are being onboarded onto its new financial software. Co-founder and executive chairman Willy Arifin told TechCrunch in an email that since 2019, monthly loan disbursements have also tripled to nearly $50 million and revenue had quadrupled.\n KoinWorks focuses on SMEs that are underserved by traditional financial institutions and may not have a bank account or credit cards. On the platform, users can create an online bank account and card, borrow working capital, and access accounting, point-of-sale, early wage access and human resources management systems tailored for small businesses.\n Arifin said that since KoinWorks\u2019 monthly disbursement rate reached $50 million a month, its take rate has grown enough that the company became cash flow positive earlier this year, and its non-performing loan (NPL) percentage is lower than 2%. He says banks serving traditional SMEs have at least double KoinWorks\u2019 NPL. \u201cAs many as 20% of businesses shifted their sales channels offline to online during the pandemic, and 89% of businesses now use online channels to sell their products and services,\u201d he said.\n Over the last three years, KoinWorks\u2019 competitors have grown to include other neobanks and startups that started out as accounting software but are expanding to include working capital loans and other financial services. Two notable examples included rivals BukuWarung and BukuKas, both of which have raised significant rounds of funding.\n   \u201cWhen we started out, we were among hundreds of traditional financial institutions. Fast forward to the present day, we are seeing those same banks now undergo digitalization,\u201d Arifin said. \u201cDespite that, Indonesia\u2019s yearly funding gap is $80 billion USD, so those who remain unbanked or underbanked are still at a disadvantage.

There will undoubtedly be fintech companies out there tackling the unbanked/underbanked space, however, KoinWorks has a best in class approach tailored to the needs of SMEs and entrepreneurs that we believe will have a significant impact on the future sector.\n  In a statement, MDI Ventures CEO Donald Wiharia said, \u201cInvesting in KoinWorks is investing in the financial literacy of underbanked and underserved communities. We are ecstatic to be in concert with a team that understands the importance of each step in the journey of entrepreneurship and SME growth.\u201c", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:50:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a,koinworks", "title": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c5\u52a0\u8fbe\u7684\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u91d1\u878d\u5e73\u53f0Koinworks Scoops US $ 108M\u7cfb\u5217C.", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tJakarta-based SME financial platform KoinWorks scoops up $108M Series C\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/jakarta-based-sme-financial-platform-koinworks-scoops-up-108m-series-c/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a", "koinworks"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "53131827bf467c4d7f4653c6ef95644b.jpg", "infoid": 1072721, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "1967\u5e746\u6708\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aCES\u6d3b\u52a8\u5438\u5f15\u4e8617,500\u540d\u4e0e\u4f1a\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u7fa4\u88abGE\u7684\u65b0\u6b3e24\u78c5\u5f69\u8272\u7535\u89c6\u4ee4\u4eba\u773c\u82b1\u7f2d\u4e71\u3002\u5728\u4ecb\u5165\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u8bae\u589e\u957f\u5982\u6b64\u4e4b\u591a\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u3002\u6839\u636e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8005\uff0c2020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4f4d\u57282020\u5e74\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86171,268\u4eba\u3002\n\u6839\u636e\u62c9\u7ef4\u52a0\u65af\u5ba1\u67e5\u671f\u520a\uff0c\u53ea\u670940,000\u4eba\u53c2\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u662f75\uff05\u7684\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\n\u57282014\u5e74\u5de6\u53f3\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u5de6\u53f3\uff0cCES\u53d8\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u573a\u8f66\u5c55\u3002\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5265\u593a\u4e86\u4eba\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u53d8\u79cd\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u5931\u53bb\u6c7d\u8f66\u5149\u6cfd\u7684CES 2022\u3002\n\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u7f3a\u5e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u8f66\u8f86\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u516c\u544a\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u4e00\u4e9b\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u4eba\u5305\u62ecLas Vegas Speedway\u7684\u5934\u8111\u524d\u5f80\u81ea\u4e3b\u8d5b\u9a6c\u573a\uff0cGM\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Mary Barra\u6253\u7b97\u5728\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u51fa\u552e\u4e2a\u4eba\u81ea\u6cbb\u8f66\u8f86\uff08\u867d\u7136\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7f3a\u5931\uff09\u548c\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7ed9\u4e58\u7528\u8f66\uff0c\u5361\u8f66\u548cSUV\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6743\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a7e\u9a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u51fa\u6765\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u672a\u6765\u7684\u627f\u8bfa\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u72ed\u9698\u5730\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u505c\u8f66\u573a - \u6216\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5f0f\u516c\u544a\u6307\u5411CES 2022\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e4b\u4e00\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "note_en": "The first CES event in June 1967 drew 17,500 attendees, where many in the crowd were absolutely dazzled by GE\u2019s new 24-pound color television. In the intervening decades, the conference grew so much, it essentially created its own gravity. The last in-person CES held in 2020 attracted a total verified attendance of 171,268, according to organizers.\n The trade show shifted to online-only in 2021, but CES returned last week, even though many exhibitors and publications (including this one) declined to send representatives, citing the ongoing omicron surge. \u201cIt\u2019s time we return to making the world better rather than living in fear,\u201d wrote Consumer Trade Association president and CEO Gary Shapiro  in an opinion column.\n But just 40,000 people attended,  according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. That\u2019s a 75% decline.\n If an event only attracts 25% of its usual crowd, for whom is it essential? Today, TechCrunch Transportation Editor Kirsten Korosec, Hardware Editor Brian Heater and reporter Haje Jan Kamps shared their thoughts on CES 2022:\n    Somewhere around 2014 or so, CES turned into a car show. And even with the latest variant of COVID derailing in-person plans for many companies, CES 2022 didn\u2019t lose its automotive luster.\n This year was different in a few respects, signaling that the automotive industry has taken a few cupfuls of we-really-need-revenue punch. Technology that is further away from commercialization showed up, but not in the same force as in previous years. CES 2022 was not the year for evtols, hyperloop, and to a lesser degree, autonomous vehicle technology.\n  Autonomous vehicle technology wasn\u2019t absent from the show, and there were some key announcements and activities. A few of the notable ones included the head-to-head autonomous racecar competition at the Las Vegas Speedway, GM CEO Mary Barra\u2019s intention to  sell personal autonomous vehicles\u00a0by mid-decade (although some key details were missing) and Intel subsidiary Mobileye\u2019s plan to bring a new\u00a0 supercomputer to market\u00a0designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\u00a0When automated driving did come up, it was often in the form of future promises, narrowly defined autonomous features like parking \u2014 or both.The Mobileye announcement points to one of the themes at CES 2022: compute.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:49:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "In fact, silly as it sounds, try being  more worried about it than seems normal. After all, for-profit biometric data collection has undergone an astounding degree of normalization in the last decade. The idea of Apple scanning your fingerprint on a daily basis once sounded startling. Now it\u2019s how we unlock our banking app and our laptop \u2014 unless, of course, we do it with our face. It\u2019s gone mainstream.\n We embraced FaceID, thumbprint scanning and similar functions specifically because they are convenient. No passcode, no problem.\n  Corporations and businesses saw this, and now convenience is among the two biggest reasons typically given for the adoption of biometric data collection \u2013 the other is public safety, which we\u2019ll get to later. Quick biometric scans, we\u2019re told, make things faster and easier.\n In a bid to save time, a number of primary schools throughout the U.K. recently  implemented facial scanning for lunch payment. Several schools ended up suspending the program after data privacy experts and parents  pushed back. They argued convenience was not exactly worth the price of the accumulation of an entire database of young children\u2019s faces stored on a server somewhere. And they\u2019re right.\n  This September, U.S. ticketing company AXS announced a flagship program to use Amazon One palm-print scanners at Red Rocks Amphitheater as an optional alternative to print or mobile concert tickets ( with plans to expand into additional venues in the coming months). The decision was met with  immediate resistance from both privacy experts and musicians, and it was hardly the first flashpoint over biometric data collection within the live music industry.\n In 2019, major promoters LiveNation and AEG (which coordinates major festivals such as Coachella)  stepped back from plans to invest in and implement facial recognition technology at concerts after public outcry from fans and artists.\n  But the fight over the use of biometric recognition during live entertainment is far from settled. When the coronavirus pandemic sent professional sports executives who depend on full stadiums back to the drawing board, their new plans often incorporated mass facial recognition. Faces would replace tickets, and this would ostensibly make everyone safer from the virus.\n These executives are determined. The Dutch football team AFC Ajax is seeking to reinstall its pilot facial recognition program that was initially halted by data protection regulators. Henk van Raan, the chief innovation officer of Ajax\u2019s home field, Amsterdam ArenA, was  quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying, \u201cHopefully we use this coronavirus pandemic to change rules. The coronavirus is a bigger enemy than [any threat to] privacy.\u201d\n This is terrible reasoning, as the risks posed to our privacy are in no way mitigated or lessened by our risk to a virus.\n In the same article, Shaun Moore, CEO of facial-recognition supplier Trueface, described his conversations with professional sports executives as overwhelmingly concerned with touch points by sidestepping the handing over of credentials, citing the risk of virus transmission while scanning ticket barcodes.\n This is a stretch, and you don\u2019t need to be an epidemiologist to call it one. When the main event involves a big crowd of people yelling and cheering next to one another, it\u2019s probably not the momentary masked interaction when an agent scans a ticket that is worth worrying about. As the safety argument falls apart, so does the convenience one. The simple fact is that our lives are not made exponentially and meaningfully better by the replacement of a mobile ticket with our palm print. Those extra five seconds are a moot point.\n It\u2019s interesting to see van Raan speak so directly about using the pandemic to override privacy protections and concerns. But his reasoning is frightening and flawed.\n Yes, the coronavirus is a real threat, but it\u2019s not an \u201cenemy.\u201d It\u2019s not embodied, nor does it have a motive. It\u2019s a virus. It is outside human control. In insurance terms, it\u2019s an \u201cact of God.\u201d And it\u2019s being used to justify something that is very much in human control: The huge uptick in biometric data collection under the guise of public safety or convenience.\n  Public safety is often the cause upon which increased biometric surveillance is foisted. In August, U.S. lawmakers  introduced a mandate that would require auto manufactures to include passive technology in new cars to prevent drunken drivers from starting vehicles. That \u201cpassive\u201d tech could end up being anything from eye-scanning devices and breathalyzers to an infrared sensor that tests BAC levels through the skin.\n Sure, this is a seemingly noble cause with a respectable motive. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that drunken driving kills nearly 10,000 people per year; the European Commission  lists a similar number for the EU.\n But where is all that data going? Where is it being stored? Who is it being sold to, and what do they plan to do with it? The privacy risks are too great.\n The pandemic obliterated many of the obstacles standing in the way of the adoption of mass biometric data collection, and the consequences will be disastrous for civil liberties if it\u2019s allowed to continue in this manner. The intensity of surveillance is ramping up in record time, making governments and for-profit corporations privy to that most private minutiae of our lives and bodies.\n A mobile ticket is surveillance enough \u2013 it announces to the system you\u2019ve entered the venue at an exact time, after all. Don\u2019t fix it if it\u2019s not broken! And don\u2019t add biometric data collection just because you can under the shaky guise of not spreading germs.\n Give out as little biometric data as possible, period. It\u2019s not enough to avoid giving your biometric data to Google or Amazon specifically, given those corporations\u2019 abysmal records when it comes to, say, basic human rights and civil liberties.\n A smaller company unaffiliated with your typical tech giant might feel like less of a threat, but don\u2019t be fooled. The moment Amazon or Google acquires that company, they acquire your and everyone else\u2019s biometric data with it. And we\u2019re back where we started.\n A safe society need not be a heavily surveilled society. We built increasingly safe and healthy societies for centuries without the use of a single video camera. And beyond safety, heavy surveillance that is this detailed and individualized is the death knell of a society that values civil liberties.\n Maybe that\u2019s what this all comes down to. A free and open society is not without its risks \u2013 this is, arguably, one of the major tenets of Western political thought since the Enlightenment.

If protein isolates are produced in the correct way, so to be safe, they could be considered as human food in the future.\u201d\n \u201cThe whole point about gorse is it is actively being removed from marginal lands \u2013 it\u2019s something we can gain protein from at no extra cost,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a huge amount of gorse all over  Scotland and when we did the calculations, just by active removal from marginal land, there\u2019s enough gorse protein to easily feed [Scotland\u2019s] population.\u201d\n Russell was speaking at a Science Media Centre event on alternative proteins which looked at the health and environmental benefits and drawbacks of alternatives to meat and dairy. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a  polling report at the event that showed 60% of people in the UK were willing to try plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy; a third were willing to try lab-grown meat and a quarter were willing to try edible insects.\n Livestock and fodder production occupies  83% of the world\u2019s farmland but produces only 18% of protein. It also has a very heavy environmental impact, driving the climate crisis and pollution. Studies have shown  sharp cuts in meat eating in rich nations are needed to halt global heating.\n From 1950 to 2000 the global population doubled, but meat intake increased fivefold, said Russell. Continuing this trend in the future is not feasible for the environment, she said: \u201cWe really do have to change our diet.\u201d\n Scotland has little arable land, which is why Russell examined invasive plants on marginal land. \u201cWhen you make a protein isolate from gorse, 57% of the total leaf protein can be recovered at up to 95% purity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re using about 4.5 to 6kg of CO 2 to produce [a kilogram of] isolate, compared to an average for meat of 102kg of CO 2.\u201d\n Fifteen Scottish farmers also planted hemp this year for the first time, Russell said. \u201cThey\u2019re really concerned about the climate and want to do their best. They really are optimistic about the commercial viability of the crop and its climate credentials.\u201d\n Russell, who leads the Scottish government\u2019s strategic research programme on food systems and supply, added: \u201cThese alternative plant proteins are very healthy, high protein, high in fibre, and high in micronutrients.\u201d\n Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA said: \u201cThere is a huge potential for novel proteins to have massive benefits in terms of environmental benefit, nutritional benefit, and access of a wider population [to good food]. Our priority is to do everything possible to help businesses get those novel, innovative products safely onto the shelves as swiftly as possible.\u201d\n May said that while many people were reluctant to try new products, such as lab-grown meat, a quarter said they would change their minds if they were confident it was safe and well regulated. \u201cThat\u2019s where we play a key role,\u201d said May.\n Lab-grown meat went on sale for the first time in December 2020 in Singapore. Proponents say they are produced in clean facilities and do not carry the risk of bacterial contamination of meat from livestock.\n In the FSA poll, 90% of people said they had heard of plant-based alternatives and 78% said they had heard of lab grown meat.\n Neil Shah, at the Edison Group investment research firm, which published a report on lab-grown meat on Monday, said: \u201cThe cultivated meat industry is booming as a result of increased appetite for ethical and environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional meat. The sector has already begun attracting significant investor interest as it offers the chance to enter an industry which could disrupt the global meat market over the coming decades.\u201d\n A 2019 report by consultancy AT Kearney predicted that  most of the meat people eat in 2040 will not come from slaughtered animals.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:42:51", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u86cb\u767d\u8d28,gorse", "title": "\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bf4\uff0c\u6765\u81eaGorse\u704c\u6728\u4e1b\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53ef\u4ee5\u517b\u6d3b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4eba", "title_en": "Protein From Gorse Bushes Could Feed Millions of People, Says Expert", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/protein-from-gorse-bushes-could-feed-millions-of-people-says-expert", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u86cb\u767d\u8d28", "gorse"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e91f8f8fffce6f53f110d2ad66ac2980.jpg", "infoid": 1072718, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u661f\u671f\u516d\uff0cAndroid Boss Hiroshi Lockheimer\u6307\u8d23Apple\u7684\u201c\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u4f34\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6b3a\u51cc\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9500\u552e\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u201d\uff0c\u5728\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u62a5\u62a5\u544a\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5982\u4f55\u5c06Apple\u7684Imessage\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9501\u5b9aAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5730\u4f4d\u7b26\u53f7\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u8981\u6c42Apple\u5728Android\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de8\u578b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42Apple\u652f\u6301IMESSage\u4e2d\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff08RCS\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u652f\u6301\u65e7\u7684SMS / MMS\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u6837\u3002\n\u201c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u5305\u542bRCS\uff0cApple\u6b63\u5728\u963b\u6b62\u884c\u4e1a\u5e76\u904f\u5236\u200b\u200b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd8\u6301\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u201d\u5728Twitter\u7ebf\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7a0d\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u6d1b\u514b\u6d77\u9ed8\u3002\n\u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u524d\u9762\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eApple\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u611f\u8c22epic v\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u5ba1\u5224\uff0c\u4e16\u754c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u82f9\u679c\u9ad8\u7ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u673a\u5bc6\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u6545\u610f\u6263\u7559IMessage\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9501\u5b9a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u62c5\u5fc3Android\u4e0a\u7684IMESSage\u5c06\u53ea\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u5220\u9664\u4e00\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\u7684iPhone\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ed9\u5b69\u5b50Android\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u201dApple Exec Craig Federighi\u4e8e2013\u5e744\u6708\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u201c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Android\u5ba2\u6237\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56Apple\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002 \u3002\u201c\n\u66f4\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u77ed\u4fe1\u662frcs\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7eb3\u5165imessage\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9Apple\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8c37\u6b4c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u70b9\u51fb\u538b\u529b\u3002\n\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u4e5f\u8bb8\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u8d1f\u8377\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u80ae\u810f\u6d17\u8863\u623f\uff08\u4ee5\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff09\u88ab\u64ad\u51fa\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u9762\u524d\uff0c\u5176\u5458\u5de5\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u8868\u8bb2\u8bdd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u50cfWSJ\u4e00\u6837\u7684\u788e\u7247\u662f\u51fa\u6765\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8482\u59c6\u53a8\u5e08\u53ef\u80fd\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u6bd4\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6269\u5927\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6210\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8102\u80aa\u5305\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1......\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4e3aAndroid\u5e26\u6765\u4e86IMessage\u6216\u8005\u5bf9imessage\u7684rcs\u662f\u82f9\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u90a3\u79cd\u5c0f\u7279\u8bb8\u6743\u3002", "note_en": "On Saturday, Android boss Hiroshi Lockheimer  accused Apple of \u201cusing peer pressure and bullying as a way to sell products,\u201d after  a  Wall Street Journal report revealed how US teens have turned Apple\u2019s iMessage into a social status symbol that locks Android users out.\n Now, Lockheimer is taking a slightly less abrasive stance: the Google executive  said Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\u201d\n We\u2019re not asking Apple to make iMessage available on Android. We\u2019re asking Apple to support the industry standard for modern messaging (RCS) in iMessage, just as they support the older SMS / MMS standards.\n\u2014 Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer)  January 10, 2022\n \u201cBy not incorporating RCS, Apple is holding back the industry and holding back the user experience for not only Android users but also their own customers,\u201d  adds Lockheimer, later in the Twitter thread.\n That\u2019s still a big accusation, but one that pulls the conversation back into familiar territory: will Apple  accept Google\u2019s olive branch to make iMessage more compatible with Android, or will it continue to use lock-in to sell more iPhones?\n On the lock-in front, there\u2019s little question about Apple\u2019s motivation. Thanks to the  Epic v. Apple trial,  the world has now seen confidential emails between Apple executives that show the company is intentionally withholding iMessage in favor of lock-in. \u201cI am concerned the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove an obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,\u201d  wrote Apple exec Craig Federighi in April 2013, adding \u201cI think we need to get Android customers using and dependent on Apple products.\u201d\n \u201cJoz and I think moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us, this email illustrates why,\u201d  wrote Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller in March 2016, forwarding an email from Beats Music co-founder Ian Rogers about how he \u201cmissed a ton of messages from friends and family\u201d after switching to an Android phone.\n What\u2019s less clear is whether RCS,  the next-gen replacement for SMS that\u2019s championed by Google and incorporates popular features common to iMessage, has any convincing reason for Apple to sign on. That\u2019s likely why Google is creating a little peer pressure of its own.\n  The Verge has asked Apple if it intends to support RCS  literally years with no comment, so we\u2019re not holding our breath. We\u2019ve also made  the moral case that a company that claims privacy is a human right has a duty to bring encrypted messaging to the world, not just its own customers, and we\u2019ve written about  the personal plight of dealing with Apple\u2019s inaction. (And when I say \u201cwe\u201d, I mean Dieter, because RCS is his jam, I\u2019m writing this post because he\u2019s on vacation, and Dieter srsly why are you reading these words, aren\u2019t you supposed to be on a socially distanced beach somewhere?)\n But maybe now that Apple  is basically a three-trillion dollar company, and it\u2019s under loads of regulatory scrutiny, and its dirty laundry (in the form of emails) has been aired in front of the world, and  its employees are speaking out, and pieces like the  WSJ\u2019s are coming out, and its CEO Tim Cook is likely looking for a legacy  larger than simply scaling up the company to become the most valuable in the world with  a fat pay package as the reward... perhaps bringing iMessage to Android or RCS to iMessage is the kind of small concession that Apple might actually make.\n Correction, 7:48PM ET : Dieter informs me Apple did actually reply to our requests for comment on RCS. Their reply was \u201cNo comment.\u201d I regret the error.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:19:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,android,lead", "title": "Android Lead Hiroshi Lockheimer\u8868\u793a\uff0cApple\u662f\u201c\u963b\u6b62\u201d\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662fAndroid\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0d\u652f\u6301IMessage\u4e2d\u7684RCS", "title_en": "Android lead Hiroshi Lockheimer says Apple is \u201cholding back\u201d the messaging experience for not just Android but its own users by not supporting RCS in iMessage", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877304/google-lockheimer-accuse-apple-imessage-holding-back-rcs-text-sms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "android", "lead"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072716, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "CREV\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002 CREV  - \u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u67097\u4e2a\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u3002\u5728github\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002", "note_en": "Repositories for the crev project. crev - Code REView system has 7 repositories available.

"note_en": "Milton Friedman\u2019s interest rate fallacy is one of the most mystifying and counterintuitive facts in modern finance. Modern economists and financial analysts often assume (and operate under the assumption) that central bankers have near complete control over interest rates, especially in the era of trigger-happy central bank officials who are all too excited to initiate asset purchases at the first sign of financial instability. The average economist and financial market participant automatically associate high interest rates with tight monetary policies and therefore tight monetary conditions in the economy,  even though it goes against the evidence and experience of the past decade, as well as of the majority of economic history prior to that.\n  After the U.S. experience during the Great Depression, and after inflation and rising interest rates in the 1970s and disinflation and falling interest rates in the 1980s, I thought the fallacy of identifying tight money with high interest rates and easy money with low interest rates was dead. Apparently, old fallacies never die. 1\n In various previous issues of  Monetary Mechanics ( Issue #10,  Issue #12, and  Issue #19), I talked about the part that the Federal Reserve plays in setting monetary policy, how monetary policy affects the economy, and (most importantly) the fact that frequently  the actual monetary conditions in the economy do not perfectly align with the applied monetary policies.\n While many people have referenced Friedman\u2019s fallacy in the past, I have not encountered an explanation that is capable of  correctly and  clearly explaining what Friedman is attempting to communicate.  The primary problem here is that most people acknowledge and accept that interest rates are the   price  of credit, but pay no or almost no attention to the   volume  of credit. I believe that what most people associate with \u201ceasy money\u201d is in fact not \u201ccheap credit,\u201d but is instead a high volume of credit. Moreover, almost everyone assumes that because interest rates are low, and credit is cheap, that credit must also be abundant, because why would it not be?\n This is because almost everyone is thinking about and taking into account only  the demand side \u2013 most people would love to borrow at low interest rates, so most people presume that low interest rates must mean that credit is both cheap and plentiful. However, not thinking about and taking into account  the supply side of the picture, the banks and institutional investors who must make the decisions about who to lend to and at what interest rates, paints a misleading picture.\n   The figure above is a bit busy, so I will break down the various components.\n The main feature of this figure is a demonstration of the different rates of credit issuance (through loans and bonds) in different market regimes. One can see that  before 1965, loans were the dominant form of credit extension, and that  after 1984, bonds became the dominant form of credit extension. The left axis denotes the year-over-year volume of credit issuance.\n The right axis and shaded green area denote the Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR) throughout the same period of time. The EFFR functions as a proxy for the general level of interest rates in the economy. One can see that there is  a strong correlation between the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates in the   opposite  direction that many might expect. Consequently, the periods of time with the highest volume of credit issuance are also the periods of time with the highest level of interest rates.\n According to traditional economic theory, high levels of interest rates lead to reduced levels of credit issuance (through loans and bonds) because high levels of interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. According to the figure above, however, it seems that markets are totally indifferent to the level of interest rates. In fact,  the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates seem to exhibit   a positive, not negative,  correlation. Basically, what this means is that low levels of interest rates tend to correspond to market regimes with low levels of credit issuance.\n One can also see the same positive correlation between the volume of credit issuance and the level of interest rates during several other periods of time, including the period immediately preceding and following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, as well as the re-emergence of the private Federal Funds market after the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord in the mid-1950s.\n   Both of the figures above show the same strange positive correlation between borrowing volumes and interest rate levels.  What is going on here?\n I believe that Friedman\u2019s fallacy is best understood through the lens of borrowers as engaging in active liability management and as bidding for funding/financing. During more prosperous times, when the economy is rapidly and robustly growing, businesses and financial institutions are happy to keep extending credit at ever increasing interest rates, because the returns on invested capital are high. During less prosperous times, when the economy is uncertain, fewer businesses are willing to leverage their balance sheets, and perhaps much more importantly, fewer financial institutions are willing to extend credit to all but the largest and most reputable borrowers.\n Now, some people may argue that during the recent period of record low interest rates, all sorts of companies have been able to obtain funding/financing, and we have seen a junk bond explosion like never before. There is some truth to that argument, as funding/financing terms are at some of the easiest as they have been in decades, and junk bond spreads are at lows like never before.\n  However, the focus on junk bonds misses a few important points.  Credit markets, while not as liquid and tradable as equity or rates markets, are   still liquid and tradable  markets, unlike bank loans. Hence, an equivalent credit should trade more expensively as a security than as a bank loan because the buyer of the security can always sell the security in a fire sale when necessary.\n In addition,  credit market instruments can be bought by institutional investors who are not beholden to the same burdensome legislations/regulations that banks have become subject to since the GFC. These institutional investors have  much more balance sheet capacity to hold instruments of questionable creditworthiness than global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), who are far more focused on maintaining their liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs), staying within their supplementary leverage ratios (SLRs), and generally maximizing profit per unit of balance sheet space (usually through nettable activity or by selling bespoke or exotic derivatives).\n When judging whether or not the entire economy is \u201coverleveraged,\u201d it is important to look at the bigger picture. This means not just looking at the record amount of debt securities that Apple is able to issue at rock-bottom interest rates, or even the ease with which private equity firms are able to issue leveraged loans from their portfolio companies, but also looking at what the vast majority of regular small and medium sized businesses are doing.  Thus, it is not what you see, but what you do not see, that is most important.\n  If credit was really as cheap and widely available/accessible as it is often claimed to be, then why have annual small business loan originations still not recovered and reached levels seen in the early 2000s? This is because small businesses have  unquantifiable risks and are truly risky, not only in the sense of  potential default risk, but much more importantly in the sense of  liquidity risk. Consequently, one can very easily see  tight monetary conditions among the 60-80% of small and medium sized private businesses that power the US economy but are not large or creditworthy enough to issue publicly traded debt securities.\n In summary, Friedman\u2019s fallacy is derived from two fundamental, yet counterintuitive, observations of economic history. One,  when the economy is rapidly and robustly growing, and there are plenty of profitable investment opportunities,  interest rates tend to increase, as both financial and non-financial institutions bid for funding/financing to take advantage of the differential between the current interest rates and the future returns on invested capital. Two,  rather than differentiate between good or bad credit based only on price (via higher or lower interest rates),  banks and institutional investors also differentiate between good or bad credit based on access, so that uncreditworthy businesses are altogether excluded from global debt markets, counterintuitively causing falling, rather than rising, interest rates as credit is contracting.\n In conclusion, one can theorize that  falling interest rates can be indicative of tight monetary conditions in the economy in the sense that demand for credit is falling (due to explanation one) and/or access to debt funding/financing is limited to just the largest and most creditworthy businesses (due to explanation two). 2\n      1 Milton Friedman, \u201cReviving Japan,\u201d  Hoover Digest, April 30, 1998.

In this case, wages were not actually rising across the economy, particularly when one takes into account the low paid hospitality workers, such as restaurant hosts and servers, who were furloughed or laid off.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 11:04:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5229\u7387,friedman,\u4fe1\u8d37", "title":

This pretty much sums up modern society; don\u2019t get it, don\u2019t want to try and get it, so it\u2019s meh. Give them more action and they will complain that it\u2019s over the top.

Change things like that and you have made something completely out of sync with the franchise. I also laugh at all the people saying this movie didn\u2019t need to be made. NO movie ever needs to be made. It\u2019s entertainment! Let it be made, let it be like by whom ever likes it and move on if you didn\u2019t like it. Simple. I was able to easily grasp every aspect of the storyline and why things happened. I enjoyed the special effects and even the minimal fight scenes, as too much more and it would have been another Matrix Reloaded. I didn\u2019t expect to be blown a away but I did enjoy it. I read that Hugo Weaving was in talks to take the role of agent smith again but it fell through due to scheduling conflicts. I think even that recast worked out in the movie\u2019s favor. Lastly, I do feel the sorry ended somewhat anticlimactic but this was no doubt due to them wanting to make another sequel, going off then ending from this one. Of course they had hoped that this got great reviews and left the audience wanting another. Sadly, even I think they should have just ended this by destroying the machines in some epic way. If they wanted to make one more it could have been something completely non-matrix and all real world and how they rebuild it all.

HPC applications typically require instances with high memory bandwidth, a low latency, high bandwidth network interconnect and access to a fast parallel file system.\n  Many customers have turned to AWS to run their HPC workloads. For example, Descartes Labs used AWS to power a  TOP500 LINPACK benchmarking (the most powerful commercially available computer systems) run that delivered 1.93 PFLOPS, landing at position 136 on the TOP500 list in June 2019. That run made use of 41,472 cores on a cluster of  Amazon EC2 C5 instances. Last year Descartes Labs ran the LINPACK benchmark again and placed within the  top 40 on the June 2021 TOP500 list with 172,692 cores on a cluster of EC2 instances, which represents a 417 percent performance increase in just two years.\n  AWS enables you to increase the speed of research and reduce time-to-results by running HPC in the cloud and scaling to tens of thousands of parallel tasks that wouldn\u2019t be practical in most on-premises environments. AWS helps you reduce costs by providing  CPU,  GPU, and  FPGA instances on-demand,  Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA), an EC2 network device that improves throughput and scaling tightly coupled workloads, and  AWS ParallelCluster, an open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage HPC clusters on AWS.\n  Announcing EC2 Hpc6a Instances for HPC Workloads  Customers today across various industries use compute-optimized EFA-enabled Amazon EC2 instances (for example,  C5n,  R5n, M5n, and  M5zn) to maximize the performance of a variety of HPC workloads, but as these workloads scale to tens of thousands of cores, cost-efficiency becomes increasingly important. We have found that customers are not only looking to optimize performance for their HPC workloads but want to optimize costs as well.\n  As we  pre-announced in November 2021,  Hpc6a, a new HPC-optimized EC2 instance, is generally available beginning today. This instance delivers 100 Gbps networking through EFA with 96 third-generation AMD EPYC\u2122 processor (Milan) cores with 384 GB RAM, and offers up to 65 percent better price-performance over comparable x86-based compute-optimized instances.\n  You can launch Hpc6a instances today in the US East (Ohio) and GovCloud (US-West) Regions in  On-Demand and  Dedicated Hosting\u00a0or as part of a  Savings Plan. Here are the detailed specs:\n      To enable predictable thread performance and efficient scheduling for HPC workloads, simultaneous multi-threading is disabled. Thanks to  AWS Nitro System, no cores are held back for the hypervisor, making all cores available to your code.\n  Hpc6a instances introduce a number of targeted features to deliver cost and performance optimizations for customers running tightly coupled HPC workloads that rely on high levels of inter-instance communications. These instances enable EFA networking bandwidth of 100 Gbps and are designed to efficiently scale large tightly coupled clusters within a single Availability Zone.\n  We hear from many of our engineering customers, such as those in the automotive sector, that they want to reduce the need for physical testing and move towards an increasingly virtual simulation-based product design process faster at a lower cost.\n  According to our benchmarking results for Siemens Simcenter STAR-CCM+ automotive CFD simulation, when the Hpc6a scales up to 400 nodes (approximately 40,000 cores), with the help of EFA networking, it is able to maintain approximately 100 percent scaling efficiency. Hpc6a instance shows 70 percent lower cost compared to c5n, meaning companies can deliver new designs faster and at a lower cost when using Hpc6a instances. This means companies can deliver new designs faster and at a lower cost when using Hpc6a instances.\n    You can use the Hpc6a instance with AMD EPYC third-generation (Milan) processors to run your largest and most complex HPC simulations on EC2 and optimize for cost and performance. Customers can also use the new Hpc6a instances with  AWS Batch and  AWS ParallelCluster to simplify workload submission and cluster creation.\n  To learn more, visit our   Hpc6a instance page and get in touch with  our HPC team,  AWS re:Post for EC2, or through your usual AWS Support contacts.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 10:53:20", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6027\u80fd,amazon,ec2,hpc", "title": "Amazon EC2 HPC6A\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316", "title_en": "Amazon EC2 Hpc6a Instance Optimized for High Performance Computing", "transed": 1, "url": "https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-hpc6a-instance-optimized-for-high-performance-computing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6027\u80fd", "amazon", "ec2", "hpc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1c39687e099c4e1b55025775e0b71bf5.jpg", "infoid": 1072710, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u56fd\u5bb6\u65b0\u95fb\u673a\u6784Tass\u62a5\u9053\uff0cBelgorod\u6838\u6f5c\u8247\u5c06\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u6d77\u519b\u7684\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u8230\u961f\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u3002\nTASS\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u62a5\u544a\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u8247\u4e0a\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u5c06\u4e8e5\u67082021\u5e745\u6708\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c1a\u672a\u6b63\u5f0f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u3002\n\u5728184\u7c73\uff08603\u82f1\u5c3a\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u957f\u7684\u6f5c\u8247\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u59d4\u6258\uff0c\u6bd4\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u957f\u7684\u53f0\u98ce\u6f5c\u8247\u4e5d\u7c73\u957f9\u7c73\u3002\n\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u901a\u8baf\u793e\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u6f5c\u8247\u6700\u5927\u6d78\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6500\u7c73\uff081,640\u82f1\u5c3a\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u8fd0\u884c1000\u5929\u3002\n\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b0\u7684\u6f5c\u8247\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u56fd\u5bb6\u5229\u76ca\u90e8\u7f7230\u4e2aPoseidon\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3002\n\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u603b\u7edf\u5f17\u62c9\u57fa\u7c73\u5c14\u00b7\u666e\u4eac\u63d0\u5230\u4e86\u6ce2\u585e\u51ac\uff0c\u4ed6\u76842018\u5e74\u56fd\u5bb6\u5730\u5740\u662f\u5168\u56fd\u516d\u4e2a\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u6b66\u5668\u201d\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u6b66\u5668\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u516d\u4e2a\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u6b66\u5668\u201d\u4e3a\u53cd\u5e94\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bfc\u5f39\u9632\u5fa1\u8ba1\u5212\u800c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "note_en": "The Belgorod nuclear submarine will serve in the Russian Navy\u2019s Pacific Fleet after passing a series of tests, Russian state news agency   TASS  has   reported .\n The soon-to-be-commissioned vessel, designed to carry Poseidon underwater nuclear drones, has the capability to carry out missions in any part of the world, according to the outlet.\n TASS  had earlier reported that trials on the submarine would take place beginning in May 2021. However, this has not been officially confirmed.\n The Sevmash shipyard began constructing the Belgorod in December 2012, and it was scheduled to be commissioned in September 2020 after passing sea trials in June,   according to   TASS .  The delay was   reportedly  due to the pandemic.\n  At 184 meters (603 feet), it will be the world\u2019s   longest  submarine once it is commissioned, nine meters longer than the current longest Typhoon-class submarine.\n Its displacement is ten thousand tons while it can travel up to 30-32 knots (55-59 kilometers per hour),   RIA Novosti   reported  citing open-source data.\n The submarine\u2019s maximum immersion depth is 500 meters (1,640 feet) while it can run autonomously for up to 120 days and has a crew capacity of 100 sailors, the Russian news agency added.\n   Dubbed the \u201c  doomsday drone ,\u201d the Poseidon has a range of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) and can carry a nuclear warhead with a yield of up to 100 megatons to most parts of the world while remaining immersed 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) beneath the surface.\n  Russia plans to deploy 30 Poseidon drones in a new line of submarines,   National Interest   reported .\n The first of four Khabarovsk class submarines is expected to be commissioned in 2023 with the second \u2014 Ulyanovsk \u2014 to follow by 2027, the news outlet added.\n Poseidon was mentioned by Russian President  Vladimir Putin in his 2018 state  address  as one of the country\u2019s six \u201csuper weapons\u201d developed in response to the American missile defense program.\n Putin detailed in his address that the underwater drone would be difficult to detect and intercept because of its speed and size and would cause massive damage to coastal targets after the underwater launch.", "posttime":

"note_en": "An article in  The Economist (21 February 2008, \u201cMoralthinking\u201d), sporting the provocative subtitle \u201cBiologyInvades a Field Philosophers Thought was Safely Theirs\u201d, beginswith the following rumination:\n Whence morality? That is a question which has troubled philosopherssince their subject was invented. Two and a half millennia of debatehave, however, failed to produce a satisfactory answer. So now it istime for someone else to have a go. [ 1]\n And the article closes with the line \u201cPerhaps [biologists] caneventually do what philosophers have never managed, and explain moralbehavior in an intellectually satisfying way.\u201d These passagesepitomize a growing theme in the popular and scientific media, echoingclaims made forty years ago with the emergence of sociobiology, when E.O. Wilson suggested that \u201cthe timehas come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of thephilosophers and biologicized\u201d (Wilson 1975, 562). For theirpart, moral philosophers will hasten to point out that they are notprimarily in the business of \u201cexplaining moral behavior\u201din the sense of causally explaining the origins of our capacity formoral judgment or of various associated emotional and behavioraldispositions. If a moral philosopher asks \u201cwhencemorality,\u201d she is more likely to be concerned with thejustification of moral principles or the source and nature ofobligation. Still, there are important potential connections betweenthe scientific explanatory issues and philosophical ones, opening theway for profitable interdisciplinary inquiry.\n Section 1 provides an overview of the issues and a sketch of theconnections between them, highlighting important distinctions we willneed throughout. Sections 2, 3 and 4 then go on to explore criticallythe three main branches of inquiry at the intersection of morality andevolutionary biology: Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics, PrescriptiveEvolutionary Ethics, and Evolutionary Metaethics.\n  Very little in the study of human life has been left untouched bydevelopments in evolutionary biology, and inquiry into the nature ofmorality is no exception. With the recognition that we, like all otherliving things, belong to a species that has evolved through naturalselection comes the acknowledgement that evolutionary processes havelikewise shaped us deeply. How deeply?\n Evolutionary explanations are commonplace when it comes to questionsabout our physiological nature\u2014why we have opposable thumbs,say, or a bipedal posture. But even a brief look at other animalsaffords countless examples of adaptive  psychological and behavioral traits as well\u2014appetites for food or sex,fear responses, patterns of aggression, parental care and bonding, orpatterns of cooperation and retribution; and these traits are likewiseoften best explained as biological adaptations, i.e., traits thatevolved through natural selection due to their adaptive effects. (Wewill go through a striking example involving cooperative behavior insection 2.2.) This raises the question: to what extent might humanpsychological and behavioral traits similarly reflect our ownevolutionary heritage?\n When it comes to morality, the most basic issue concerns our capacity for normative guidance: our ability to be motivatedby norms of behavior and feeling through  judgments about howpeople  ought to act and respond in various circumstances(Joyce 2006, Kitcher 2006a,b, 2011, and Machery and Mallon 2010). Isthis human capacity a biological adaptation, having perhaps conferreda selective advantage on our hominin ancestors by enhancing socialcohesion and cooperation? (\u2018Hominin\u2019 refers, as did\u2018hominid\u2019 until very recently, to  Homo sapienstogether with fossil species of ape to which  Homo sapiens aremore closely related than we are to chimpanzees; these include theAustralopithecines, extinct species of  Homo, etc., making upthe tribe Hominini within the sub-family Homininae.)\n If so, then it would be part of  evolved  human natureto employ moral judgment in governing human behavior, rather than amere \u201ccultural veneer\u201d artificially imposed on an amoralhuman nature (de Waal 2006). This would be a significant result, andit is only the beginning of the intriguing questions that arise at theintersection of morality and evolutionary biology. Researchers arealso interested in the possibility of more specific forms ofevolutionary influence. Are there, for example, emotional adaptationsthat influence the very  content of moral judgments andbehavior, even today?\n For example, many of us believe that among our various moral duties,we have special and stringent duties toward family members. Might this\u2018moral intuition\u2019 be attributable, at least in part, to anevolved tendency to favor members of one\u2019s kin group over others,analogous to similar traits in other animals? Even where moral beliefsare heavily shaped by culture, there might be such evolutionaryinfluences in the background: evolved psychological traits may havecontributed to the shaping of cultural practices themselves,influencing, for example, the development of \u201cfamilyfirst\u201d cultural norms that inform our judgments. Similarly witha tendency more generally to favor members of one\u2019s own group(however defined) over outsiders.\n The above sorts of questions, which are receiving growing attention inthe sciences, all pertain to morality understood as a  set ofempirical phenomena to be explained: it is an empirical factabout human beings that we make moral judgments, have certain feelingsand behave in certain ways, and it is natural for the sciences to seekcausal explanations for such phenomena. At the same time, however, itis a very complex matter\u2014and one often neglected outside ofphilosophy\u2014how such empirical, explanatory projects are relatedto the very different sets of questions and projects pursued byphilosophers when they inquire into the nature and source ofmorality.\n Moral philosophers tend to focus on questions about the justificationof moral claims, the existence and grounds of moral truths, and whatmorality requires of us. These are very different from the empiricalquestions pursued in the sciences, but how we answer each set ofquestions may have implications for how we should answer the other. Aswe will see, though the two sets of issues are distinct, thescientific explanatory projects raise potential challenges for certainphilosophical views, and at the same time attention to philosophicalissues raises doubts about some of the explanatory claims made in thename of science, which often  rely on controversialphilosophical assumptions. Progress in this area will not be madeeither by doing moral philosophy in isolation from the sciences or bytaking morality out of the hands of philosophers and looking toscientific inquiry in isolation. More promising would be a carefulexamination of the ways in which the scientific and philosophicalprojects inform each other.\n  Talk of \u2018evolutionary ethics\u2019 may suggest a well-definedfield of inquiry, but in practice it can refer to any or all of thefollowing:\n Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionarytheory in the scientific explanation of the origins of certain humancapacities, tendencies, or patterns of thought, feeling and behavior.For example: the appeal to natural selection pressures in the distantpast to explain the evolution of a capacity for normative guidance, ormore specifically the origins of our sense of fairness or ourresentment of cheaters. (See section 2.)\n Prescriptive Evolutionary Ethics: appeals to evolutionarytheory in justifying or undermining certain normative ethical claimsor theories\u2014for example, to justify free market capitalism ormale-dominant social structures, or to undermine the claim that humanbeings have a special dignity that non-human animals lack. (Seesection 3.)\n Evolutionary Metaethics: appeals to evolutionary theoryin supporting or undermining various  metaethical theories (i.e., theories  about moral discourse and itssubject matter)\u2014for example, to support a non-cognitivistaccount of the semantics of moral judgment (the idea that moraljudgments do not purport to represent moral facts but instead justexpress emotions, attitudes or commitments), or to undermine the claimthat there are objective moral values, or to cast doubt on whether wecould have justified beliefs about such values. (See section 4.)\n All three types of project have broadly to do with  howneo-Darwinian evolutionary theory might bear on our understanding ofethics or morality. The driving questions, concerns,methodologies and implications, however, differ greatly among thesethree lines of inquiry.\n Importantly, there are no simple or straightforward moves from thescientific projects in A to the philosophical projects in B or C.Arguments for or against such moves require difficult philosophicalwork. Moreover, philosophical issues relevant to C can have animportant bearing on at least some of the scientific explanatoryprojects in A. This puts important constraints on how much canconfidently be said in favor of such scientific explanations givenongoing controversy over the philosophical issues.\n It is, for example, a matter of live debate in contemporary metaethicswhether there are knowable  moral truths\u2014correct answersto at least some questions about what is morally good or bad, right orwrong. If there are, as many philosophers (and non-philosophers)believe, then this will likely make a difference to the explanation ofat least  some of our moral beliefs and behaviors. Our beliefin equal human dignity, for example, along with derivative beliefsabout the wrongness of slavery or rape, might be sufficientlyexplained by our having grasped the moral truth that human beings havesuch dignity and so should not be treated as \u201cmere means\u201d(see section 2.4). Similarly, the belief that we have moralobligations to mitigate suffering even among distant strangers mightbe explained at least in part by our having grasped the moral factthat pointless suffering is intrinsically bad and that this gives usgood reason to mitigate it where we can.\n If this is so, then scientists will be overreaching if they claim that\u201ccausal explanations of brain activity andevolution\u2026already cover most known facts about behavior we term\u2018moral\u2019\u201d (Wilson 1998, 54). Instead, a significantamount of moral judgment and behavior may be the result of gainingmoral knowledge, rather than just reflecting the causal conditioningof evolution. This might apply even to  universally held moralbeliefs or distinctions, which are often cited as evidence of anevolved \u201cuniversal moral grammar\u201d (Mikhail 2011). Forexample, people everywhere and from a very young age distinguishbetween violations of merely  conventional norms andviolations of norms involving  harm, and they are stronglydisposed to respond to suffering with concern (Nichols 2004). But evenif this partly reflects evolved psychological mechanisms or\u2018modules\u2019 governing social sentiments and responses, muchof it may  also be the result of human intelligence grasping(under varying cultural conditions) genuine morally relevantdistinctions or facts\u2014such as the difference between thenormative force that attends harm and that which attends mereviolations of convention.\n We will look in more detail later at this and other possibilities forexplaining moral judgment and behavior. The point so far is just thatthere are plausible philosophical accounts of at least some moraljudgment and behavior that appeal to independent exercises ofjudgment\u2014perhaps in grasping moral truths, or perhaps just informing reflective commitments\u2014rather than to causalconditioning by evolutionary factors. There is a danger, then, ofbegging central questions if we draw  general conclusionsabout \u201cthe\u201d explanation of \u201cour\u201d moral thoughtand behavior based on scientific considerations\u2014as is common indiscussions of scientific work in this area. We may instead need aplurality of explanatory models. The best explanation for deeplyreflective moral judgments may look quite different from theexplanation for unreflective psychological dispositions we share withother primates, and there may be mixed explanations for much that liesin between.\n  As a final preliminary point, it is useful to clear up one persistentsource of confusion in discussions of morality and evolution bydistinguishing between two very different senses of\u2018morality\u2019 and describing more explicitly the differentsets of questions associated with them.\n  People coming from a scientific perspective, who are interested in descriptive evolutionary ethics, speak of morality assomething to be explained scientifically\u2014as in familiar talk of\u201chow morality evolved\u201d. Here \u2018morality\u2019refers, as noted earlier, to a certain  set of empiricalphenomena, such as the observed capacity of human beings to makenormative judgments, or the tendency to have certain sentiments suchas sympathy or guilt or blame, or certain \u2018intuitions\u2019about fairness or violence. Just as we can inquire into the originsand functions of other traits, such as human linguistic capacities, wecan inquire into the origins and functions of the variouspsychological capacities and tendencies associated with\u2018morality\u2019.\n The sense of \u2018morality\u2019 in the above questions may becalled the  empirical sense of the term, and it is in thissense that scientists speak of \u201cthe evolution ofmorality,\u201d using such tools as comparative genomics and primatestudies to shed light on it (Rosenberg 2006; de Waal 1996 and 2006).Such explanatory projects will be discussed in section 2.\n  In contrast to the above, there is a very different use of the term\u2018morality\u2019 in what may be called the  normative sense. Consider the question: \u201cDoes morality requirethat we make substantial sacrifices to help distant strangers?\u201dSuch a question arises from the deliberative standpoint as we seek todetermine how we ought to live, and it is a normative rather than anempirical question. We are not here asking an anthropological questionabout some actual moral code\u2014even that of our ownsociety\u2014but a normative question that might lead us to a newmoral code. When we use \u2018morality\u2019 in the normative sense,it is meant to refer to  however it is we ought to live, i.e.,to  a set of norms that ought to be adopted and followed. [ 2]\n  Philosophers employ this normative sense of \u2018morality\u2019 or\u2018moral\u2019 in posing a variety of both normative andmetaethical questions: What does morality require of us? Does moralityhave a purely consequentialist structure, as utilitarians claim? Whatkind of meaning do claims about morality in the normative sense have?Are there moral truths\u2014i.e., truths about morality in thenormative sense\u2014and if so, what are they grounded in and how canwe come to know them? Is morality culturally relative or at leastpartly universal? (Note that this is not the same as the anthropological question whether or to what extent moralityin the  empirical sense  varies from culture toculture.)\n While morality in the normative sense is not an empirical phenomenonto be explained, there are still important questions to ask about howevolutionary theory may bear on it. Can we look to our evolutionarybackground for moral guidance, gaining insight into the content ofmorality in the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of prescriptive evolutionary ethics)? (Section 3) Doesevolutionary theory shed light on metaethics, helping to resolvequestions about the  existence and  nature of moralityin the normative sense (as claimed by proponents of evolutionarymetaethics)? Does it, for example, lend support to nihilism (the ideathat there is really  no such thing  as  moralityin the normative sense) or to skepticism (the idea that even ifthere are truths about morality in the normative sense we cannot knowthem, or at least could not know them if they were objective truths)?(Section 4)\n Having distinguished various issues and questions, we may turn now toconsider first the scientific explanatory projects concerning moralityin the  empirical sense.\n  Evolutionary explanations for morality in the empirical sense areoffered at different levels, and this makes for very differentexplanatory projects with different implications. Some typical explananda in accounts of \u201cthe evolution ofmorality\u201d are:\n The general capacity for normative judgment and guidance, and thetendency to exercise this capacity in social life;\n  The tendency to experience and to be motivated by certainsentiments in certain types of situation;\n The tendency to make certain particular kinds of moral judgment orinference, or to have certain characteristic moral intuitions (i.e., a\u2018moral sense\u2019);\n The tendency to exhibit certain particular types of behavior incertain types of situation (as a result of D);\n The tendency of societies to exhibit certain particular systems ofnorms or types of practice (due to D and E).\n  It is uncontroversial that there will be evolutionary explanations of some sort for the very general capacities and tendencies in Aand B: we are evolved creatures, and our psychological capacities,like other complex capacities, are outcomes of evolutionary processes.But this does not by itself settle whether these capacities andtendencies are themselves  adaptations, having evolved throughnatural selection because of their adaptive effects. That is the mostcommon view (further explored below), but there are alternatives.\n It is possible, for example, that our capacity to make moral judgmentsis a spin-off (side-effect or by-product) of our non-moralintellectual capacities, which latter are adaptations. [ 3] On this view, we tend to make moral judgments because we areintellectual and reflective creatures, not because natural selectionhas specifically given us this moral capacity and tendency as anadaptation; the role of natural selection would be indirect, supplyingmore general capacities as adaptations, from which specifically moraltendencies spring independently (Ayala 2006; Prinz 2008, Machery andMallon 2010).\n The deeper point, however, is that  whichever position onetakes on the role of natural selection in the emergence of genericcapacities for moral judgment, this does not settle how best toaccount for other, more specific tendencies, such as C-F. Inparticular:\n Even if (1) our capacity and tendency to make moral judgments is an adaptation that evolved through natural selection, itremains possible that (2) the  content of particular moraljudgments is derived  autonomously, i.e., free from causalshaping by particular elements in our evolutionary background\u2014inroughly the way that the contents of our beliefs in physics orphilosophy seem to be (see section 2.4 below).\n Alternatively, even if (1*) our capacity and tendency to makemoral judgments is  not itself an adaptation, it remainspossible that (2*) the  content of particular moral judgments is deeply shaped by evolved emotional dispositions that haveaffected the content of moral judgments since human beings beganmaking them. Such emotional adaptations may thus have influencedcultural norms throughout history and may continue to influence ourmoral judgments, and hence our behavior, today.\n And of course there are other possibilities: 1 might be combined with2*, or 1* might be combined with 2, and both 2 and 2* could also beweakened to apply only to  some judgments, while others areexplained in other ways, as suggested earlier. There are, then, manypossible stories to be told about the origins of our moral judgmentsand behavior.\n Since our concern is with  morality, the crucial issue tobegin with is the origins of  moral judgment: for morality hasnot merely to do with certain emotions and behaviors (such as sympathyand altruism) as such, but with the exercise of moral judgment about how one ought to behave in various socialcircumstances (Joyce 2006, ch. 2; Korsgaard 2006; Kitcher 2006c, 2011;Machery and Mallon 2010). Certain emotions and behaviors are thenrelevant too insofar as they relate to the exercise of such judgment,but in the absence of moral judgmen\n......", "posttime": "2022-01-11 10:38:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8fdb\u5316,evolutionary,\u9053\u5fb7", "title": "\u9053\u5fb7\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66", "title_en": "Morality and Evolutionary Biology", "transed": 1, "url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8fdb\u5316", "\u9053\u5fb7"]}]
