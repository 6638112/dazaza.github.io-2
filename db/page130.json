Your browser is not supported. To try it out, visit this page with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge  (but not on your iOS device).\n        A lot of devices require to be connected to the network to be controlled or receive data. The majority of these devices use Wi-Fi to establish a connection with a local application or the cloud.\n Configuring a device to connect to your Wi-Fi is a pain. The most common approach is Soft Enabled Access Point. The device starts its own Wi-Fi access point, the user connects to it with their phone/computer and then interacts directly with the device via an app or a website served from the device.\n It\u2019s easy for something to go wrong. The user submits incorrect Wi-Fi credentials or the phone loses access to the access point. In such cases it is difficult to recover. Phones also have a bad time dealing with access points that don\u2019t provide internet access.\n  The goal of the standard is to get the device connected to the Wi-Fi via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It is not the goal to offer a way for devices to share data or control. The standard should work without requiring the device to contain a screen.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 09:01:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u84dd\u7259,wi,\u8bbe\u5907", "title": "\u901a\u8fc7\u84dd\u7259le\uff0cGENT Wi-Fi\uff1a\u5f00\u653e\u6807\u51c6\u8bbe\u7f6eWi-Fi ", "title_en": "Improv Wi-Fi: Open Standard for Setting Up Wi-Fi via Bluetooth LE", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.improv-wifi.com/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u84dd\u7259", "wi", "\u8bbe\u5907"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fe13daf19b993d1190971ace7e58b83f.jpg", "infoid": 1066353, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2018\u5e74\u901a\u8fc7\u7684\u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\uff06\uff0339;\u5e38\u89c4\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6761\u4f8b\uff08GDPR\uff09\u9700\u8981\u7f51\u7ad9\u5728\u653e\u7f6e\u997c\u5e72\u4e4b\u524d\u8981\u6c42\u8bbf\u5ba2\u540c\u610f\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7528\u6237\u73b0\u5728\u90fd\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u6216\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u8bbf\u95ee\u51e0\u4e4e\u4efb\u4f55\u7f51\u7ad9\u65f6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u63a5\u53d7cookie\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u60a8\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684HTTP\u6807\u51c6\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u5185\u90e8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5176\u9690\u79c1\u9996\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u7f51\u7ad9\u65e0\u5f62\u5730\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\n  \u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u542f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u504f\u597d\u4f20\u9012\u65b9\u6cd5 - \u5176\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u6258\u7ba1\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684Web\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u7f51\u7ad9\u672c\u8eab\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\n \u5f53ADPC\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0eWeb\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7HTTP\u6807\u5934 - \u5c06\u94fe\u8def\u6807\u5934\u6307\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684JSON\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u7528\u6237\uff06\uff0339\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u53d1\u51fa\u7684ADPC\u6807\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u4e0e\u7f51\u7ad9\u672c\u8eab\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7JavaScript  - \u914d\u7f6e\u5c06\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f20\u9012\u7ed9DOM\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982Navigator.DataProtectionControl.request\uff08...\uff09\u3002\n \u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u6237\uff06\uff0339;

As any Internet user is now aware, this means an extra step required when visiting nearly any website for the first time\u2014or potentially\u00a0 every time, if you choose not to accept cookies. A new proposed HTTP standard from  None of Your Business\u00a0and the  Sustainable Computing Lab\u00a0would allow the user to set their privacy preferences\u00a0 once, inside the browser itself, and have the browser communicate those preferences invisibly with any website the user visits.\n  The proposed standard enables two methods of automated preference delivery\u2014one which communicates directly with the web server\u00a0hosting a site being visited, and another which communicates with the website itself.\n When  ADPC\u00a0communicates directly with the web server, it does so via HTTP headers\u2014a Link header pointing to a JSON file on the server, and the ADPC header emitted by the user&#39;s browser. When communicating with the website itself, the mechanism is via JavaScript\u2014 configuration is passed as an object to the DOM interface, e.g.,  navigator.dataProtectionControl.request(...).\n In either case, the user&#39;s privacy preferences are communicated to the website or server as a list of request identifiers they consent to. This list is sent in ADPC headers for the HTTP-based approach and as the final return value of the DOM interface in the JavaScript approach.\n    Although both mechanisms accomplish the same goal in similar fashions, there are plenty of reasons to support both. The HTTP-based approach is probably more efficient\u2014but it obviously would require new versions of web server applications which explicitly support it (or at least, new pluggable modules in the case of servers like Apache which support them). Meanwhile, the JavaScript-based mechanism works without any special web server configuration necessary\u2014but it won&#39;t work for users who refuse to enable JavaScript.\n  A JSON file is at the heart of the website&#39;s end of ADPC, whether using HTTP or Javascript mechanisms to reach it. That consent file will look something like this:\n {\r &#34;consentRequests&#34;: {\r &#34;cookies&#34;: &#34;Store and/or access cookies on your device.&#34;,\r &#34;ads_profiling&#34;: &#34;Create a personalised ads profile.&#34;\r }\r}\n In HTTP-based ADPC, the webserver links to the consent file directly in its response to an HTTP GET:\n  When the web browser detects this link, it can either respond with previously user-configured settings or request an answer from the user via a pop-up dialog (most likely, one spawned from the browser&#39;s lock button). Once the user has set their preferences accordingly, the browser includes an ADPC header on future HTTP GET requests:\n  In the above example, we see a configuration similar to what one might see on a network firewall: a default DENY in the form of  withdraw=*, overridden by a specific acceptance of  cookies. So for our website which wanted both to set cookies and create an advertising profile, the cookie request is granted (allowing storage of, e.g., user authentication and personal settings), but advertising profile is denied.\n Another benefit of the ADPC scheme is that the user is interacting with their own browser, with consistent UI regardless of website. Another benefit is that it&#39;s possible for the user to set persistent preferences for a site\u00a0without needing to allow cookies\u2014something which isn&#39;t possible for a website which must ask for consent via a banner embedded in the webpage itself.\n    Finally, cookie banners may frequently not be displayed at all\u2014in our testing, popular ad-blocking plugins blocked the display of many cookie banners, including but not limited to  The Guardian&#39;s. Such blocking can be due to collateral damage caused by overly aggressive block rules or deliberate attempts to minimize &#34;click fatigue.&#34; In either case, they prevent the user from directly expressing consent or refusal to privacy-related issues.\n  It&#39;s important to realize that ADPC is not a mechanism for enforcing a user&#39;s privacy profile\u2014it&#39;s simply a normalized way of requesting it in compliance with the European Union&#39;s GDPR and similar privacy laws elsewhere.\n Nothing technically prevents a hypothetical ADPC-compliant website from requesting permission to create an advertising profile for a user, being denied, and then creating that profile anyway. But legitimate sites can request consent in a more machine-readable, consistent, and less user-fatiguing way.\n ADPC does still assist users in dealing with shady sites that ignore their users&#39; preferences\u2014in the event of a GDPR or other lawsuit, users&#39; preferences are more likely to be logged and readable from their own systems.

Microsoft said in a  statement.\n Under Nadella&#39;s watch Microsoft regained the title of world&#39;s most valuable public company. Today it stands as the second most valuable, only behind  Apple, with Microsoft stock having risen more than 600%.\n Nadella&#39;s Microsoft has become more focused on cloud computing services to power other company&#39;s applications, and the company has expanded through acquisitions of business social network LinkedIn, source code-sharing site GitHub and video-game developer Zenimax.\n Microsoft&#39;s board members gave plaudits to Nadella for his leadership during the coronavirus pandemic in  the proxy statement the company filed in December, with the company delivering 14% revenue growth in the 2020 fiscal year, even as the company faced challenges in advertising and other markets. &#34;The board credits Mr. Nadella for his tremendous progress driving cultural change across the organization, especially given the unprecedented impact of Covid-19 on our business and our people,&#34; Microsoft said.\n Nadella is one of Microsoft&#39;s top individual shareholders, with more than 1.6 million shares of the company&#39;s stock.\n  The move came a year after Bill Gates, a co-founder of Microsoft and its first CEO, left the company&#39;s board. Gates stepped down after the board investigated a report that Gates had tried to start an intimate relationship with an employee in 2000,  a company spokesperson said.\n Thompson, formerly CEO of Symantec, joined Microsoft&#39;s board in 2012 and replaced Gates as Microsoft&#39;s chair in 2014, on the same day Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer as the Microsoft CEO.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 08:16:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5fae\u8f6f,microsoft,\u4e3b\u5e2d,chair", "title": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u5c06\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Satya Nadella\u547d\u540d\u4e3a\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e862014\u5e74\u62c5\u4efb\u4e3b\u5e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u8463\u4e8bJohn Thompson ", "title_en": "Microsoft has named CEO Satya Nadella as chair of its board, replacing independent director John Thompson who succeeded Bill Gates as chair in 2014", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/16/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-will-also-become-chairman-of-the-board.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5fae\u8f6f", "microsoft", "\u4e3b\u5e2d", "chair"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4b5f14c37a4af26c965efa6afa85fafa.png", "infoid": 1066349, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u7ba1\u7406\u60a8\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5355\u4e2a\u6761\u7eb9\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u548c\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u89c6\u56fe\u3002\u7ec8\u7aef\u4e0e\u6761\u7eb9\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u8ba1\u8d39\u65e0\u7f1d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u63d0\u4f9b\u8de8\u9891\u9053\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u5ba2\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5982\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5728\u5546\u5e97\u4e2d\u62fe\u53d6\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684SDK\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5c06\u6761\u7eb9\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u60a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u548cWeb\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5e97\u5185\u7ed3\u5e10\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u60a8\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\u6216\u5e02\u573a\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e2a\u4eba\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6761\u7eb9\u7ec8\u7aef\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u4eba\u5458\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u4e00\u8de8\u6e20\u9053\u7684\u652f\u4ed8\u3002\n  \u4f7f\u7528\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8230\u961f\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u8f7b\u677e\u7ba1\u7406\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u7269\u6d41\u3002\u8ba2\u8d2d\u548cDropship\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u914d\u7f6e\u8bfb\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u76d1\u63a7\u8bbe\u5907\u72b6\u6001\u3002\n    \u6446\u8131\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u6761\u7eb9\u7ec8\u7aef\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u5efa\u7acb\u60a8\u7684\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u5e76\u62e5\u6709\u60a8\u7684\u7ed3\u8d26\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u6536\u636e\u6216\u8bfb\u53d6\u5668\u98de\u6e85\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684API\u548cSDK\u5c06\u7ec8\u7aef\u96c6\u6210\u5230JavaScript\uff0ciOS\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eAndroid\u7684\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u3002\n  const\u7ec8\u7aef= stripeterminal.create\uff08{onfetchconnectionToken\uff1aserver.fetchconnectiontoken\uff0c}\uff09;

She then headed to the area\u2019s other national park, Canyonlands, where she waited about half an hour to get inside.\n  With its natural stone arches, sandstone fins and towering red rock formations, Arches attracted about 194,000 people in April, up 15% from April 2019. It was closed in April 2020 due to the pandemic.\n  Arches reaches capacity and closes its gate to visitors most days before 9 a.m., according to the park social-media channels, which send out real-time tweets when the park temporarily closes because its parking lots are full. Those who can\u2019t get in often head to Canyonlands, a traditionally less popular park more than four times the size of Arches. Canyonlands has seen its own visits jump 30% in April 2021 from April 2019, to nearly 117,000. Lines to enter Canyonlands can stretch up to two hours during peak visitation times.\n  You will be charged $  + tax (if applicable) for The Wall Street Journal.

in the dark, rocio morales, night goggles\n Being able to see in the dark without the use of night-vision goggles could soon become reality, thanks to a breakthrough from Canberra scientists. Researchers at the Australian National University have helped to develop a thin film made of nanoscale crystals that would allow users to see clearly at night. The film, thinner than a human hair, has the potential to be placed on a standard pair of glasses, allowing them to be used for night vision. Lead researcher on the project and postdoctoral fellow at the university, Dr Rocio Camacho Morales, said the new technology had the potential for a wide variety of uses. &#34;This is a very important breakthrough, and it will be able to provide lots of opportunities, like being able to drive more safely at night in case an animal jumps out of nowhere,&#34; Dr Morales said. &#34;We have made the invisible visible.&#34; Work on developing the nanoscale crystal film has been a five-year project for Dr Morales and a team of researchers from Australia, the UK and Europe. It&#39;s hoped the film would be able to be applied as a filter to glasses or even drones in order for people to see more clearly during the night. Other potential uses, such as improving safety for people walking home at night or for police and emergency services while on the job, have been touted as future possibilities for the technology. Dr Morales said the new film would also be easier, safer and less heavy to use than traditional night-vision devices, that often leave users with chronic neck injuries due to its weight. &#34;In normal night-vision or infrared cameras, it requires a cooling system for it to work, and so there is often a lot of noise going on as well,&#34; she said. &#34;The current technology converts infrared lights to an electrical signal, which is then displayed on a monitor. &#34;In our case, the [nanoscale crystal film] will all be optical, so no conversion is required.&#34; Rather than requiring cryogenic freezing in order to work, the new technology is able to function at room temperature. While research has led to the first proof-of-concept experiments for the film, further work will be carried out to determine how the technology would be advanced. Dr Morales said the new technology would be easy to mass produce and would be able to be done within Australia, once further research was conducted. &#34;This is just the start, and there are lots of ambitions and applications for it,&#34; she said. &#34;The next steps are to keep exploring those possibilities, which will give us more efficiency and allow us to start partnering with industry. &#34;In Australia, we have the capacity, knowledge and experience in this technology to manufacture it ourselves.&#34; The research has been published in the journal Advanced Photonics.

", "note_en": "Apple has been under a mountain of scrutiny lately from legislators, developers, judges, and users. Amidst all that, CEO Tim Cook sat with publication Brut. to discuss Apple&#39;s strategy and policies. The  short but wide-ranging interview offered some insight into where Apple plans to go in the future.\n As is so common when Tim Cook speaks publicly, privacy was a major focus. His response to a question about its importance was the same one we&#39;ve heard from him many times: &#34;we see it as a basic human right, a fundamental human right.&#34; Noting Apple has been focused on privacy for a long time.\n  You can think of a world where privacy is not important, and the surveillance economy takes over and it becomes a world where everyone is worried that somebody else is watching them, and so they begin to do less, they begin to think less, and nobody wants to live in a world where that freedom of expression narrows.\n And when asked about regulatory scrutiny, he pointed to the GDPR as an example of regulation Apple supports and also said Apple would support further expanding privacy-related regulations.\n But beyond regulations strictly centered on privacy, he wasn&#39;t as effusive. &#34;As I look at the tech regulations that&#39;s being discussed, I think there are good parts of it and then I think there are parts of it that are not in the best interests of the user,&#34; he said.\n As an example of the latter, he said &#34;the current DMA language that is being discussed would force sideloading on the iPhone.&#34; He added:\n That would destroy the security of the iPhone and a lot of the privacy initiatives that we&#39;ve built into the App Store, where we have privacy nutrition labels and App Tracking Transparency... these things would not exist anymore.\n Privacy watchdogs have praised Apple&#39;s App Tracking Transparency move even as advertisers have lambasted it, but the nutrition labels have been less of a hit. Many observers have pointed out that the labels are often inaccurate or incomplete.\n &#34;Android has 47 times more malware than iOS does,&#34; Cook claimed. &#34;It&#39;s because we&#39;ve designed iOS in such a way that there&#39;s one app store and all of the apps are reviewed prior to going on the store. And so that keeps a lot of this malware stuff out of our ecosystem, and customers have told us very continuously how much they value that, and so we&#39;re going to be standing up for the user in the discussions.&#34;\n  The interview wasn&#39;t all about regulation and privacy, though; Cook also responded to open-ended questions about Apple&#39;s future product strategy. When asked what he believes Apple&#39;s products will look like many years from now, he carefully offered the caveat that no one can really predict where things are headed:\n We approach the future with great humility because we know we can&#39;t predict it. I&#39;m not one of those people that is going to say I can see 20 years out, and 30 years out, and tell you what is going to happen. I can&#39;t. I really don&#39;t believe anyone can.\n To back that point, he talked about Apple&#39;s path towards putting its own silicon in Macs:\n We didn&#39;t know when we were working on the chip for the iPhone that it would become the heart of the iPad, and we didn&#39;t know that it would eventually become the heart of the Mac as it just did in this past year. We didn&#39;t know that, but we kept discovering, and we kept pulling the string, and we kept our minds open about where that journey would take us, and it&#39;s taken us somewhere that&#39;s incredible and that has a great future ahead of it.\n That said, Cook named augmented reality (AR) and the intersection of health and tech as areas where he sees future potential. He said he sees AR &#34;as a technology that can enhance life in a broad way.&#34; And once again hinting at ambitions plans for future AR hardware, he said: &#34;We&#39;ve been working on AR first with our phones and iPads, and later we&#39;ll see where that goes in terms of products.&#34;\n On the health side, Cook said he is &#34;exceedingly optimistic&#34; about the intersection of health and technology:\n You know, when we started shipping the Watch, we did so thinking about it from a wellness point of view, but we put a heart rate sensor on it, and I was getting tons of emails about people that found out they had heart problems that they didn&#39;t know about it. And so we started adding more function to the Watch... and I begin to get even more notes from people that found that they&#39;d had a problem because of this ability to continually monitor themselves. I think the idea of continually monitoring the body, much like happens in your car with warning lights and so forth, I think this is a big idea that has a long road path ahead of it. All of those things make me incredibly optimistic.\n The mention of a car as inspiration drew a smirk from Brut.&#39;s interviewer, who shortly afterwards asked if Apple plans to design and begin selling a car. &#34;In terms of a car,&#34;

The winning bidder will also take home a letter, written by the computer scientist, in which he reflects on the code and its creation.\n  &#34;It has been fun to go back and look over the code,&#34; the letter reads. &#34;It is amazing to see the things that those relatively few lines of code, with (the) help of an amazing growing gang of collaborators across the planet, stayed enough on track to become what the web is now.\n &#34;I have never once felt I could relax and sit back -- as the web was and is constantly changing,&#34; Berners-Lee signs off. &#34;It is not yet the best it can be: there is always work to be done!&#34;\n  Although the world&#39;s first web page didn&#39;t go live until 1991, the birth of the World Wide Web is usually considered to be 1989, the year that Berners-Lee  submitted a manuscript entitled &#34;Information Management: A Proposal&#34; at CERN, a particle physics research laboratory in Switzerland.\n Initially designed to help scientists collaborate, his invention soon expanded beyond the academic world. There are now  over 4.6 billion active internet users in the world.\n  Sotheby&#39;s, which is organizing the sale, described the code as the &#34;first digital-born artifact&#34; ever to come to auction. The auction house&#39;s global head of science and popular culture, Cassandra Hatton, said the sale offered a chance to &#34;own&#34; part of a technological development that heralded a &#34;paradigm shift&#34; for humankind.\n &#34;I&#39;ve been trying to come up with something comparable,&#34; she said on the phone from New York. &#34;I thought maybe the theory of relativity, heliocentrism, the printing press, light bulbs or the combustion engine. But I think that this is a much bigger thing.\n &#34;Light bulbs were an improvement on candles, the combustion engine as an improvement of steam engine, but with the World Wide Web, it was something entirely new.&#34;\n   Based on blockchain technology, NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have have  revolutionized digital art and collectibles by offering proof of ownership. The tokens have made it easier to buy and trade digital assets that could otherwise be easily copied, such as tweets or photographs.\n  Berners-Lee&#39;s code has been publicly available since 1993, but Hatton believes that the chance to own the &#34;original files&#34; makes this NFT like other high-value historical collectibles.\n &#34;I look at it from the lens of somebody who&#39;s been a books and manuscripts specialist for almost two decades,&#34; she added. &#34;The existence of paperback does not devalue the first edition, and the existence of the first edition does not devalue the existence of the manuscripts.\n &#34;It&#39;s the same with paintings: How many posters of Van Gogh&#39;s &#39;The Starry Night&#39; are there out there? They do not devalue the painting at all.&#34;\n  Berners-Lee, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004, said in a press statement that NFTs represent &#34;the most appropriate means of ownership that exists&#34; for his pioneering code.\n &#34;Why an NFT? Well, it&#39;s a natural thing to do as when you&#39;re a computer scientist and when you write code and have been for many years,&#34; he is quoted as saying. &#34;It feels right to digitally sign my autograph on a completely digital artifact.&#34;\n  Bidding will open at $1,000 on June 23, and the auction will run online until the end of the month. As with all of Sotheby&#39;s NFT sales to date -- including 28 digital artworks that sold for a combined $17.1 million last week -- the auction house declined to offer an estimated price for Berners-Lee&#39;s code.\n Given NFTs limited history on the market, Hatton said it would likely &#34;be a while&#34; before auctioneers can provide accurate valuations for NFTs market. But she predicted that the buyer would likely be someone &#34;who has lived through the paradigm shift&#34; brought about by the web&#39;s arrival.\n &#34;To really appreciate this invention,&#34; she added, &#34;you have to understand what it was like before.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-17 07:37:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ee3\u7801,\u53d1\u660e\u5bb6,wide", "title": "\u4e07\u7ef4\u7f51\u7684\u53d1\u660e\u5bb6\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u9500\u552e\u4e3aNFT ", "title_en": "The World Wide Web's inventor is selling its original code as an NFT", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnn.com/style/article/tim-berners-lee-nft-auction/index.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u7801", "\u53d1\u660e\u5bb6", "wide"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2cd868838db1f5b268d99d3408db78f5.jpg", "infoid": 1066343, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u660e\u5929\u65e9\u4e0a10\u70b9\u5728\u4e0a\u534810\u70b9\u5f00\u653e\u3002\u5f53\u5730\u65f6\u95f4\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8c37\u6b4c\u5927\uff0c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u897f\u65b9\u623f\u5730\u4ea7\u6295\u8d44\u76845000\u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u96f6\u552e\u5730\u70b9\u4ee5\u524d\u7531\u90ae\u5c40\u548c\u661f\u5df4\u514b\u5360\u636e\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u79df\u7ea6\u5230\u671f\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u53f8\u623f\u4e1c\u4e0b\u624d\u817e\u51fa\u4e86\u8be5\u5904\u6240\u3002\n   \u8be5\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u516c\u53f8\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u3002\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u516c\u53f8\u83b7\u5f97\u50cf\u7d20\u624b\u673a\uff0c\u5bb6\u5ead\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u65af\u5854\u8fea\u4e9a\uff0cWearos\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684Fitbit\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5728\u6e38\u5ba2\u548c\u5f53\u5730\u4eba\u9762\u524d\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n \u201c\u6211\u4eec\u771f\u7684\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5f39\u51fa\u7a97\u53e3\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u987e\u5ba2\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u8c37\u6b4c\u552f\u4e00\u4ea4\u4ed8\u7684\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u201d\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u9884\u89c8\u5468\u520a\u671f\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u201cVP Jason Rosenthal\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4ece2016\u5e74\uff0c2016\u5e74\uff0c2018\u5e74\u548c2019\u5e74\u7684\u5f39\u51fa\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e86\uff0c\u5e76\u771f\u6b63\u5582\u517b\u4e86\u5728\u5207\u5c14\u897f\u5f00\u8bbe\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u201c\n  \u7531\u4e8e\u6d41\u884c\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9884\u89c8\u662f\u865a\u62df\u7684\u3002\u867d\u7136\u672c\u5468\u5bf9\u516c\u4f17\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9884\u9632\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5c3e\u7aef\u3002\n \u867d\u7136Covid-19\u51e0\u4e4e\u80af\u5b9a\u4f1a\u653e\u6162\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u5f00\u573a\uff0c\u4f46\u8c37\u6b4c\u627f\u8bfa\u5728\u660e\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u4f1a\u5168\u529b\u4ee5\u8d74\u3002\u8fd9\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5546\u5e97\u768450\u5c81\u5de6\u53f3\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6b65\u4f10\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5b8c\u6210\u89e6\u53ca\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u5c71\u666f\u4e2d\u5efa\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u5546\u5e97\u5927\u578b\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u5c71\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5e93\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u9664\u4e86\u4ea7\u54c1\u5c4f\u5e55\u548cDioramas\u886c\u91cc17\u82f1\u5c3a\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u5916\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u6c99\u76d2\u201d -

The retail location was previously occupied by a Post Office and Starbucks, which vacated the premises once their leases expired under their new corporate landlord.\n   The store\u2019s layout is designed to be experiential, highlighting the company\u2019s growing hardware portfolio along with select third-party partners. Essentially it\u2019s a way for the company to get Pixel phones, Home offerings, Stadia, WearOS and the newest addition to the hardware portfolio, Fitbit devices, in front of tourists and locals.\n \u201cWe really used the pop-ups over the last several years to get a better sense of what are customer expectations for what we can uniquely deliver at Google,\u201d VP Jason Rosenthal said during a press preview week. We\u2019ve taken learnings from our 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 pop-ups and really fed that learning into what we\u2019re opening[\u2026] in Chelsea.\u201d\n  Due to pandemic restrictions, the preview was virtual. And while it\u2019s open to the public this week, the company will be maintaining the standard safety precautions, as the city deals with (knock on wood) the tail end of the pandemic.\n And while COVID-19 almost certainly slowed the planned opening, Google promises that things will be in full force starting tomorrow. This follows several weeks of piloting, wherein the store\u2019s 50 or so staffers were put through their paces, while the company put the finishing touches on the experience. Prior to this, Google built a full-size store mockup in a hangar space in Mountain View to test out ideas.\n  In addition to product screens and dioramas lining the 17-foot windows, the company filled the store with \u201csandboxes\u201d \u2014 effectively scenarios like a living room, not dissimilar to what you might find in a large furniture store \u2014 albeit better lit. There\u2019s also a gaming area for playing Stadia and a soundproof spot for testing out various Home/Nest products.\n Like Apple\u2019s Store, customers can bring in for repair broken devices like Pixels.

", "note_en": "1. During a recent visit to Cologne, I avoided the city\u2019s most magnetic tourist attraction \u2013 you\u2019ve seen one Gothic cathedral, you\u2019ve seen them all \u2013 and instead I explored the city\u2019s bookshops. Large and small, general and specialized, spacious and cramped, there seemed to be no end to the variety. But they all had one thing in common: they were thriving.\n How do the Germans do it? When a huge, once-mighty book-selling chain like Borders is going down in flames across the Atlantic, how do the Germans manage to keep their book publishing industry so diverse, so robust, so stable? How do booksellers consistently turn a profit on everything from  Goethe to  Grass to  Grisham? Is it because of careful planning? Dumb luck? Some mystical Teutonic gene? Or could it be a  Kultur thing?\n 2. Buchladen, a small shop on the north side of Cologne, is as good a place as any to begin searching for answers. It doesn\u2019t look like much from the street \u2013 green awning, small display window \u2013 but as soon as you enter the shop you\u2019re stunned by the quality and quantity, the variety and beauty of what\u2019s on the shelves. At the front of the shop are new fiction and history books, in hardcover and paperback, by well-known German authors and numerous Americans in translation, including  Philip Roth,  Richard Price,  Nicole Krauss,  Paul Auster, and  Richard Powers. In the paperback fiction section, 30 feet of floor-to-ceiling shelves, I found books by  David Foster Wallace,  Jonathan Safran Foer,  Karin Slaughter,  Don Winslow, and  Elmore Leonard mixed in with German, French, Scottish, Irish, English, and Japanese authors. German readers have catholic tastes. They consume crime novels as hungrily as literary fiction, history, philosophy, erotica, and just about everything else.\n One thing you will not find on the shelves at German bookshops, large or small, is that mainstay of big American bookstores \u2013 signs announcing steep discounts on current bestsellers. That\u2019s because the cost of all new books in Germany is strictly regulated by something called the  Buchpreisbindung, a uniform pricing policy that was adopted voluntarily by booksellers in 1888 and became national law in 2002. By forcing all stores and on-line vendors to sell new titles at the same price, the law is, obviously, a boon to small stores that can\u2019t compete with the volume purchasing of the big chains and online giants like Amazon.de and Buch.de.\n \u201cThe idea [of the  Buchpreisbindung] was to eliminate price competition in order to promote the sale of little-known books,\u201d says  Simone Thelen, spokeswoman for the Mayersche chain, which was founded in the 19th century and now has 49 stores, mostly in the state of North Rhine Westphalia. \u201cIt makes it possible for publishers to publish a variety of books and authors, and it gives us the chance to promote young, unknown authors and books that are not blockbusters.\u201d\n This seemingly counter-intuitive strategy \u2013 protecting books by keeping them expensive \u2013 is actually in line with much of what goes on in Germany today. The country enjoys the healthiest economy in Europe, rising employment, a balanced budget, and an enviable trade surplus not in spite of, but because of, its well-paid workers and their vast network of social services, including universal (that is, mandatory) health care, plus at least four weeks of paid vacation and in some cases more than seven. It makes perfect sense to prosperous, book-loving Germans to pay a fair, strictly regulated price for new books because they believe that the health of the book industry \u2013 that is, of publishers, booksellers, and writers, from famous to unknown \u2013 is vital to the health of the whole society.\n The idea of the government regulating the price of consumer goods is anathema to most Americans, who have bought into free-market gospel and the Walmart mantra that price is everything, and lower is always better than higher. It comes as no surprise, then, that many Americans are wailing about the coming cost of universal health care, our onerous tax rate (among the lowest in the industrialized world), and the need to trim the federal deficit by slashing government spending while preserving tax breaks for the rich. And yet, as the Borders debacle illustrates, allowing booksellers in America to set prices anywhere they choose is no guarantee that even the biggest fish will survive. Pity the vanishing small fry.\n Marion Krefting, a sales clerk at Buchladen for the past 13 years, is, like most Germans, widely read, fluent in English, and addicted to foreign travel. Krefting happens to be in love with Australia, which she first visited in the late 1970s and has revisited many times since, most recently two years ago. In Australia she saw first-hand what happens when the government stops regulating the price of books and lets market forces do the job. \u201cThe first time I visited Australia, about 35 years ago, they had regulated pricing like we do,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhen I went back a few years later they had stopped it. What happened was that the bestsellers became cheaper, everything else became more expensive, and there was less variety.\u201d And now the predictable kicker: \u201cThe little bookshops don\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n Australia\u2019s experience is not unique. After price regulation ended in England, the price of books rose by 8 percent; and when it ended in Sweden, one out of four bookstores went out of business. Always willing to go against the grain, the Swiss, who do not now have a book pricing law, are talking about instituting one.\n Krefting, the daughter of a bookseller, is a fan of such writers as  Tad Williams,  Elizabeth George, and  William Boyd. But her great love is children\u2019s books, and she points with pride to her personal fief, the large, colorful section devoted to children\u2019s books at the back of Buchladen. When a customer comes in and asks for an appropriate book for a 6-year-old girl, Krefting steers her to a book called  Rita das Raubschaf. She gives the customer a concise synopsis of the plot \u2013 it\u2019s about a sheep named Rita who gets bored chewing grass and runs off to become a pirate \u2013 along with her enthusiastic personal endorsement. The customer buys the book without hesitation. Such crisp professionalism is the norm in German bookstores because clerks are required to study for several years \u2013 literature, accounting, and the mechanics of the book business \u2013 then pass a standardized exam before they can become certified booksellers. In DIY, blue-sky, go-for-it America, such rigid standards are almost unthinkable. Which is not to say there are no knowledgeable booksellers in the U.S. There are many, of course. It\u2019s just that Americans hope to find knowledgeable employees when they go to a bookstore, while Germans insist on it. To Krefting, the German way makes perfect sense. \u201cThis is not a job, it\u2019s a profession I love,\u201d she says. \u201cThe pay is not good, the hours are terrible, but I just love books.\u201d\n At a nearby shop called Agnes Buchhandlung, the display window contains copies, in German translation, of  Gary Shteyngart\u2019s   Super Sad True Love Story,  Lorrie Moore\u2019s   A Gate at the Stairs, and  Salman Rushdie\u2019s   Luka and the Fire of Life. The owner,  Uli Ormanns, leaves no doubt about the importance of the  Buchpreisbindung for small shops like his. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical to our survival,\u201d he says. Another thing that helps, he adds, is the national network of book warehouses and its shipping system. \u201cOf the one million books available in Germany, we can order 400,000 of them overnight, just like the big chain stores,\u201d Ormanns says. \u201cOther books, like textbooks, technical books, university presses \u2013 which are not a big part of our business \u2013 we can get in a week.\u201d He then leads me to the corner of the shop devoted to books \u2013 in English \u2013 by American and British authors. Particularly popular with Agnes Buchhandlung\u2019s customers are  Stephenie Meyer, Philip Roth, Paul Auster, and  Jonathan Franzen. \u201cIt\u2019s a small part of our business,\u201d Ormanns says, \u201cbut more and more customers are asking for American and English authors in English, usually after they\u2019ve read the book in German.\u201d\n Catherine Brull, a native of Belgium who has worked in the shop for seven years, is getting ready to crack open her new copy of  Super Sad True Love Story, which is priced at 19.95 euros, about $28, including tax. (The sales tax on books in Germany is 7 percent, compared with 19 percent for most consumer goods.) \u201cThe German people like the American way of writing,\u201d Brull says. \u201cSometimes the German authors aren\u2019t easy to read. They have a heavy heritage \u2013 Grass,  Mann,  Boll \u2013 and they\u2019re always thinking about that.\u201d\n Discounted books are not unheard-of in Germany. When I walked into the venerable Buchhandlung Walther Koenig in the heart of Cologne, I was greeted by a large table festooned with high-quality art books reduced in price by as much as 75 percent. There are four ways sellers can make such sharp price cuts: if the book is used, if it\u2019s damaged, if it was imported from a country without a  Buchpreisbindung, or if the sales are so slow after 18 months that the publisher declares it a \u201cremainder,\u201d thus freeing stores to set their own price. The effect of the rule is that large chain stores tend to offer remaindered books at sharp discounts, which smaller stores rarely try to match. Similarly, there are no price rules on audio books, and therefore it\u2019s almost impossible to find them at small shops. The prices of e-books, which currently account for less than 1 percent of all book sales in Germany, are regulated by the  Buchpreisbindung.\n 3.   Which brings us, finally, inevitably, to the elephant in the middle of the bookshop. I\u2019m talking of course about the differences in reading habits between Americans and Germans \u2013 or, to be a bit more broad, between Americans and most of the rest of the civilized world. Simply put, one of the major reasons Germany has a healthy book publishing industry, beyond its pricing law, is because Germans (like the English, the Irish, the Japanese, the French, and many other nationalities) tend to read more, and more seriously, than Americans. I can\u2019t cite statistics to prove this, but after traveling much of the world I know in my bones that it\u2019s true. I became convinced of it the day I boarded an airplane in Dusseldorf and sat next to a perfectly typical German  hausfrau who spent the flight devouring   Foucault\u2019s Pendulum by  Umberto Eco, a novel that has defeated me every time I\u2019ve tried to read it. I remember thinking: Germans are different.\n \u201cIt\u2019s true that the tradition of reading is very deep-rooted in German culture,\u201d says  Michael Roesler-Graichen, an editor at the magazine put out by the Borsenverein, the national society of publishers and booksellers based in Frankfurt. \u201cIt\u2019s not the whole population. The so-called higher literature, or  belles lettres, is read by a small percentage. But it\u2019s a very vital tradition.\u201d\n In 2007 an Association of American Publishers (AAP) survey revealed that one in four Americans did not read a single book \u2013 not one book \u2013 the previous year. Things seem to have improved since hitting that nowhere-to-go-but-up nadir. In 2009 the National Endowment for the Arts reported that the number of Americans reading literature (novels, short stories, poems, and plays) had increased for the first time since 1982. And this summer a joint survey by the AAP and the Book Industry Group revealed that American publishers\u2019 net sales rose by 5.6 percent from 2008 to 2010, thanks to surging sales of e-books as well as juvenile and adult fiction. Much is now being made of the ascendancy of e-books and the boost they\u2019re giving to the American book industry. I say hooray. But I\u2019m inclined to wonder if this ramping-up of e-reader and e-book sales is an indicator that Americans are suddenly reading more. I suspect they\u2019re merely downloading more. I hope I\u2019m wrong. Time will tell.\n None of this is to suggest that the German system of selling books could or should be transplanted wholesale to the United States. Nor is it to imply that all Germans are better-read and better-educated than all Americans. Roesler-Graichen, the editor, is happy to set the record straight on that score. \u201cWhenever I visit America, people say, \u2018Oh, you Germans are so well educated, you\u2019re so well read,&#39;\u201d he says. Then, with a laugh, he adds, \u201cI have to tell them it\u2019s not true of all Germans.\u201d\n He\u2019s right, of course. But there can be no denying that books occupy a special place in the life of Germany, the country that gave us the printed book. Thelen, the spokeswoman for the Mayersche chain, sums that place up nicely. \u201cBooks are not just a commodity here,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have a cultural value that has to be saved.\u201d\n   An interesting piece with an error. In Australia the small stores maintained their market share after the abolition of fixed pricing in 1972 and ultimately nearly 40 years later it is the discounters that have closed there are probably more small stores than ever before.\n That is no reason for complacency or smugness however as the market is under threat of contraction, and that is the real issue.. fewer people are using their discretionary spend on the humble book.\n This is exacerbated by high prices at RRP (set by publishers not retailers ) and the capacity of companies with favorable exchange rates to compete on price online (read Amazon and their recent purchase Book Depository)\n Book prices at RRP in this country have been high in international terms before and after the abolition. It\u2019s a nonsense that protecting the the profits of what were almost all exclusively International publishers back in 1972 kept the prices down. It remains a nonsense now.\n Very interesting and well written view from the outside, highlighting the situation over here. Thanks!\n It\u2019s certainly true: While hampering the advent of ebooks in Germany, the Buchpreisbindung is \u2013 for the time being \u2013 saving the smaller bookstores from sudden decline. Mind you: Times are getting harder and harder for the small shops here, too, even without the rise of ebooks and ereaders. And many had to strike sail during the last years already.\n  (An addendum by the way: If the nice vintage postcard (presumably from the late 60\u2019ies) is there to illustrate Cologne, you are mistaken. It\u2019s the Minster at Bonn.)\n   I live in Germany and Mr. Morris did a great job describing the situation here. Great essay \u2013 very insightful. We have to realize that some things are worth preserving \u2014 and paying for!\n Nice that an outsider can have these insights into the German culture of books and reading. As a German living in New York, I would even go so far as to say Germany is in general a more enlightened country than America \u2013 may it be recycling, health insurance, taxing the rich. All Germans believe in evolution, pay a lot for gas\u2026 you name it \u2026., but then, why is life in barbaric America so much more interesting than life in Germany?\n Thank you very very much for this article, because we Germans are also very good at whining, especially the booksellers!\n But it is not true that only because the publisher fixes the price, it has to be expensive. They just do what a bookseller would do in the US: Calculating what price the consumer would be willing to pay and how they can still make a profit (remember: The Euro is more worth than the Dollar, so simply converting makes the books look more expensive than they actually are) The problem is, although it is illegal, they sell their books cheaper to the big chain-stores than to the smaller ones. So although the reader pays the same price, not all booksellers earn the same.\n   It\u2019s \u201cStephenie\u201d Meyer. I\u2019m surprised that there\u2019s no copyediting in this article, apparently.\n  as a born inhabitant of Cologne I am deeply deeply hurt that you didn\u2019t visit our famous \u201cDom\u201d i.e. the gothic cathedral ;)\n If you ever think of a new article maybe you should investigate on the people of Cologne and their relationship to the Dom, Karneval and how to avoid the law the \u201clegal\u201d way (called \u201cKl\u00fcngel\u201d \u2013 but that\u2019s a whole different story)\n As in others countries in Europe, people acquires less and less books. Pricing is obviously higher than the reality of market.\n  We can observe the part of books in household spending has decreased hugely (divided by three) during the last years.\n Law of a single price for each book was not ordered for having an luxury market of expensive items but only to give a chance for little shops in downtown to survive at the competition with retail markets biggest companies.\n A very well reserached and very well written piece \u2013 thank you for that. It is indeed a wonderous thing, at least to Neoliberals, that what they would call a price fixing cartel serves to benefit everyone involved: The retailers, producers, authors and readres alike. One of the commentators said that publishers sell their books at higher discounts to larger retailers. This is not quite so: The German law on retail price maintenace (rpm) allows a certain leeway, but not in a way that would allow the big guys to outgun the smaller competition. Where we see marked differences is in the marketing spending: the big retailers demand and get hefty fees for preferred display locations within the shops. Prices have not risen too far over the past 30 years, the period over which I have been involved in the trade, Hardcover fiction hardly ever goes beyond 25 Euros, quality paperback sticks around the 19 Euro mark, mass market sometimes,but not often breaks beyond 12 Euros. Over this period, inflation has outpaced book prices quite severely \u2013 in fact, books today are relatively cheaper than they were 10, 15 years ago. Rpm has also been beneficial in that it has kept the huge retail conglomerates out of the book trade: the German brothers of Walmart or Tesco cannot lure people into their outlets by using books as loss leaders. Another commentator said that reading has shrunk as an activity in Germany \u2013 this is not borne out by the data. Yes, people have migrated in some ways towards the internet and TV, but reading has been staying in the top 10 leisure activities for donkey\u2019s years and there is no reason to believe this will change dramatically. As for eBooks: It is not rpm that slows down the adoption of electronic reading \u2013 it is the relatively small number of titles available (approx. 80.000) , combined with a certain cultural conservatism, that has limited the rush to buy eReaders and eBooks. Currently the maket hovers around 1 per cent. I do read eBooks and find it a pleasant experience, but I do not think that eBooks have an intrinsic value that would oblige us to switch from paper to screen. As for my compatriot living in New York and asking why life in the US is so much more interesting than life in Germany: Since when has New York been associated with life in the USA? Have you ever tried the flyover states? Bad Berleburg is a heaving thrill of a metropolis compared to Red Dust Flats, Iowa\u2026 And a last comment for our friend harping on about the \u201cGerman Solution\u201d \u2013 Get a Life, saddo!\n Hi Holger, well, you got a point about the rest of the USA = everything outside of NYC. I guess I have been around in this country quite a bit. And yes, \u201coutside\u201d it\u2019s just very astonishing. I have not been to Bad Berleburg though. But I have recently visited a very backward family in the Bavarian Woods, no internet or smart phones and such. But they did believe in evolution. AND they were reading books!!!\n    So \u2013 you\u2019ve seen one gothic cathedral, you\u2019ve seen them all, eh? Well, you must be a quintessential fool. The German publishing industry..so robust, so stable? Ask the smaller presses and publishers of literary merit, those that don\u2019t derive their profits from translating bestsellers, and you will hear an utterly different story.\n  Herr Helmut Schwarzer, It\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019m a quintessential fool, or maybe my \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-17 07:30:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e66\u7c4d,books,\u5fb7\u56fd", "title": "\u4fdd\u5b58\u4e66\u7c4d\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u6602\u8d35\uff082011\uff09 ", "title_en": "Saving books by keeping them expensive (2011)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://themillions.com/2011/09/the-german-solution-saving-books-by-keeping-them-expensive.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e66\u7c4d", "books", "\u5fb7\u56fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "612e60f03e73120a73098268bcac164b.jpg", "infoid": 1066341, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6311\u6218\u662f\u6211\u7ed9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u6c34\u8d4c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8db3\u591f\u5c0f\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u6211\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e00\u4e24\u5929\u5185\u8fd0\u9001\u5b83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5907\u7528\u5bb6\u5ead\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\n \u672c\u5468\u672b\uff06\uff0339;

Something like a blockchain explorer, but without the crypto overhead.\n Each node in the system is represented by a hash. Because humans areterrible at reading and quickly identifying large numbers (other than by theirfirst or last few digits), a visual representation is needed.\n  I wanted one that still looks abstract (not as opinionated as monsters or robots),and that plays nice in a rounded avatar UI component.\n    If you are allergic to maths and trigonometry, feel free to play with the moredetailed  interactive example here. Otherwise, let&#39;s dive intohow it&#39;s done.\n  Many of the existing solutions produce square images, yet avatars are oftendisplayed as circles. They would lose information on the corners when rounded,so instead of a cartesian (x-y) approach, we&#39;re going to use polar (angle-radius)coordinates instead.\n  SHA-256 hashes have 256 bits of information that we need to represent. Dividinga circle into 256 sections would make each section too small to be visually useful,and would only leave 1 bit of &#34;value&#34; to represent in each section(0 or 1, black or white).\n   The resulting SVG code for such a grid looks like this (in a React component):\n export  const     =  ( )  =&gt;  {  // Equal radii  const r1  =  1  const r2  = r1  *  0.75  const r3  = r1  *  0.5  const r4  = r1  *  0.25  return  (                               ) }\n Doing this naively, with each concentric ring&#39;s radius being 1/4th of theoutermost/largest one gives us this:\n                                    If we calculate the radii so that each section has an equal area, we getthe following result:\n                                   Equal areas are calculated by solving a system of equations. Each section area is 1/32nd of the area of the whole circle. Assuming the outer circle has a radius of 1, that&#39;s an area of  \u03c0/32.\n To compute the associated radius for a ring, we express the pie slice area with the outer radius R and subtract the pie slice area with the inner radius r:  Pi R^2 - Pi r^2, then we iterate from the outside in.\n More details\n   I don&#39;t know about you, but  0.42 hits the ballpark both in aesthetics and nerd-sniping satisfaction, so let&#39;s go for that.\n  Now that we have 32 nice looking sections on our circle, we can map each sectionto an 8-bit value in the hash.\n   We can split it in 32 blocks of 8 bits (2 hexadecimal digits), and organise them by4 blocks of 8 to map to the rings:\n 12 o&#39;clock -&gt; clockwise31 5f 5b db 76 d0 78 c4 Outer ring3b 8a c0 06 4e 4a 01 64 Middle-outer ring61 2b 1f ce 77 c8 69 34 Middle-inner ring5b fc 94 c7 58 94 ed d3 Inner ring\n                                    31 5f 5b db 76 d0 78 c4 3b 8a c0 06 4e 4a 01 64 61 2b 1f ce 77 c8 69 34 5b fc 94 c7 58 94 ed d3 In order to fill each section with a different colour, we generate an SVG  &lt;path&gt; polygon.Each section resembles a pie/pizza slice, going from the centerof the circle to a given radius, and covering 1/8th of the circle.\n The reason we can get away with all sections going to the center is because of our mapping order: by laying out from the outside in, the inner sections will be overlaid on top of the outer ones in z-index.\n Since SVG uses cartesian coordinates, we&#39;ll have to convert our polar logicinto cartesian SVG path commands:\n interface    { x :  number y :  number } function  polarPoint ( radius :  number , angle :  number ) :    {  // Angle is expressed as [0,1[  // Note: we subtract pi / 2 to start at noon and go clockwise  // Trigonometric rotation + inverted Y axis = clockwise rotation, nifty!  return  { x : radius  *   . cos ( 2  *   .

Instead, we cangenerate colours using the   hsl() CSS function.\n Hue is the component that has the most visual impact, while Saturation andLightness can be used to add little variants to each section.\n To map our 8 bit value to 3 components, we can divide the byte into:\n  function  mapValueToColor ( value )  {  const colorH  = value  &gt;&gt;  4  const colorS  =  (value  &gt;&gt;  2 )  &amp;  0x03  const colorL  = value  &amp;  0x03  const normalizedH  = colorH  /  16  const normalizedS  = colorS  /  4  const normalizedL  = colorL  /  4  const h  =  360  * normalizedH  const s  =  50  +  50  * normalizedS  // Saturation between 50 and 100%  const l  =  40  +  30  * normalizedL  // Lightness between 40 and 70%  return   ` hsl(  ${h } ,   ${s } %,   ${l } %) ` }\n                                     The colour mapping function could use a high-contrast version that focuses on the Luminosity channel rather than the Hue.\n  Our colour encoding suffers from a flaw: two hashes can look very similar, buthave a few bits of difference here and there. They can go unnoticed especiallyif differences occur in the LSBs of hue/saturation/lightness components.\n  It would be nice if there was some pattern to a hash that makes itrandom enough to be distinguished yet coherent enough within itself.A balance between order and chaos.\n In order to fix that, we compute the  soul of the hash, using XOR operations.\n For each ring, we XOR the bytes that form this ring&#39;s section to compute the  ring&#39;s soul.   (horcruxes?)\n // Each soul is between -1 and 1 function  computeSouls ( bytes :  string [ ] )  {  const ringLength  =   . round (bytes . length  /  4 )  const rings  =  [ bytes . slice ( 0 , ringLength ) , bytes . slice ( 1  * ringLength ,  2  * ringLength ) , bytes . slice ( 2  * ringLength ,  3  * ringLength ) , bytes . slice ( 3  * ringLength ,  4  * ringLength )  ]  const  xorReducer  =  ( xor :  number , byte :  string )  =&gt; xor  ^  parseInt (byte ,  16 )  return  { hashSoul :  (bytes . reduce (xorReducer ,  0 )  /  0xff )  *  2  -  1 , ringSouls : rings . map ( ring  =&gt;  (ring . reduce (xorReducer ,  0 )  /  0xff )  *  2  -  1 )  } } // Example for our demo hash: // hashSoul: 0.2313725490196079 // ringSoul 0: 0.9137254901960785 // ringSoul 1: -0.8274509803921568 // ringSoul 2: -0.050980392156862786 // ringSoul 3: -0.9529411764705882\n  Notably, we can  &#34;seed&#34; the Hue with the hash soul, and introduce hue varitionsper-ring with each ring soul, and with the value itself.\n export  function  mapValueToColor (  { value , hashSoul , ringSoul  } )  {  const colorH  = value  &gt;&gt;  4  const colorS  =  (value  &gt;&gt;  2 )  &amp;  0x03  const colorL  = value  &amp;  0x03  const normalizedH  = colorH  /  16  const normalizedS  = colorS  /  4  const normalizedL  = colorL  /  4     const s  =  50  +  50  * normalizedS  const l  =  40  +  30  * normalizedL  return   ` hsl(  ${h } ,   ${s } %,   ${l } %) ` }\n We can also introduce structural variations by changing each ring&#39;s startingangle based on the ring soul, to create a staggering effect:\n   Not only does this help give a bit more uniqueness to the avatar, it also helpswith accessibility for colour-blind people\n  If we change the radius and flags for the arc part of the section paths andplay with each ring&#39;s starting angle, we can obtain interesting variations:\n   With a bit of tweaking in the colour mapping value, we can easily extend thistechnique to arbitrary hash lengths (as long as said length is divisible by 32).\n It so happens that when I started this project, Centralized Coin was using SHA-256,but later on switched to SHA-384, which gives 12 bits per section.\n  You can see the hashvatars  (thanks to  @wzulfikar for the name)in action in the Centralized Coin Explorer,or play with the variants yourself  on the playground.\n I will publish the code as an NPM package later, in the mean time the source code for this articleis on GitHub, as well as the component itself.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 07:30:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

Creative is dead and the spreadsheets and algorithms murdered it. The bots have triumphed and the result is mind-numbingly dull. \u201cNobody gets fired for buying IBM,\u201d they used to say. Now, nobody gets fired for buying Facebook ads.\n We all know there\u2019s a better way than annoying people. Advertising shouldn\u2019t push against what people want, it should  align with what they want. That\u2019s why at Unsplash we\u2019ve decided to build our business on a new model we call  Open Source Advertising.\n Open Source Advertising:  the act of promoting a brand by releasing media (especially images) featuring its product(s) to the public to use and distribute free of charge.\n The brands we partner with say it\u2019s like product placement for the internet. Content featuring a brand gets picked up and repurposed by creators, spreading organically across the internet via articles, blog posts, presentations, and social media.\n The end result is a path far superior to the model that currently frustrates consumers and advertisers alike. And we know because it\u2019s working for the creators and brands we partner with at Unsplash every day.\n   People hate ads these days. They\u2019re annoying, creepy, and interrupt you from getting what you want. Facebook, Google, and YouTube could have changed the game, but instead they pushed the industry even further toward the dark side.\n But once upon a time, before clicks ruled, ads aimed to be compelling. Think of the classic campaigns from Apple, Volkswagen, Absolut, and Nike.\n  During this era, advertising was about more than conversion; it wanted people to  feel something. It relied on great creative (and memorable visuals) to  earn people\u2019s attention instead of privacy invasions and targeted ads to  buy it. As a result, brands got the best of both worlds: sales and long-term brand equity.\n    Sadly, we\u2019ve lost those great, Ogilvy-esque, creative campaigns and replaced them with the digital equivalents of windshield flyers, direct mail campaigns, and door tags. What a snooze.\n  Who\u2019s to blame? The advertising-industrial complex, which sells an outdated approach over-reliant on interruption, programmatic ads, and creepy privacy invasions. It\u2019s the result of an industry that\u2019s gained enormous power yet is built on a house of cards.\n Big Ad loves to tell brands how their ads reach millennials and how video is \u201csexy.\u201d But here\u2019s some numbers Big Ad doesn\u2019t want you to see:\n From 2018 to 2019, the total number of devices around the world with ad blockers rose from 142 million to upwards of 615 million. ( source)\n 45% percent of people report \u201cI don\u2019t notice online ads anymore, even if I don\u2019t block them.\u201d ( source)\n  96% of US people opted out of app tracking in the latest Apple iOS. ( source)\n Consumers aren\u2019t the only ones suffering; brands are victims too. They are forced to keep throwing money into the advertising-industrial complex pipeline in order to reach a ton of people, but wind up infuriating many of them while converting only a tiny fraction. In the short-term, this drives some sales. But in the long-term, this negatively impacts their brand by annoying more and more people. And with a diluted brand, you have to keep spending increasing amounts to get new customers. Big Ad wins again and brands lose.  What a rotten system.\n   Open Source Advertising is built on a model of intention instead of interruption. It gets branded content into the hands of the creators and curators who fuel online media who, in turn, repurpose it for their audiences.\n This process provides a different (and better) kind of origin story; one that\u2019s organic instead of processed. The inciting interaction isn\u2019t \u201cthis is an ad,\u201d it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a creator and I need an image so I can make something I care about.\u201d It\u2019s an organic way to align brands with publications and creators; these people then use that brand imagery to tell stories to an audience which already trusts them.\n   Brands have been forced to choose between the playfulness of creative marketing and the mass reach of paid media buying. With Open Source Advertising, you can have both.\n Think of the Ocean Spray-sipping skateboarder (real name: Nathan Apodaca) gliding down the highway while grooving to Fleetwood Mac. The clip was everywhere online, racking up  tens of millions of views. That\u2019s the kind of thing a brand can\u2019t plan, it can only happen organically.\n  However, brands can\u2019t just sit around and wait for this kind of lightning to strike; they need to plan budgets and they need advertising that scales. As a result, programmatic ad budgets have grown exponentially even though they yield inferior results to something that\u2019s organically viral like the Ocean Spray video.\n Open Source Advertising delivers the best of both worlds. It puts your brand in the hands (and phones/laptops) of millions of creators like Apodaca. And when you let creators use your images, they wind up everywhere. This kind of  brand planting is a natural way to provide scale while retaining the unique, authentic feeling that results when a creator uses a brand in what they\u2019re creating with genuine intent.\n \u201cBut will my brand be safe if go this route?\u201d Yes. Here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t worry: First, under intellectual property law, you have the ability to issue a takedown notice to remove content that negatively infringes on your brand. Second, there\u2019s minimal risk that creators will use your brand imagery in a negative way. We\u2019ve had over 35 million image downloads of branded content yet there have been only five instances of inappropriate usage. Basically, it\u2019s a non-issue. Why? In large part, it&#39;s because Unsplash is a curated environment. Only one in a hundred images meet the submission guidelines of Unsplash. High quality visuals result in high quality usage. Plus, brands get to choose which visuals they want to share in the first place. It\u2019s tough to smear a brand by using its preferred content. When you consider the upside (i.e. creators spreading your brand visuals in a positive way to millions of people), the opportunity is exponentially greater than the risk.  Give creators a permission slip; don\u2019t be afraid to go viral.\n  The most valuable digital real estate is not for sale, it\u2019s owned by creators who have earned the trust of their loyal audiences. Open Source Advertising allows brands to align with these creators in a symbiotic way that benefits everyone involved.\n    They wind up in the sandbox of creators who are highly trusted and know how to speak to their audience.\n   Consumers trust these images used by someone they know more than random \u201cmedia units\u201d that interrupt their day.\n The image usage doesn\u2019t originate in a paid transaction, it begins with the creator\u2019s authentic desire to show the brand. There\u2019s no substitute for authentic enthusiasm.\n  A bridge of trust is maintained between creator and audience. Creators are using this content because they  want to, not because they\u2019re getting paid to.\n    Unsplash visuals dominate the internet \u2013 reaching an audience of more than 300 million people (and growing) across tens of thousands of the internet&#39;s most popular platforms and websites each month. As the internet becomes more visual, Open Source Advertising is a way for brands to ride that wave.\n  Get images. Unsplash works with brands to find visuals that align with the goals of the campaign (if none exist yet, we help find photographers to create them). The goal is for the brand impression to be obvious but not obnoxious.\n Images appear in results. The images then appear promoted across relevant searches on Unsplash where they\u2019re downloaded by creators.\n Creators use images. Creators search for visuals they want to use in their creations and spread them online. (Good news for brands: Creators tend to use branded images at the same rate they use other images on Unsplash.)\n The creator&#39;s content is viewed by audiences who trust the maker. Image views spread exponentially, driving awareness to the brand and its desired positioning.\n Brands get results. Unsplash tracks results via API integrations and reverse image searches revealing the articles, images, and other creations using the brand\u2019s image.\n It\u2019s the perfect way for brands to achieve relevance at mass scale. It\u2019s as if a brand had the option to get its press kit into the hands of millions of creators eager to use its hi-res brand imagery.\n   Brands we\u2019ve worked with have gotten over 7 billion impressions. This brand planting has resulted in over 35 million uses of brand visuals in major publications, blog posts, Instagram posts, keynote presentations, and more.\n According to brand lift studies conducted by the research firm Kantar, Unsplash outperforms TV and existing digital channels, including Instagram, by 2x-5x.\n 92% of the brands that have tried an Open Source Advertising campaign with Unsplash are still working with with us today.\n   Open Source Advertising provides a new way. It\u2019s less interruption, more intention. Less invasion, more opt-in. Less friction, more freedom. Less buying attention, more earning it. It\u2019s the antidote to the advertising-industrial complex. And phew, we need that right now.\n If you\u2019d like to learn more about Open Source Advertising,  get in touch.\n We&#39;ll be sharing more of our point of view on advertising and updates on Unsplash for Brands.

I\u2019ve done it quite a bit myself and I know you&#39;ve all done it too.\n  After all, if you&#39;ve been a certain way since you can remember, then maybe you should just assume it\u2019s who you are right? Objectively it&#39;s probably a mixture of the environment you grew up in, genetics / brain chemistry and all that fun stuff right? You&#39;ve been a procrastinator since birth, you&#39;ve felt socially awkward since kindergarten. These things don\u2019t change, at least not for you. It\u2019s just who you are, and you&#39;ll learn to work around it. No point in addressing something that&#39;s embedded into your DNA.\n Before you click off this page thinking I\u2019m about to launch into a Tony Robbins style self help guide (I kind of am), please just entertain me with the following.\n  If you don\u2019t have an answer that feels natural just make something up. Write something that sounds like some annoying person somewhere would probably agree with it.\n Don&#39;t worry I&#39;m not recording what you type unless someone offers me a good price.\n    For the few of you that actually tried to complete the prompts you probably noticed that it wasn&#39;t all that difficult to come up with something.\n You probably also noticed that both of your answers had some degree of truth to them. Although one might be more objective than the other.\n  If one of these had to be engrained into your mind for the rest of your life which one would you pick?\n   I&#39;m not trying to ask you which one is closer to the truth. But whichever one you chose to focus on would surely impact the decisions you make throughout your life. As annoying as this kind of stuff may come across as there really isn&#39;t any denying it. The people who focus on limitations will have more of them. Even if they are valid.\n We pick the data from our minds to confirm what we already believe to be true of ourselves and the world.\n Almost the entirety of our self identity comes down to confirmation bias and there is no shortage of data.\n When it comes to self image pretty much everything can be true (and false) and you are probably much less objective than you&#39;d like to think.\n    Maybe? I would of course like to believe the answer is always yes. You can boost your self esteem, confidence and motivation to levels you thought impossible. At least that much is true. You can change deeply engrained personality traits in a day that you probably thought were unchangeable. But maybe not all of them.\n However, maybe you specifically can&#39;t. Maybe you are entirely right about yourself. You have somehow managed to build your self identity out of pure objectivity and there is no room for growth. Maybe you are already perfect or maybe you just suck way more than everyone else or got dealt a truly impossible hand. That&#39;s definitely the case for someone out there reading this. I&#39;m truly sorry you had to get through this article just to be left with that.\n But the truth is most people do meet the minimum requirements to reach their goals and change for the better. And they probably know that already but still do nothing. Unfortunately if they don&#39;t do something about it they aren&#39;t going to have a very fulfilled life. There really isn&#39;t any way around that.\n For most people, someone in their exact position has accomplished everything they could dream of.\n The good news is that it&#39;s probably not going to be as hard to shift your mindset as you would think.\n Like a mental couch potato, you may have allowed your confidence and self beliefs to get ridiculously out of shape. It\u2019s probably time that you change that.\n Very deep, I know. If I had a less irritating way of writing that I would have.\n  So far this has been mostly drivel. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen a million articles in the self help niche blasting you with the same few points but ultimately leaving you with nothing you can apply.\n Hopefully I can offer you something that you actually can do. Something that will actually make you notice a difference in both the way you think and feel.\n And all it really is, is exercises. Mental exercises that force you to think from perspectives that you aren&#39;t all that used to. Maybe even think thoughts that you have never had in your entire life.\n If you have been a chronic procrastinator for your entire life, you&#39;ve probably never asked yourself:\n  Because why would you ever do that? It doesn&#39;t make any sense. But how can you ever expect to change something you constantly reaffirm to yourself every single day of your life?\n You have to know what it feels like to be someone you&#39;re not to be well... someone you&#39;re not.", "posttime": "2021-06-17 07:28:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u81ea\u5c0a,esteem,\u53ef\u80fd", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u5c0a\u548c\u505c\u6b62\u62d6\u5ef6 ", "title_en": "How to Boost Self Esteem and Stop Procrastinating", "transed": 1, "url": "https://neuralshifter.com/posts/boost-self-esteem-stop-procrastination", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u81ea\u5c0a", "esteem", "\u53ef\u80fd"]}]
