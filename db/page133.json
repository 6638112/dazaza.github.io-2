Here\u2019s the thinking.\n Context \u00b7 But first: This is part of this blog\u2019s  Investing theme, whose  Intro makes it clear that I have no investment expertise and nobody should take this as investment advice, because it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just a bloggy disclosure of some of my own financial positions, which I owe readers anyhow.\n  While I\u2019m an admirer of the technology, I\u2019ve repeatedly criticized Bitcoin specifically and blockchain in general, on the grounds that I\u2019ve seen no practical real-world applications.\n   Beliefs \u00b7 I believe the following things about Bitcoin. This is not a scholarly article so I\u2019m not going to provide references, but I\u2019ve seen enough evidence that I\u2019m willing to bet my own money based on them.\n A high proportion of all Bitcoins are owned by insiders; miners and people close to the exchanges. Their cost basis is much lower than the current Bitcoin price, and that cost is in practice sunk.\n Bitcoin is not usable as a currency because the transaction costs and latency are both too high. (Yes, I know about the Lightning network.)\n A high proportion of Bitcoin trading is intermediated by Tethers (USDT). There are strong reasons to suspect that Tethers are a highly unstable stablecoin. The facts about whatever backs them up are mostly unknown. In practice they\u2019re quite difficult to convert to real money. There are repeated allegations that Tethers are created out of thin air to prop up the price of Bitcoin.\n The Bitcoin market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s easy to believe that much of the trading is seriously sketchy, whether that\u2019s based on ad-hoc Tether creation, wash trading, or other well-known pump/dump schemes. These practices have run rampant on every financial market in human history that hasn\u2019t regulated against them fiercely. Why should Bitcoin be any different?\n The net effect is that money flows in from, in effect, suckers and rubes, then into the pockets of the insiders. A bit goes back out to non-insiders but, as I know personally, converting Bitcoin into cash is a high-latency high-friction operation. Converting Tether to cash? Good luck with that.\n Bitcoin\u2019s Byzantine-generals solution, based on proof-of-waste, is unacceptable in the face of the oncoming climate crisis.\n To the extent that Bitcoin has an ideology, it\u2019s some sort of mutant greedhead libertarian claptrap. Most people on the scene can\u2019t spell \u201cideology\u201d and are there to make a quick speculative buck. Since Bitcoin has no practical uses, the buyer is a fool who is counting on eventually finding a greater fool.\n My best guess is that pretty soon the supply of greater fools runs out. At that point the insiders holding the bulk of Bitcoins will rationally be willing to unload for dramatically lower prices, which probably leads to a dramatic deflation. This could be provoked by a Tether collapse, or legal action from any one of a number of governments, or the public exposure of egregious insider sleaze. Or some surprise of the kind that history is full of, the kind that nobody was expecting.\n When will it happen? I dunno. I\u2019ll be astonished if we get through 2021 without an explosion.\n How to short Bitcoin? \u00b7 The classic short would be to borrow Bitcoins and sell them, in the expectation of being able to buy them back for much less when the time comes to return them. But I\u2019ve sold Bitcoin and I didn\u2019t like the experience. Also, if I\u2019m wrong, the downside is unlimited, which violates our  #BeCareful investing principle. So no.\n Some of the crypto exchanges offer options, including puts. But I personally have little to no faith in the integrity or durability of these organizations. Should Bitcoin take the kind of dive I expect, the chances of getting your Put exercised would be about zilch. So, no.\n  In Canada, there\u2019s the  Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC.B on TSX), which actually trades on the mainstream market. Which I take to mean that a put option should exercise fine even during a meltdown because whoever wrote it would have had to establish their ability to cover margin. Nothing fancy about it, as I write this its assets are 21597.3588 Btc.\n Then there\u2019s this company called MicroStrategy ($MSTR) which has been around since 1989 and sells business-intelligence and analytics software. I have no idea if the software is any good.\n They became infamous in March 2000 upon revealing \u201caccounting problems\u201d. The share price collapsed, marking the start of the dot-com crash. The US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission sued their asses for fraud and eventually the company settled, paying big fines without admitting any guilt.\n 21 years later, the company still has the same CEO, Michael Saylor. His Twitter avatar now has Bitcoin-y laser eyeballs, as you can see in  the tweet below.\n  Between August 2020 and June 2021, MicroStrategy bought a lot of Bitcoin. There\u2019s a prominent Bitcoin-labeled pointer on the front page at microstrategy.com which leads to  hope.com \u2009\u2014\u2009Bitcoin is Hope. It\u2019s absurd.\n Recall the words \u201crube\u201d and \u201csucker\u201d that I used above? I think Micro\u00adStrategy is one of those, corporately. Maybe their share price can survive the Bitcoin bet going south? But I doubt it. So I bought puts.\n Finally, Coinbase. I see no reason to think they\u2019re dishonest or stupid, and I know people who\u2019ve used them for Bitcoin trading and came away happy. If you believe in the long-term existence of a lively Bitcoin marketplace, they\u2019re probably a good investment. But I don\u2019t. So, I picked up puts.\n Looking forward \u00b7 Puts are pretty cheap. If I\u2019m totally wrong and Bitcoin is still sailing along at the end of 2021, I\u2019ll be annoyed but not impoverished. If it crashes I\u2019ll be sad for the unfortunates who lost their stakes, and entirely unsympathetic to the insider community.\n       As a recent btc buyer I&#39;m one of the suckers but I didn&#39;t realise everything you say is true until too late. Hoping the value stays up until I can offload on another sucker! Good luck with the put.\n If you don&#39;t follow David Rosenthal&#39;s blog, you should do. (Another ex-Sun DE.) His analysis of cryptocurrency in a series of posts over the last couple of years has been devastating.  https://blog.dshr.org/\n Reasonable reasons. But, why this year?

After 90\u00a0years in a micro-pocket of midtown bordered by Times Square and Bryant Park,  The New Yorker was heading to new quarters, at the southern tip of Manhattan.\n My colleague Pamela Maffei McCarthy greeted me at her door and, with a sly smile, pressed on me four fat folders. \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to look at these,\u201d she said.\n As deputy editor, Pam may have accumulated more files than anyone else in our offices, so I suspected that she was attempting a wily offloading maneuver, sticking me with a papery hillock of old expense reports. No backsies! But, after I took the files to my desk and started to sort through the delicate onionskin pages, I realized that this was treasure\u2014 hundreds of editing memos written by Harold Ross, who founded  The New Yorker, in 1925, and ran it for a generation. The memos were dated 1950 and 1951, his last two years alive.\n  Ross was suffering from lung cancer and other painful maladies in those final years, but his eccentric, unstoppable obsessiveness, his unembarrassed habit of questioning every matter of grammar, usage, and fact, no matter how niggling, seemed undiminished. Encountering \u201cBird of Passage,\u201d a short story by a pup writer named Roger Angell, Ross riddled the query pages with numbered points of contention, a spray of editorial buckshot. A few pellets:\n  Do people say  executive, i.e., use it in conversation. It\u2019s pretty much of a writer\u2019s word.\n It is my recollection that most hotels have uncarpeted marble or floors that look like marble.\n Reading John Cheever\u2019s short story \u201cClancy in the Tower of Babel,\u201d Ross responds, \u201cOne technical point in this piece bothers me. Cheever has Clancy, his elevator man Clancy, around the building early in the morning and late of the evening. . . \u00a0I think under union rules, which govern these things, elevator men gain the day shift by seniority.\u201d He senses that a reporting piece from Berlin by Joseph Wechsberg is overly sympathetic: \u201cI still think it is too soon for us to go pro-German.\u201d\n  And, as he considers an essay by Lionel Trilling, you can practically hear the sigh of a man who set out to create a \u201ccomic weekly\u201d surrendering to the demands of a graver sensibility: \u201cI suppose there\u2019s no other way of doing this, but it always bothers me when a reviewer writes as if he\u2019s talking the book over with someone who has already read it, and knows what\u2019s on p. 236.\u201d\n  In those days, Ross had to spend many days in the hospital. He was quick to disappointment and exasperation, and yet he had a successor in mind, an editor as seemingly recessive in manner as he had been aggressive and incandescent. William Shawn, a shy newspaperman from Chicago, worked in the early 1930s\u00a0for Ross as an \u201cidea man.\u201d Ben Yagoda writes in  About Town, an excellent history of the magazine, that on Shawn\u2019s first two days on the job he conceived ideas for ten Talk pieces, including the \u201cJac Mac Famous School of Acrobatics\u201d; pigeon farms on Manhattan rooftops; a rat exterminator on Riker\u2019s Island; and George Selkirk, the talented, if not quite immortal, outfielder whose destiny it was to replace Babe Ruth in right for the Yankees. Shawn made his mark as an editor by directing the magazine\u2019s coverage of the Second World War. Ross came to think of him as indispensable. As he wrote to Kay Boyle, in 1949, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything with Shawn away, for the future is in his head.\u201d When Ross died in December 1951, Raoul Fleischmann, the magazine\u2019s owner, appointed Shawn. He remained in the job for the next 35\u00a0years.\n In his attention to detail and his urge to clarity, Shawn resembled\u00a0Ross. Yagoda relates how Shawn sent a memo to Matthew Josephson telling him that his profile of William Knudsen, a leader of the automobile industry, was \u201ca stunning piece of historical reporting.\u201d Then he wrote that he was appending \u201ca few questions.\u201d There were 178.\n But Shawn, who took over the magazine in January 1952, was a distinctly different personality. Shawn assumed for himself far more authority than Ross, who was prepared to delegate a greater amount to his various deputies, or \u201cJesuses.\u201d Shawn was also quiet, subtle, secretive, elliptical, and, to some, quite strange. He was a variety of genius who enjoyed funny writing as well as serious fiction, supported completely the individual artists and writers on a profoundly variegated staff, and expressed his myriad curiosities about the world by sending writers out to explore its many corners. J.D. Salinger called him \u201cthe most unreasonably modest of born great artist-editors.\u201d Beneath the modesty, however, was a steely tactical will. Harold Brodkey suggested that Shawn combined the qualities of Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and Saint Francis of Assisi.\n   Shawn was also working in radically different circumstances than Ross. In the early years of the magazine, Ross was often at odds with ownership and battling over questions of principle and money. As with most fledgling editorial enterprises, the central concern was existence itself. Would the thing survive?  The New Yorker almost closed its doors more than once. I have on my wall a rueful letter from Fleischmann informing a business-side colleague that he was shutting the magazine down. It is dated May 1925\u2014three months after the debut issue. There were many such moments of despair and rescue. But the magazine found its financial footing, and, by the early 1950s, it was in happy synch with the postwar consumer boom. Educated middle- and upper-middle-class readers seemed to want what  The New Yorker was providing, and advertisers identified the magazine as uniquely suited to reaching those freespending readers.\n With that kind of security, and with so many editorial columns to fill, Shawn could think expansively about the magazine. He could build on\u00a0the deepening ambitions of the 40s\u00a0with the plump resources of the 50s. If he wanted reporting from the newly independent country of Ghana, the big East-West summit in Geneva, or the Bandung Conference, in Indonesia, he did not consult the ledger books; he sent a writer. In fact, the sheer proliferation of advertising demanded that Shawn scramble in search of more and more editorial matter. This, he found, had an inevitable drag on quality. There is, in this world, after all, only\u00a0so much talent at a given time\u2014only so much good writing. At a certain point, he found it necessary to limit the pages in a weekly issue to 248\u2014as fat as a phone book in some towns. In his tenure as editor, Shawn made innumerable hires, tried out countless freelancers, and ran long, multipart series\u2014some forgettable, some central to the literary and journalistic history of mid-century America. His relationship to advertising was distinguished mainly by the ads he found too distasteful to accept. A manufacturer of bathroom fixtures once told me that his ads for bathtubs and sinks had been rejected, because, as Shawn told him, \u201cThey are in the bathroom, which means they are next to the, well, you know . . .\u201d\n Decorum was important to Shawn, even though the world was changing. Rachel MacKenzie, a fiction editor, rejected Philip Roth\u2019s 40,000-word novella \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d less because of its length\u2014the magazine had just run J. D. Salinger\u2019s 50,000-word \u201cZooey\u201d\u2014but, rather, because, as MacKenzie wrote, \u201ctaste would rule out here much of what is essential to the narrative.\u201d The magazine accepted Roth\u2019s \u201cDefender of the Faith\u201d but not his more frenetic story \u201cEli, the Fanatic.\u201d \u201cWe all agree that there are remarkable things in the story,\u201d MacKenzie wrote to Roth\u2019s agent, \u201cbut we feel that it keeps sliding off into caricature and farce and that in the end it falls between realism and didactic modern fable, the emotional thread breaking and the lesson taking over.\u201d\n  Shawn was also wary of the Beats, perhaps the most lasting school of literary outrage in the 50s. When the fiction editor Katharine White rejected the author of  On the Road, she wrote, \u201cWe read with a great deal of interest John Kerouac\u2019s \u2018Go, Go, Go,\u2019 and it makes us hope that he will have other short stories to send us. . . \u00a0We hope that Mr. Kerouac will try something for us that is not about this particular group of wild kids.\u201d Similarly, the magazine, which was alive to the work of young poets like James Merrill, Adrienne Rich, and Sylvia Plath, was not a home for \u201cHowl\u201d or \u201cKaddish.\u201d Jane Kramer would write a marvelous multipart profile of Allen Ginsberg, but not until the late 60s.\n  Critics like Seymour Krim worried that  The New Yorker, which had exhibited so much bite in its first few decades, was now getting complacent and reserved in middle age. But no magazine can be a completist omnibus of the cultural or political moment, and this one never aspired to be one. History will inevitably find it wanting in some way or another. A reader looking in the 50s\u00a0archives for a profile of Chuck Berry will be disappointed. The coverage of jazz did not prove worthy of the form\u00a0until Shawn gave Whitney Balliett a jazz column, in 1957, by which time rock and roll was under way. Shawn\u2019s magazine was much more in the groove of its time with other arts, as some of the pieces here make thrillingly evident: Lillian Ross\u2019s irresistible Hemingway profile, Winthrop Sargeant\u2019s profiles of Richard Avedon and Marianne Moore, Berton Rouech\u00e9\u2019s piece on Jackson Pollock, Truman Capote\u2019s barbed portrait of a youngish Marlon Brando, Thomas Whiteside\u2019s profile of Pat Weaver, the executive-maestro of NBC.\n One of the lasting triumphs of cultural reporting for the magazine in the 50s\u00a0was Lillian Ross\u2019s five-part series about John Huston, Hollywood, and the making of a mediocre adaptation of Stephen Crane\u2019s  The Red Badge of Courage. Ross had joined the magazine during the war, one of a small number of women who found a place there when so many men were in the service. Having obtained unfettered access to Huston, the cast, the set, and the relevant executives, Ross painted a dramatic, detailed, and wicked portrait of all the ambitions and compromises that go into even a failed and ephemeral production. Ross\u2019s prose is direct, and unembellished, but the simplicity is deceptive. The influence of the work was significant. Norman Mailer, when discussing  The Executioner\u2019s Song, credited Ross as a pioneer in nonfiction.\n  Political and foreign reporting had become a great deal more serious during the Second World War, and there was no going back to the wide-eyed, we-are-confused-little-men fripperies of the bygone world. Reading the best of it here, you get an uncanny sense of writers coming to grips with issues and maps that are with us today. A.J. Liebling in Gaza and Janet Flanner in Algeria confront the emerging Middle East; Joseph Wechsberg in Berlin and Emily Hahn in China draw the fault lines of the Cold War. Bernard Taper\u2019s travels with Thurgood Marshall, in his days with the NAACP, is an early look at the civil-rights movement. And Richard Rovere, a Communist who, as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, had become an anti-Communist liberal, covered Washington as an outsider living in Rhinebeck, New York. His running portrayal of the malign phenomenon of Joseph McCarthy was some of the most impressive political coverage that the magazine had yet produced.\n Harold Ross liked to pose as anti-intellectual\u2014he famously declared himself unsure whether Moby Dick was \u201cthe man or the whale.\u201d Shawn was without any such ambivalence toward intellectual ambition. One of the first writers he hired was Dwight Macdonald, who had been an editor at  Partisan Review. Macdonald was capable of both outrageously witty criticism\u2014as when he dissects Mortimer Adler\u2019s Great Books set\u2014and vivid, sympathetic political reporting, as with his profile of the Catholic social activist Dorothy Day.\n  The postwar 50s\u00a0had a certain technological utopianism about them\u2014not unlike our current era\u2014and the magazine was notably alive to this. Shawn was wary of modern gadgetry (he would not ride in an elevator without an attendant), but that did not quash his curiosity. There are pieces here on the whizbangery of push-button phones, video-tape, home freezers, the \u201cperceptron simulator,\u201d data processing, and, with real depth, the dawning of the Computer Age.\n  Finally, Shawn had a sharp eye for that essential component of any institution that wishes to develop: new talent with new things to say. The 50s\u00a0saw the rise of one such talent in particular, John Updike, who, for the next\u00a055\u00a0years, was an unfailingly prolific and versatile contributor to  The New Yorker. His fine-grained prose was there from the start, and, with time, his sharp-eyed intelligence alighted on seemingly every surface, subject, and subtext. Updike was, out of the box, an American writer of the first rank. He was profoundly at home at  The New Yorker and, at the same time, able to expand the boundaries of its readers\u2019 tastes. He could seem tweedy and suburban\u2014a modern, golf-playing squire\u2014and yet, as a critic, he introduced to the magazine\u2019s readers an array of modernists and postmodernists, along with writing from countries far beyond the Anglo-American boundaries; as a writer of fiction, he was not a revolutionary, but his short stories make up a vast social, political, and erotic history of postwar America, or at least some precincts of it.\n One of the more persistent myths of the magazine came up in those Ross-era files\u2014the putative tyranny of its stylistic prejudices. Roald Dahl, whose story \u201cTaste\u201d is published here, wrote to one of Ross\u2019s editors that he was in a \u201chowling fury\u201d because of the outrageous and peremptory changes reflected in a set of proofs that had just arrived in the mail. \u201cYou have sprinkled commas about all over the pages as though you were putting raisins in a plum-pudding,\u201d Dahl wrote. \u201cI know what commas I want. I know what phrases I wish to use. It is my story. I wrote it.\u201d And yet, as any reader will see, even in the 50s, before the arrival of experimentalists like Donald Barthelme and Max Frisch, writers in possession of a real voice did not lose it, despite the magazine\u2019s at times persnickety ministrations. Nabokov, Welty, Flanner, Ross, Liebling,\u00a0Mitchell, Capote, Thurber, Updike\u2014they are utterly themselves, their preferences and hesitations as distinct as can be.\n Now we\u2019ve moved downtown to the end of Manhattan island and into the tallest skyscraper in the city. From our floor, there is an astonishing view of the harbor that used to be Joe Mitchell\u2019s beat. At a certain point, certainly by the 50s, Joe told editors and friends that the city was changing\u2014changing so profoundly that he no longer saw it as his own and, gradually, he wrote more about the past, about his interior New York, about the memories that carved through the present like initials gouged in old tabletops. This is often what happens. Young men and women arrive and it is their work to describe the world that is becoming. That\u2019s the way it is now.\n From the book  THE\u00a050S: THE STORY OF A DECADE\u00a0by  The\u00a0New\u00a0Yorker. Copyright \u00a9 2016 by  The\u00a0New Yorker.

"note_en": "Welcome to the Convivial Society , a newsletter about technology and society, broadly speaking. If you find the writing helpful, you can sign up if you haven\u2019t already, share it with others, or subscribe.\n   I\u2019m a Mets fan. Right at this moment, that\u2019s not such a bad thing. Despite having up to 17 players on the injured list earlier this season, they\u2019ve been in first place in their division for nearly two months. Over the past three decades, however, being a Mets fan has meant mostly disappointment and frustration, punctuated by rare moments of joy. Naturally, I\u2019m bequeathing this legacy of emotional turmoil to my daughters.\n But it\u2019s not only the first place standing that makes this a tolerable, even enjoyable baseball season. It is also the once-in-a-lifetime performance that pitcher Jacob deGrom has been putting on. If you attend at all to the world of American sports, you may know that deGrom has been one of the best pitchers in baseball the past few years. He won consecutive Cy Young awards in 2018 and 2019. This season he is having a historically good run. I\u2019ll spare you the statistics. If you peruse the  top search results for \u201cdeGrom\u201d on Twitter, and you\u2019ll get a sampling of his accomplishments thus far.   It\u2019s been a delight to watch him pitch. He combines remarkable physical skill and precision with uncanny mental focus and composure. He gets measurably better in higher pressure situations. On the mound, his lack of emotional expression lends him an almost robotic air. You get the point. The man is good, and his current stretch may very well be the best stretch by any pitcher ever. Oh, and he throws hard. Since the beginning of the pitch tracking era in 2008, deGrom has been the only starting pitcher to average 100 mph on his fastball for an entire game. He\u2019s done it twice this year. He has also set the record for the most 100 mph pitches in a game.\n Perhaps the most striking thing about deGrom\u2019s velocity is that it has improved year after year. In 2016, his average fastball came in at 93.9 mph. In 2020, it was at 98.7. Thus far in 2021, he\u2019s average 99.2 mph. This impressive improvement over time is especially notable given deGrom\u2019s age. He turned 33 on June 19th. So how has he done it? One answer is that he has achieved machine-like efficiency with the mechanics of his delivery.\n Here is a video produced by Tread Athletics, a baseball consulting firm focused on harnessing data to improve pitcher velocity. It\u2019s an analysis of Jacob deGrom\u2019s mechanics over the last few years during which his average velocity increased more than 5 mph.\n  The video presentation is about 50 minutes in length and relies on video archives of deGrom\u2019s pitching career. As the presenter makes clear, they have no special access to deGrom and the analysis is undertaken with a view to gleaning lessons for the firm\u2019s clientele. That said, it offers an interesting glimpse into the world of elite or would-be elite pitchers. Pretty much every aspect of their bodily motion is subject to measurement, analysis, and calibration. Consider, too, especially if you\u2019ve not kept up with baseball analytics, the sheer volume of data available to measure a pitcher\u2019s performance. Take a look, for example, at deGrom\u2019s page at  Baseball Savant or  FanGraphs. Turns out that when you can track and measure every pitch and every swing, you can generate an absurd amount of analytical categories.\n As I thought about deGrom\u2019s mechanical precision, it seemed that baseball analytics offered an interesting vantage point from which to consider the nature of data-driven optimization that now structures so much of contemporary society. For example, the analytics trajectory that emerges circa 2008 with the deployment of increasingly precise and comprehensive data gathering tools also mirrors broader social trends. We can now measure and analyze dimensions of personal and social life that we wouldn\u2019t even have thought to measure a decade or two ago. It was always theoretically possible for us to count our steps, but altogether impractical. Now we can have it done for us passively. Indeed, as most of us know all too well, all manner of information about us and our activities is now gathered passively, stored indefinitely, and put to useful, dubious, and dangerous ends. Aspiring pitchers may now be able to finely calibrate and optimize their bodily motions to increase their velocity, but it is another thing altogether for a corporation to similarly monitor and discipline the bodies of their employees for the sake of more efficient production.\n It will be helpful, I think, for us to consider data-driven optimization in light of what the mid-20th century French polymath Jacques Ellul called  la technique. Some of you will already be familiar with what Ellul meant by the term, but, if you\u2019re encountering it for the first time, a bit of exposition is warranted. It was an expansive concept, which Ellul used to capture what he considered the tyrannical dominance of the drive for efficiency in modern society. Here is a helpful  synopsis from James Fowler:\n Ellul\u2019s issue was not with technological machines but with a society necessarily caught up in efficient methodological techniques. Technology, then, is but an expression and by-product of the underlying reliance on technique, on the proceduralization whereby everything is organized and managed to function most efficiently, and directed toward the most expedient end of the highest productivity. Ellul\u2019s own comprehensive definition is found in the preface of\u00a0 The Technological Society: \u201cTechnique is the totality of methods, rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity.\u201d\n And here\u2019s a bit more from Fowler\u2019s discussion of what technique had become in the 20th century according to Ellul:\n Technique became the defining force, the ultimate value, of a new social order in which efficiency was no longer an option but a necessity imposed on all human activity. Technique became universally totalitarian in modern society as rationalistic proceduralism imposed an artificial value system of measuring and organizing everything quantitatively rather than qualitatively.\n The tendency remains, and, as Ellul predicted, it has only intensified. The power of digital computation\u2014still nascent when Ellul published his best known work,  The Technological Society\u2014radically widened the scope of technique, understood as the drive toward efficiency in all realms of human experience. And, as it turns out, developments in the game of baseball illustrate the more general social patterns pretty well, and they may, in fact, present us with a few insights into  la technique realized in the culture of optimization.\n Baseball, of course, has always been a numbers game, at first characterized by traditional statistics based on analog records. The first box score, for example, is attributed to Henry Chadwick, who came up with it in 1858. The baseball scorebook (belwo) became the standard tool for recording at bats, hits, strikeouts, walks, runs, etc.\n  This simple tool supported the collection of a surprising amount of data. Most of this data told us what had happened in a game, and it required relatively straightforward calculations to yield useful information about player performance. A more sophisticated class of statistics was then made possible by computation. My sense, too, is that there was also a shift in what statistics could tell us about: from what has happened to what will happen, from documentation to prediction.\n Here, for instance, is an interesting  tidbit about Davey Johnson\u2019s career-long fascination with harnessing the power of computation:\n Before Bill James popularized sabermetrics, Davey Johnson used an IBM System/360 at team owner Jerold Hoffberger&#39;s brewery to write a FORTRAN baseball computer simulation while playing for the Baltimore Orioles in the early 1970s. He used his results in an unsuccessful attempt to promote to his manager Earl Weaver the idea that he should bat second in the lineup. He wrote IBM BASIC programs to help him manage the Tidewater Tides, and after becoming manager of the New York Mets in 1984, he arranged for a team employee to write a dBASE II application to compile and store advanced metrics on team statistics.\n Davey Johnson was a pioneer of a data-driven approach to the game enabled by modern computing that was later popularized by Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland A\u2019s in the late 90s and early 2000s. Beane\u2019s success in fielding a winning team on the cheap using advanced metrics was chronicled in Michael Lewis\u2019s  Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game (2003). Beane\u2019s success, of course, meant that other teams would take note and follow suite. What was once a distinctive and idiosyncratic approach to the game became the dominant strategy. The consequences of this homogenizing tendency will be the first thing for us to consider, and, back in 2018, Alan Jacobs  described the consequences in an essay lamenting the flattening of the game that followed the success of the sabermetric revolution.\n Jacobs begins the essay by recalling his fascination with the Baltimore Orioles of the early 70s led by manager Earl Weaver. Interestingly, this was the same team Davey Johnson played for when he was fiddling with FORTRAN simulations. Weaver\u2019s distinctive approach to the game focused on the most efficient way to score runs was soon validated by Bill James\u2019s statistical analysis in the late 70s and Billy Beane\u2019s success with the A\u2019s. But here a paradox emerges: Jacobs argues that \u201cstrangely enough, baseball was better when we knew less about the most effective way to play it.\u201d In Jacobs\u2019s view, when everyone knows the most efficient way to play the game, the game as a whole loses its color and variety.\n  Coaches used to place a lot of emphasis on teaching batters how to hit the ball to the opposite field, at least sometimes. But sabermetrics has shown that batters get more hits, and more extra-base hits, if they pull the ball. In turn, the increased dominance of pull-hitting has led defenses to employ shifts that place fielders in the most likely paths of balls hit by any given batter. And then batters have responded to these shifts by realizing that it doesn\u2019t matter where the fielders are if you hit the ball out of the park. So: more and more batters swinging for the fences, hitting more home runs than ever, and accepting historically high levels of strikeouts as just the inevitable collateral damage.\n And, as Jacobs goes on to emphasize, \u201ccoaches and players understand the percentages better than they ever have in the history of the game, and are acting accordingly. All of these changes I have traced are eminently rational.\u201d\n \u201cSo you can\u2019t blame anyone for the way the game has developed,\u201d Jacobs concludes. \u201cIt has become more rational, with a better command of the laws of probability, and stricter, more rigorous canons of efficiency.\u201d\n It\u2019s worth pausing to consider wherein the purported rationality lies. It is the logic of competition. Within the sporting world, of course, the point is to win, and to do so in a way that can be clearly determined quantitatively. There are no grounds for anyone to ask a manager or a player to pursue a strategy that will diminish their competitive edge. Most of life, however, is not a game with quantifiable outcomes, and probably shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. However, the triumph of technique in Ellul\u2019s sense encourages the competitive mode of experience. Indeed, quantification itself invites it. This dynamic can be put to beneficial use, and, in clearly delineated circumstances, is perfectly appropriate. But applied uncritically and indiscriminately or even nefariously (see e.g. social media metrics) it can introduce destructive tendencies and eclipse qualitative or otherwise unquantifiable values. Generally speaking, quantification and the logic of optimization which it encourages tend to transform our field of experience into  points of aggression, as the sociologist Hartmut Rosa has aptly put it. Data-driven optimization is, in this sense, a way of perceiving the world. And what may matter most about this is not necessarily what it allows us to see, but it keeps us from perceiving: in short, all that cannot be quantified or measured.\n On an earlier occasion, Jacobs\u2019s analysis also recalled a distinction drawn by one philosopher between what is correct and what is true. What is correct may fall short of truth because it is partial or inadequate, and may for that reason be, in fact, misleading. It seemed to me that we might, in similar fashion, draw a distinction between what is right and what is good. It was right for the Baltimore Orioles in the 70s and the A\u2019s in the early 2000\u2019s to optimize their team strategies and tactics as they did. Moreover, it is right (meaning rational and in keeping with the competitive nature of the sport) for all other teams to do so. It is not, however, good for baseball that they do so, or so Jacobs and others who take his view of things would argue.\n But is the game, taken as a whole, really worse off? Anecdotally, I encounter frequent complaints from diverse quarters about the homogenous character of the game. And it\u2019s worth noting that there are also perennial anxieties about the popularity of the game among younger fans unrelated to the fallout of an analytics intensive approach to the game. But there are, I\u2019m sure, many fans who are untroubled by any of this. So, is Jacobs right to say that baseball was better when we knew less about it? And here we are at the crux of the issue from another angle: how is the goodness of the game measured and accounted for? Or, more to the point,  can the goodness of the game be measured? If not, then in what would the goodness of the game consist? And, an equally interesting question, why might we assume or want it to be the case that good can be adequately quantified? My point in raising these questions, of course, is that we should ask them in relation to things other than baseball.\n As it turns out, Jacobs\u2019s analysis in the piece I\u2019ve been referencing reminded me of a paragraph he had  posted on his blog a few years prior from Claude Levi-Strauss\u2019s memoir,  Tristes Tropiques:\n In Martinique, I had visited rustic and neglected rum-distilleries where the equipment and the methods used had not changed since the eighteenth century. In Puerto Rico, on the other hand, in the factories of the company which enjoys a virtual monopoly over the whole of the sugar production, I was faced by a display of white enamel tanks and chromium piping. Yet the various kinds of Martinique rum, as I tasted them in front of ancient wooden vats thickly encrusted with waste matter, were mellow and scented, whereas those of Puerto Rico are coarse and harsh. We may suppose, then, that the subtlety of the Martinique rums is dependent on impurities the continuance of which is encouraged by the archaic method of production. To me, this contrast illustrates the paradox of civilization: its charms are due essentially to the various residues it carries along with it, although this does not absolve us of the obligation to purify the stream. By being doubly in the right, we are admitting our mistake. We are right to be rational and to try to increase our production and so keep manufacturing costs down. But we are also right to cherish those very imperfections we are endeavouring to eliminate. Social life consists in destroying that which gives it its savour.\n It\u2019s not altogether obvious to me that social life must consist in destroying that which gives it its savor. I suppose much depends on what exactly is entailed by \u201cpurifying the stream,\u201d as Levi-Strauss puts it. As Ellul saw it, technique colonized realms of life to which it did not properly belong. The key, then, is to recognize where and when it is appropriate to allow technique (or quantification or optimization) a place and where and when it would be good to circumscribe its scope. In order to do so we must have before us a clear sense of the good we seek. But, as Ellul warned, technique becomes a problem precisely when it becomes and end in itself. This may happen because we ourselves lose sight of the ends we were originally seeking or because the focus on technique itself gradually blinds us to those ends. It would seem that when a framework within which questions of the good can be meaningfully taken up is unavailable, then quantification rushes in to fill the axial vacuum. In his own fine  post on baseball and optimization a couple of years back, Rob Horning cited Melissa Gregg who observed that \u201cpersonal productivity is an epistemology without an ontology, a framework for knowing what to do in the absence of a guiding principle for doing it.\u201d\n So as more and more of our lives become subject to regimes of optimization, we should remember the limits of quantification and strive to see what we cannot measure. And because we may need a little help toward that end, I\u2019ll wrap us up by commending a children\u2019s book to you,  The Little Prince.\n \u201cGood morning,\u201d said the merchant.  This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need for anything to drink.  \u201cWhy are you selling those?\u201d asked the little prince.  \u201cBecause they save a tremendous amount of time,\u201d said the merchant. \u201cComputations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.\u201d\n \u201cAnd what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?\u201d  \u201cAnything you like ...\u201d  \u201cAs for me,\u201d said the little prince to himself, \u201cif I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.\u201d\n You should read the whole thing someday if you\u2019ve never done so.
