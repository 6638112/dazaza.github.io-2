", "note_en": "Twenty miles south of Cairo, on the Nile&#39;s west bank, where riverfed crop fields give way to desert, the ancient site of Saqqara is marked by crumbling pyramids that emerge from the sand like dragon&#39;s teeth. Most striking is the famous Step Pyramid, built in the 27th century B.C. by Djoser, the Old Kingdom pharaoh who launched the tradition of constructing pyramids as monumental royal tombs. More than a dozen other pyramids are scattered along the five-mile strip of land, which is also dotted with the remains of temples, tombs and walkways that, together, span the entire history of ancient Egypt. But beneath the ground is far more\u2014a vast and extraordinary netherworld of treasures.\n        One scorching day last fall, Mohammad Youssef, an archaeologist, clung to a rope inside a shaft that had been closed for more than 2,000 years. At the bottom, he shined his flashlight through a gap in the limestone wall and was greeted by a god\u2019s gleaming eyes: a small, painted statue of the composite funerary deity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris, with a golden face and plumed crown. It was Youssef\u2019s first glimpse of a large chamber that was guarded by a heap of figurines, carved wooden chests and piles of blackened linen. Inside, Youssef and his colleagues found signs that the people buried here had wealth and privilege: gilded masks, a finely carved falcon and a painted scarab beetle rolling the sun across the sky. Yet this was no luxurious family tomb, as might have been expected. Instead, the archaeologists were astonished to discover dozens of expensive coffins jammed together, piled to the ceiling as if in a warehouse. Beautifully painted, human-shaped boxes were stacked roughly on top of heavy limestone sarcophagi. Gilded coffins were packed into niches around the walls. The floor itself was covered in rags and bones.\n  This eerie chamber is one of several \u201cmegatombs,\u201d as the archaeologists describe them, discovered last year at Saqqara, the sprawling necropolis that once served the nearby Egyptian capital of Memphis. The excavators overseen by Youssef uncovered hundreds of coffins, mummies and grave goods, including carved statues and mummified cats, packed into several shafts, all untouched since antiquity. The trove includes many individual works of art, from the gilded portrait mask of a sixth- or seventh-century B.C. noblewoman to a bronze figure of the god Nefertem inlaid with precious gems. The scale of discoveries\u2014captured in the  Smithsonian Channel documentary series  \u201cTomb Hunters,\u201d an advance copy of which was made available to me\u2014has excited archaeologists. They say it opens a window into a period late in ancient Egyptian history when Saqqara was at the center of a national revival in pharaonic culture and attracted visitors from across the known world. The site is full of contradictions, entwining past and future, spirituality and economics. It was a hive of ritual and magic that arguably couldn\u2019t seem more distant from our modern world. Yet it nurtured ideas so powerful they still shape our lives today.\n    Travelers visiting Egypt have long marveled at the vestiges of the pharaohs\u2019 lost world\u2014the great pyramids, ancient temples and mysterious writings carved into stone. But Egyptology, the formal study of ancient Egyptian civilization, didn\u2019t begin in earnest until Napoleon Bonaparte invaded at the turn of the 19th century and French scholars collected detailed records of ancient sites and scoured the country for antiquities. When Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion deciphered hieroglyphs, in the 1820s, the history of one of humanity\u2019s great civilizations could finally be read, and European scholars and enthusiasts flocked to see not only the pyramids at Giza but also the colossal Ramses II statues carved into the cliffs at Abu Simbel and the royal tombs in Luxor\u2019s Valley of the Kings.\n    Apart from its eroding pyramids, Saqqara was known, by contrast, for its subterranean caverns, which locals raided for mummies to use as fertilizer and tourists ransacked for souvenirs. Looters carted off not only mummified people but also mummified animals\u2014hawks, ibises, baboons. Saqqara didn\u2019t attract much archaeological attention until the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, who became the first director of Egypt\u2019s Antiquities Service, visited in 1850. He declared the site \u201ca spectacle of utter devastation,\u201d with yawning pits and dismantled brick walls where the sand was mixed with mummy wrappings and bones. But he also noticed the half-buried statue of a sphinx, and probing further he found a sphinx-lined avenue leading to a temple called the Serapeum. Beneath the temple were tunnels that held the coffins of Apis bulls, worshiped as incarnations of Ptah and Osiris.\n  Since then, excavations have revealed a history of burials and cult ceremonies spanning more than 3,000 years, from Egypt\u2019s earliest pharaohs to its dying breaths in the Roman era. Yet Saqqara has remained overshadowed by the glamour of Luxor to the south, where in the second millennium B.C. pharaohs covered the walls of their tombs with depictions of the afterlife, and the Great Pyramids just miles to the north.\n    It certainly took a while for Mostafa Waziri, the archaeologist directing the latest project, to be converted to Saqqara\u2019s charms. He spent most of his career excavating in Luxor, but in 2017 he was appointed director of  Egypt\u2019s Supreme Council of Antiquities (making him, among other things, a successor to Mariette). The new job entailed a move to Cairo. Continuing to dig in southern Egypt was therefore no longer practical, he says, but on his doorstep was another great opportunity: \u201cI realized it was less than one hour from my office to Saqqara!\u201d\n  Working with an Egyptian team, including Youssef, the site director, Waziri chose to excavate near a mysterious temple called the Bubasteion, dedicated to the cat goddess Bastet, that had been cut into limestone cliffs near the site\u2019s eastern boundary around 600 B.C. A group of French archaeologists had worked nearby for decades, where they found, among other discoveries, the 14th-century B.C. tomb of King Tutankhamen\u2019s wet nurse, Maia. But Waziri targeted an area that the French team had used to pile the debris from their excavations, calculating that whatever lay beneath it had remained untouched.\n    His approach paid off. In December 2018, Waziri announced the discovery of a 4,400-year-old tomb, intact and ornately carved, that belonged to a high-ranking priest named Wahtye. The next season yielded intriguing caches of animal mummies\u2014not just cats but a cobra, a lion cub, a mongoose and even a scarab beetle. Then, in September 2020, the team unearthed a vertical shaft dug 30 feet down into the bedrock, the first of the \u201cmegatombs.\u201d In separate niches at the bottom were two giant coffins, and when the archaeologists cleared the surrounding debris they found dozens more. \u201cI had to call the [antiquities] minister,\u201d says Waziri. \u201cHe asked me, \u2018How many?\u2019\u201d Eighteen months later, Waziri is still counting.\n    In a simple conservation lab set up at the site, Youssef and his colleagues admired the first coffin to be removed from the shaft. Sealed with black resin, it was roughly human-shaped but huge and squat\u2014more than 7.5 feet long and 3 feet wide\u2014with a wide, impassive face. Removing the intricately carved wooden lid revealed a glint of gold: A second coffin was nested inside, complete with gilded mask. Beautifully preserved, it showed the face of a woman with large, kohl-lined eyes. The rest of the inner coffin was intricately painted in blue, green and red, and included flower and leaf motifs and a depiction of the sky goddess, Nut, with outstretched wings. Most exciting, though, were the hieroglyphs, because they provided valuable information about the occupant: not just spells to aid her journey to the afterlife but details of her family, as well as her name: Ta-Gemi-En-Aset.\n    These details and the distinctive style of the coffin indicate that she lived during the sixth or seventh century B.C., at the start of Egypt\u2019s Late Period, when a pharaoh named Psamtik I reunified the country after a period of instability and foreign invasions. Egypt was strong and prosperous once again, a global power alongside Babylon and Persia. Psamtik also revived the powerful city of Memphis, then home to around two million people, and nearby Saqqara to hold its dead. According to Campbell Price, curator of Egypt and Sudan at the Manchester Museum in England, the name Ta-Gemi-En-Aset means \u201cshe who was found by Isis.\u201d The coffin inscriptions describe her mother as a singer, and include a symbol representing a sistrum, a musical rattle used in temples. Price suggests that Ta-Gemi may have belonged to the cult of Isis, and perhaps played a role in rituals and festivals in a nearby temple devoted to the goddess.\n  The second coffin retrieved from the shaft was similar to Ta-Gemi\u2019s, and it also contained an inner coffin with a gilded mask. This time, the portrait mask showed a bearded man named Psamtik (probably in honor of one of several pharaohs of this period who shared the name). At first, the team wondered whether Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were related. The hieroglyphs revealed that their fathers had the same name: Horus. But their mothers\u2019 names were different, and further discoveries revealed a different picture.\n    The team dug deeper, a painfully slow process that involved the help of local laborers, who scooped out the sand by hand and hauled basketsful of debris to the surface using a traditional wooden winch called a  tambora, the design of which hasn\u2019t changed in centuries. Below Psamtik\u2019s burial niche was a room filled with many additional coffins, covered in rubble and damaged by ancient rockfalls. The bottom of the shaft led to a second, even bigger cavern, inside of which were jammed more than a hundred coffins of different styles and sizes. There were also loose grave goods, including  ushabtis, miniature figures intended as servants in the afterlife, and hundreds of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statuettes. There were even coffins buried in the base of the shaft itself, as if whoever put them there was running out of space. The result was a megatomb described by the research team as the largest concentration of coffins ever unearthed in Egypt.\n              Great collections of mummies and coffins have been found before, but never grouped so densely together. This was mass burial on an astonishing scale, and it shines a light on Egyptian culture at a moment of transition. In the Old Kingdom, in the third millennium B.C.\u2014Djoser\u2019s time\u2014the elites appear to have favored private family spaces such as the priest Wahtye\u2019s rock-cut tomb, which included an ornate, above-ground chapel for visitors lined with painted reliefs, inscriptions and statues of Wahtye himself. Burial shafts dug into the floor of such tombs were dedicated to particular family members. By the Late Period, some 2,000 years later, well-to-do Egyptians such as Ta-Gemi and Psamtik were packed into tight, shared spaces like cheap crates. Why did people who could clearly afford expensive coffins settle for such a crowded resting place?\n  According to Aidan Dodson, an Egyptologist at the University of Bristol, in England, they did so in part because by then the practice was simply routine. Shared tombs became popular across Egypt around 1000 B.C., driven by economic necessity as the kingdom faced a period of instability and collapse. When Psamtik I restored order in the seventh century B.C., the practice stuck. \u201cWe know that from the Late Period, that\u2019s how burials are done,\u201d Dodson says.\n    Campbell Price, of the  Manchester Museum, adds that the answer also has to do with Saqqara\u2019s pyramids. The necropolis had always been a center for religious cults, from the time high-ranking Egyptians were first buried there, often in low, flat-roofed tombs called  mastabas, and probably long before. To help bring the country together after turbulent times, Psamtik encouraged a revival of traditional rituals and belief; after a long period as a backwater, Saqqara exploded again in popularity. Far more than a local cemetery, says Price, it became a pilgrimage site, \u201clike an ancient Mecca or Lourdes,\u201d attracting visitors not just from Egypt but from all over the eastern Mediterranean. Buildings such as the Step Pyramid were already thousands of years old at this time, and people believed their creators, such as Djoser and his architect Imhotep, were gods themselves. Cults and temples sprang up. Pilgrims would bring offerings, and they vied for burial spaces for themselves and their families near the ancient, sacred tombs. \u201cSaqqara would have been the place to be seen dead in,\u201d says Price. \u201cIt had this numinous, divine energy that would help you get into the afterlife.\u201d\n    That created conditions for a thriving commercial operation entwined with the spiritual one, resulting in a kind of real estate market for the dead. \u201cIt\u2019s a business,\u201d says Dodson. There was probably a sliding scale of options available. Senior officials and military officers were interred in large tombs near the Old Kingdom pyramids of Unas and Userkaf, for example, while the poorest in society were probably buried \u201cin the desert in a sheet.\u201d But the wealthy middle classes appear to have opted for a shared shaft, perhaps with a private niche if they could afford it, or were simply piled with others on the floor. If you wanted to be close to the magical energy of Saqqara\u2019s gods and festivals, Dodson says, \u201cyou bought yourself a space in a shaft.\u201d\n    The supersized burials unearthed by Waziri\u2019s archaeology team reveal how intense the desire for particular locations became\u2014and how profitable they were. Instead of digging new tombs, the priests in charge of burials reused older shafts, expanding them and, Price and Dodson suggest, cramming in as many coffins as they could. The cliffs of the Bubasteion, overlooking the landscape and close to the main processional route, may have been one of the most sought-after spots of all.\n    Last October, the archaeologists found a new shaft beneath the ruins of the Bubasteion\u2014the chaotic, painted chamber illuminated by Youssef\u2019s flashlight. It was another megatomb, bursting with some of the finest coffins and mummies yet discovered, as well as grave goods including a falcon-topped wooden box (possibly a canopic chest, used to store internal organs removed during mummification) and numerous painted Ptah-Sokar-Osiris statues, one of which contained seeds of corn, a symbol of rebirth.\n    Many of the burials date later than the other finds at Saqqara, to the era of Greek rule in Egypt following the Late Period, after Ptolemy, one of Alexander the Great\u2019s top generals, founded a new dynasty of pharaohs in 305 B.C. With the Ptolemaic pharaohs came strong Greek cultural influences, particularly at the Mediterranean capital of Alexandria, home to some of the finest scholars of the Hellenistic world, such as the mathematician Euclid and the physician-anatomist Herophilus. Hundreds of thousands of migrants from across the Greek world settled elsewhere in Egypt, and many were awarded plots of land. Public life was Greek-run, but in private life, including religious worship, there was considerable freedom, and many of the new arrivals appear to have adopted Egyptian beliefs and customs, including mummification. As time went on, says Dodson, \u201cmore people who self-identified as Greeks were being buried according to Egyptian customs.\u201d Saqqara was as busy as ever, and the new discoveries suggest the priests were still squeezing as many bodies as possible into the shafts.\n        In a nearby shaft, the team unearthed cat mummies along with human remains. Previous excavations had discovered a huge cat necropolis at the Bubasteion, where the animals, sacred to the feline goddess Bastet, were embalmed and left as offerings. It was one of many local animal cults. Just north of the Bubasteion is the Anubieion, a temple complex dedicated to the jackal-headed god of death, Anubis, where mazelike tunnels are estimated to have held millions of mummified dogs. Beyond that are catacombs once filled with mummified ibises, hawks and baboons. To the west is the Serapeum, where Apis bulls were laid to rest.\n      These cults always existed at Saqqara. Their roots stretch back to predynastic times, and they thrived especially in the Late Period, during the renaissance inaugurated by Psamtik, perhaps because they were seen as archetypally Egyptian, says Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist based at the  American University in Cairo\u2014a symbol of national identity when foreign influence was an ever-present threat. But they became even more popular under the Greeks, with millions of animals bred to order, presumably on nearby farms, and often sacrificed shortly after birth. Waziri and his colleagues found animal mummies of varying qualities, which were probably priced accordingly. X-rays reveal that some \u201cmummies\u201d have no cat remains inside at all. And the mix with human bones suggests that if priests ran out of space in the dedicated animal catacombs, they simply commandeered older human tombs. The animal cults, in other words, became an ever more significant economic and spiritual force, helping to drive Saqqara\u2019s final flourish. Or as Price puts it: \u201cSaqqara was like an enormous, divine magnet or battery, powered by all these animal mummies.\u201d\n  To the Greeks, part of the appeal of such Egyptian customs may have been the ease of making a personal plea to the gods, by visiting a stall selling mummified animals and choosing from a range of prepared products on offer. And the reward would likewise have been appealing: the promise, unique to Egyptian theology at that time, of an eternal afterlife of splendor. By contrast, \u201cGreek ideas for the afterlife were pretty dull,\u201d says Price. In classic Greek literature, for example, the dead were mere shadows inhabiting a dark underworld. The Babylonian and Jewish traditions had very exclusive notions of heaven; eternal life was reserved for the gods. But Egyptian texts covering the walls inside the Saqqara pyramids describe the king\u2019s soul rising up after death to join the sun in the sky. By around 2000 B.C., resurrection spells were written onto coffins directly, enabling even ordinary citizens such as Ta-Gemi to make the journey to idyllic, golden fields. Although the details of the afterlife changed over time, the most desirable postmortem destination during the Ptolemaic period was the \u201cField of Reeds,\u201d an agricultural paradise with unfailing harvests and eternal spring.\n      After Cleopatra ended her life in 30 B.C., bringing the Ptolemaic era to an end, Rome ruled Egypt. Whereas the Greeks had integrated into Egyptian culture, the Romans remade it, imposing their laws and administrative systems and, in time, their newly adopted Christian faith. At Saqqara, the last Egyptian mummies date to the third century A.D. Despite the cultural triumph of Rome, however, some Egyptian iconography lives on in Christian narratives. Many scholars have noted similarities between Egyptian and Christian religious symbolism, for example in stories of the goddess Isis and her son Horus and the Virgin Mary and her son Jesus. \u201cA lot of the iconography in Christianity is derived from ancient Egypt,\u201d says Ikram, of the American University in Cairo.\n    Which is not to say that these images were necessarily appropriated directly; rather, in antiquity these influences ran in many directions. The historian Diarmaid MacCulloch, of Oxford, notes that Christian ideas of the afterlife in particular drew heavily on Greek belief, which by then had developed a \u201cvocabulary\u201d for concepts such as Plato\u2019s notion that the human soul \u201cmight reflect a divine force beyond itself.\u201d Plato, for his part, was influenced by Pythagoras, who is thought to have studied in Egypt in the sixth century B.C. \u201cBy the time Chris\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:47:39", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "saqqara,tombs,\u57c3\u53ca", "title": "\u5728Saqqara\u7684\u575f\u5893\u91cc\u9762 ", "title_en": "Inside The Tombs of Saqqara", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/inside-tombs-saqqara-180977932/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["saqqara", "tombs", "\u57c3\u53ca"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066924, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u7ec8\u6b62\u7ec8\u6b62\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u5bf9\u4e8eC\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7410\u788e\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u5b83\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u867d\u7136C\u578b\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u5171\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u662f\u5c06\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u590d\u5236\u5230\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u5404\u79cd\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u51fd\u6570\u58f0\u79f0\u5728C.\u8f76\u4e8b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u505a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u6709\u5f88\u5927\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u6e34\u671b\u5177\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u590d\u5236\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\n \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u548c\u8868\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6574\u6570\u3002\n  \u8fd4\u56de\u540e\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u65f6\uff08\u5177\u4f53\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u76ee\u7684\u5730\u7f13\u51b2\u5668\u5177\u6709\u975e\u96f6\u5927\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u672a\u7ecf\u672a\u52ff\u7ed2\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u6307\u5411\u5305\u542b\u6e90\u6781\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u3002 \uff08\u867d\u7136\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u622a\u65ad\u6709\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f8\u5f53\u5408\u7406\u7684\u56de\u529b\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u6307\u793a\u5b83\u4ece\u6e90\u590d\u5236\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u793a\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002 \uff08\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u5141\u8bb8\u5904\u7406\u6ea2\u51fa\u3002\uff09\n  \u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u5e94\u8be5\u8bfb\u53d6\u6216\u5199\u5165\u5b83\u4e0d\u5fc5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90e8\u5206\u643a\u624b\u5408\u4f5c\uff1a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u901a\u884c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u5199\u5165NUL\u5b57\u8282IT\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4ece\u6e90\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u4e2d\u8bfb\u53d6\u5b57\u7b26\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u786e\u5b9a\u5b83\u5df2\u586b\u5145\u76ee\u6807\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u662f\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\uff08\u653e\u5bbd\u4e00\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff09\u3002\n  \u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u7b26\u5408ISO C\u6216POSIX.1\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u6700\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u3002\n \u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8c03\u7528strxcpy\uff1a \nchar * strxcpy\uff08char *\u9650\u5236dst\uff0cconst char *\u9650\u5236src\uff0csize_t len\uff09{if\uff08\uff01len\uff09{return null; } whiled\uff08 -

While C-style strings are a fundamental part of using the language, manipulating them is a common source of security bugs and lost performance. One of the most common operations is copying a string from one buffer to another, and there are a variety of string functions that claim to do this in C. Anecdotally, however, there is much confusion about what they actually do, and many people desire a string copying function with the following properties:\n The function should accept a null-terminated source string, a destination buffer, and an integer representing the size of the destination buffer.\n  Upon return the function should ensure that the destination buffer points to a null-terminated string containing a prefix of the source string when possible (specifically, when the destination buffer has a non-zero size) to avoid issues in the future with unterminated strings. (While string truncation has its own issues, it is often a fairly reasonable fallback.)\n  The function should indicate how many characters it copied from the source, as well as indicate if an overflow occurred. (This allows for dealing with the overflow, if desired.)\n  The function should be efficient, and it should not read or write memory that it does not have to. These go partially hand-in-hand: the function should run in a single pass, not write to the destination buffer past the NUL byte it places, or read characters from the source string once it\u2019s determined that it has filled the destination buffer. Ideally, the implementation would be vectorizable (relaxing some of the previous constraints slightly to within platform alignment guarantees).\n  The function should be standardized, so that it may be used portably across systems. Conformance to  ISO C or  POSIX.1 are generally the most desirable.\n That is, what is often necessary is the function below, which we\u2019ll call  strxcpy:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t return  NULL ;\t }\t while  ( -- len  &amp;&amp;  ( * dst ++  =  * src ++ ))\t\t ;\t if  ( ! len )  {\t\t * dst ++  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t\t return  * src  ?  NULL  :  dst ;\t }  else  {\t\t return  dst ;\t } }\n Other than standardization, this function will copy the smaller of  strlen(src) or  len - 1 bytes from  src to  dst and cap the copy with a NUL character. In the case where  src fits in  dst, it will return a pointer past the NUL byte it placed; otherwise it returns  NULL to indicate a truncation. While  current  compilers seem to have trouble with its control flow, it should also be fairly straightforwards to vectorize, as the core loop is somewhat similar to a combination of  strncpy and  strlen.\n With guidance to look back to, let\u2019s take a look at a variety of copying routines and see if they can help us.\n To head off the usual concerns, we\u2019ll assume that we must use C, and that we will be eschewing the various length-prefixed or aggregate string constructions available as third-party libraries. While using a different language can solve many of the issues in C besides the one mentioned here; it\u2019s not always desirable or even possible to utilize them. In addition to the usual drawbacks to using third-party libraries, replacing null-terminated strings often causes added syntactical overhead and incompatibilities with other code that has been designed to work with them.\n   The standard  strcpy function, which copies characters from  src to  dst, up to and including the first NUL byte encountered. If  dst is smaller than or aliases  src, then the behavior of the program is undefined.  dst is returned.\n strcpy certainly fulfills requirement 2 and parts of 4: it will always write out a null-terminated string and it\u2019ll do so quickly. However, it cannot perform bounds checks at all, so we can only use it if we know our destination buffer is smaller than our source buffer\u2013it fails requirement 1. Plus it doesn\u2019t tell us how many characters it wrote, either\u2013that\u2019s requirement 3. It\u2019s been part of C forever, so it does meet requirement 5.\n  strncpy copies up to  len characters from  src to  dst. If  src is shorter than  len, then  dst is NUL-padded to  len characters.  dst is returned.\n strncpy takes the parameters we want, so it satisfies requirement 1; even in the face of an arbitrary source string it won\u2019t exhibit undefined behavior, provided that we supply it with the correct destination buffer length. However, if the source is longer that the destination, the buffer will not be null-terminated, and if it is shorter  strncpy will continue writing NUL bytes to the destination up to its size. In addition, it doesn\u2019t indicate how many characters from the source were written, though it is possible to detect overflow by writing a NUL byte to the last character of the destination buffer and checking it after the call. That means it fails requirements 2, 3, and 4, but as it\u2019s been around in C for as long as  strcpy it does meet requirement 5.\n   memcpy doesn\u2019t care about NUL characters at all; it doesn\u2019t even require the source to be a null-terminated string. It fails the first three requirements right off the bat, but it\u2019s part of C and it sure is fast so it meets requirements 4 and 5.\n  strcpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strcpy that performs the same operation and returns zero except it can write unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, and if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, it will write a NUL byte to  *dst if possible, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function.\n On the surface, this function  seems useful\u2013but a closer look shows that it has a number of unfortunate issues. The largest is that any truncation will call a constraint handler function which can do many things,  like abort the program. In addition, it doesn\u2019t tell us how much it wrote, can scribble over the destination, and is standardized but only available as an optional extension to C11. Overall, it only satisfies requirement 1.\n  strncpy_s conforms to  ISO C11, and is available if  __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ is defined prior to including string.h and  __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined.\n    A bounds-checked version of  strncpy, that returns a non-zero value if  src == NULL,  dst == NULL, if truncation would occur,  len is zero or greater than  RSIZE_MAX, or  src and  dst overlap, in which case it will write the NUL byte to  *dst if possible, unspecified values to the remainder of  dst, return a nonzero value, and call a constraint handler function. Otherwise is will copy  len bytes from  src to  dst and then add a NUL terminating byte at  dst[len - 1], returning zero.\n This function has the same constraint handler issue as  strcpy_s, and is also standardized but often not available. While it will null-terminate when the string fits and only clobber the destination on an error, it still only satisfies the first requirement.\n  Identical to  strncpy, except that a pointer to the written NUL byte is returned, if any; otherwise  dst + len is returned.\n stpncpy is an improvement on  strncpy, but it only fixes the issue of detecting termination or overflow, which is requirement 3. It still fails requirement 2 because it doesn\u2019t necessarily null-terminate and it fails requirement 4 because it writes NULs to the end of the destination buffer. Unlike  strncpy it\u2019s part of POSIX, but it still meets requirement 5 in addition to requirement 1.\n  When used with  %s as  fmt, copies the first variadic parameter (a string) to  dst, or the first  len - 1 bytes followed by the NUL byte. Returns the length of the first variadic parameter.\n snprintf is a somewhat strange inclusion, but it\u2019s a standard function that can help us if we use \u201c%s\u201d as the format string, taking a size and null-terminating its destination. It fulfills requirements 1, 2, and 5, but falls short on 3 and 4: its return value is essentially \u201cwhat  sprintf would have returned\u201d, which means it must perform an equivalent of a  strlen at the very least. This is slow, not what we want, and an  int (not a  size_t).\n  Semantically equivalent to  sprintf(dst, len, &#34;%s&#34;, src) save for the return value, which is a  size_t.\n strlcpy is identical to the  sprintf invocation from before, except it uses the correct  size_t return type. This still means it fails to satisfy the performance requirements of 3 and 4, and it\u2019s not standard so it doesn\u2019t satisfy 5 either. Since it does the copy and leaves you with a null-terminated string it fills the first two requirements.\n  strscpy copies  src to  dst if it fits in the buffer and return the number of characters copied excluding the trailing NUL byte; otherwise it will copy the first  len - 1 characters and set  dst[len - 1] to a NUL byte, returning  -E2BIG.\n strscpy is the first function we\u2019ve seen that satisfies the four functional requirements: it copies the as much of the source string as possible, null terminates the destination buffer, returns the number of characters copied, and does not perform excessive reads or writes. In fact, we can implement our  strxcpy function using it:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t ssize_t  copied  =  strscpy ( dst ,  src ,  len );\t return  copied  !=  - E2BIG  :  src  +  copied  +  1  :  NULL ; }\n It has two issues: the first, is that it returns an  ssize_t rather than a  size_t, but in practice this isn\u2019t really a problem. The second is that it\u2019s unfortunately non-standard\u2013it\u2019s something the Linux kernel wrote for itself\u2013which means it violates requirement 5.\n  memccpy is identical to  memcpy, but may stop prematurely if  src contains  chr, copying  chr and returning pointer after its location in  dst. If  len characters are copied without encountering  chr, then  NULL is returned.\n memccpy, when used with the NUL character, satisfies all the requirements except for the second one, but this is trivial to fix:\n char  * strxcpy ( char  * restrict  dst ,  const  char  * restrict  src ,  size_t  len )  {\t char  * end  =  memccpy ( dst ,  src ,  &#39;\\0&#39; ,  len );\t if  ( ! end )  {\t\t dst [ len  -  1 ]  =  &#39;\\0&#39; ;\t }\t return  end ; }\n While it\u2019ll ship in an upcoming C standard, it\u2019s already widely available as a popular, optional POSIX extension.\n  There\u2019s a couple of other functions\u2013 stpcpy,  mempcpy,  sprintf,  sprintf_s, and  snprintf_s\u2013that have been omitted for brevity, as their behavior (and issues) are fairly self-explanatory based on the other functions. ( mempcpy is a GNU extension.)\n  Copying strings in C is an extremely common operation, but doing so safely and efficiently is non-trivial. Almost all currently available string routines, standardized or not, have subtle quirks that often prevent them from matching the expectations of the programmer who reaches for them. This issue is compounded by the fact that many style guides or linters will recommend the use of one (or sometimes more than one!) of these functions to replace  strcpy without discussing their limitations. Finally, as we saw above the functions compose quite poorly: our  strxcpy, an academic but not improbable scenario, could not use any of them in its implementation; one can only imagine that those writing an ad-hoc replacement for it may make both errors in doing so.\n In contrast, the standardization of  memccpy is a very welcome improvement, as it facilitates the construction of safer and more efficient string algorithms\u2013in addition to  strxcpy, a number of the functions discussed are  also easy to construct with it. As it becomes more widespread, most code that relies on some of the semantics of  strxcpy but uses one of the other functions to achieve it should probably migrate to  memccpy, and ideally the push to phase out the use of them will drive the standardization and adoption of many more widely applicable string functions.\n Questions?

The antiparasitic ivermectin, with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties, has now been tested in numerous clinical trials.\n    We assessed the efficacy of ivermectin treatment in reducing mortality, in secondary outcomes, and in chemoprophylaxis, among people with, or at high risk of, COVID-19 infection.\n    We searched bibliographic databases up to April 25, 2021. Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion.\n    Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19\u20130.73; n = 2438; I 2 = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian\u2013Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff\u2013Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%\u201391%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for \u201cneed for mechanical ventilation,\u201d whereas effect estimates for \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201cdeterioration\u201d clearly favored ivermectin use. Severe adverse events were rare among treatment trials and evidence of no difference was assessed as low certainty.

Although originally intended as a promotional tool to explain  free and open source software, the drink took on a life of its own and 150,000 cans were sold.  [2] The Toronto-based company Opencola became better known for the drink than the software it was supposed to promote. Laird Brown, the company&#39;s senior strategist, attributes its success to a widespread mistrust of big corporations and the &#34;proprietary nature of almost everything&#34;.  [3]\n        After mixing up the concentrate to the prescribed recipe (including all recommended safety precautions), the syrup is diluted 5:1 with (&#34;preferably  sodium-free&#34;)  soda water to make the finished drink; at this dilution, the above combination of ingredients will yield approximately 24 litres of OpenCola.\n The full recipe also includes instructions for home-made soda water produced from basic ingredients such as  yeast and  sugar in order to make the entire process open source; otherwise there would be a need to use commercially produced bottled or canned soda, or consumer  carbonation machines with commercially manufactured  carbon dioxide canisters.

It\u2019s easy to install, feels just like the real S3, and doesn\u2019t require any code changes.\n   Below is a pytest fixture that creates an S3 stub. Since other S3 clients won\u2019t use this stub, we also need to patch  get_s3 and replace its return value with the stub - thereby forcing all S3 clients in the Recipe class to use our stub.\n import  datetime import  json from  dateutil.tz  import  tzutc from  io  import  BytesIO from  unittest.mock  import  patch import  boto3 from  botocore.stub  import  Stubber ,  ANY from  botocore.response  import  StreamingBody import  pytest from  recipe  import  Recipe ,  S3_BUCKET @ pytest . fixture def  s3_stub ():  &#34;&#34;&#34;Pytest fixture that mocks the get_s3 function with a S3 client stub Yields a Stubber for the S3 client &#34;&#34;&#34;  s3  =  boto3 . client ( &#34;s3&#34; )  stubber  =  Stubber ( s3 )  with  patch ( &#34;recipe.get_s3&#34; ,  return_value = s3 ):  yield  stubber\n Then, we can stub out responses for the  put_object and  get_object S3 APIs. With those stubs in place, we can run the test that creates and subsequently fetches a Recipe.\n def  test_create_and_get ( s3_stub ):  # Stub out the put_object response  # Note: These stubs are incomplete - I omitted things such as  # HTTP headers for brevity  put_object_response  =  {  &#34;ResponseMetadata&#34; :  {  &#34;RequestId&#34; :  &#34;5994D680BF127CE3&#34; ,  &#34;HTTPStatusCode&#34; :  200 ,  &#34;RetryAttempts&#34; :  1 ,  },  &#34;ETag&#34; :  &#39;&#34;6299528715bad0e3510d1e4c4952ee7e&#34;&#39; ,  }  put_object_expected_params  =  { &#34;Bucket&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Key&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Body&#34; :  ANY }  s3_stub . add_response ( &#34;put_object&#34; ,  put_object_response ,  put_object_expected_params )  # Create the StreamingBody that will be returned by get_object  encoded_message  =  json . dumps (  { &#34;name&#34; :  &#34;nachos&#34; ,  &#34;instructions&#34; :  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; }  ). encode ( &#34;utf-8&#34; )  raw_stream  =  StreamingBody ( BytesIO ( encoded_message ),  len ( encoded_message ))  # Stub out the get_object response  get_object_response  =  {  &#34;ResponseMetadata&#34; :  {  &#34;RequestId&#34; :  &#34;6BFC00970E62BC8F&#34; ,  &#34;HTTPStatusCode&#34; :  200 ,  &#34;RetryAttempts&#34; :  1 ,  },  &#34;LastModified&#34; :  datetime . datetime ( 2020 ,  4 ,  6 ,  5 ,  39 ,  29 ,  tzinfo = tzutc ()),  &#34;ContentLength&#34; :  58 ,  &#34;ETag&#34; :  &#39;&#34;6299528715bad0e3510d1e4c4952ee7e&#34;&#39; ,  &#34;ContentType&#34; :  &#34;binary/octet-stream&#34; ,  &#34;Metadata&#34; :  {},  &#34;Body&#34; :  raw_stream ,  }  get_object_expected_params  =  { &#34;Bucket&#34; :  ANY ,  &#34;Key&#34; :  ANY }  s3_stub . add_response ( &#34;get_object&#34; ,  get_object_response ,  get_object_expected_params )  # Activate the stubber  with  s3_stub :  recipe  =  Recipe ( name = &#34;nachos&#34; ,  instructions = &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; )  recipe . save ()  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;nachos&#34; )  assert  recipe . name  ==  &#34;nachos&#34;  assert  recipe . instructions  ==  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34;\n While botocore stubs are functional, I don\u2019t like working with them for several reasons:\n They require a lot more prep. Creating stubs is time-consuming. Even if you run the real code interactively and copy the response, some things need to be replaced - such as the StreamingBody above.\n  They\u2019re fragile and fake. Responses are returned first in, first out - so if you call the S3 APIs in a different order than you added the responses, it will throw an error. If you have a bug in how you call the API, it might not be caught.\n  To make the stubs look somewhat realistic, you have to mock many fields that your code doesn\u2019t care about and bloat your tests with fake responses.\n  They leak implementation details from the module being tested. For example, if a module switched from using  s3.list_objects to  s3.list_objects_v2, the test would fail because it depends on a specific API being called. This creates an unnecessary dependency on the private API of the module, instead of testing the public API.\n  A third option is  localstack, which allows you to bring up an entire AWS cloud stack locally.\n  version :  &#34; 3.7&#34; services :  tests :  image :  s3_testing:latest  networks :  -  app  entrypoint :  -  /app/wait-for-it.sh  -  -t  -  &#34; 30&#34;  -  localstack:4572  -  --  -  pytest  -  test/  environment :  -  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=fake  -  AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=fake  -  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=fake  localstack :  image :  localstack/localstack  ports :  -  &#34; 4566-4599:4566-4599&#34;  networks :  -  app  environment :  -  SERVICES=s3 networks :  app :  driver :  bridge\n Next, we mock  get_s3 again and this time replace it with an S3 client that is connected to localstack.\n from  unittest.mock  import  patch import  boto3 import  pytest from  recipe  import  Recipe ,  S3_BUCKET @ pytest . fixture def  s3_localstack ():  s3  =  boto3 . client ( &#34;s3&#34; ,  endpoint_url = &#34;http://localstack:4572&#34; )  s3 . create_bucket ( Bucket = S3_BUCKET )  with  patch ( &#34;recipe.get_s3&#34; ,  return_value = s3 ):  yield  s3\n With this mock in place, we can run the same tests that we ran with moto.\n def  test_create_and_get ( s3_localstack ):  Recipe ( name = &#34;nachos&#34; ,  instructions = &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; ). save ()  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;nachos&#34; )  assert  recipe . name  ==  &#34;nachos&#34;  assert  recipe . instructions  ==  &#34;Melt cheese on chips&#34; def  test_get_does_not_exist ( s3_localstack ):  with  pytest . raises ( s3_localstack . exceptions . NoSuchKey ):  recipe  =  Recipe . get_by_name ( &#34;sandwich&#34; )\n Localstack is extremely easy to use, but it takes almost 30 seconds to spin up on my machine.\n  Both moto and localstack are very powerful and easy to work with. Both solutions do a good job of implementing the S3 API, and they also support other AWS services including EC2, RDS, Lambda, and more. They can both be used to test code in other languages in addition to Python.\n Localstack is probably the closest thing to actually connecting to AWS, but for my simple use case presented above, I can\u2019t justify the extra overhead and time required to spin up the stack. Therefore, I recommend moto as it\u2019s the most lightweight solution that properly implements the S3 API.\n For more complicated projects that are testing S3 performance, localstack could be a good choice. Botocore stubs don\u2019t make the cut.\n  Thanks for reading!

But the way that government statisticians track the price of consumer goods may be missing just how explosive home-price growth has been in recent months.\n  Housing costs rose by 0.4% between April and May, according to  the latest edition of the monthly consumer price index released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Compared with last year, housing prices for renters and homeowners alike were up 2.2%.\n  Altogether, the rise in housing prices  accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May, a reflection of how heavily government economists weight this spending category.\n  But if that 2.2% figure seems off based on your own experience of buying or selling a home, it\u2019s not a surprise. Not everyone agrees on the rate of house-price growth.\n    Other data suggested a much faster pace of home price appreciation and rental growth, well in excess of that level.\n  The  most recent report from the Case-Shiller Home Price Index for March showed that home prices were up more than 13%, the largest rate of growth since 2005.\n  So how does the CPI calculate housing? Firstly, housing units themselves are not included the CPI market basket.\n  Secondly, rental data to establish how prices are changing are collected every six months. The calculations for most other CPI items are collected monthly or bimonthly.\n  \u201cLike most other economic series, the CPI views housing units as capital (or investment) goods and not as consumption items,\u201d  the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. \u201cSpending to purchase and improve houses and other housing units is investment and not consumption.\u201d\n  \u201cThe cost of shelter for renter-occupied housing is rent. For an owner-occupied unit, the cost of shelter is the implicit rent that owner occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes,\u201d it adds.\n   The government pollsters ask homeowners: \u201cIf someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?\u201d\n  And they ask renters: \u201cWhat is the rental charge to your [household] for this unit including any extra charges for garage and parking facilities? Do not include direct payments by local, state or federal agencies. What period of time does this cover?\u201d\n   \u201cThe rate of house price appreciation is not akin to inflation,\u201d said Mark Fleming, chief economist at title insurance company First American Financial Services  FAF.\n  For a start, housing is a very basic necessity. \u201cDemand for shelter doesn\u2019t go away \u2014 it just moves around,\u201d Fleming said. In other words, if the price of airfares skyrockets 7%, as it did over the past month, families could decide against going on that summer getaway.\n  That choice isn\u2019t so simple when it comes to housing. As the cost of shelter increases it can have a \u201ccascading effect on extremely low-income renters,\u201d said Andrew Aurand, vice president for research at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n    Research from Aurand\u2019s organization has shown that more than 9.2 million \u201cextremely low-income\u201d renters are cost burdened by their housing, meaning they spent more than a third of their income on shelter-related expenses. Many of these households spend upwards of 50% on housing, leaving little money behind for other purchases.\n  The alternative for these households would be losing the roof over their heads. In recent years, that has become the reality for many Americans. A  2019 study released by the Trump administration estimated that more than 500,000 people sleep outdoors each night across the country, while many more couch surf or utilize shelters for unhoused people.\n  Meanwhile, for people who own their homes, buying a property isn\u2019t the same as buying, say, a banana. Owning that banana won\u2019t benefit you financially in the long-run, whereas with a house you can expect to see its value increase and to profit off that. But a home isn\u2019t a pure investment asset like a stock \u2014 it\u2019s a mix of both.\n    Home prices can rise both because the actual structure itself may be worth more \u2014 thanks to the rising cost of labor and lumber \u2014 but also because people see value in it as a capital investment.\n  As a result, there can be a mismatch in the way economists or government statistician view rising home prices, and what that means to a consumer.\n  \u201cIn a market environment where prices are rising so quickly to buy a home the economist would say that\u2019s the increase in the price of the capital good,\u201d said Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. \u201cBut to the buyer, it represents a higher cost of living.\u201d\n   People experience inflation vis-\u00e0-vis housing differently to most other products, and that makes it a challenging to measure.\n  For the typical homeowner, their housing costs likely haven\u2019t changed too much over the past year.\n  \u201cIf you have a fixed mortgage, on your home, year over year, how much does your cost of living in that home change? Not very much,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cThe only things that change year over year are your escrows for taxes and insurance.\u201d\n  Even with renters, the price of housing doesn\u2019t shift higher or lower from month to month. That\u2019s why the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects housing data more infrequently than most other items in the CPI basket of goods.\n  For renters and buyers, you encounter the changing cost when something about your living arrangement changed: When you move to a new home, sign a new lease or refinance your mortgage.\n    But Americans do need to know how much housing costs are rising or falling \u2014 not the least of which because residential real-estate makes up such a huge portion of the nation\u2019s economy.\n  The government\u2019s Consumer Price Index calculates the \u201cimputed rent\u201d \u2014 essentially the amount a homeowner is paying for their housing rather than paying a landlord.\n  If it did not do so, GDP would actually fall, Dietz said, \u201cbecause money that would be a rental payment in the marketplace paid by a renter suddenly disappears.\u201d\n  To bridge this challenge, the government relies on survey data to produce its estimates of housing costs for renters and homeowners. In renters\u2019 cases, they are simply asked how much they pay for housing.\n  But owners aren\u2019t asked what their mortgage payment is \u2014 after all, not everyone has a mortgage. Instead, that\u2019s why they are asked to estimate how much they would be able to charge for rent to lease out their current home.\n  Government statisticians survey the same cohort of Americans periodically to produce their findings and track changes over time to estimate housing costs.\n  \u201cInflation and [changes in] housing prices have generally been matched up,\u201d said Jonathan Needell, President and Chief Investment Officer of KIMC, a private real-estate investment company. He added that rising housing prices has \u201cexceeded inflation in some circumstances.\u201d\n  Some researchers have argued, however, that this approach  can also understate and/or be slow to identify true inflation occurring in the housing market.\n  A  new analysis from Fannie Mae  FNMA,  +2.26% showed that there is typically a lag between when home prices are actually rising, and when that price growth is reflected in inflation reports like the consumer price index.\n   The shifts in housing preferences and needs caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also complicated our ability to gauge the effect of inflation in the housing market.\n  Wealthier Americans, many of whom suddenly found themselves able to work remotely, chose to move away from major cities into larger and cheaper homes in the suburbs, often saving money in the process. As a result, rental rates declined in pricier neighborhoods.\n  But in more affordable areas, rents actually increased. Americans who lost their jobs because of the pandemic rushed to find cheaper housing, pushing rents higher for the least expensive apartments and homes in the suburbs.\n  Those effects are beginning to dissipate, but will continue to weigh on official measures like the consumer price index given the time lags that occur.\n    So is housing quickly becoming more expensive? The answer, economists agree, is yes. First American Financial Services has its own measure, the Real House Price Index, which compares nominal-price gains with Americans\u2019 ability to afford to purchase a property based on the prevailing interest rates and household income.\n  For a period of time between 2018 and the beginning of 2020, the  Real House Price Index was falling, because Americans\u2019 buying power was rising faster than home prices, Fleming said. That\u2019s not the case anymore.\n  \u201cDeflation has turned into inflation, not because interest rates have gone up \u2014 they\u2019ve only gone up a little bit \u2014 but because house prices are just crazy,\u201d Fleming said.\n  The reason home prices are rising so fast is fairly simple. After the Great Recession, home-building activity all but drew to a standstill as the construction industry worked to recover.\n    As a result, the construction of new homes did not keep pace with population growth and the formation of new households.\n  That left the housing market with a serious shortage of homes, just as millennials have begun getting married and having kids \u2014 traditional hallmarks of home-buying interest.\n  With the pandemic, the shift to remote working and low interest rates have only exacerbated things.\n  The primary solution to address runaway inflation in housing will be to build more homes \u2014 something that\u2019s easier said than done. \u201cSome of the challenges that we face on the supply side of the residential construction industry are going to persist well into 2022,\u201d Dietz said.\n  Those challenges run the gamut from the high cost of lumber to the lack of skilled workers to complete construction projects. Another factor: Zoning regulations across the country prevent the construction of more dense housing in many cities, effectively driving up home prices and rents in the process.\n  Finally, new-home construction alone won\u2019t make matters easier for all Americans. Because of the high costs, it\u2019s easier for builders to construct more expensive homes, even though the demand and competition is strongest for entry-level properties.\n  Over time, that increased concentration in the bottom-tier of the housing market is driving up prices for those who can least afford it.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s this argument that if you just build more supply to meet the demand, it will eventually help extremely low and very low-income renters,\u201d Aurand said. \u201cBut the market is not going to adequately serve mostly extremely low-income renters.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 02:45:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u98ce\u66b4,storm,\u4f4f\u623f", "title": "\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u98ce\u66b4\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4f4f\u623f\u5e02\u573a\u6765\u4e34 ", "title_en": "An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-u-s-housing-market-11623419869?mod=mw_more_headlines", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u98ce\u66b4", "storm", "\u4f4f\u623f"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066918, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JPEG XL\u56fe\u50cf\u683c\u5f0f\u5305\u62ec\u6240\u8c13\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u548c\uff0334;\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5176\u90bb\u5c45\u989c\u8272\u7684\u989c\u8272\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u8fbe\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u989c\u8272\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5c0f\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u5219110\u8702\u7a9d\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u3002 \uff08\u5b83\u4e0d\u662f\u4efb\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u60f3\u6211\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u505a\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219110\u662f\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u7684 - \u9664\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u662f\uff01\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e2e\u52a9\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0cJPEG XL\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u50cf1024\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c1024\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3002\u6240\u4ee5JPEG XL\u672c\u8eab\u662f\uff06\uff0339; T\u5b8c\u6210;\u6ca1\u67091024\u00d71024\u50cf\u7d20\u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u3002\n   \u8fd9\u662f\u6211JPEG XL\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c4\u5219110\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u3002\u5355\u51fb\u5b83\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\n   \u5f53\u6211\u5728\u4e0b\u9762\u5199\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\uff0cJXL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u683c\u5f0f\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\u6216\u5e38\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u8ba9\u5b83\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5e94\u7528sed\u547d\u4ee4sed\uff06\uff0339; s | \\ s *;\u3002* $ ||; s | t 1 | t 255 |; s | -1 | -255 |\uff06\uff0339;\u5265\u53bb\u6ce8\u91ca\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u00b11\u81f3\u00b1255\u3002\n  \u5982\u679cY\uff06gt; 0\u5982\u679cn\uff06gt; 0\u5982\u679cnw-n\uff06gt; -1; n = 1\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; 0; nw = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NW = 1\uff0cNE = 0/1\u5982\u679cnw-n>; 0; n = 0\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; -1; nw = 1  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NE = 1\u5982\u679cn-ne\uff06gt; -1; nw = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e0; ne = 0  - \u8bbe\u7f6e1; NE = 1\u5982\u679cx\uff06gt; 1022  -  SET 255  -  SET 0\n  JPEG XL\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u827a\u672f\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728JPEG XL Developer Jon Sneyers\u7684JXL Art Gallery\u4e2d\u770b\u5230\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u827a\u672f\u8005\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728JPEG XL Discord\u4e2d\u7684#JXL-ART\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5f00\u521b\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u827a\u672f\u3002\u8be5\u5e93\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301JPEG XL\u7684\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u3002\n \u201cJPEG XL\u827a\u672f\uff1a\uff06\uff0339; eeg\u5728Mount sierpinski\uff06\uff0339; 77\u5b57\u8282\u7684\u57fa\u5730\u3002 reddit\u7ebf\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7Jon Sneyers\u53d1\u8868\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ed6\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u683c\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u53ca\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u3002 ", "note_en": "The  JPEG XL image format includes so-called &#34;predictors&#34;, small programs that improve compression by expressing the color of a pixel in terms of the colors of its neighbors.

However, the threat most likely affects only the  $2,495 bike used in public spaces, such as in hotels or gyms, because the hacker needs to physically access the screen using a USB drive containing a malicious code.\n According to McAfee&#39;s Advanced Threat Research team, a hacker can discreetly control the stationary bike&#39;s screen remotely and interfere with its operating system. That means hackers could, for example, install apps that look like Netflix or Spotify and steal the users&#39; log-in information. Perhaps more alarmingly, the cybersecurity team was able spy on users via the camera and microphone, which is normally used for video chats with other users.\n      &#34;As a result, an unsuspecting gym-goer taking the Peloton Bike+ for a spin could be in danger of having their personal data compromised and their workout unknowingly watched,&#34; the report said. It also warned the hacker could configure this spyware at any point, including during the supply chain or delivery process, without the owner knowing.\n   Internet-connected devices, whether they are bikes, computers or even refrigerators,  are all susceptible to hacks. Cyberattacks have increasingly caught the public&#39;s attention, with high-profile companies including  McDonald&#39;s, Microsoft and Electronic Arts publicly revealing recent security breaches.\n  McAfee said it pored over Peloton&#39;s software with a &#34;critical eye&#34; to find vulnerabilities and warn users. The two companies worked together to &#34;responsibly develop and issue a patch.&#34;\n Peloton  (  PTON) released a mandatory software update that fixes the issue to users earlier this month. The security risk doesn&#39;t affect the lower-priced Peloton Bike because it uses a different type of touchscreen.\n This is an important reminder for users of all connected devices to activate automatic software updates to keep them protected against the latest attacks, according to McAfee.\n   &#34;Stay on top of software updates from your device manufacturer, especially since they will not always advertise their availability,&#34; McAfee&#39;s researchers said. &#34;Visit their website regularly to ensure you do not miss news that may affect you.&#34;\n This report marks the second security concern for Peloton in two months. In May, the fitness firm released a security update that sealed a leak that was revealing personal account information, such as a user&#39;s age, city and weight.

We know the technology pieces are there, as recently discussed with  Luke Short in our recent podcast. However, we are still waiting for an  official announcement that would turn the expected rumors into reality.\n While not an official confirmation yet, I have received the following information through a source that will remain anonymous:\n There are now some QA testers being hired to work on the \u201c ChromeOS Steam Launch Team\u201d to triage games, find defects and test performance in specific configurations.\n As I don\u2019t have first hand confirmation, take this  with a grain of salt, but I feel confident enough that this is very likely true to publish this.\n That\u2019s probably as close as a confirmation as we are going to get before Google/ChromeOS or Valve actually announces anything on this matter.\n This is absolutely excellent news, as this would now bring Google as an additional company supporting Linux Gaming front and center \u2013  and not just Valve. We all know that Google is a Linux shop at heart, but we have yet to see how this all fits with their  Stadia platform.\n Who knows, maybe in return Valve will help bring titles to Stadia via the Steam catalogue? That would not be a completely crazy idea. What do you think?\n   BoilingSteam lets you access our content for free, but writing articles is a constant investment.

As  The Washington Post reported in late January, Subway \u2014 the  world\u2019s largest sandwich chain \u2014 is currently facing a class-action lawsuit in the state of California that claims its tuna sandwiches \u201care completely bereft of tuna as an ingredient.\u201d\n After the news broke, the jokes swiftly followed. Jessica Simpson (who  famously didn\u2019t know whether Chicken of the Sea was chicken or tuna back in 2003)  tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s OK @SUBWAY. It IS confusing.\u201d Jimmy John\u2019s, a competitor, started sending email blasts with subjects like: \u201cTuna \ud83d\udc4f Sandwiches \ud83d\udc4f Should \ud83d\udc4f Use \ud83d\udc4f Real \ud83d\udc4f Tuna \ud83d\udc4f.\u201d\n Subway, for its part, has categorically denied the allegations. \u201cThere simply is no truth to the allegations in the complaint that was filed in California,\u201d a spokeswoman wrote in an email to The New York Times. \u201cSubway delivers 100 percent cooked tuna to its restaurants, which is mixed with mayonnaise and used in freshly made sandwiches, wraps and salads that are served to and enjoyed by our guests.\u201d\n From a reporter\u2019s perspective, however, the case bore further investigation \u2014 a deep dive, if you will.\n So, I procured more than 60 inches worth of Subway tuna sandwiches. I removed and froze the tuna meat, then shipped it across the country to a commercial food testing lab. I spent weeks chatting with tuna experts. I waited, and waited, until the lab results came back.\n   Canned tuna has its die-hards and naysayers, but it certainly sells. According to Nielsen Holdings, a global data and analytics company, about 700 million cans of tuna were sold in the U.S. over the last year.\n \u201cI think part of it is just nostalgia,\u201d said Ryan Sutton, the chief food critic for  Eater NY, when asked to explain the ascendancy of the canned fish. \u201cIt\u2019s what a lot of people grew up eating.\u201d\n Tuna sandwiches rose to prominence  in the early 1900s, when people realized canned fish could translate into a quick and cheap meal that involved no cooking. By the 1950s,  tuna had surpassed salmon in popularity, and during the 1980s, an  estimated 85 percent of Americans had canned tuna in their pantries despite growing concerns about high levels of  mercury in the fish.\n After a decades-long decline in tuna consumption, a  2018 Wall Street Journal story suggested that millennials were to blame (\u201cmany can\u2019t be bothered to open and drain the cans\u201d), though newer brands offering more sustainable options were seeing their market share grow.\n Then, in 2020, canned goods took on great urgency as shoppers  scrambled to buy shelf-stable food, not knowing how long the pandemic might last. That year, the global canned tuna market was valued at $8.57 billion, according to  Grand View Research.\n Subway has nearly 40,000 locations worldwide, about half of them in the U.S. (As  Grub Street once calculated, the average distance between Subways in Manhattan is 1,154 feet, or about four and a half blocks.) The total number of locations has been  in decline since 2015, a trend that a New York Times investigation attributed, in part, to targeted and manipulated inspections.\n Still, Subway\u2019s storefronts are ubiquitous, and according to the company, its tuna sandwiches are some of the best selling. \u201cSubway\u2019s tuna sandwich ranks among our guests\u2019 favorite sandwiches,\u201d the chain\u2019s spokeswoman wrote in an email.\n   But it\u2019s safe to say that Karen Dhanowa and Nilima Amin \u2014 the plaintiffs in the lawsuit \u2014 do not love Subway\u2019s tuna, which they believe is \u201canything but tuna,\u201d according to their filing from January. (Ms. Dhanowa and Ms. Amin\u2019s legal team declined to comment on the case for this article.)\n What exactly the plaintiffs believed the sandwiches contained, they wouldn\u2019t say. But in their filing from January, they alleged that Subway has deliberately misled customers by selling products \u201cfalsely advertised as \u2018tuna\u2019\u201d in order to charge a \u201cpremium price.\u201d\n Subway\u2019s spokeswoman, when asked about the progress of the case, reiterated the statement shared when the original complaint was filed.\n \u201cThe taste and quality of our tuna make it one of Subway\u2019s most popular products and these baseless accusations threaten to damage our franchisees,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n \u201cGiven the facts, the lawsuit constitutes a reckless and improper attack on Subway\u2019s brand and goodwill,\u201d she added.\n With all of that in mind, I began searching for a commercial lab that could test a sample of Subway\u2019s product. A handful of them politely declined my inquiries, citing technical limitations and company policies that made my tuna ineligible for analysis. Eventually, I found myself on the phone with a spokesman for a lab that specializes in fish testing. He agreed to test the tuna but asked that the lab not be named in this article, as he did not want to jeopardize any opportunities to work directly with America\u2019s largest sandwich chain.\n For about $500, his lab could conduct a PCR test \u2014 which rapidly makes millions or billions of copies of a specific DNA sample \u2014 and try to tell me whether this substance included one of five different tuna species.\n  According to  the Seafood List, which is compiled by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there are 15 species of nomadic saltwater fish that can be labeled \u201ctuna.\u201d\n Subway\u2019s  tuna and seafood sourcing statement says the chain only sells skipjack and yellowfin tuna \u2014 species that a lab would recognize as Katsuwonus pelamis and T. albacares.\n Before it lands on a Subway sandwich, that tuna, like the majority of commercially sold tuna, is caught by fishermen working in exclusive economic zones. (E.E.Z.s are areas that extend roughly 200 nautical miles from each country\u2019s coast; the U.S., with over 13,000 miles of coastline, controls the largest E.E.Z. in the world, containing 3.4 million square nautical miles of ocean.)\n There are five organizations that manage regional fisheries within those economic zones. Their job is to enforce regulations and \u201cmake sure the predators of ocean ecosystems remain in the ocean and not on our plates,\u201d according to Barbara Block, a professor of marine sciences at Stanford University who co-directs Stanford\u2019s Tuna Research and Conservation Center.\n \u201cRemoval at sustainable levels is a priority of many,\u201d Dr. Block added in an email, \u201cbut practiced by few.\u201d Bluefin tuna, for example, is now an endangered species following  decades of overfishing.\n There are three methods these fisheries use to catch tuna: purse seining, longlining and pole-and-line fishing.\n Pole-and-line fishing is the kind hobbyists take part in: sitting on a boat and bringing in one catch at a time. Larger fishing operations tend to rely on the other two methods.\n Purse seiners drop a large, round wall of netting around a school of fish and then \u201cpurse\u201d the bottom of the net shut to prevent fish from escaping. Longliners drop one 30- or 40-mile-long line into the water, then wait for the fish to catch on hundreds (or thousands) of hooks.\n Then the fish is cleaned, sorted and, eventually, canned. Dave Rudie, the president of Catalina Offshore Products in San Diego (the former  tuna capital of the world), works with a cannery that sells about a million cans of tuna each year, 10,000 of which contain bigeye sourced from him.\n \u201cThe really perfect colored tuna \u2014 the brightest red \u2014 goes to the sushi bars,\u201d Mr. Rudie said. \u201cTuna that\u2019s a little bit paler in color will go more for the cooking, where you sear the outside and it\u2019s raw in the middle.\u201d\n \u201cWe also get some more off-color tuna and that off-color tuna, we cut it up and freeze it,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd we send it up to a cannery in Oregon.\u201d\n Canneries tend to follow the same general process. \u201cMost canned tuna is caught by purse seiners and it\u2019s frozen on the boat,\u201d Mr. Rudie said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take it to a cannery, where they\u2019re most likely going to cook it once, and then they\u2019re going to pull the meat off the bone, and they\u2019re going to put it in a can, and then it\u2019s going to get retorted \u2014 cooked a little bit \u2014 to sterilize it the last time before they seal the can.\u201d\n Then there\u2019s the issue of labeling. When  Oceana, an organization focused on ocean advocacy, conducted one of the largest \u201cfish fraud\u201d investigations in the early 2010s, it discovered that \u201cseafood may be mislabeled as often as  26 to 87 percent of the time for commonly swapped fish such as grouper, cod and snapper, disguising fish that are less desirable, cheaper or more readily available.\u201d\n  Such distinctions might not be noticeable, or all that troubling, to every consumer. But when you\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s in a Subway tuna sandwich, they matter.\n I was told that if I packed a Ziploc of Subway tuna into a Styrofoam shipping cooler with a few ice packs and mailed it across the country, the lab could test it.\n To procure the sandwich specimens, I visited three different Subway locations around Los Angeles. It seemed logical to order only tuna on the sandwiches \u2014 no extra vegetables, cheese or dressing \u2014 as the lab was already wary about the challenges of identifying a fish that\u2019s been cooked at least once, mixed with mayo, frozen and shipped across the country.\n My first frozen tuna shipment, which cost upward of $150, was lost in transit. But on second try, the sample arrived intact. In two to three weeks, the lab would tell me whether it contained any tuna.\n  Though Subway declined to disclose its tuna suppliers, Sage, who has been a Subway manager in California for three years, shared some details about how the product arrives at her location. (Sage asked not to use her full name out of fear of reprisal from her employer.)\n \u201cThe tuna comes in a case and inside the case, there are six aluminum pouches and it\u2019s just like a pressed, vacuum sealed slab of tuna,\u201d Sage said. \u201cIt\u2019s flaky and it\u2019s clearly soaked in water \u2014 it\u2019s like a brine, so it\u2019s just soaked in salt water \u2014 and it\u2019s just flaky tuna. We just spread it apart with our hands\u201d \u2014 gloved, of course \u2014 \u201cand mix it with mayo.\u201d\n Sage said that each store follows corporate guidelines, which instruct that certain meats can stay out in the store\u2019s refrigerated sandwich bar for up to 24, 48 or 72 hours.\n Tuna, she said, has a 72-hour counter life (the time frame was also confirmed by Subway\u2019s spokeswoman), though Sage said her store often replaces it before it hits three days. \u201cWe all agree \u2014 all of us that work there \u2014 it gets kind of gross,\u201d she said.\n Jen, a former Subway \u201c sandwich artist\u201d who worked at a location in Iowa for a year, said she couldn\u2019t imagine what incentive Subway would have to replace the tuna with anything else. (Jen also asked not to use her full name out of fear of reprisal from her employer.)\n \u201cI dealt with the tuna all the time,\u201d Jen said. \u201cThe ingredients are right on the package and tuna is a relatively cheap meat. There would be no point to making replacement tuna to make it cheaper.\u201d\n And as an occasional consumer of Subway\u2019s tuna, Jen said she\u2019s confident it\u2019s fish.\n \u201cI personally have a really weak stomach to fish, which is how we know the tuna is real,\u201d she said. \u201cLast time I ate it, I puked my guts out.\u201d\n But Sage said that beyond meeting these food safety standards, she\u2019s not very concerned about whether this tuna is real or not.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t really care at all,\u201d she said of herself and her fellow sandwich artists. \u201cWhich may sound kind of weird, I guess, but customers will bring it up and we just go, \u2018I don\u2019t know. What kind of cheese do you want?\u2019\u201d\n   \u201cNo amplifiable tuna DNA was present in the sample and so we obtained no amplification products from the DNA,\u201d the email read. \u201cTherefore, we cannot identify the species.\u201d\n The spokesman from the lab offered a bit of analysis. \u201cThere\u2019s two conclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, it\u2019s so heavily processed that whatever we could pull out, we couldn\u2019t make an identification. Or we got some and there\u2019s just nothing there that\u2019s tuna.\u201d (Subway declined to comment on the lab results.)\n To be fair, when  Inside Edition sent samples from three Subway locations in Queens out for testing earlier this year, the lab found that the specimens were, indeed, tuna.\n Even the plaintiffs have softened their original claims. In a new filing from June, their complaints centered not on whether Subway\u2019s tuna was tuna at all, but whether it was \u201c100% sustainably caught skipjack and yellowfin tuna.\u201d\n With all testing, there are major caveats to consider. Once tuna has been cooked, its protein becomes denatured \u2014 meaning that the fish\u2019s characteristic properties have likely been destroyed, making it difficult, if not impossible, to identify.\n All of the people I spoke with also questioned why Subway would swap out its tuna.\n \u201cI don\u2019t think a sandwich place would intentionally mislabel,\u201d Mr. Rudie from Catalina Offshore Products said. \u201cThey\u2019re buying a can of tuna that says \u2018tuna.\u2019 If there\u2019s any fraud in this case, it happened at the cannery.\u201d\n Peter Horn, the director of the  Ending Illegal Fishing Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, agreed that it would be difficult to place blame on Subway if this were the case.\n \u201cIn the defense of Subway, or quite a lot of these fishmongers, the further you get the fish from the bone, the harder it is to recognize what that fish is,\u201d he said.\n \u201cMost of us see the fish on the bone, skin intact, and we can recognize what sort of fish that is,\u201d he continued.  \u201cYou drop the head and the tail off, it becomes more difficult, but you can still probably recognize it.
