I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my &#39;roadmap to becoming a better human&#39; google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I&#39;m making  most of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year&#39;s resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p><p>去年大约这个时候，我充斥着关于新年决议和年度总结的各种文章，就像一月初的情况一样。我试图确定我的生活中是否有希望改变的事情。我的路线图上的重要要点之一就是成为一个更好的人。谷歌文档（每个人都有一个，对吗？）越来越意识到我的时间会发生什么（我会花在什么上面？我确定我会充分利用它吗？）。这听起来像是可行的新年决议，所以我决定尝试一下。但是，有时我有时会变得有些紧张，因此我全年记录所有活动的时间间隔为15分钟。</p><p>   Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just &#34;Life&#34;):</p><p>   在这里，从我的Google工作表中查看此屏幕截图（顺便说一句，电子表格标题只是＆＃34; Life＆＃34;）：</p><p>   I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn&#39;t sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into  quality time.</p><p>   我想看看我的时间会发生什么。我知道我在社交媒体上花了很多钱，但我不确定确切多少。我也知道我在做很多事情，想准确地量化多少（扰流板警报：不是那么多）。我希望跟踪自己所做的事情将有助于我识别浪费的时间并将其转化为优质的时间。</p><p> It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p><p> 这也是纯粹出于科学的好奇心-我想找到答案的时候，有很多不太重要的问题，我很想知道：单身时我的睡眠会减少吗？我要花多少时间与人相处还是与自己相处？喝酒有什么作用？还有很多其他</p><p>   When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p><p>   当我开始时，我完全希望对整个事情感到无聊，并且可能在一个月左右后停止。令人惊讶的是，记录我所做的事情非常容易。您可能已经注意到，我对数据感到非常兴奋，因此看到我的电子表格越来越大，越来越丰富多彩，足以激励我前进。在少数情况下，当我快要停下来的时候，强大的FOMD（害怕丢失数据）总是会让我重回正轨。</p><p>   I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn&#39;t want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</p><p>   我决定每隔15分钟记录一次我的活动-我希望能够赶上更短的活动（尤其是拖延），但不希望它太疯狂（尽管我可能已经失去了决定什么是疯狂的权利）当我开始整个项目时）</p><p> I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template  here.</p><p> 我正在使用Google表格记录数据。我喜欢它们，因为默认情况下处于在线状态，允许我同时在笔记本电脑和手机上记录数据；拖曳复制的单元格内容功能使记录长时间的活动变得容易，而条件格式使电子表格美观而丰富多彩，可即时提供满足。您可以在此处访问我的模板。 </p><p> I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.For me, the categories were: focused work - what I really understand as productivity: self-improvement - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</p><p>我将活动分为几大类，以使其更容易记录下来。有些类别又分为子类别。对我而言，这些类别是：专注工作-我真正理解为生产力：自我完善-职位申请，还从事我的个人项目（例如编写代码以分析我的数据或学习画）</p><p> admin - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</p><p> 管理员-答复电子邮件，填写表格等（但填写我的时间跟踪电子表格属于此类别）</p><p> low-focus work - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn&#39;t require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</p><p> 低重点工作-与重点工作相同的子类别。低焦点的工作包括更具机械性的活动，不需要太多的脑力。例如，管理或整理我的笔记将是低重点的，而阅读论文或撰写论文将是重点的工作。</p><p>   human function - the boring stuff I need to do to stay alive (showering, making food, eating and things like that. On trips also setting tents etc)</p><p>   人的功能-我需要做的无聊的事情才能维持生命（淋浴，做饭，吃饭等类似的事情。在旅行中还设置帐篷等）</p><p> other quality time - things that didn&#39;t really fit into the other categories. Subcategories:  blogs,  podcasts,  news,  games,  YouTube,  chilling (for the times when I needed to just lie down or stare at the wall), and  other)</p><p> 其他优质时间-确实不适合其他类别的时间。子类别：博客，播客，新闻，游戏，YouTube，令人不寒而栗（在我只需要躺下或凝视在墙上的时候）等）</p><p>   Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let&#39;s use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p><p>   好了，现在我希望能使您平静下来，让我们使用我必须回答的几个问题：</p><p>   Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I&#39;m very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can&#39;t decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p><p>   事实证明，我一年中的前三项活动是睡觉（每天平均7h 45分钟，对此我感到非常自豪），工作（每天平均6h 20分钟）和社交（每天3h 25分钟） ）。这是我所期望的，只是它总是使我感到恐惧，实际上我们花了多少时间潜意识。我无法决定在人体功能（饮食和淋浴等）上花费1小时20分钟的时间是否很多（我想这是小样本量的缺点）。一方面，我可能会用这段时间做更多有趣的事情，但另一方面，我也许应该放松一下。拖延时间（平均每天10分钟）肯定比实际要少-我将详细讨论在下面的生产率部分中。 </p><p> Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as &#39;extra days&#39; on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn&#39;t spend them on human function.</p><p>我记录数据方式的另一个很酷的功能是，我可以将多个活动记录到一个时隙中（走路和听播客是经典的）。这意味着花在所有活动上的总时间总计超过365天-您可以将其视为“额外天数”。在上面的情节上。事实证明，今年，我有395个盈余小时或16.5个盈余天。我希望我没有花时间在人体功能上。</p><p>   By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p><p>   到目前为止，我的大部分工作是攻读大学和博士学位-总共51天。在排除6月至9月的假期之后，这是我每天的工作时间，大约是5个小时。尽管这包括周末，但似乎并不多，尤其是周末在uni并不十分受人尊敬。</p><p> Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a  lot of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p><p> 即使在感觉高效的日子里，找出很少要做的重点工作也是分析数据的最大惊喜之一。事实证明，一个典型的工作日（9-17）通常只能提供大约5-6个小时的实际工作时间，而其余时间会分散在低专注度的工作上，与人聊天，喝咖啡休息和其他一些小干扰。虽然有时候我要花8个小时来集中精力工作（今年我有32天这样的重点大学工作时间），但他们要么花一整天（9-22天）的工作时间，要么要付出很多努力才能保持专注。从长远来看，两者都很累人并且不可持续。我想这里的教训是，在集中精力工作方面，8小时工作日是无法实现的目标，不应用作基准。</p><p> I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p><p> 我也做很多行政工作，几乎有一半时间都花在文化上。这是相当可悲的，是未来的潜在行动点。</p><p>  I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I&#39;m quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads  1 ). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can&#39;t really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the &#39;documentaries&#39; are really just Louis Theroux and I don&#39;t regret a single minute.</p><p>  我花了很多时间看书-平均每天将近1.5小时！我对此很满意，因为这是我今年自觉培养的习惯。在这段时间里，我阅读了35本书（根据Goodreads 1的统计，共12,715页）。如果您需要一些建议，我的前三名将是：莫斯科的绅士，中间的地方和无处不在的小火。另一方面，我找不到真正喜欢的电影或电视节目，因此，如果您有自己喜欢的电影或电影，请告诉我！还有一个好处：纪录片＆＃39;真的只是路易斯·瑟鲁（Louis Theroux），我不会后悔一分钟。</p><p>    As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p><p>    如上所述，如果我同时进行两个活动，那么由于将两个活动记录在一个时隙中，因此小时总数超过24。</p><p> You can quite clearly identify the &#39;hard lockdown&#39; times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master&#39;s thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p><p> 您可以很清楚地识别出“硬锁定”时间-四月+五月和十一月。在这两个时期中，工作时间都有明显增加，社交活动减少，文化也有所增加。在春季，我正在完成硕士学位论文并为考试进行修订，因此无论锁定如何，我都希望生产率得到提高。但是，在11月看到相同的情况（不鼓励我们去上班）似乎表明，我在家工作时实际上在做更多工作。这可能是由于分散注意力较少，但也缺少替代方法。通常，我会经常停止工作以结识朋友。在锁定期间，如果无法选择，我经常会继续工作。 </p><p> I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p><p>我很想谈谈所有其他类别，但是帖子变得冗长，因此您可以在这里进行探索（另一个好处：寻找我玩Zoo Planet的狂欢）：</p><p>  As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.Inspired by  this post I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun  now and doesn&#39;t really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p><p>  当我整年都在分析自己的数据时，我对自己的工作量很少感到失望，并一直在寻找提高工作效率的方法。我希望它们能为我的猴子大脑带来瞬间的乐趣（猴子的大脑现在想要乐趣，并且真的不在乎未来的我），使它做的事情可能不那么有趣，但对鉴于我已经全天都有活动数据，因此分配积分非常简单。</p><p>  4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</p><p>  每小时4点，用于最有生产力的活动（着重于uni和自我完善和锻炼的工作）</p><p>   0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</p><p>   对于重要的事情要0分，但我还是要这样做（社交，睡觉等）</p><p>     Turns out my monkey brain is   crazy  about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, nearly all months have higher averages and fewer days with very low scores than January, February and March.</p><p>     原来我的猴子脑子疯狂点。从我开始的那一刻起，每天都变得很乐观。您会发现，与1月，2月和3月相比，几乎从4月开始，所有月份的平均水平更高，而得分极低的天数却更少。</p><p> This is already pretty cool, but the most important outcome of introducing these points is that I stopped thinking about productivity in binary terms. Before the points, whenever I was too tired to do work, my thinking process would go like this: &#34;Since I&#39;m not doing work (bad), I might as well scroll some social media (also bad)&#34;, while after the points this became &#34;Alright, I am too tired to do work (not gaining 4 points) but maybe I can read a book (3 points) or go for a walk and listen to a podcast (3 points) instead&#34;</p><p> 这已经很酷了，但是介绍这些要点的最重要结果是，我不再以二进制的方式考虑生产力。在此之前，每当我太累而无法工作时，我的思考过程就会像这样：＆＃34;由于我没有工作（不好），所以我不妨滚动一些社交媒体（也是不好的） ＆＃34 ;，当积分变为＆＃34;好之后，我太累了不能上班（得不到4分），但也许我可以读一本书（3分）或散步听一听播客（3分）代替＆＃34;</p><p> Of course, there are some caveats. Remember how I was unconvinced about the very low procrastination times? Since I started scoring myself, my monkey brain had a high incentive to find ways around logging in procrastination. I have frequently caught myself making sure that I only spend 5 or 6 minutes on Facebook so that I didn&#39;t reach the threshold of 7 minutes for logging in an activity in my spreadsheet. Sadly, I don&#39;t have any other source of data on how much time I was spending on social media to verify the accuracy of my tracking.</p><p> 当然，有一些警告。还记得我对拖延时间很短感到不服吗？自从我开始给自己打分以来，我的猴子脑非常有动力去寻找解决拖延症的方法。我经常发现自己确保只在Facebook上停留5到6分钟，以至于我没有达到7分钟的门槛，无法登录电子表格中的活动。遗憾的是，我没有其他数据来源可以证明我在社交媒体上花费了多少时间来验证跟踪的准确性。 </p><p> Another important consideration is that &#39;hours spent on&#39; is not a great measure of productivity - I want to achieve things and not just spend time doing busywork. To make sure that this is the case, I do weekly summaries, where I compare what I wanted to accomplish vs what I actually did accomplish in the past week and plan for the upcoming week. However, for many activities, the points work well enough (a longer walk is more beneficial than shorter walk). And as for working, there is still some merit in making sure I do at least x hours of work per day - if I manage to accomplish something after 4 hours, I can still read a paper or do some less focused work.</p><p>另一个重要的考虑因素是，花费的时间在这不是衡量生产力的好方法-我想实现目标，而不仅仅是花时间做忙碌的工作。为了确保能做到这一点，我每周做一次总结，在这里我将要完成的工作与过去一周中实际完成的工作进行比较，并计划下一周的工作。但是，对于许多活动而言，这些点已经足够好了（较长的步行比较短的步行更有益）。至于工作，确保每天至少工作x个小时仍然有一些好处-如果我在4个小时后设法完成某件事，我仍然可以阅读论文或做一些不太集中的工作。</p><p>   Giving myself points for activities is an incredible life hack. Turns out that getting some non-existent tokens is enough of an incentive for me now to do things that me from the future wants done. I want to experiment with this a bit more (what happens if I give myself points for spending time with people? or for going on walks?)</p><p>   为自己提供活动积分是一个不可思议的生活技巧。事实证明，获得一些不存在的代币足以激励我现在做将来我想做的事情。我想对此做些尝试（如果我给自己一些与人相处的时间或散步的机会，会发生什么？）</p><p>  ... I don&#39;t know? Do you want to? Personally, I found it fun and rewarding but you might not.</p><p>  ...我不知道吗？你想要_____吗？就个人而言，我觉得它很有趣而且很有意义，但您可能没有。</p><p>  I. Have. So. Much. Data. (over 35k data points) This post barely scratched the surface. Stay tuned to learn how do different activities influence my mood, how important was spending time with people, whether lockdowns made me less unhappy and much more!</p><p>  我有。所以。许多。数据。 （超过35k数据点）此帖子几乎没有刮擦表面。请继续学习不同的活动如何影响我的心情，与人相处的时间有多重要，锁定是否使我减少了不快乐并变得更多！</p><p>      1. A quick calculation (12715 pages/(508hrs of reading * 60 minutes/hr)) suggests that I&#39;ve been reading with the speed of 0.4 page per minute. Apparently, on average, books have  200-300 words per page and a typical reader reads around 200-250 words/minute. My reading speed seems be within the expected order of magnitude, though quite slow. This might be because the page count does not include books which I started and didn&#39;t finish. Another potential explanation is that I&#39;ve been overreporting reading.   ↩</p><p>      1.快速计算（12715页/（508小时的阅读时间* 60分钟/小时））表明我一直以每分钟0.4页的速度进行阅读。显然，平均而言，书籍每页包含200-300个单词，一个典型的读者每分钟阅读大约200-250个单词。我的阅读速度虽然很慢，但似乎在预期的数量级内。这可能是因为页数不包括我开始但尚未完成的书。另一个可能的解释是，我一直在夸大阅读量。 ↩ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://samplesize.one/blog/posts/my_year_in_data/">https://samplesize.one/blog/posts/my_year_in_data/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/每隔/">#每隔</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/intervals/">#intervals</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
