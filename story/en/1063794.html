It was old and didn&#39;t work but it was the start of a love affair with technology that turned him into an inventor, entrepreneur and telecoms millionaire - a future that few would have predicted after his tough start in life.</p><p>Freddie Figgers在九岁时给了他的第一台电脑。它是旧的，＆＃39; T工作，但它是与技术的爱情开始，让他成为一个发明家，企业家和电信百万富翁 - 一个很少在生活中艰难地开始后的未来。</p><p>  Just one piece of advice 31-year-old entrepreneur Freddie Figgers would like to pass on to others.</p><p>  只有一件事就是31岁的企业家弗雷迪·差价格想过别人。</p><p> When he was eight years old, he asked his father, Nathan, about the circumstances of his birth, and the reply was unforgettable.</p><p> 当他八岁时，他问他的父亲Nathan关于他出生的情况，答复令人难忘。</p><p> &#34;He said, &#39;Listen I&#39;m going to shoot it to you straight, Fred. Your biological mother, she threw you away, and me and Betty Mae, we didn&#39;t want to send you through foster care and we adopted you, and you&#39;re my son.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他说，＆＃39;听我＆＃39;我要直接把它射击，弗雷德。你的生物母亲，她把你扔掉了，我和贝蒂的mae，我们没有想通过寄养护理送你，我们通过你，你和＃39;＆＃39;＆＃34;＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie had been found abandoned as a newborn baby next to a dumpster (a large rubbish container) in rural Florida.</p><p> 弗雷迪被发现被遗弃为佛罗里达州农村的垃圾箱（大型垃圾容器）旁边的新生婴儿。</p><p> &#34;When he told me that, I was like, &#39;OK I&#39;m trash,&#39; and I felt unwanted. But he grabbed my shoulder and he said, &#39;Listen, don&#39;t you ever let that bother you.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当他告诉我，我就像，＆＃39;好的，我＆＃39; m垃圾，＆＃39;我感到不受欢迎。但他抓住了我的肩膀，他说，＆＃39;听，不要让你打扰你。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> Nathan Figgers was a maintenance worker and handyman and Betty Mae Figgers, a farm worker. They lived in Quincy, a rural community of about 8,000 people in North Florida, and were in their 50s when Freddie was born in 1989.</p><p> 内森图是一个维修工人和贝蒂Mae Figgers，一个农场工人。他们在佛罗里达州北北北约克的农村社区生活在昆西，并在1989年出生的弗雷迪出生时50多岁。 </p><p>  They had already fostered many children, but decided to take Freddie in when he was two days old, and adopt him as their own son. Freddie says they gave him all the love he could ever want - but other children in Quincy could be brutal.</p><p>他们已经培养了许多孩子，但决定在他两天的时候去拿弗雷迪，并将他作为自己的儿子。弗雷迪说他们给了他所有想要的爱 - 但昆西其他孩子可能是残酷的。</p><p> &#34;Kids used to bully me and call me, &#39;Dumpster baby,&#39; &#39;Trash can boy,&#39; &#39;Nobody wants you,&#39; &#39;You&#39;re dirty,&#39;&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;孩子们曾经欺负我，叫我，＆＃39;垃圾箱宝贝，＆＃39; ＆＃39;垃圾桶男孩，＆＃39; ＆＃39;没有人想要你，＆＃39; ＆＃39;你＆＃39;重新肮脏，＆＃39;＆＃34;他说。</p><p> &#34;I remember getting off the school bus sometimes and kids used to just come behind and grab me and throw me in a trash can and laugh at me.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我记得有时候下车校车，孩子们曾经只是抓住我，把我扔进垃圾桶，嘲笑我。＆＃34;</p><p> It reached a point where his father would wait for him at the bus stop and walk him home, but the children mocked Nathan too, Freddie remembers, &#34;saying, &#39;Ha ha, look at the old man with the cane.&#39;&#34;</p><p> 它到达了一个父亲在公共汽车站等他的地方，走他回家，但是孩子们也嘲笑内森，弗雷迪记得，＆＃34;＆＃39;哈哈，看着老人甘蔗。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> So far as Freddie was concerned, Nathan and Betty Mae were heroes, and great role models.</p><p> 就弗​​雷迪而言，纳森和贝蒂的Mae是英雄，而且伟大的榜样。</p><p> &#34;I saw my father always helping people, stopping on the side of the road helping strangers, feeding the homeless,&#34; he says. &#34;He was an incredible man, and for them to take me in and raise me, that&#39;s the man I want to be like.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我看到我的父亲总是帮助人们，停在路边帮助陌生人，喂养无家可归者，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;他是一个令人难以置信的男人，为他们带我进去抚养我，那个我想要的男人。＆＃34;</p><p>  At weekends Freddie and Nathan would drive around &#34;dumpster diving&#34; - looking for useful things that had been thrown away by their owners. Freddie particularly had his eye out for a computer.</p><p>  在周末，弗雷迪和内森会开车＆＃34;垃圾箱潜水＆＃34; - 寻找由业主抛弃的有用的东西。弗雷迪特别引起了一台电脑。 </p><p> &#34;It&#39;s an old saying, &#39;One man&#39;s trash is another man&#39;s treasure,&#39;&#34; says Freddie, &#34;and I was always fascinated by computers. I always wanted a Gateway computer, but at that time we couldn&#39;t afford one.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;它＆＃39;一个旧的谚语，＆＃39;一个人＆＃39;垃圾是另一个男人＆＃39; s宝，＆＃39;弗雷迪说，＆＃34;我总是被电脑着迷。我一直想要一个门户电脑，但那时我们无法买一个。＆＃34;</p><p> Finally, one day when Freddie was nine, they went to a second-hand shop called Goodwill, where they came across a broken Macintosh computer.</p><p> 最后，有一天，当弗雷迪九岁时，他们去了一个叫做善意的二手店，他们遇到了破碎的Macintosh电脑。</p><p> &#34;We persuaded the sales associate,&#34; says Freddie, &#34;and he said, &#39;Hey, I&#39;ll give it to you for $24,&#39; (£17), so we took the computer home and I was just so ecstatic.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们说服了销售助理，＆＃34;弗雷迪说，＆＃34;他说，＆＃39;嘿，我＆＃39; ll以24美元的价格给你，＆＃39; （£17），所以我们拍了电脑家，我只是如此欣喜若狂。＆＃34;</p><p>     He was already fond of tinkering with the collection of radios, alarm clocks or VCRs that Nathan had accumulated, and the broken Mac now became the focus of his attention.</p><p>     他已经喜欢滋补无线电，闹钟或vcr的收集，即内森积累了，并且破碎的Mac现在成为他注意的重点。</p><p> &#34;When I got it home and it wouldn&#39;t come on, I took the computer apart,&#34; says Freddie.</p><p> ＆＃34;当我得到它的时候，它会＆＃39; t来吧，我把电脑分开了，＆＃34;弗雷迪说。</p><p> &#34;As I was looking in it I saw capacitors that were broken. I had soldering guns there and I had radios and alarm clocks, so I took parts out of my father&#39;s radio alarm clock and I soldered them into the circuit board.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我正在寻找它时，我看到了被打破的电容器。我那里有焊枪，我有无线电和闹钟，所以我把零件从我的父亲中拿出来了，我的无线电闹钟，我将它们焊接到电路板中。＆＃34;</p><p> After about 50 attempts, he says, the computer finally switched on - and at this moment Freddie says he knew that he wanted to spend his life working with technology.</p><p> 他说，大约50次尝试后，电脑终于改装了 - 此刻弗雷迪说他知道他想度过他的生活与技术合作。 </p><p>   Whenever he was being picked on at school, he says he was always thinking, &#34;I can&#39;t wait to get home to play with my computer.&#34;</p><p>每当他在学校被选中时，他都说他一直在思考，＆＃34;我可以等待回家和我的电脑一起玩。＆＃34;</p><p> He was 12 when his skills became noticed by others. At an after-school club, while other children were playing in the playground, Freddie set to work repairing broken computers in the school&#39;s computer lab.</p><p> 当他的技能被其他人注意到他的技能时，他是12岁。在一个课后俱乐部，而其他孩子在操场上玩耍，弗雷迪设为修复学校的破碎电脑＆＃39;计算机实验室。</p><p> &#34;If the hard drive was corrupt I would swap it out. If it needed more memory I would add more RAM. If it needed a power supply, I would switch it out,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;如果硬盘驱动器腐败我会换掉它。如果需要更多的内存，我会添加更多的RAM。如果需要电源，我会把它切换出来，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> The director of the after-school programme was Quincy&#39;s mayor and when she saw that he was bringing broken computers back to life, she asked him to come to the city hall with his parents.</p><p> 课后课程的董事是昆西＆＃39;我的市长，当她看到他把破碎的电脑带回生活时，她让他和父母一起来市政厅。</p><p> &#34;When we get to city hall, she shows me all of these computers in the back, oh gosh, maybe 100 of them stacked up, and she says, &#39;I need these computers repaired.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我们到达市政厅时，她向我展示了所有这些电脑，哦天哪，也许100人堆积起来，她说，＆＃39;我需要这些计算机。＆＃39; ＆＃34;</p><p> From then on, Freddie spent time every day after school mending this pile of computers, for $12 (£9) an hour.</p><p> 从那时起，Freddie每天放学后花时间修补这堆电脑，每小时12美元（9英镑）。</p><p> &#34;It wasn&#39;t even really about the money,&#34; he says. &#34;I had an opportunity to do something that I loved to do and it was just so fun to me.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;它甚至不是真的关于钱，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;我有机会做一些我喜欢做的事情，对我来说这么有趣。＆＃34; </p><p>  A couple of years later, a coding opportunity arose. Quincy needed a system to check the city&#39;s water pressure gauges, and a company had quoted $600,000 (£432,500) to develop a computer program.</p><p>几年后，会出现一个编码机会。昆西需要一个系统来检查城市＆＃39; S水压力表，公司引用了600,000美元（432,500英镑）来开发计算机程序。</p><p> Freddie remembers that the city manager called out, &#34;Hey, Freddie&#39;s a computer dork, he could probably help with this.&#34;</p><p> 弗雷迪记得城市经理所召集，＆＃34;嘿，弗雷迪＆＃39;我可能有助于这个。＆＃34;</p><p> &#34;So I said, &#39;Sir, listen, if you give me an opportunity, I could build the same program. So he gave me that opportunity and I built that program exactly to the specifications that they needed. I didn&#39;t get paid $600,000, I got my regular pay cheque and went home.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;所以我说，＆＃39;先生，听，如果你给我一个机会，我可以建立同一计划。所以他给了我这个机会，我完全建立了他们所需要的规格的程序。我没有得到600,000美元，我得到了常规支票并回家。＆＃34;</p><p> It was a crucial turning point in Freddie&#39;s life. He was only 15, but he now decided to leave school and start up his own computing business - much to his parent&#39;s dismay.</p><p> 它是弗雷迪的一个关键的转折点。他只有15岁，但他现在决定离开学校并启动自己的计算业务 - 很多父母的沮丧和＃39;</p><p> &#34;They believed in education, work, retirement, and I wanted to break that chain, I wanted to do something different,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;他们相信教育，工作，退休，我想打破那个连锁店，我想做一些不同的事情，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> Freddie&#39;s business was going from strength to strength when a couple of years later, Nathan started rapidly developing Alzheimer&#39;s disease.</p><p> 弗雷迪＆＃39;业务从力量到实力，当几年后，内森开始迅速发展阿尔茨海默氏症＆＃39;疾病。</p><p> One disturbing symptom was that he would wake up in the night and re-enact things he had seen on television earlier in the evening. This led to what Freddie calls &#34;the most traumatising thing that ever happened to me&#34;.</p><p> 一个令人不安的症状是他会在夜晚醒来，并在晚上早些时候重新制定他在电视上看到的东西。这导致了Freddie呼叫和＃34;我遇到的最突出的事情＆＃34; </p><p> Money is nothing but a tool, and I&#39;m going to do everything in my power to try to make the world a better place before I leave it</p><p>金钱只不过是一个工具，而我将在我留下来的情况下尝试使世界变得更美好的地方</p><p> &#34;It was about two o&#39;clock one morning, and my father used to like this old western called Gunsmoke, and he came into my bedroom and he thought he was [the main character] Matt Dillon. He had a rifle in his hand and he told me… &#39;I&#39;m going to need you to get out of town.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这是两个o＆＃39;一天早上的时钟，我的父亲曾经喜欢这个古老的西方人叫枪声，他进入了我的卧室，他以为他是[主角] Matt Dillon。他手里有一个步枪，他告诉我......＆＃39;我将需要你离开城镇。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie says there was a &#34;bit of a tussle&#34;, but he got the gun out of his father&#39;s hand, took him back to bed and tucked him in.</p><p> 弗雷迪说，有一个＆＃34;位的田鼠＆＃34;但他把枪从他的父亲中拿出来，把他带回睡觉，把他塞进去。</p><p>  This was another symptom of his Alzheimer&#39;s and it had happened before. Sometimes he would forget to get fully dressed before wandering off, though he always put on his shoes.</p><p>  这是他的阿尔茨海默氏症的另一种症状＆＃39;它以前发生过。有时他会忘记在徘徊之前完全穿着，虽然他总是穿上鞋子。</p><p>  &#34;So I got my dad&#39;s shoes, I cut the sole of the shoe open, I built the circuit board and placed it inside of the shoe with a 90 megahertz speaker, a microphone and a wired area network card,&#34; says Freddie.</p><p>  ＆＃34;所以我得到了我的爸爸和＃39;我削减了鞋子的鞋底，我制造了电路板，并用90兆赫兹扬声器，麦克风和有线区域网卡放在鞋内。 ，＆＃34;弗雷迪说。</p><p> &#34;I integrated that with my laptop - this was before Apple maps or Google maps - and I integrated that through the TomTom, Garmin platform.</p><p> ＆＃34;我用我的笔记本电脑整合了 - 这是Apple地图或谷歌地图 - 我通过TomTom，Garmin平台集成了这一点。</p><p> &#34;My father could actually wander off and I could press a button on my laptop and say, &#39;Hey Dad, where are you?&#39; I would come in as a loudspeaker on his shoe, and he would say, &#39;Fred, I don&#39;t know where I am!&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我父亲实际上可以徘徊，我可以在我的笔记本电脑上按一个按钮，说，＆＃39;嘿爸爸，你在哪里？＆＃39;我会像他的鞋子那样进来，他会说，＆＃39;弗雷德，我不知道我在哪里！＆＃39;＆＃34; </p><p> Freddie could then trace his whereabouts via the GPS tracker and go and fetch him. He says he had to do this about eight times.</p><p>然后弗雷迪可以通过GPS跟踪器追踪他的下落，然后去取他。他说他必须做这个大约八次。</p><p>  When Nathan&#39;s condition deteriorated further, some family members wanted him to go into a nursing home, but Freddie refused. Instead he took his father with him to business meetings.</p><p>  当内森＆＃39;条件进一步恶化时，一些家庭成员希望他进入养老院，但弗雷迪拒绝了。相反，他带着他的父亲去了商务会议。</p><p>  When he visited potential clients, he would leave Nathan in the back seat of the car with the air conditioning on, the radio playing and a lock on the steering wheel.</p><p>  当他访问潜在客户时，他会在汽车的后座，带上空调，无线电播放和方向盘上的锁定。</p><p> &#34;One time I was in a meeting and I looked out the window and... oh my gosh, my dad had let the back window down and climbed out,&#34; says Freddie. &#34;So I was in panic mode and it was embarrassing, but I was like, &#39;Hey, I have to go.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;有一次我在开会，我看着窗外......哦，我的天哪，我的父亲让后窗下来爬出，＆＃34;弗雷迪说。 ＆＃34;所以我处于恐慌模式，它令人尴尬，但我就像，＆＃39;嘿，我得走了。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie ran out of the meeting and was relieved to find his father sitting in a nearby car park.</p><p> 弗雷迪跑出会议，并释放了坐在附近停车场的父亲。</p><p>  &#34;It honestly broke me,&#34; says Freddie, &#34;because all I ever wanted to do was make my dad happy.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;它诚实地打破了我，＆＃34;弗雷迪说，＆＃34;因为我想做的就是让我的爸爸开心。＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie had sold his shoe tracker invention for $2.2m (£1.6m) and had been waiting for the funds to clear. Nathan had always wanted to own a 1993 Ford pick-up truck and a fishing boat but now that Freddie could afford to buy them, it was too late.</p><p> 弗雷迪以220万美元（1.6亿英镑）卖掉了他的鞋跟踪器发明，并等待资金清除。内森一直想拥有1993年福特拾取卡车和一艘渔船，但现在弗雷迪可以买到他们，为时已晚。 </p><p> &#34;That really opened my eyes and taught me that money is nothing but a tool, and I&#39;m going to do everything in my power to try to make the world a better place before I leave it,&#34; says Freddie.</p><p>＆＃34;真正睁开了我的眼睛，并教给了我的钱，只有一个工具，而且我将在我留下的力量之前做出努力让世界变得更美好的地方，＆＃34 ;弗雷迪说。</p><p> &#34;Knowing my father, he wasn&#39;t a rich man at all, but he [made an impact on] so many people&#39;s lives and I want to just do right by everyone I meet and help everyone I can.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;了解我的父亲，他根本不富裕的人，但他[对]这么多人＆＃39;生活，我想对我见面的大家做正确的，我可以。＆＃34;</p><p>  By this stage, Freddie had invented another clever device, also inspired by a personal experience - this time a visit to Georgia when he was eight years old, to visit his mother&#39;s uncle.</p><p>  在这个阶段，弗雷迪发明了另一个聪明的装置，也通过个人经验启发 - 这次当他八岁时访问格鲁吉亚，拜访他的母亲＆＃39;叔叔。</p><p> &#34;When we got to his house my mother and father were knocking on the front door and he wouldn&#39;t come to the door,&#34; says Freddie. &#34;So my father said, &#39;Hey Fred, can you climb through the window and open the front door?&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我们到他的房子时，我的母亲和父亲正在敲门，他不会来到门口，＆＃34;弗雷迪说。 ＆＃34;所以我的父亲说，＆＃39;嘿弗雷德，你可以爬过窗户，打开前门吗？＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie got inside, unlocked the door. He could see his relative sitting in a chair by the fireplace and thought everything was fine.</p><p> 弗雷迪进来了，打开了门。他可以看到他的相对坐在椅子上的壁炉，并认为一切都很好。</p><p> &#34;My dad walked up to him and I remember these words - my dad called my mum and he said, &#39;Betty Mae, he&#39;s dead.&#39;&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我爸爸走向他，我记得这些话 - 我爸爸叫我的妈妈，他说，＆＃39;贝蒂Mae，他死了。＆＃39;＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;When you think about somebody with diabetes, when they check their blood sugar they have to write it down and take a log of it, and in the case of my mother&#39;s uncle, even if he wrote it down, for the rural area that he lived in, there was no-one to keep an account of that,&#34; Freddie says.</p><p>  ＆＃34;当你想到有糖尿病的人时，当他们检查他们的血糖时，他们必须把它写下来并拍摄它，在我母亲的情况下，即使他把它写下了，对于他住的农村地区，没有人能够保持那个帐户，＆＃34;弗雷迪说。 </p><p> So at the age of 22, Freddie built a smart glucometer that instantly shares a person&#39;s blood sugar level with their closest relative and adds the readings to their electronic health record, which a doctor can view. If a person&#39;s blood sugar level is abnormal, it sends out an amber alert notification as a warning.</p><p>因此，在22岁时，Freddie建立了一个智能血糖仪，立即与他们最近的相对分享的血糖水平，并将读物添加到他们的电子健康记录中，医生可以看到。如果一个人和＃39; s血糖水平异常，它会将琥珀色警报通知发送为警告。</p><p>  But Freddie had also begun work on a bigger project. He was aware that many parts of rural America had no access to the 2G or 3G network, and in Quincy people were still using dial-up internet at the time, with its distinctive symphony of crackly white noise and high pitched ringing.</p><p>  但弗雷迪也在更大的项目上开始工作。他意识到，农村农村的许多部分都无法访问2G或3G网络，在昆西人时仍然在当时使用拨号互联网，其独特的混合性白噪声和高倾斜响。</p><p> He wanted to bring up-to-date communications to these rural areas and in 2008 made the first of many applications for an FCC (Federal Communications Commission) licence to start his own telecoms company.</p><p> 他希望为这些农村地区提出最新的沟通，并于2008年为FCC（联邦通信委员会）许可证的申请中的众多申请中首先启动了自己的电信公司。</p><p> &#34;I had to petition to show that the bigger telecom carriers are not going to come in and invest their infrastructure into a rural area with populations of less than 1,000,&#34; he says.</p><p> ＆＃34;我不得不请求表明，更大的电信运营商不会进入并将其基础设施投入到一个人口少于1,000，＆＃34;他说。</p><p> It wasn&#39;t easy. In fact, he says, it took 394 attempts, and cost a huge amount of money. But in 2011, at the age of 21, Freddie became the youngest telecoms operator in the US.  According to NBC News, Figgers Communication remains the only black-owned telecommunications company in the country.</p><p> 它不是很容易的。事实上，他说，花费了394次尝试，并花费了大量的钱。但2011年，在21岁时，弗雷迪成为美国最年轻的电信运营商。根据NBC新闻，Flagges Communication仍然是该国唯一的黑人电信公司。</p><p> In the early days Freddie did most of the work himself - from laying the concrete for his first mobile phone tower, to installing fibre optic cables.</p><p> 在初期，弗雷迪做了大部分工作 - 从将混凝土铺设了他的第一台手机塔，安装光纤电缆。</p><p>  He started out providing services in rural areas of north Florida and southern Georgia, not far from Quincy, and the company has steadily grown. In 2014, Freddie launched a smartphone, the Figgers F1, with a device that detects motion and switches to &#34;safe mode&#34; above 10mph, preventing people from texting while driving. The Figgers F3, which went on sale in 2019, contains a chip designed to enable wireless charging whenever the phone is within five metres of a &#34;super base charger&#34; - a device that has been awaiting approval by the FCC.</p><p>  他开始提供在佛罗里达州北部的农村和格鲁吉亚南部的服务，不远离昆西，公司稳步发展。 2014年，Freddie通过检测运动和切换到＆＃34的设备，推出了一个智能手机的智能手机F1，与＆＃34切换;安全模式＆＃34;高于10英里，防止人们在驾驶时发短信。在2019年销售的贴图F3包含一个芯片，该芯片旨在使手机在5米范围内的＆＃34;超级基础充电器和＃34; - 已等待FCC批准的设备。 </p><p> The marketing of the F3 caused controversy, with some bloggers arguing that not all of the first model&#39;s features were as up-to-date as they said they had been led to believe. Freddie told the BBC: &#34;Our goal is to provide honesty and transparency while we provide quality and advanced products at an affordable price.&#34;</p><p>F3的营销造成了争议，一些博主争论并非所有的第一个型号和＃39;他们所说的所有特征都是最新的，因为他们表示他们被引导相信。弗雷迪告诉英国广播公司：＆＃34;我们的目标是提供诚实和透明度，同时我们以实惠的价格提供优质和先进的产品。＆＃34;</p><p> Freddie&#39;s mother, 83, has now also begun to develop Alzheimer&#39;s.
