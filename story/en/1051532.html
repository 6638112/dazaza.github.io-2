An afternoon that I can play back like a home movie. It’s a bright sunny day in the wake of one of Rochester, New York’s typically brutal winters. The sky is blue, the clouds are cotton balls, and sunlight shimmers off the deep green leaves of the grass, bushes, and oak trees of campus, all freshly nourished by the recently melted snow. Undergraduates are out in shorts on the quad, some gathered on steps, others tossing Frisbees, all surrounded by ivy-covered halls of red brick and gray stone, including Bausch and Lomb Hall, home of the physics department. I’m in the dining room of the university’s Faculty Club, where the daylight is smothered by heavy velvet drapes. Maroon, I think, bordered by sunlight. Chandeliers sparkle above. There are seven or eight people sitting around the table, which is set with a white cloth and place settings decked out with multiple forks. A bottle of wine is making the rounds. The meal feels like what it is: a celebration.</p><p>  这是在罗切斯特大学的16年来的“93年春天，在那里我去了物理学研究生。一个下午我可以像家庭电影一样回来。这是纽约州的罗切斯特之一，这是一个灿烂的阳光灿烂的日子，通常是残酷的冬天。天空是蓝色的，云是棉球，阳光熄灭草的深绿色的叶子，灌木丛和乌鸦树的校园，都是最近融化的雪的新鲜滋养。大学生在四边形短缺，有些人聚集在一起，其他人折腾Fisbees，所有人都被红砖和灰色石头所覆盖的大厅，包括百星和LOMB大厅，物理部门的家园。我在大学的教师俱乐部的用餐室，当时烈天鹅绒窗帘弄脏了日光。栗色，我觉得，边阳光接壤。吊灯闪耀在上面。坐在桌子周围有七八个人，用白布设定，并将设置放在用多个叉子上装饰。一瓶葡萄酒正在制作圆形。这顿饭感觉就像它是什么：庆祝。</p><p>  It was the end of my second year of graduate school and I had what I’m sure was a very goofy grin on my face as I listened to the little pecan-colored man with the remarkably round head to my right. He wore wire-framed glasses and was smiling too. Actually Sarada Rajeev was always smiling, although his smile had several variations. There was the default smile he had on now, a smile of surprise that lifted his glasses in synchrony with his eyebrows, and a smile of discomfort where his eyes gave his true feelings away. But my favorite of all was the subversive smile he’d get after one of his own mischievous jokes, the one where his eyes would light up and meet yours until you were smiling too. Rajeev was an assistant professor of physics in his early 30s, just five years older than me. He had a soft voice, a quick wit, and a way of sauntering the department’s hallways—chin up and smiling—that prompted one of my classmates to admiringly comment on how “prosperous” he looked. Rajeev had arranged the lunch, having gathered all of his students and postdocs to welcome me into his group.</p><p>  这是我第二年的研究生院的结束，我有什么我肯定的是我脸上的一个非常愚蠢的笑容，因为我听到小山核桃色的男人，在我的右边是非常圆形的。他穿着丝网框架眼镜，也很帅。实际上，Sarada Rajeev总是微笑着，虽然他的笑容有几种变化。他现在有默认的笑容，一个惊喜的笑容，用眉毛同步地抬起眼镜，以及他的眼睛给出了他真正的感受的笑容。但是我最喜欢的是他在他自己的顽皮笑话之后的颠覆性的笑容，他的眼睛会照亮的那个，直到你微笑。 Rajeev是30多岁的物理学助理教授，只需要五岁。他有一个柔和的声音，一个快速的机智，以及一种驾驶部门的走廊 - 下巴的方式，促使我的一个同学们钦佩地评论他看起来的“繁荣”。 Rajeev安排了午餐，收集了他所有的学生和博士后，欢迎我进入他的小组。</p><p>  I’d met him for the first time a year earlier, after finding a slip of paper in my Bausch and Lomb mail cubby and on it a handwritten note:</p><p>  我在一年前的第一次见到他，在我的百士和LOMB邮件Cubby和它上面看了一张纸上，并在手写笔记：</p><p>  “Mr. Henderson. If you’d like to discuss research in high-energy theory, please come by my office. – S.G. Rajeev.”</p><p>  “先生。亨德森。如果您想讨论高能量理论的研究，请通过我的办公室来。 -  S.G. Rajeev。“</p><p>  I was thrilled, even though I knew little about Rajeev. There were 15 of us in my class at Rochester and I was the only one who still hadn’t found a research advisor to take me on as an apprentice once classes were over. That was because I was the only one holding out for high-energy theory, aka theoretical particle physics—Rajeev’s specialty. High-energy theory is also sometimes called  “fundamental physics” because it concerns the fundamental laws of nature that govern the way elementary particles, like electrons and quarks, act and interact, and therefore how everything made of those particles (which meant, as far as I knew,  everything) behaves, too. I’d quit a good job as an electrical engineer in Southern California and come to Rochester with a dream of studying fundamental physics and pursuing its Holy Grail: a theory of quantum gravity that would reconcile quantum mechanics with Einstein’s general theory of relativity and therefore, as I understood things at the time, amount to a Theory of Everything.</p><p>  我很激动，即使我对Rajeev知之甚少。在罗切斯特班上有15个，我是唯一一个仍然没有找到一项课程的研究顾问，一旦课程结束。这是因为我是唯一一个坚持高能理论的人，是理论粒子物理 -  Rajeev的专业。高能量理论也有时被称为“基本物理学”，因为它涉及到基本颗粒，如电子和夸克，行为和相互作用的方式的基本规律，因此如何如何由那些颗粒（这意味着，到目前为止正如我知道的那样，一切）也表现得。我将在南加州的电气工程师辞职，并享有梦想学习基础物理并追求其圣杯的梦想：一种量子重力理论，将与爱因斯坦的一般相对论理论调和量子力学，当我当时了解的事情时，金额到一切的理论。 </p><p>  Like Don Quixote, I was propelled on my quest by books, New Agey ones like  The Tao of Physics and  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, and biographies of physics greats like Einstein and Feynman, books that gave me the very welcome news that there were still frontiers to explore, even in the late 20th century, even for a bookish sort like me. Basically I was a naïve and dreamy kid who hadn’t yet hit any intellectual limits. My dad was an NYPD detective whose one pearl of career advice was, “You can do whatever you want.” And, at the time I switched to physics, I saw no reason to doubt him.</p><p>就像唐吉诃德一样，我被书籍推进了我的追求，新的古代的物理和禅宗和摩托车维修艺术，以及物理学的伟大的伟大像爱因斯坦和费曼，书籍给了我很欢迎的消息即使在20世纪末，也仍然是探索的前沿，即使是像我这样的书评。基本上我是一个尚未触及任何智力限制的天真和梦幻般的孩子。我父亲是一个尼斯侦探，职业建议的一珍珠是“你可以做任何你想做的事情。”而且，当我转向物理时，我没有理由怀疑他。</p><p>  Rajeev must have heard about me from one of the more senior theorists in the department who I’d already approached but who wasn’t taking students. So Rajeev wasn’t my first choice, but by the time I found his note he seemed like my only hope.</p><p>  Rajeev必须从我已经接近的部门中的越来越高的理论家中听说过我，但没有服用学生。所以Rajeev不是我的第一个选择，而是当我发现他的纸条时，他似乎是我唯一的希望。</p><p>  The next thing I knew I was crouched in a chair in Rajeev’s little office, with a notebook on my knee and focused with everything I had on an impromptu lecture he was giving me on an esoteric aspect of some mathematical subject I’d never heard of before. Zeta functions, or elliptic functions, or something like that. I’d barely introduced myself when he’d started banging out equations on his board. Trying to follow was like learning a new game, with strangely shaped pieces and arbitrary rules. It was a challenge, but I was excited to be talking to a real physicist about his real research, even though there was one big question nagging me that I didn’t dare to ask:  What does any of this have to do with physics?</p><p>  我知道的下一件事我在Rajeev的小办公室里蹲在一把椅子上，膝盖上的笔记本，并与我在讲授的一切中专注于他正在给我一些我从未听说过的一些数学主题的宇宙方面。前。 Zeta函数或椭圆函数，或类似的东西。当他开始在他的董事会敲掉方程时，我几乎没有介绍自己。试图遵循就像学习一个新的比赛，奇怪的碎片和任意规则。这是一个挑战，但我很高兴与真正的物理学家谈论他的真实研究，即使有一个大问题唠叨我，我不敢问：这有什么与物理有关？</p><p>  After a couple of hours, Rajeev turned to me with a look that I later realized must have been heightened scrutiny.</p><p>  几个小时后，Rajeev转向我，看起来我后来意识到一定是提升的审查。</p><p>  “Maybe, you could work it out?” he said, about a problem he’d just described but hadn’t solved.</p><p>  “也许，你可以搞砸了吗？”他说，关于他刚才描述但没有解决的问题。</p><p>  Sure, I said, stuffing my notebook into my backpack, I could give it a try.</p><p>  当然，我说，把我的笔记本塞进我的背包里，我可以试一试。</p><p>    I staggered back into the hallway punch-drunk from all the new concepts that had just been pounded into my head. So it was only as I stepped out of Bausch and Lomb altogether and back into the bright of the quad that I added two and two together and got four. Rajeev had said little about his research or his group, and the only question he’d asked me was that one problem at the end.</p><p>    我从所有刚刚砸到我脑海中的所有新概念中都蹒跚进入走廊淋上。所以只是我完全走出了Bausch和Lomb，并回到了四边形的光明，我在一起加入了两个和两个，得到了四个。 Rajeev对他的研究或他的团体有点几乎没有说过，他唯一一个问我的问题是最后一个问题。 </p><p>    That night, I took Rajeev’s problem home with me, to a house in a suburban neighborhood a few miles from campus, where I rented the second floor from an old woman who lived downstairs. My desk was in the bedroom and my pacing creaked the floorboards, which periodically prompted the  boom-boom-boom of her broom on her ceiling as a rebuke to my stirring past the 11 p.m. end of prime time.</p><p>那天晚上，我把Rajeev的问题与我一起，到郊区距离校园里几英里的郊区的房子，在那里租了一楼从楼下的老太太租了二楼。我的桌子在卧室里，我的起搏吱吱作响，这些地板吱吱作响，这些地板促使她的天花板上的扫帚的热潮繁荣，因为我在下午11点举行搅拌我的剧烈刺激。黄金时间结束。</p><p>  Eventually I settled down at my desk, and tiptoed whenever I had to get up for coffee or the bathroom.</p><p>  最终我安顿下来，每当我不得不拿到咖啡或卫生间时都会尖头。</p><p>  I don’t remember the details of the problem, just that it involved proving some general property of elliptic functions (or zeta functions, or whatever) as opposed to being a brute force calculation. It was a little as if someone had just introduced you to right triangles, but not the Pythagorean theorem, and then asked if you could find some relationship between the sides. Solving it would take a creative spark. But what really threw me was realizing that I didn’t have any sense of how hard the problem was, how intricate the calculation would have to be to solve it, or whether Rajeev knew the answer himself, or even whether the thing had an answer at all.  Damn, I thought to myself,  Why didn’t I ask?</p><p>  我不记得问题的细节，只是它涉及证明椭圆函数（或Zeta函数或其他）的一些常规属性，而不是成为蛮力计算。这有点好像有人刚刚将你介绍到右三角形，但不是毕达哥拉斯定理，然后询问你是否可以找到两侧之间的一些关系。解决它会采取创造性的火花。但是，真正扔给我的是意识到我没有任何意义的问题是问题的艰难，计算如何解决它，或者rajeev是否知道答案自己，甚至是事情是否有答案根本该死的，我想对自己，为什么我不问？</p><p>  I figured I had until the next day, when I’d agreed to see Rajeev again. I’d plowed through page after page of my yellow pad all evening, but each time I tried a new direction I either got lost or lost heart in the thicket of jumbled symbols I’d scribbled on the page. I kept flipping through my notes, looking for some fact I’d missed. I was haunted by the possibility that the thing had no answer at all, and by the even more dismaying thought that the damn thing was simple and I just couldn’t see it.  Am I stupid to keep trying or stupid to not be done yet? Either way …</p><p>  我认为我直到第二天，当我同意再次看到Rajeev。我整个晚上，我的黄色垫的页面后犁过页面，但每次我尝试了一个新的方向，我要么在页面上潦草地潦草地丢失的丛林中丢失或失去了心脏。我一直翻阅我的笔记，寻找一些我错过的事实。我困扰着事情根本没有答案，而且甚至更加令人沮丧地认为该死的事情很简单，我只是看不到它。我是愚蠢的，不断尝试或愚蠢，还没有完成吗？无论哪种方式 …</p><p>  I feared failing Rajeev’s test. All of my classmates had taken up with advisors who were, like most physicists, experimentalists, the researchers who do the hands-on work of, say, smashing particles together at accelerators to see what comes out. Theorists like Rajeev, or for that matter Einstein and Feynman, who instead do the noodling necessary to explain the results of experiments with math are fewer and further between. A couple of Rochester’s experimentalists had pressured me to drop my dream of doing theory because, they explained, theory was so ridiculously difficult and had so few jobs. But I’d brushed them off. The whole reason I’d quit my job and come to Rochester was to do theory and to pursue “The Grail.” Anything less would have felt like failure.</p><p>  我担心没有rajeev的测试。我所有的同学都与顾问一起接受，这些顾问，如大多数物理学家，实验主义者，那些在加速器一起击毁粒子的研究人员，看看加速器，看看出来了什么。像Rajeev这样的理论家，或者对于那个Einstein和Feynman，他们代替做出必要的面条，以解释数学的实验结果是较少的，并且进一步。几个罗切斯特的实验主义者迫使我放弃了我做理论的梦想，因为他们解释说，理论是如此荒谬困难，工作很少。但我会把它们刷掉。我辞职的整个原因并来到罗切斯特是做理论并追求“格拉勒”。更少的任何东西都会觉得失败。</p><p>  I made another pot of coffee and brought a mug back to my desk. I scribbled ever deeper into my yellow pad. I got more and more nervous and it got harder and harder to sit still. Every once in awhile I padded to the window, for a view that no longer changed.</p><p>  我煮了一盆咖啡，把杯子带回了我的桌子。我潦草地潦草地进入我的黄色垫。我越来越紧张，静静地静静地变得更加紧张。每次一旦我填充到窗口，以便一个不再改变的视图。</p><p>  Stray thoughts fluttered like butterflies through my mind, scattering my mental constructions to the wind. Sometimes they morphed into more sinister things, little black spidery things that hissed with a hectoring voice …</p><p>  迷走思想像蝴蝶一样颤抖，散落着我的精神结构到风。有时他们变成了更加险恶的东西，小黑的蜘蛛，嘶嘶声用寄入声音...... </p><p>      If you can’t even do this, how can you ever expect to make it as a theorist?</p><p>如果你甚至不能这样做，你怎能期望它成为理论家？</p><p>  Pinpricks of sweat pierced the back of my neck and hands. My throat went dry. The hectoring voice questioned every decision I’d made that brought me to where I was. Quitting my cushy California job. Sending the experimentalists away. Waiting to start this damn problem until after dinner.</p><p>  针刺汗水刺穿了我的脖子和手。我的喉咙干了。寄入声音质疑我所做的每一个决定都会让我带到我的位置。退出我的Cushy加州工作。将实验主义者送走。在晚餐后等待开始这个该死的问题。</p><p>  When the idea finally came, it was like a faint breath over my shoulder, unexplained magic from an unseen direction. I felt in my gut it was right, but still had to prove it. I was too excited to sit still. I held myself down in my chair. The damn thing was solvable after all. I was wet with sweat when I finished. When I looked back up at the window, it was glowing a rosy morning gold.</p><p>  当这个想法终于来了，就像我的肩膀上的微弱呼吸，从看不见的方向来说是不明原因的魔法。我觉得我的肠道是对的，但仍然必须证明它。我太兴奋了静止。我把自己抱在椅子上。毕竟该死的东西是可解决的。当我完成时，我很湿。当我抬起窗户时，它正在发光一个玫瑰色的黄金。</p><p>  A year later, at the Faculty Club lunch, I was finished with classes for good and chomping at the bit to start research with Rajeev. I’d just learned that I’d passed the department’s “prelim” exam with flying colors; I even received an award for my score. That made my joining Rajeev’s group official, but it felt like a formality after Rajeev’s own test the year before.</p><p>  一年后，在学院俱乐部午餐，我已经完成了课程，以便在rajeev开始研究。我刚刚了解到，我通过了鲜艳的颜色通过该部门的“PRELIM”考试;我甚至收到了我的分数奖。这使我加入了Rajeev的团体官员，但它在Rajeev自身测试之后感觉到一个正式。</p><p>  After lunch, we all filed out of the club and into the sunlight and shimmering green of campus. In my home-movie memory, I’m walking next to Rajeev on the path back to Bausch and Lomb. He’s twisting a toothpick in his mouth, deep in thought. I’m still grinning that goofy grin and can’t feel the ground. I’m high from the wine and the sun, but also from memories of the convoluted route it had taken me to get there, including a couple of other aborted careers before engineering. Finally I’d figured out who I was and where I belonged.  Finally. I held back tears.</p><p>  午餐后，我们都归档了俱乐部，进入阳光，闪闪发光的校园绿色。在我的家庭电影记忆中，我旁边走到了rajeev的路径旁边，回到百星和lomb。他在嘴里扭曲了牙签，深思熟虑。我仍然咧着嘴笑，不能感受到地面。我从葡萄酒和阳光下高，也从回忆的巡回路线上，它让我到达那里，包括工程前几个其他中产阶级的职业生涯。最后，我想知道我是谁以及我所属的地方。最后。我背弃了眼泪。</p><p>  And this is where I’d freeze the frame.  This was my happiest moment, and not just with work, but ever. There on that path with Rajeev and thinking to myself, for the first time in my life:  There is nowhere I’d rather be, and nothing I’d rather be doing. Rajeev had just told me over dessert that the first project he wanted me to work on with him was a problem in quantum gravity.</p><p>  这就是我冻结框架的地方。这是我最幸福的时刻，而不仅仅是为了工作，而且是永远的。在那条路上与Rajeev和思考自己，在我的生命中第一次：我宁愿的地方，我宁愿做任何事情。 Rajeev刚刚告诉我甜点，他希望我和他一起工作的第一个项目是量子重力的问题。</p><p>      That summer, I moved. A fellowship I’d had had run out, so I’d have to start earning my keep as a teaching assistant and living off a stipend that went from a subsistence wage to a sub-subsistence wage. I left the old woman’s house for the relative bargain of a basement of another house in a seedier neighborhood. Its tiny windows up by the ceiling furnished its one room with feeble light and a bug’s-eye view of weeds. Its concrete walls seeped with damp. The bed was a mattress on the floor, with a plastic tarp under it to keep it dry. I kept a pair of running shoes next to it, for whacking the giant centipedes that regularly wriggled by. Dad, who never seemed bothered by sleeping on the shared cots in his dingy police station, or by nights spent in the rat-infested warehouses where he moonlighted as a security guard, was incredulous the first time he came. “I don’t know how you can live like this,” he rasped in his Bronx accent, looking both concerned and amused.</p><p>      那个夏天，我搬了。我曾经遇到过的一位奖学金，所以我必须开始作为教学助理和生活的助学金，这些津贴从生存到亚自满工资。我离开了老太太的房子，为播种机社区的另一所房子的地下室相对讨价还价。天花板的微小窗户带着一间带有微弱的灯光和杂草的虫子眼睛观。它的混凝土墙用潮湿渗出。床上是一个床垫在地板上，用塑料篷布，使其保持干燥。我在它旁边保留了一双跑步鞋，为破坏定期蠕动的巨型蜈蚣。爸爸，似乎从未睡过他的昏迷警察局的共同婴儿床，或者在他融入的仓库里度过了他月球作为保安的仓库，这是他第一次来的时候，他令人兴奋的夜晚。 “我不知道你是如何生活的，”他在他的布朗克斯口音中咆哮，看起来有兴趣和逗乐。 </p><p>    And I’d be spending all my waking hours in Bausch and Lomb anyway, working on quantum gravity with Rajeev, exploring the sort of intellectual frontier that  Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance had called the “high country of the mind.”</p><p>无论如何，我都会在Bausch和Lomb中花费所有醒来的时间，致力于Rajeev的量子重力，探索禅宗和摩托车维修艺术所谓的“心灵高地”的智力边疆。</p><p>      The first was how much Rajeev already knew about the problem, even before we started. And I don’t just mean background knowledge, but instead the actual answer to our project’s main question, at least in broad strokes.</p><p>      即使在我们开始之前，第一个是Rajeev已经知道这个问题。我不仅仅意味着背景知识，而是对我们项目的主要问题的实际答案，至少在广泛的中风中。</p><p>  If you were to picture Rajeev and me as explorers in the high country, facing some misty mountain range that we needed to cross, Rajeev was the one scanning the landscape, making mental calculations, and pointing the way. What struck me most was how he somehow knew that our ultimate destination, call it a river, lay on the other side. The “river” in our case was a detailed answer to the quantum gravity question Rajeev had posed over dessert at the Faculty Club. Its exact location and shape would remain a mystery until we’d found it, but Rajeev never doubted it was there.</p><p>  如果您将Rajeev和Me作为高国家的探险者，面对一些迷雾的山脉，我们需要交叉，Rajeev是扫描景观，使心理计算和指向方式。我最震惊的是他如何以某种方式知道我们的终极目的地，称之为河流，躺在另一边。我们的案例中的“河”是rajeev在教师俱乐部甜点上的量子重力问题的详细答案。它确切的位置和形状将仍然是一个谜，直到我们发现它，但Rajeev从来没有怀疑那里。</p><p>  That made me the scout. We’d convene in Rajeev’s little office and, like our first meeting, I’d focus on following his logic and asking questions while he paced back and forth, thought out loud, and banged out equations on the board. At some point, after three or four hours, he might say something like “What else could it be?” that signaled that he was happy enough with the direction he’d found to let me forge ahead on my own, meaning I’d spend the next day or two in my office doing the detailed calculations that he’d speculated would take us to the next landmark. Sometimes I’d find the route clear; other times an obstacle in the way. Either way, I’d report back and then we’d sink back into another session. Thus research advanced, by a system reminiscent of the directions on a shampoo bottle: Meet. Calculate. Repeat.</p><p>  这让我成为侦察员。我们召开在Rajeev的小办公室，就像我们的第一次会议一样，我将专注于他的逻辑并在他来回开始时询问问题，在董事会上响亮，想念和撞击方程式。在某些时候，三四个小时后，他可能会说“其他能力？”这样的东西这使得他足够高兴地用他发现的方向让我努力让我努力，这意味着我会在我的办公室里度过第二天或两个人，他正在进行详细的计算，他推测他会带来我们的详细计算下一个地标。有时我会发现途径清晰;其他次障碍的方式。无论哪种方式，我会报告回来，然后我们会沉到另一个会话。因此，通过系统让人想起了洗发水瓶上的方向：满足。计算。重复。</p><p> The Man Who Loved PhysicsBy Alan Lightman Several years ago, I attended a Buddhist retreat in which I was introduced to the idea of the “retinue,” a constellation of influential and supportive people whom one imagines in an enveloping cloud...  READ MORE</p><p> 多年前喜欢艾伦·莱特曼的男人，我参加了一个佛教撤退，我被引入了“retinue”的想法，这是一个有影响力和支持的人，一个人在包围云中想象一下...阅读更多</p><p>  After a few months, we solved the problem and reached the river’s edge, which was right about where Rajeev had reckoned. We wrote and published a paper called “Quantum Gravity on a Circle and the Diffeomorphism Invariance of the Schrödinger Equation.” Rajeev put my name first, because “H” comes before “R.”</p><p>  几个月后，我们解决了这个问题并达到了河流的边缘，这是一个正确的Rajeev估计的地方。我们在赛中发表并发表了一种称为“圆形重力的纸张以及Schrödinger方程的扩散不变性”。 Rajeev首先把我的名字放在，因为“H”来到“R”之前。</p><p>  And here came the second surprise of my first research experience: that I could come all the way to a true frontier and still have so little clue where I was. There are terms in our paper (“Virasoro algebra,” “Yamabe problem”) that I could not define for you today, and not because I’ve forgotten. I understood our calculations, but there was so much more to knowing where you were than that, so much context that Rajeev had in his head but that I didn’t have time to learn because it was all I could do to simply keep up. The times I’d fallen behind, Rajeev had gone ahead on his own, done his own calculations and summarized for me what he found. I learned my lesson. If I wanted to forge frontiers rather than just following as a tourist, I’d have to keep up, keep moving, and only pause long enough to hack a few vines and clear a few weeds. There was no time to stop just to appreciate the scenery.</p><p>  在这里来到我的第一次研究经历的第二个惊喜：我可以一路走到真正的边境，仍然有这么小的线索在哪里。我们的论文中有条款（“Virasoro代数，”Yamabe问题“）我今天无法为您定义，而不是因为我忘记了。我明白了我们的计算，但是要知道你的位置比那么多，那么rajeev在他的脑海中的那种情况下，但我没有时间学习，因为这就是我能做的就是要做的。当我落后的时候，Rajeev已经自己前进，做了自己的计算，并为我找到了他发现的东西。我学会了我的课程。如果我想锻造前沿而不是作为旅游者，我必须继续走动，继续移动，只暂停足够长的时间来破解一些葡萄藤并清除一些杂草。没有时间停止欣赏风景。 </p><p>    I only would have appreciated more how Rajeev and I hadn’t come any closer to The Grail. This was yet another surprise: that not every part of the frontier is equally earthshaking and that some are sort of trivial. Despite how knotty our project seemed to me, our conclusions were of extraordinarily limited scope.</p><p>我只会欣赏更多Rajeev和我没有靠近Grail。这是另一个令人惊讶的是：不是边境的每个部分都是平等的，有些部分有点琐碎。尽管我们的项目似乎是多么结合，但我们的结论是非常有限的范围。</p><p>    The paper we wrote did indeed flesh out a consistent theory of quantum gravity, one in which the concept of distance is defined by the phase of a quantum mechanical wavefunction. It even predicted black holes. But—and this is a very big but—the theory could only be true in a hypothetical one-dimensional universe that’s shaped like a ring, in other words a world nothing at all like the three-dimensional one in which you and I live, pay taxes, and die.</p><p>    我们编写的纸张确实肉体的量子重力的一致理论，其中距离的概念由量子机械波形的相位限定。它甚至预测了黑洞。但是 - 这是一个非常大的但是 - 这个理论只能在一个假设的一维宇宙中是真的，它形状像一个戒指，换句话说，世界上没有像你和我住的三维之一，纳税，死亡。</p><p>  What we’d created is called a “toy model”: an exact solution to an approximate version of an actual problem. This, I learned, is what becomes of a colossal conundrum like quantum gravity after 70-plus years of failed attempts to solve it. All the frontal attacks and obvious ideas have been tried. Every imaginable path has hit a dead end. Therefore researchers retreat, set up camp, and start building tools to help them attempt more indirect routes. Toy models are such tools. Rajeev’s river almost certainly didn’t run to The Grail. The hope was that some side stream of one of its many tributaries (Virasoro, Yamabe …) would.</p><p>  我们创建的是什么称为“玩具模型”：一个完全的解决方案，对实际问题的近似版本。我学会了这一点，它是在70多年的尝试失败尝试后的量子重力等巨大的难题是什么。所有的正面攻击和明显的想法都已尝试过。每一个可想到的路径都达到了死胡同。因此，研究人员撤退，设置营地，并开始构建工具，以帮助他们尝试更多的间接路线。玩具型号是这样的工具。 Rajeev的河流几乎肯定没有跑到Grail。希望是它众多支流之一的一些侧面流（Virasoro，Yamabe ......）。</p><p>  Actually that was my hope, not Rajeev’s. Rajeev, I believe, just liked doing the math. The thing was a puzzle he could solve, so he solved it. For him that was enough.</p><p>  实际上，这是我的希望，而不是rajeev。 rajeev，我相信，只是喜欢做数学。事情是他可以解决的难题，所以他解决了它。对他来说足够了。</p><p>      One morning in 1907, Einstein gazed out his Swiss Patent Office window at the skyline of Bern and imagined what it would feel like to fall off a roof.  Weightless was his answer, and that rapturous realization led him to the general theory of relativity and its radical reinterpretation of gravity as a consequence of curved spacetime.</p><p>      一天早上在1907年，爱因斯坦在伯尔尼的天际线上凝视着他的瑞士专利局窗外，想象着它觉得掉落的东西。摇摇欲坠的是他的答案，而狂热的实现使他引起了弯曲时空的曲法的一般相对论及其激进重复性。</p><p>  That was one of the stories that had inspired me into physics, a view from 150,000 feet of the high country, in all of its awe-inspiring, albeit hazy, glory. The idea that one could discover something deep about the universe by making a slightly offbeat observation about an ordinary occurrence. The possibility that I, too, might one day look out a window and see a path to The Grail.</p><p>  这是一个让我感受到物理学的故事之一，从高中的150,000英尺的景色，虽然令人敬畏，虽然朦胧，荣耀。通过对普通发生的略微观察来说，人们可以通过略微进一步观察来发现一些关于宇宙的事情。我也可能有一天看一个窗户并看到一条窗外的路径。</p><p>  Galileo called the universe a “great book,” that’s written in the “language of mathematics.” Einstein said he wanted to know the “thoughts of God.”  Wow. It was statements like those that fed my hope that I’d one day read the universe like prose and discover whatever fundamental ingredients and eternal rules undergird its ever-shifting surface. And that maybe, just maybe, the answers to the “What?” and the “How?” might even give a clue to the “Why?”</p><p>  伽利略叫宇宙是一个“很棒的书”，写着“数学语言”。爱因斯坦说，他想知道“上帝的想法”。哇。这是一种陈述，就像那些喂我希望我有一天的希望像散文一样阅读宇宙，发现任何基本原料和永恒的规则底部的膨胀。也许，也许，也许，“什么？”的答案和“怎么样？”甚至可能给出“为什么？”的线索 </p><p>  It was fuzzy logic like that—and, of course, dreams of explorer glory—that brought me to Rochester. But those fantasies started drying up quick under the heat lamp of research with Rajeev and of having my expectations of enlightenment adjusted by our work and by the tales Rajeev told of his own physics heroes.</p><p>这是模糊的逻辑，就像那样 - 当然，梦想荣耀的梦想 - 让我到罗彻斯特。但是，这些幻想开始在Rajeev研究的研究热灯下快速干燥，并在我们的工作和Tales Rajeev讲述他自己的物理英雄的观点来看。</p><p>  One was William Hamilton, a 19th-century Irish physicist whose big contribution wasn’t a new theory but instead a new mathematical formulation of an old theory, Newton’s laws of motion. Hamilton’s math managed to make all the same predictions as Newton’s, but without the need for Newton’s notion of force. I was struck by the wrinkle this revealed in Galileo’s great book metaphor. If the universe was really a book written in math, I thought, then different mathematical descriptions of the same physical phenomenon should just be a simple matter of translation, like going from French to Greek; the fundamental ingredients of the universe wouldn’t change, only their names would.</p><p>  一个是威廉·汉密尔顿，这是一个19世纪的爱尔兰物理学家，其重要贡献不是一个新的理论，而是旧理论的新数学制定，而是旧理论，牛顿的议案法。汉密尔顿的数学设法使所有与牛顿的预测相同，但无需牛顿的危险概念。在伽利略的伟大的书籍隐喻中，我被皱纹所震撼。如果宇宙真的是一本在数学写的书，我想，那么同样的物理现象的不同数学描述应该只是翻译的简单问题，就像从法国人到希腊语;宇宙的基本成分不会改变，只有他们的名字。</p><p>  But Hamilton’s discovery helped me see that that’s not the way physics really works. Instead, different mathematical descriptions describe the world in terms of fundamentally  different things. Newton’s description includes force. Hamilton’s doesn’t. That wasn’t just translation; that was different characters and a different plot.</p><p>  但汉密尔顿的发现帮助我看到，这不是物理真正有效的方式。相反，不同的数学描述在根本不同的事情方面描述了世界。牛顿的描述包括武力。汉密尔顿没有。这不仅仅是翻译;这是不同的角色和不同的情节。</p><p>  I saw the same in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger formulation of the theory, for example, describes reality in terms of an entity called a wavefunction that undulates through space and collapses to a point whenever it’s observed. The Feynman formulation describes it in terms of strangely schizophrenic particles that somehow take every possible path when t</p><p>  在量子力学中，我看到了相同的。例如，理论的Schröddinger制定理论描述了一种称为驱动器的实体的现实，这些实体通过空间波动并在观察到的时间点折叠到一个点。 Feynman制剂在奇怪的精神分裂症粒子方面描述了它，以某种方式采取所有可能的路径</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-physics">https://nautil.us/issue/43/heroes/what-does-any-of-this-have-to-do-with-physics</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/物理/">#物理</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/physics/">#physics</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/rajeev/">#rajeev</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
