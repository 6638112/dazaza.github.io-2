The genius detective L attempts to track him down with analysis and trickery, and ultimately succeeds.  Death Note is almost a thought-experiment-given the perfect murder weapon, how can you screw up anyway? I consider the various steps of L’s process from the perspective of computer security, cryptography, and information theory, to quantify Light’s initial anonymity and how L gradually de-anonymizes him, and consider which mistake was the largest as follows:</p><p>在漫画死亡票据中，主角轻的Yagami被赋予了超自然的武器“死亡票据”，可以根据需要杀死任何人，并开始使用它来重塑世界。 Genius侦探l试图通过分析和诡计跟踪他，最终成功。死亡票据几乎是一个思考实验 - 鉴于完美的谋杀武器，无论如何，你怎么能搞砸？我考虑了L'S过程的各个步骤，从计算机安全，加密和信息理论的角度来，量化光的初始匿名性以及如何逐渐脱离他，并考虑哪个错误最大，如下所示：</p><p> Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is impossibly precise and something profoundly anomalous is going on. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. Whatever the bogus justification may be, this is a major victory for his opponents. (To deter criminals and villains, it is not necessary for there to be a globally-known single anomalous or supernatural killer, when it would be equally effective to arrange for all the killings to be done naturalistically by ordinary mechanisms such as third parties/ police/ judiciary or used indirectly as parallel construction to crack cases.)</p><p> 通过心脏病发作杀死并不只是让他早期可见，但死亡揭示了他的暗杀方法是不可能的精确性，并且正在进行深刻的异常情况。 L已经消除了基拉存在。无论义齿的理由如何，这是对手的主要胜利。 （为了阻止犯罪分子和恶棍，当一个全球知名的单个异常或超自然杀手不需要，当时安排所有杀戮都是通过第三方/警察等普通机制来分析的所有杀戮/司法机构或间接使用作为平行构建以裂缝案例。）</p><p> Worse, the deaths are non-random in other ways—they tend to occur at particular times!</p><p> 更糟糕的是，死亡在其他方面是非随机的 - 它们倾向于在特定时间发生！</p><p> Light’s third mistake was reacting to the blatant provocation of Lind L. Tailor.</p><p> Light的第三个错误是对Lind L. Tymor的公然挑衅作出反应。</p><p> Taking the bait let L narrow his target down to 1⁄3 the original Japanese population, for a gain of ~1.6 bits. 4. Light’s fourth mistake was to use confidential police information stolen using his policeman father’s credentials.</p><p> 采取诱饵让L L让L缩小到原来的日本人口1/3，获得〜1.6位。 4.光的第四个错误是使用他的警察父亲的凭据用机密警察信息被盗。</p><p> This mistake was the largest in bits lost. This mistake cost him 11 bits of anonymity; in other words, this mistake cost him twice what his scheduling cost him and almost 8 times the murder of Tailor! 5. Killing Ray Penbar and the   team.</p><p> 这个错误是丢失的比特中最大的错误。这个错误花费了他11位匿名;换句话说，这个错误让他两倍于他的安排成本和谋杀裁定的近8次！ 5.杀死射线笔和团队。</p><p> If we assume Penbar was tasked 200 leads out of the 10,000, then murdering him and the fiancee dropped Light just 6 bits or a little over half the fourth mistake and comparable to the original scheduling mistake. 6. Endgame: At this point in the plot, L resorts to direct measures and enters Light’s life directly, enrolling at the university, with Light unable to perfectly play the role of innocent under intense in-person surveillance.</p><p> 如果我们假设Penbar被任务为200，那么谋杀他和未婚妻队的光明只有6位或者略微超过第四个错误，并与原始调度错误相当。 6.最终名称：在情节的这一点上，L Restres直接指导措施并直接进入Light的生活，招募大学，光线无法完全发挥无辜的激烈监视。 </p><p> From that point on, Light is screwed as he is now playing a deadly game of “Mafia” with L &amp; the investigative team. He frittered away &gt;25 bits of anonymity and then L intuited the rest and suspected him all along.</p><p>从那时起，光线被搞砸，因为他现在正在玩L＆amp的“黑手党”的致命游戏;调查团队。他爆发了逃离了; 25位匿名，然后我彻底主而不见，并疑虑了他。</p><p> Finally, I suggest how Light could have most effectively employed the Death Note and limited his loss of anonymity. In an appendix, I discuss the maximum amount of information leakage possible from using a Death Note as a communication device.</p><p> 最后，我建议光线如何最有效地雇用死亡记录并限制他对匿名的丧失。在附录中，我讨论使用死亡笔记作为通信设备的最大信息泄漏量。</p><p> (Note: This essay assumes a familiarity with the early plot of    and  . If you are unfamiliar with DN, see my   Death Note Ending essay or consult   or  read the DN rules⁠.)</p><p> （注意：本文致熟悉早期情节。如果您不熟悉DN，请参阅我的死亡笔记结束文章或咨询或阅读DN规则¶。）</p><p> I have called the protagonist of  Death Note, Light Yagami, “hubristic” and said he made big mistakes. So I ought to explain what he did wrong and how he could do better.</p><p> 我称之为死亡票据的主角，轻的yagami，“洪水道”，并说他犯了大错误。所以我应该解释他做错了什么以及他如何做得更好。</p><p> While Light starts scheming and taking serious risks as early as the arrival of the   team in Japan, he has fundamentally already screwed up. L should never have gotten that close to Light. The Death Note kills flawlessly without forensic trace and over arbitrary distances;  Death Note is almost a thought-experiment—given the  perfect murder weapon, how can you screw up  anyway?</p><p> 虽然光线开始策划并早起的风险早在日本的抵达时，他从根本上搞砸了。 L永远不应该靠近光。死亡票据完美无瑕地杀死，没有法医迹线和任意距离;死亡票据几乎是一个思考实验 - 鉴于完美的谋杀武器，无论如何，你怎么能搞砸？</p><p> Some of the other Death Note users highlight the problem. The user in the   carries out the normal executions, but  also kills a number of prominent competitors. The killings directly point to the Yotsuba Group and eventually the user’s death. The moral of the story is that indirect relationships can be fatal in narrowing down the possibilities from ‘everyone’ to ‘these 8 men’.</p><p> 一些其他死亡笔记用户突出了问题。用户在执行正常执行情况下，也杀死了许多突出的竞争对手。杀戮直接指向Yotsuba集团，最终是用户的死亡。故事的寓意是，间接关系可能是造成的，因为缩小“每个人”到“这8个人”的可能性。</p><p> In Light’s case, L starts with the world’s entire population of 7 billion people and needs to narrow it down to 1 person. It’s a search problem. It maps fairly directly onto basic  ⁠, in fact. (See also  Simulation inferences⁠,  The 3 Grenades⁠, and for case studies in applied deanonymization,  Tor  -related arrests, 2011–2015⁠.) To uniquely specify one item out of 7 billion, you need 33 bits of information because log 2(7000000000) ≈ 32.7; to use an analogy, your 32-bit computer can only address one unique location in memory out of  4 billion locations, and adding another bit doubles the capacity to &gt;8 billion. Is 33 bits of information a lot?</p><p> 在轻的情况下，L从世界整个人口突出70亿人口，需要将其缩小到1人。这是一个搜索问题。事实上，它将相当直接映射到基本⁠上。 （另见模拟推论¶，3个手榴弹率，以及应用Deanymation的3个案例研究，Tor -Related逮捕，2011-2015⁠。）为了独特地指定超过70亿的一项，您需要33位信息，因为日志2 （7000000000）≈22.7;要使用类比，您的32位计算机只能在内存中解决一个独特的位置，在40亿个位置，并添加另一个位的容量加倍，＆gt; 80亿。 33位信息很多？ </p><p> Not really. L could get one bit just by looking at history or crime statistics, and noting that mass murderers are, to an astonishing degree,  male  1⁠, thereby ruling out half the world population and actually starting L off with a requirement to obtain only 32 bits to break Light’s anonymity.  2 If Death Note users were sufficiently rational &amp; knowledgeable, they could draw on concepts like   to acausally cooperate  3 to avoid this information leakage… by arranging to pass on Death Notes to females  4 to restore a 50:50 gender ratio—for example, if for every female who obtained a Death note there were 3 males with Death Notes, then all users could roll a 1d3 dice and if 1 keep it and if 2 or 3 pass it on to someone of the opposite gender.</p><p>并不真地。我可以通过查看历史或犯罪统计数据来获得一点，并注意到大规模杀人犯是一种惊人的程度，男性1⁠，从而裁定了世界人口的一半，实际上是要求只有32位的要求开始打破光的匿名。 2如果死亡说明用户足够理性和amp;知识渊博，他们可以借鉴概念，即协调3，避免这种信息泄漏......通过安排将死亡笔记传递给女性4来恢复50:50的性别比例 - 例如，如果每个女性在那里获得死亡票据是3个男性死亡笔记，然后所有用户都可以滚动1d3骰子，如果1保持它，如果2或3将其传递给相反的性别的某人。</p><p> We should first point out that Light is always going to leak  some bits. The only way he could remain perfectly hidden is to not use the Death Note at all. If you change the world in even the slightest way, then you have leaked information about yourself in principle. Everything is connected in some sense; you cannot magically wave away the existence of fire without creating a cascade of consequences that result in  every living thing dying⁠. For example, the fundamental point of Light executing criminals is to  shorten their lifespan—there’s no way to hide that. You can’t both shorten their lives and  not shorten their lives. He is going to reveal himself this way, at the least, to the actuaries and statisticians.</p><p> 我们首先要指出，光线总是会泄漏一些比特。他可以保持完美隐藏的唯一方法是根本不使用死亡票据。如果您甚至最轻微的方式更改世界，那么您原则上泄露了有关自己的信息。一切都在某种意义上连接;你不能神奇地摆脱火的存在，而不会产生导致每个生物染色的级联后果。例如，执行罪犯的光的基本点是缩短他们的寿命 - 没有办法隐藏。你不能缩短他们的生活，而不是缩短他们的生活。至少，他将以这种方式透露自己的精算和统计学家。</p><p> More historically, this has been a challenge for cryptographers, like in  : how did they exploit the Enigma &amp; other communications without revealing they had done so? Their solution was misdirection:  ⁠, like search planes that ‘just happened’ to find German submarines or leaks to   about there being undiscovered spies. (However, the famous story that Winston Churchill allowed the town of Coventry to be bombed rather than risk the secret of Ultra has  ⁠.) This worked in part because of German overconfidence, because the war did not last too long, and in part because each cover story was plausible on its own and no one was, in the chaos of war, able to see the whole picture and realize that there were  too many lucky search planes and too many undiscoverable moles; eventually, however, someone would realize, and apparently some Germans did conclude that Enigma had to have been broken (but much too late). It’s not clear to me what would be the best misdirection for Light to mask his normal killings—use the Death Note’s control features to invent a anti-criminal terrorist organization?</p><p> 历史上，这对加密人士来说是一个挑战，就像：他们是如何利用谜和amp的？其他通信没有揭示他们这样做了？他们的解决方案是误导：⁠，像搜索飞机一样，“刚刚发生”，找到德国潜艇或泄漏到没有被发现的间谍。 （然而，Winston Churchill的着名故事让Coventry镇被轰炸而不是冒险超越的秘密。）这部分原因是德国过度自信，因为战争没有持续太长，部分是因为每个封面故事都是合理的，没有人在战争中，能够看到整个画面，并意识到有太多的幸运搜索飞机和太多的痣;然而，最终有人会意识到，显然有些德国人确实得出结论，谜团必须被破坏（但太晚了）。这对我来说是什么是最佳误导掩盖他的正常杀戮的最佳误导 - 使用死亡票据的控制特征来发明反犯罪恐怖组织？</p><p> So there is a real challenge here: one party is trying to infer as much as possible from observed effects, and the other is trying to minimize how much the former can observe while not stopping entirely. How well does Light balance the competing demands?</p><p> 因此，这里有一个真正的挑战：一方试图尽可能地从观察到的效果推断出来，另一方试图尽量减少前者在没有完全停止的时候可以观察到多少。轻盈平衡竞争需求的程度如何？</p><p> However, he can try to reduce the leakage and make his   as large as possible. For example, killing every criminal with a heart attack is a dead give-away. Criminals do not die of heart attacks that often. (The point is more dramatic if you replace ‘heart attack’ with ‘lupus’; as we all know, in real life it’s never lupus.) Heart attacks are a subset of all deaths, and by restricting himself, Light makes it easier to detect his activities. 1000 deaths of lupus are a blaring red alarm; 1000 deaths of heart attacks are an oddity; and 1000 deaths distributed over the statistically likely suspects of cancer and heart disease etc. are almost invisible (but still noticeable in principle).</p><p> 然而，他可以尝试减少泄漏并尽可能大。例如，用心脏病发作杀死每一个罪犯都是死亡的。犯罪分子不会常常死于心脏病发作。 （那点是更戏剧性的，如果你用'Lupus'取代'心脏病发作';众所周知，在现实生活中，它就不是狼疮。）心脏病发作是所有死亡的子集，通过限制自己，光使它更容易检测他的活动。狼疮的1000个死亡是一个呈红色警报; 1000个心脏病发作的死亡是一种奇怪的态度;在统计上可能的癌症和心脏病的嫌疑嫌疑人的1000人死亡几乎是看不见的（但原则上仍然明显）。</p><p> So, Light’s fundamental mistake is to kill in ways unrelated to his goal. Killing through heart attacks does not just make him visible early on, but the deaths reveals that his assassination method is supernaturally precise. L has been tipped off that Kira exists. Whatever the bogus justification may be, this is a major victory for his opponents.</p><p> 所以，光的根本错误是以与他的目标无关的方式杀死。通过心脏病发作杀死并不只是让他早期可见，但死亡表明，他的暗杀方法是超自然的精确性。 L已经消除了基拉存在。无论义齿的理由如何，这是对手的主要胜利。</p><p> First mistake, and a classic one of serial killers (eg the  ’s vaunting was less anonymous than he believed): delusions of grandeur and the desire to taunt, play with, and control their victims and demonstrate their power over the general population. From a literary perspective, this similarity is clearly not an accident, as we are meant to read Light as the  Sociopath  Hero archetype: his ultimate downfall is the consequence of his  ⁠,  ⁠, particularly in the original sadistic sense. Light  cannot help but self-sabotage like this.</p><p> 第一个错误，以及一个经典的连续杀手之一（例如，vaunting比他相信的匿名不那么匿名）：妄想妄想和嘲笑，玩耍，并控制他们的受害者并展示他们对普通人口的权力。从文学的角度来看，这种相似性显然不是一个事故，因为我们本来应该读到SocioPath英雄原型：他的终极垮台是他的⁠，⁠，特别是在原始虐待狂的后果。光不禁自我破坏这样的自我破坏。 </p><p> (This is also deeply problematic from the point of carrying out Light’s theory of deterrence: to deter criminals and villains, it is not necessary for there to be a globally-known single supernatural killer, when it would be equally effective to arrange for all the killings to be done naturalistically by third parties/ police/ judiciary or used indirectly to crack cases. Arguably the deterrence would be more effective the more diffused it’s believed to be—since a single killer has a finite lifespan, finite knowledge, fallibility, and idiosyncratic preferences which reduce the threat and connection to criminality, while if all the deaths were ascribed to unusually effective police or detectives, this would be inferred as a general increase in all kinds of police competence, one which will not instantly disappear when one person gets bored or hit by a bus.)</p><p>（这也是从举行灯光的威慑的角度来深入有问题：阻止犯罪分子和恶棍，在那里有一个全球知名的单身超自然杀手，当它同样有效地安排所有杀戮，由第三方/警察/司法机构自然地完成或间接地用于破解案件。可以说，威慑将更有效地更有效，它被认为是 - 因为单个杀手具有有限的寿命，有限的知识，可变性和特殊减少威胁和与犯罪联系的偏好，而如果所有的死亡归因于异常有效的警察或侦探，这将被推断为各种警察能力的一般增加，当一个人感到无聊时，这将不会立即消失或者由公共汽车击中。）</p><p> Worse, the deaths are non-random in other ways—they tend to occur at particular times! Graphed, daily patterns jump out.</p><p> 更糟糕的是，死亡在其他方面是非随机的 - 它们倾向于在特定时间发生！绘制，每日模式跳出来。</p><p> L was able to narrow down the active times of the presumable student or worker to a particular range of longitude, say 125–150° out of 180°; and what country is most prominent in that range? Japan. So that cut down the 7 billion people to around 0.128 billion; 0.128 billion requires 27 bits (log 2 (128000000) ≈ 26.93) so just the scheduling of deaths cost Light 6 bits of anonymity!</p><p> l能够缩小可推定的学生或工人的活动时间，以特定的经度范围，例如180°的125-150°;在该范围内最突出的国家是哪个国家？日本。因此，将70亿人减少到大约1280亿; 0.128亿需要27位（日志2（128000000）≈26.93）因此，死亡的调度成本低6位匿名！</p><p> On a side-note, some might be skeptical that one can infer much of anything from the graph and that  Death Note was just glossing over this part. “How can anyone infer that it was someone living in Japan just from 2 clumpy lines at morning and evening in Japan?” But actually, such a graph is surprisingly precise. I learned this years before I watched  Death Note, when I was heavily active on Wikipedia; often I would wonder if two editors were the same person or roughly where an editor lived. What I would do if their edits or user page did not reveal anything useful is I would go to “Kate’s  ” and I would examine the times of day all their hundreds or thousands of edits were made at. Typically, what one would see was ~4 hours where there were no edits whatsoever, then ~4 hours with moderate to high activity, a trough, then another gradual rise to 8 hours later and a further decline down to the first 4 hours of no activity. These periods quite clearly corresponded to sleep (pretty much everyone is asleep at 4  ), morning, lunch &amp; work hours, evening, and then night with people occasionally staying up late and editing  5⁠. There was noise, of course, from people staying up especially late or getting in a bunch of editing during their workday or occasionally traveling, but the overall patterns were clear—never did I discover that someone was actually a nightwatchman and my guess was an entire hemisphere off. (Academic estimates based on user editing patterns correlate well with what is predicted by on the basis of the geography of IP edits.  6)</p><p> 在一个方面，有些人可能是持怀疑态度，即人们可以从图中推断出大部分内容，并且死亡笔记只是在这部分上光泽。 “怎样才能推断它是在日本早上和晚上在日本生活在日本的人？”但实际上，这样的图表令人惊讶地精确。我在我看着死亡笔记之前了解到这几年，当我对维基百科有很大活跃;通常我会想知道两位编辑是否是同一个人或者粗略的人。如果他们的编辑或用户页面没有透露任何有用的东西，我会做什么，我会去“凯特”，我会检查一下的一天，所有数百或数千个编辑都是在做的。通常，一个人会看到的是〜4小时，没有任何编辑，然后〜4小时与中度至高活动，一个槽，然后另一个逐渐上升到8小时后，进一步下降到没有的前4小时活动。这些时期非常清楚地与睡眠（几乎每个人在4岁时睡着了），早晨，午餐＆amp;工作时间，晚上，然后晚上偶尔熬夜和编辑5¼。当然，有噪音，从工作日或偶尔旅行期间熬夜或进入一堆编辑，但整体模式都很清楚，我发现有人真的是一个噩梦，我的猜测是整个半球关闭。 （基于用户编辑模式的学术估计与基于IP编辑地理所预测的内容相关。6）</p><p> Computer security research offers more scary results.

TAMER广播，批评KIRA和LIGHT OUT以使用清晰可见的名称＆amp;面对杀死Lind L. Tymor。直播是一种公然的试图挑起反应 - 任何反应 - 从惊讶＆amp;毫无准备的光线，而且单独应该是简单地忽略它的充分理由（即使光无法合理地知道它是陷阱的方式）：一个人永远不应该做一个敌人想要在地上做的事情和amp;条款＆amp;敌人准备的时间。 （光有选择在未来随时使用死亡笔记，这几乎与在直播期间这样做的人的力量展示。） </p><p> Running the broadcast in 1 region was also a gamble &amp; a potential mistake on L’s part; he had no real reason to think Light was in   (or if he did already have priors/ information to that effect, he should’ve been bisecting Kanto) and should have arranged for it to be broadcast to exactly half of Japan’s population, obtaining an expected maximum of 1 bit. But it was one that paid off; he narrowed his target down to 1⁄3 the original Japanese population, for a gain of ~1.6 bits. (You can see it was a gamble by considering if Light had been outside Kanto; since he would not see it live, he would not have reacted, and all L would learn is that his suspect was in that other 2⁄3 of the population, for a gain of only ~0.3 bits.)</p><p>在1个地区运行广播也是赌博＆amp; L'S部分的潜在错误;他没有真正的理由思考光线（或者如果他已经有了那件前锋/信息，他应该一直在分别为Kanto），并应该安排在日本人口的一半以上广播，获得预计最多1位。但这是一个偿还的;他将目标缩小到原始日本人口的1/3，获得〜1.6位的增长。 （如果考虑光已经在Kanto以外，你可以看到它是一个赌博;因为他不会看到它，他不会做出反应，而且我都会学到他的嫌疑人在那个人口中的其他2/3 ，只有〜0.3位的增益。）</p><p> But even this wasn’t a  huge mistake. He lost 6 bits to his schedule of killing, and lost another 1.6 bits to temperamentally killing Lind L. Tailor, but since the male population of Kanto is 21.5 million (43 million total), he still has ~24 bits of anonymity left (log 2 (21500000) ≈ 24.36). That’s not too terrible, and the loss is mitigated even further by other details of this mistake, as pointed out by  Zmflavius⁠; specifically, that unlike “being male” or “being Japanese”, the information about being in Kanto is subject to  decay, since people move around all the time for all sorts of reasons:</p><p> 但即使这不是一个巨大的错误。他对他的杀戮时间表失去了6位，并失去了另外1.6位的热身杀死Lind L. Tymor，但由于Kanto的男性人口为2150万（共4300万），他仍然留下了〜24位匿名留下了左侧2（21500000）≈24.36）。这不是太可怕，甚至通过这个错误的其他细节进一步减轻了损失，如Zmflaviusō所指出的;具体来说，与“是男性”或“日语”不同，关于在凯托的信息受到腐烂，因为人们一直在各种原因移动：</p><p> …quite possibly Light’s biggest mistake was inadvertently revealing his connection to the police hierarchy by hacking his dad’s computer. Whereas even the Lind L. Taylor debacle only revealed his killing mechanics and narrowed him down to “someone in the Kanto region” (which is, while an impressive accomplishment based on the information he had, entirely meaningless for actually finding a suspect), there were perhaps a few hundred people who had access to the information Light’s dad had. There’s also the fact that L  knew that Light was probably someone in their late teens, meaning that there was an extremely high chance that at the end of the school year, even that coup of his would expire, thanks to students heading off to university all over Japan (of course, Light went to  ⁠, and a student of his caliber not attending such a university would be suspicious, but L had no way of knowing that then). I mean, perhaps L had hoped that Kira would reveal himself by suddenly moving away from the Kanto region, but come the next May, he would have no way of monitoring unusual movements among late teenagers, because a large percentage of them would be moving for legitimate reasons.</p><p> ......通过黑客攻击他的父亲的电脑，有可能是光明的最大的错误，无意中透露他与警察层次结构的联系。而甚至Lind L. Taylor崩溃只会透露他的杀戮力学，并将他缩小到“卡托地区的某人”（这是一个令人印象深刻的成就，而基于他所拥有的信息，完全毫无意义地发现嫌疑人）也许是有几百人可以访问信息灯的爸爸。还有情况下，我知道光可能在青少年的时候可能是有人，这意味着在学年结束时，甚至他的职位将会到期，感谢学生到大学的学生来在日本（当然，Light To♥，他的口径没有参加这样的大学的学生将是可疑的，但我没有办法知道那么）。我的意思是，我希望基拉将突然远离卡托地区揭示自己，但下一个五月，他将无法监督迟到的青少年之间的不寻常运动，因为他们的大量是他们的百分比将会搬家合理的原因。</p><p> (One could still run the inference “backwards” on any particular person to verify they were in Kanto in the right time period, but as time passes, it becomes less possible to run the inference “forwards” and only examine people in Kanto.)</p><p> （一个人仍然可以在任何特定的人身上经营推断“向后”，以验证它们在合适的时间段，但随着时间的推移，运行推理“前进”并只检查Kanto的人。）</p><p> This mistake also shows us that the important thing that information theory buys us, really, is not the  bit (we could be using log 10 rather than log 2, and compares   rather than “bits”) so much as comparing events in the plot on a  logarithmic scale. If we simply looked at how the absolute number of how many people were ruled out at each step, we’d conclude that the first mi</p><p> 这个错误还向我们展示了信息理论为我们购买的重要事项，真的不是那么（我们可以使用Log 10而不是日志2，并比较绘图中的事件的比较而不是“比特”）。对数标度。如果我们只是看着每一步都排除了多少人的绝对数量，我们得出结论是第一个MI</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity">https://www.gwern.net/Death-Note-Anonymity</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/注意/">#注意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/note/">#note</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/死亡/">#死亡</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
