If we\u2019re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it\u2019ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on  what a metaverse is.\n This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at  CES. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering \u2014 but each another step in the progression.\n  (* the one potential meteor strike, of course, being if Apple does what it loves to do and swoops in late, drops its version and turns the category on its head. That\u2019s been the rumor \u00a0for a while now.)\n    We\u2019ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light \u201cWe\u2019re working on it!\u201d announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn\u2019t shared many specifics.\n  They\u2019re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what\u2019s now officially known  as the PS VR2. Such as:\n It\u2019ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.\n  It\u2019ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.\n It\u2019ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever\u2019s in the center of your vision.\n They\u2019re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5\u2019s mind-bending adaptive triggers.\n  What\u2019ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the  Oculus Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it\u2019s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.\n   What\u2019s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your  hand the controller, instead?\n Hand tracking isn\u2019t a brand new idea, of course. Companies  have come and gone with hand tracking as their primary focus.\n But HTC\u2019s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can\u2019t see \u2014 like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you\u2019ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.\n The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it\u2019ll only work with HTC\u2019s Vive Focus 3 headset.\n   VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they\u2019re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?\n Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an \u201cultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution\u201d headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3\u2033 (2560\u00d72560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don\u2019t expect to move around  too much in these ones \u2014 you\u2019ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.\n    Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm\u2019s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)\n   It\u2019s not flashy hardware, but it\u2019s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.\n  Omniverse is Nvidia\u2019s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It\u2019s the company\u2019s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.\n   This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so \u2026 well, don\u2019t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. \u201cHolographic optical waveguide technology\u201d pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:18:39", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ar,vr", "title": "VR\u548cAR\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728CES 2022\u7168", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tVR and AR continue to simmer at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/vr-and-ar-continue-to-simmer-at-ces-2022/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ar", "vr"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7f5397905636e5537b23df747befac7e.jpg", "infoid": 1072517, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5e74\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u4e09\u661f\u9884\u7b97\u65d7\u8230\u548c\u4ece\u5e76\u884c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u65b0onlyplus\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9884\u89c8\uff1f\u5f53\u7136\uff0cLG\u548cHTC  - \u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u90fd\u6ca1\u6709\u5f97\u5230\u5e2e\u52a9 - \u8981\u4e48\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u534e\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u5c55\u4f1a\u4e0a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u51e0\u5e74\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f88\u5feb\u53c2\u52a0CES\u3002\n\u558a\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u914d\u4ef6\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u522b\u7684\uff0canker\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u672c; $ 220\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u89c6\u9891\u680f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c2K\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5185\u7f6e\u706f\u5854\u548c\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f1a\u66ff\u6362\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u6216\u8005\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4ef6\u7269\uff0c\u86cb\u767d\u77f3\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u63d2\u5934\u548c\u64ad\u653e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\uff09\u4fbf\u5b9c\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c6\u9891\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "note_en": "This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren\u2019t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC \u2014 which were both involved in the show in some form \u2014 are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won\u2019t be participating in CES any time soon.\n Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they\u2019re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the  Martian metaverse. Certainly the show kept  Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week.\n  CES continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren\u2019t as many phones as there once were. It\u2019s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It\u2019s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness \u2014 the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there\u2019s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.\n  At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the  Vivomove Sport is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.\n Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags. This year the former got another PC partner, in Lenovo, as the  ThinkPad X1 got Tile tracking support, allowing users to find their lost laptop for up to 14 days, even when powered down. Targus, meanwhile, built Apple\u2019s Find My support directly into  its latest backpack.\n   But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of  CARD. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I\u2019d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.\n  Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole  what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild \u2014 especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you\u2019re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link\u2019s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?\n  Shout-out to what\u2019s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you  the Video Bar, which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It\u2019s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it\u2019s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.\n  Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES\u2019s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at  Labrador\u2019s system this week, however, because it addresses a very real need \u2014 specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.\n  It\u2019s not CES without fun new form factors, and the  Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What\u2019s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I\u2019m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we\u2019ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.\n  Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year.

It\u2019s Friday and the snow is falling like the dickens in my neck of the woods. But it was no snow day in the tech world. Not at  all. In fact, one venture firm raised 10 figures of capital today. Can you guess who?\n Before we jump in, today\u2019s TechCrunch staff highlight is  Grace Mendenhall, a member of  the Equity team who is also a documentary film editor. And she\u2019s frankly just the best. Now, the news! \u2014 Alex\n   a16z reloads with $9B in new capital: \u00a0The venture capital money arms race continued this week with news that Andreessen Horowitz has put together $9 billion to invest in venture deals, growth deals and biotech more specifically. As TechCrunch notes, the resulting dollar figure is a boost on the group\u2019s last trio of similar funds. There is, it appears, an infinite capital appetite in today\u2019s startup market.\n Roblox pulls Chinese app: \u00a0Five months after launching with Tencent in China, Roblox\u2019s LuoBuLeSi was taken down. What happened? It may be that Roblox has some work to do on the data side of its service, something that it hinted at in a statement. Regardless, the move is yet another example of how hard it is for non-Chinese companies to build and sell digital products in the country.\n India to investigate Google:\u00a0In the wake of industry complaints from news groups, India\u2019s Competition Commission \u201csaid Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws,\u201d TechCrunch reports. Given how big and lucrative the Indian market is, this is not good news for Mountain View.\n  Before we jump into all the startup news of the day, TechCrunch has a little treat for you. We got veteran venture capitalist Matt Murphy on the phone as 2021 came to a close  to chat about prior tech booms, prior tech busts and what he sees as the strengths and weaknesses of today\u2019s venture game. It\u2019s a great weekend read.\n  Pendulum raises $5.9M for narrative tracking:\u00a0This is a fun one, as the company\u2019s target market is utterly new to me. Per our reporting, Pendulum \u201chelps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.\u201d I guess you and I currently do this by reading lots of tweets, but seeing a company build software for it makes good sense.\n Peter Reinhardt leaves Twilio: \u00a0Remember when Twilio bought Segment for $3.2 billion? It also bought Segment\u2019s CEO, Peter Reinhardt, as part of the deal. Now, however, the exec is leaving to \u201cbe full-time CEO at Charm Industrial, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018,\u201d Ron Miller reports. I can\u2019t quite connect  charm and  carbon, but we\u2019ll keep an eye out for what the startup does next.\n Avataar raises $45M for \u201clife-sized 3D product evaluation\u201d: No, this is not \u201cAvatar,\u201d like the movie. It\u2019s Avataar, a U.S.- and India-based startup that helps consumers \u201cvisualize products in real-life size and feel in their living room\u201d using their phones. Given that we all want to buy more stuff online, but it\u2019s not always easy to picture a new footstool in situ, I like what the company is up to. Unsurprisingly, Avataar is working with e-commerce brands in categories like furniture.\n Bfree wants to update the irksome business of credit collections:\u00a0If you have ever gotten a call from a person who thinks that you owe them or someone that they represent money, you may have harkened back to how much more fun it was to get a root canal. Bfree, a \u201cNigerian credit management fintech,\u201d as TechCrunch puts it, is working to build something that it considers to be more ethical debt collection. The company just raised $1.7 million and is busy recruiting in 16 markets, we report.\n From the CES Beat: TechCrunch\u2019s coverage of the great consumer electronics confab continued today, with posts up on  the promises of elder tech and, well,  all things metaverse, good and bad.\n If you need  even more startup news and notes and analysis this weekend,  the Equity team has you covered.\n After talking to marketing leaders for a year, here\u2019s my advice for CEOs\n  This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you\u2019re trying to grow one \u2014 well, winter is coming.\n We\u2019ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers\u2019 growing desire for more privacy, but here\u2019s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.\n \u201cThis is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner\u2019s Annual CMO Spend Survey,\u201d the research company reported.\n Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.\n In a TechCrunch+ guest post, she covers the \u201cdownward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars\u201d and shares several strategies that are producing results \u2014 as well as some \u201ccrazy\u201d ideas \u201cthat seemed ridiculous at the time.\u201d\n (TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.  You can sign up here .)\n  Apple keeps working on its fitness product: TechCrunch has news up today regarding Apple\u2019s fitness product, the somewhat lamely named Fitness+. What\u2019s new? Collections, which we write are \u201dcurated series of workouts and meditations\u201d that are targeted at a particular goal. Also new is what\u2019s called \u201cTime to Run,\u201d an \u201caudio running experience,\u201d as we put it.\u00a0Why doesn\u2019t Apple just buy Peloton? I don\u2019t know.\n When does a Twitter Space become a podcast? \u00a0We\u2019re going to find out. Twitter is working on recording its live-audio product, called Spaces. And the social network is saying that it will include replay analytics. Which is super cool? Twitter\u2019s product team is seemingly bringing its really solid 2021 product cadence into the new year.\n And finally, from CES, a   roundup of electric mobility two-wheelers for everyone out there who lives in a city that hasn\u2019t given up its soul to provide more parking for lazy folks.\n   If you have a software consultant that you think other startup founders should know about, fill out the survey  here.\n    Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking and focused execution. We chose them for their expertise, disciplined approach and excellent work ethic. Thanks to team 91Ninjas, our inbound marketing engine has picked up good momentum.

Parr looks ahead at what\u2019s coming down the pike, including web3 and NFTs, and gives his advice on how your startup should proceed.\n Should online sellers start planning now to start stocking NFTs? Parr noted that Shopify is testing a pilot program for Shopify Plus customers that helps them sell non-fungible tokens via its platform, but he still suggests a wait-and-see approach:\n \u201cUnless you\u2019re deep in web3-land or have a large enough budget for brand experimentation, you should probably wait until the technology becomes more mature or only dip your toe in the water to start,\u201d writes Parr. \u201cA great NFT launch requires a lot more work than making a JPEG and putting it on the blockchain.\u201d\n  Marketer: Ridhi Singh, founder,  91Ninjas  Recommended by: Anish Khadiya,  itilite  Testimonial: \u201cRidhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking, and focused execution.

Since the acquisition closed earlier this year, the CEO of Auth0, Eugenio Pace, and I have come a long way in uncovering the best ways to embrace our differences, unite our teams and learn the ins and outs of each other\u2019s leadership styles.\n Our journey so far offers lessons for other CEOs navigating partnerships with a new co-CEO or other C-suite leaders post-acquisition. Here are my top takeaways from working together during the past year.\n   It\u2019s worthwhile to put pen to paper on your company\u2019s vision ahead of an acquisition \u2014 it helps you solidify your goals in writing that you can then easily share. Before our acquisition, I wrote a long paper mapping out my five-year vision for Okta. While articulating Okta\u2019s vision is a big part of my role as CEO, I had never laid it out in this type of written format (which turned out longer than I intended \u2014 15 pages!).\n The exercise allowed me to reflect on Okta\u2019s growth over the past 12-plus years and what\u2019s to come.\n  Eugenio found it helpful in understanding my viewpoint as we started the process of learning how we\u2019d best collaborate and bring our two companies together. He\u2019d actually drafted a similar document outlining his view of success if we were to join forces. These vision documents have helped us align our goals and illustrate how we intend to scale and capitalize on our massive market opportunity.\n  With any new C-suite hire or partner, it helps to build a relationship by finding common ground and shared values. Eugenio and I knew we both placed equal importance on implementing the same \u201cnorth star\u201d guidelines for the integration: sustainable growth, putting our customers first, continued innovation, protection of our brands and empowerment of our teams.\n Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.\n  Along with our mirrored core culture values, Eugenio and I share similarities in our leadership styles and personalities that complement each other. We\u2019re introverts, and we even have the same Myers-Briggs score (INTP), translating into a natural leadership chemistry. We both take accountable, dependable leadership seriously and understand each other\u2019s work styles. Eugenio has a deep product and technology background, so we\u2019re able to get really technical when discussing and making decisions about the future of our joint companies. Our shared background also enables us to effectively share and receive feedback with each other.\n Ultimately, understanding your new partner\u2019s unique style and how you\u2019re similar (and different) can help you work together more efficiently, make faster decisions and build quick momentum.\n  Acquisitions signal that a significant threshold of success has been crossed for companies on either side of the deal. To acquire or be acquired, companies must be doing  something right and it\u2019s essential to identify the strengths within both organizations that have reaped such rewards. Combining the elements of each team that fosters an overall synergy while also protecting the unique areas is key when joining forces.\n For example, Auth0\u2019s collaborative culture has already helped Okta reignite its startup spirit. It\u2019s no easy task maintaining the same scrappy energy from the early days when we were pursuing our first 10 customers (we\u2019re now over 14,000), but Auth0 has introduced a new perspective on innovation while still allowing room to retain our respective brands and individual strengths. Auth0 is a brand beloved by developers, and its remote-first nature has also helped us navigate a dynamic work environment this year. Leveraging the strengths of the acquired company helps push your growth forward in new areas.\n  In the early stages of an acquisition, success depends on intentional and frequent communication with your new partner and team. Keep meetings and check-ins frequent, both with new leaders and with your broader employee base.\n This year, we\u2019ve regularly held full company and integrated all-hands meetings, and we\u2019ve made these meetings intentional and transparent. We format the agendas around decisions we\u2019ve made, things that won\u2019t change and what\u2019s undecided as a way to keep employees in the know while staying honest about what we\u2019re still figuring out. In any acquisition, discussions on office spaces, merged benefits and team integration timelines will inevitably arise, and giving employees an open line to ask questions and share concerns goes a long way in creating clarity and building trust.\n Acquisitions can test your team\u2019s strength and threaten existing close-knit cultures, so it takes purposeful communication to keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.\n It\u2019s worth the energy spent to make the partnership successful; Eugenio and I have worked together for less than a year, and we\u2019ve already benefited greatly from each other\u2019s perspectives and background as we move forward in this next chapter.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:17:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7528\u4e8e,navigate,\u9886\u5bfc", "title": "4\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bfc\u822a\u5458\u989d\u8ffd\u52a0\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\t4 ways to navigate a post-acquisition partnership\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/4-ways-to-navigate-a-post-acquisition-partnership/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7528\u4e8e", "navigate", "\u9886\u5bfc"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d22d72d6577d5d52418fe3730db12048.jpg", "infoid": 1072513, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u597d\u5947\u7684\u65c1\u89c2\u8005\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u7684\u827a\u672f\u5bb6Danielle Baskin\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7ecf\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u670d\u7684\u6076\u4f5c\u5267\uff08\u5982\u84dd\u8272\u652f\u7968\u5bb6\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u6280\u6587\u5316\u4e2d\u5632\u7b11\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u53d8\u6210\u5b9e\u9645\u516c\u53f8\uff08\u5982\u54c1\u724c\u6c34\u679c\uff09\u3002\u5979\u5230\u8fbe\u5723\u4f55\u585e\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u5927\u697c\uff0c\u5728\u62d6\u8f66\u7684\u624b\u63d0\u7bb1\uff0c\u5356\u8d43\u7269\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6885\u5c14\uff1a\u91d1\u53d1\u5047\u53d1\uff0c\u7ea2\u8272\u53e3\u7ea2\uff0c\u9ed1\u8272\u7684\u9ad8\u9886\u548c\u8840\u6db2\u80fd\u91cf\u996e\u6599\u3002\n\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u88ab\u7092\u4f5c\u6240\u5305\u56f4 - \u50cf\u4e54\u6cbb\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5179\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u50cf\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b59\u5b50\u4e00\u6837\u5bf9\u5f85\u5979\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53\u4ed6\u5728Theranos\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b59\u5b50\u6cf0\u52d2\u00b7\u65af\u79d1\u5c14\u8328\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u6000\u7591\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u6b63\u5728\u9610\u8ff0Theranos\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7597\u6548\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u65af\u79d1\u8328\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u3002\n\u201c\u4ed6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u5728\u505a\u751f\u610f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u5b9a\u7f6a\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\uff0c\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6211\u7684\u5e73\u5eb8\u611f\u5230\u60ca\u8bb6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u8ddf\u968f\u6211\u7684\u672c\u80fd\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u201d\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af\u5728\u644a\u4f4d\u8bf4\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba9\u5979\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u798f\u5c14\u65af\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5979\u88ab\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u8001\u4f34\u4fa3\u6ee5\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u72af\u4e0b\u4e86\u6b3a\u8bc8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u662f\u771f\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5979\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u7f6a\u6b3a\u9a97\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00\u4e5f\u5bf9Theranos\u5ba2\u6237\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u663e\u7740\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e86\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "note_en": "One of those curious onlookers was  Danielle Baskin, a San Francisco-based artist who often pokes fun at tech culture through elaborate pranks (like  Blue Check Homes) that sometimes turn into actual companies (like  Branded Fruit). She arrived at the courthouse in San Jose with a suitcase in tow, selling bootleg Holmes merch: blonde wigs, red lipstick, black turtlenecks and blood energy drinks.\n In the long cold morning outside the San Jose courthouse, I vended Elizabeth Holmes costumes out of a suitcase for anyone in the trial line.  pic.twitter.com/ITaneixBu0\n It was a joke, mocking the absurdity of the fact that someone on trial for fraud has \u201cstans\u201d who call themselves \u201c Holmies.\u201d But as Baskin watched Holmes\u2019 third day of testimony, she shared a key insight about how Theranos got so out of control.\n \u201cComing out of the Holmes trial, I think one of my biggest pieces of advice to startup founders is to have friends,\u201d Baskin  tweeted after court adjourned. \u201cYou need people in your life you enjoy hanging out with that say things like \u2018lol what are you talking about\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s a bad idea\u2019 when you say weird shit.\u201d\n  In his opening statement of the case, federal prosecutor Robert Leach described how Holmes constructed a company with a $10 billion valuation based on technology that was dangerously faulty, at best. He said that one of Holmes\u2019 techniques was to rely on \u201c false and misleading\u201d media coverage of Theranos to secure funding from investors. Holmes was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes and Inc. Magazine, and she was celebrated as one of TIME\u2019s 100 Most Influential People in 2015, lauded as a \u201ctech visionary.\u201d It made sense that people believed her vision when so many powerful people and institutions said she was the next Steve Jobs.\n  \u201cWhen I was introduced to Elizabeth by [former Secretary of State] George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate\u2019s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground,\u201d Henry Kissinger  wrote in the TIME 100 blurb about Holmes. \u201cElizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference.\u201d\n Kissinger went on to call Holmes a \u201cformidable advocate\u201d who was \u201con the verge of achieving her vision.\u201d But already, a level of uncertainty bubbled around Theranos. \u201cOthers will judge the technical aspects of Theranos, but the social implications are vast,\u201d Kissinger wrote in the final line of the blurb.\n Holmes was surrounded by hype \u2014 investors like George Shultz treated her like another grandchild. So when his grandson Tyler Shultz, who worked at Theranos, told him that he suspected Holmes was lying about the efficacy of Theranos\u2019 technology, the senior Shultz didn\u2019t believe him.\n \u201cElizabeth is a very, very charismatic person,\u201d Tyler Shultz said to  CBS News this week. \u201cWhen she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.\u201d\n  Tyler Shultz became the first whistleblower for Theranos, but at great personal and financial cost \u2014 in his audio-memoir \u201cThicker than Water,\u201d he discussed being threatened by high-profile lawyers like David Boies and being followed by  private investigators. But Shultz told a brief, yet poignant anecdote in his memoir about attending family dinners with his grandfather, who always invited Holmes and even hosted her thirtieth birthday party.\n \u201cThere was a weird situation where my parents kept telling [Holmes] to invite her parents, and they just kind of assumed that she did, and then my grandparents were talking to Elizabeth\u2019s parents on the phone, and Elizabeth\u2019s parents were completely unaware she was having a thirtieth birthday party, so it didn\u2019t seem she was very close with her parents at all,\u201d Shultz recalled. Throughout the trial, Holmes was usually seen clutching her mom\u2019s hand \u2014 but per Shultz\u2019s memory, they weren\u2019t all that close at the time of her crimes.\n Shultz goes on to describe the attendees of her birthday party: He says that he and Holmes\u2019 brother were the only people under 30, and the next youngest person was Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, who was almost 50 \u2014 he met Holmes when she was 18 and he was 37. They dated in secret for more than 10 years, unbeknownst to most Theranos employees and investors. Holmes moved in with Balwani in 2005, soon after she dropped out of Stanford.\n \u201cHe impacted everything about who I was and I don\u2019t fully understand that,\u201d Holmes testified.\n Holmes tearfully explained in court that Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her throughout their relationship. She said that he controlled what she ate, when she slept and how she behaved.\n \u201cHe told me that I didn\u2019t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished by my mediocrity, and that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,\u201d Holmes said on the stand.\n  Her defense submitted as evidence two documents that showed how Holmes was being controlled by Balwani: one was a schedule of her  daily routine, while another set  instructions for how she behaved. These guidelines would help her \u201cbecome a new Elizabeth,\u201d Holmes said Balwani told her. One \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d in her instructions declared that she would never meet with anyone \u2014 especially direct reports \u2014 for longer than five minutes unless she had written down a clear agenda for the meeting. According to the documents, her lifestyle was monastic: waking up at 4 A.M., praying, mediating, exercising, only eating certain foods and never doing anything for recreation.\n Holmes\u2019 schedule became a bit of a meme, with some journalists even  trying out her schedule for clicks \u2014 but the reality is much darker than that. It may be difficult to take Holmes\u2019 account of abuse seriously, since she\u2019s famously a liar and was just convicted of criminal fraud \u2014 but these documents, if legitimate, show a woman whose every action was being controlled by an older partner and business associate.\n \u201cHe said I needed to spend all of my time on the business, and that I should only be spending time with people who could help the business to be successful, that I needed to be working seven days a week, and I needed to be only doing things that could contribute to making the company successful,\u201d Holmes testified.\n In this context, Shultz\u2019s account of Holmes thirtieth birthday party makes more sense. She was so committed to building Theranos that she didn\u2019t seem to have any friends or hobbies, nor did she communicate enough with her parents to invite them to her birthday party.\n \u201cSunny would get very upset if I was with my family, because he said it was a distraction to the business,\u201d Holmes said in trial. Her defense referenced a  text from Balwani from Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, which said: \u201cWhen ur family is here, I feel lonely bcz u spend a total of 10 seconds with me a day.\u201d\n Maybe if Holmes had friends to confide in, someone would have told her that she was going too far by stretching the truth with investors, or that it wasn\u2019t a good idea to deliver unreliable blood test results to patients, even if her boyfriend-slash-COO said to do so. But by design, there was no one for the single-minded entrepreneur to talk to.\n  This is not to exonerate Holmes of her crimes. It can be true that she was abused by a controlling, manipulative, older partner, yet it can simultaneously be true that she committed fraud. Plus, even though she was not convicted of defrauding patients, her lies caused significant distress to Theranos customers who were given alarmingly false blood test results.\n We talk a lot about what the tech industry learned from Theranos, but we gloss over something so simple: Startup founders need to have a life outside of their job.\n We valorize founders like Elizabeth Holmes who are so dedicated to their vision that they will make huge sacrifices, abandoning their social lives to build their companies. But this isolating form of hustle culture doesn\u2019t usually breed success \u2014 it breeds burnout at best, and millions of dollars of criminal fraud at worst.\n If you\u2019re a startup founder, you\u2019re probably not the next Elizabeth Holmes. But if you just do normal things like, I don\u2019t know, see a gosh darn movie with some friends (COVID permitting), maybe you\u2019ll spare yourself from making some short-sighted mistakes.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:16:50", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "theranos,learn,\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af", "title": "\u4eceTheranos\u5b66\u4e60\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u3002", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tWhat\u2019s left to learn from Theranos?

The current boom in COVID cases is a huge bummer, but perhaps this is the last year we\u2019ll have to drag ourselves back to productivity under the specter of lockdowns, mass death and a lack of hugs. I hope so.\n Regardless, today we have a lot of fun stuff that should keep your mind off the state of the world for a few minutes.\n  Kicking off today, let\u2019s talk about Liquid Death. The excellently named company  kills thirst with  water, hence its name. That\u2019s really the company in a nutshell. Liquid Death sells water in a can, a business around which it has tailored an anti-plastic stance and a general heavy metal vibe. It\u2019s neat.\n But Liquid Death  also raised $75 million this week, which has me wondering why everything is so expensive to build these days. Why does a water company need to raise a whole pre-seed fund in a single investment? What does it need the money for? Research? It\u2019s selling water!\n There was a general perspective a few years ago that it was cheaper than ever to build a startup. With off-the-shelf software, cloud computing and modern fintech back ends, putting together the building blocks of modern business was becoming faster and less expensive. Apart from the high costs of hiring software developers, it seemed that startups would be able to do more with less.\n And yet. Startups are raising more money than ever. The Exchange is diving into venture capital data next week, but it\u2019s clear that the venture and startup classes are still moving funds around with great relish. So much so that Liquid Death has raised over $130 million to date,  per Crunchbase data.\n Square the circle of lower startup costs, and mega-rounds for me if you can. Are we seeing marketing spend raised through equity capital sources? If so, that makes me worry a bit!\n (Note that Liquid Death could be a kickass business with great margins and lovely economics; I don\u2019t know its numbers. But why does it need $75 million if it\u2019s in such good shape? What are we missing here?)\n  From deep in the notes docs, a brief note on  Level. Level is a company that  I covered back in February of 2021. The company had just closed a $1.5 million round for work we described as bringing \u201ccredit to workers who might not be able to tap it from traditional sources, using their current income from freelance work to back the advance.\u201d\n It was a neat model, as lending based on assets over cash flow is a bit silly in a world where lots of folks work but don\u2019t live asset-heavy lifestyles. (That\u2019s a polite way of dissing NIMBY boomers, of course).\n Anyway, Level raised another round as 2021 closed, this time a $7 million Series A. Anthos Capital led the funding, with NextView Ventures and other prior inventors also kicking in cash. The capital came after the company grew its size by \u201c10x,\u201d per its own data.\n What I find most notable in the Level news item is not that the company raised more money \u2014 more that its goal set is super big. Per  the company, it wants to build a \u201cfinancial OS for microbusinesses.\u201d\n I dig that because tiny businesses are not the sorts of companies that get lots of attention from traditional financial institutions. Fintech should be, in my view, a method of applying tech to break down walls and bring more value to more folks. Level seems to be working along those lines, while also building a venture-ready business. Neat!\n  On the heels of news that a16z has  put together $9 billion in new funds for venture, growth and biotech investing it\u2019s easy to forget that there are smaller funds in the market as well. And some that are quite new, in fact.\n On the biotech front  PsyMed Ventures is busy raising a $25 million fund, the first close of which ($8 million) is in the bank. I chatted with the group Friday to dig in a bit more to their model.\n First, basics. PsyMed has three investing partners:  Dina Burkitbayeva,  Greg Kubin\u00a0and  Matias Serebrinsky. As you can work out from its first fund size target, it will be investing on the earlier side of things in the psychedelic medical space, along with a few related areas. The group isn\u2019t new to working together, having previously formed an investing group using AngelList tech to invest around $15 million to date.\n A few thoughts about PsyMed. First, I am hype that we\u2019re expanding the boundaries of what we\u2019re testing for medical use. Prudishness in my home country has held back this sort of work, to our detriment. Second, the biotech investing space is interesting to me as the companies founded go public a lot earlier than what we tend to see in, say, the enterprise software market. So, you get to see more about companies, more quickly and more frequently.\n For venture investors in biotech companies, this can also mean earlier liquidity possibilities than what is often seen in today\u2019s unicorn era.\n Talking with Burkitbayeva, Kubin and Serebrinsky gave me the impression that we\u2019re nearing a confluence point in terms of regulatory, scientific and medical progress that could unlock a lot of neat new treatments for some sticky human matters. Things like PTSD, treatment-resistant depression and my personal favorite, substance-use disorder.\n All this is to say that I\u2019ll be keeping out an eye for where the group puts its new fund to work and how quickly they can boost early-stage pharma startups into the public markets. Here\u2019s to reading more biotech S-1s this year and next, I suppose!\n  And that\u2019s what I have for now \u2014 don\u2019t forget that  Equity is back to its regular thrice-weekly cadence next week, so I\u2019ll chat with you on your podcasting app of choice in short order!

The earliest investors are rethinking signaling risk, dilution and, most surprisingly, the worth of a traditional demo day.\n   Signaling risk happens when a VC chooses to not do pro rata, or follow-on investing, in an existing portfolio company. The idea is that investors who know you best \u2014 the ones who bet on you earlier than others \u2014 are choosing not to invest in you in your next phase of growth, which must mean that the deal isn\u2019t that great. Negative perception can trickle down to other investors who, despite what their Twitter bios will tell you, are pretty risk-averse folks.\n Accelerators have an interesting role to play here. If an accelerator like Y Combinator ever gets to host 1,000 startups per batch, an automatic pro-rata investment in each startup would be both capital-intensive and perhaps unintentionally dilute its own signal. Like clockwork, in 2020, the accelerator  changed its policy on automatic pro-rata investments and chose to invest on a case-by-case basis, just like 500 Startups.\n \u201cWe have significantly exceeded the funds we raised for pro ratas, and the investors who support YC do not have the appetite to fund the pro rata program at the same scale,\u201d the  accelerator wrote in a post then. \u201cIn addition, processing hundreds of follow-on rounds per year has created significant operational complexities for YC that we did not anticipate.\n \u201cSaid simply, investing in every round for every YC company requires more capital than we want to raise and manage. We always tell startups to stay small and manage their budgets carefully. In this instance, we failed to follow our own advice.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u52a0\u901f\u5668,accelerators,\u4fe1\u53f7", "title": "\u542f\u52a8\u52a0\u901f\u5668''\u503c\u6dfb\u52a0'\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\u5237\u65b0", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tStartup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/08/startup-accelerators-definition-of-value-add-is-due-for-a-refresh/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u52a0\u901f\u5668", "\u4fe1\u53f7"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e306d0d4b5502e34e4dd43d93da7faae.jpg", "infoid": 1072510, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "2020\u5e744\u6708\uff0cNextview VC\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u539a\u5b9e\u4e2d\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u800cy\u7ec4\u5408\u5668\u548c500\u540d\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5219\u5386\u53f2\u5b75\u5316\u5668\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5730\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u6279\u6b21\u5b8c\u5168\u9065\u8fdc\u548c\u6284\u5199\u961f\u5458\u7684\u94a5\u5319\u8c03\u6574\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5077\u770b\u4e00\u4e9b\u6700\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u9884\u5148\u79cd\u5b50\u548c\u79cd\u5b50\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u5176\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\nNextview\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b64\u7acb\u4e8e\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6f14\u793a\u65e5\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u50cf\u53d1\u5c04\u623f\u5b50\u76f8\u53cd\u7684\u8d44\u672c\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u6837\u6b63\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u8d8a\u66f4\u806a\u660e\u7684\u571f\u5730\u5904\u7406\u548c\u63a8\u8fdb\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u3002\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6240\u77e5\u9053\u7684\uff1a\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e00\u5e74\uff0cBankaya\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaCeo Mauricio Cordero\uff0cRam\u00f3nChedraui\u548c\u8fed\u6208\u00b7\u74e6\u5c14\u52a0\u65af\u58f0\u79f0\u4ed6\u4eec\u964d\u843d\u4e8645\u4e07\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fdd\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5168\u90e8\u542f\u52a8\u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "note_en": "In April 2020,  NextView VC launched its debut accelerator in the thick of the pandemic, while historical incubators like Y Combinator and 500 Startups were similarly rethinking their independent strategies. Key tweaks like making batches fully remote and scrapping the cohort model gave us a peek at how some of the most active pre-seed and seed investors were rethinking their jobs.\n Fast-forward perhaps too many months, NextView partner Melody Koh tells me the accelerator  is launching its third cohort with some key tweaks, again signaling some interesting changes for the seed-stage startup scene.\n  The first big change is that NextView is growing its check size from $200,000 for an 8% ownership stake to $400,000 for a 10% ownership stake. Big check sizes in this economy are anything but surprising, but Koh\u2019s perspective is that the cash will \u201carm companies with just a little bit more ammunition that can really set them up.\u201d Beyond market pressure, the firm realized they were the only funding sources for a lot of cohort startups \u2014 which meant they had to make larger initial investments to truly get these companies to follow on funding.\n \u201cIt just provides a little bit more flexibility and the ability for teams to really experiment and execute and kind of get to the next stage of the milestones that this market now is looking for,\u201d she added. So far, more than 50% of the NextView accelerator alumni identify as underrepresented founders and come from cities including Miami, Seattle, Boston, Birmingham, San Diego and New York.\n Considering its distributed format, the firm has had to update its mentorship. This time around, it is pairing each of its six to eight batch startups with a primary partner for weekly meetings and a secondary for monthly meetings. The former will give the company a more on-going resource while they\u2019re in the weeds and is a result of feedback NextView has seen from previous cohorts. The more involved partnership model could bring startup founders  more activation energy when they need it most.\n And finally, the firm is doubling down on its no demo day rule. Part of the argument here is that the idea of an annual, flashy event may no longer be necessary for founders to land coveted attention.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like the artificial kind of deadlines, and the demo day date format is the best use of your time,\u201d Koh said. \u201cThe way we engage with every company is \u2026 \u2018OK each of you has a different set of milestones that make sense for you,\u2019 so we don\u2019t really focus on demo day as the right way to expend their energy or our energy.\u201d\n NextView isn\u2019t alone in rethinking demo days and its broader investing strategy. Firms like Contrary Capital and startups like Launch House are similarly looking for smarter ways to land deals and propel startups.\n Even in a world where  capital is a commodity, investors are preparing \u2014 perhaps even more so \u2014 to find innovative ways to make their cash even more worth it to founders. \u201cValue add\u201d chatter can be cringey at times, but to me it just signals that an emerging class of investors are figuring out what they\u2019re best at (beyond spotting ambitious founders). That\u2019s fun to see, and even something as small as a tweak on accelerator format can give us something to think about.\n For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column:  Startup accelerators\u2019 definition of \u2018value add\u2019 is due for a refresh.\n In the rest of this newsletter, we\u2019ll dig into CES 2022 trends, a fintech startup with a contrarian view on CAC and a feature on the future of Black Girls Code.

All of our CES coverage  can be found at this nifty link, but I recommend starting with Brian Heater\u2019s  CES 2022 themes just to wet your palate.\n Here\u2019s what to know: Stand out announcements so far include BMW\u2019s plan  to turn cars into rolling cinemas, a  mission to scale paper-based tooth brushes and, on a more serious note, a statement on the  importance of a cushion that tracks your child\u2019s temperature.\u200b\u200b\n     Bankaya! As our own Mary Ann Azevedo reports, this Mexican fintech is opting for a non-traditional strategy when it comes to acquiring customers: going offline. The new, early-stage company is targeting 50 million underbanked individuals with face-to-face advertising: think street sales and debit card kiosks strategically placed in vaccination centers.\n Here\u2019s what to know:  Just one year after launch, Bankaya co-founders CEO Mauricio Cordero, Ram\u00f3n Chedraui and Diego Vargas claim they landed 450,000 customers. And, adding to their counterintuitive strategy, the company is fully bootstrapped to date.\n     Over the holidays, news broke that Black Girls Code co-founder and  CEO Kimberly Bryant was \u201csuspended indefinitely\u201d from the nonprofit organization she launched nearly a decade ago. I spoke to the nonprofit board that decided to place her on leave, former employees who allege rising tensions between Bryant and the organization, and of course, Bryant herself to get the full story.\n Here\u2019s what to know: There\u2019s too much nuance in this story to sum it all up in a perfect blurb, so I\u2019d really recommend those interested  to read the entire story. As of now, the board claims it has formed a special committee to review complaints against Bryant from former and current employees and put Bryant on paid administrative leave last week \u201cto ensure a full and fair review process.\u201d\n    Our events calendar got leaked (by us) so now\u2019s your chance to  check out our legendary line up for this year. I\u2019m so excited to share that TechCrunch Disrupt, our flagship event, will be returning as an in-person event. Three days, a lot of startup chatter, and over-caffeination.

Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies are the current weapons of choice, driving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to embrace crypto as an  investable asset class.\n Bitcoin has witnessed  strong year-to-date returns, outshining traditional hedges by  rallying over 130% compared to gold\u2019s meager 4%. In addition, increased  institutional adoption, sustained appetite for digital assets based on  weekly inflows\u00a0and growing exposure in the media strengthened bitcoin\u2019s case among weary investors.\n  If these are the moves being made by big money, they must be smart moves. However, while the prospect of hedging against bitcoin may seem enticing to retail investors, certain lingering question marks remain over its viability in mitigating financial risk for individuals.\n  The ongoing discussion of bitcoin as an inflation hedge needs to be prefaced with the fact that the currency is often susceptible to market jitters and gyrations: Bitcoin\u2019s value plummeted over  80% during December 2017, by  50% in March 2020 and by another  53% in May 2021.\n Bitcoin\u2019s ability to improve user returns and reduce volatility over the long term has yet to be proven. Traditional hedges like gold have  demonstrated efficacy in preserving purchasing power during periods of sustained high inflation \u2014 take the U.S.  during the 1970s as an example \u2014 something bitcoin has yet to be tested on. This increased risk, in turn, makes returns subject to the drastic short-term swings that sometimes affect the currency.\n  Many make the argument for bitcoin based on the fact that it\u2019s designed for a limited supply, which supposedly protects it from devaluation compared to traditional fiat currencies. While this makes sense in theory, bitcoin\u2019s price has been shown to be vulnerable to external influences. Bitcoin \u201cwhales\u201d are known for their ability to manipulate prices by selling or buying in large quantities, meaning that bitcoin can be dictated by speculative forces, not solely the money-supply rule.\n Another key consideration is regulation: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are still at the mercy of regulators and wildly varying laws across jurisdictions. Anti-competitive laws and shortsighted regulations could significantly hamper the adoption of the underlying technology, potentially depreciating the asset\u2019s price further. All this is to say one thing: It\u2019s far too early to be making judgments on bitcoin being an effective hedge.\n  Against the background of this debate, another salient trend has been driving its momentum. As bitcoin\u2019s popularity grows, it continues to drive adoption and institutionalization of the currency among consumers, including several wealthy individuals and corporations.\n A recent survey found that  72% of U.K. financial advisers have briefed their clients about investing in crypto, with nearly half of the advisers saying they believed crypto could be used to diversify portfolios as an uncorrelated asset.\n  There has also been a great deal of bitcoin advocacy from prolific individuals, known for being technologically progressive, namely billionaire Wall Street investor  Paul Tudor, Twitter CEO  Jack Dorsey,  the Winklevoss twins and  Mike Novogratz. Even powerful companies such as  Goldman Sachs and  Morgan Stanley have expressed their interest in bitcoin as a viable asset.\n If this momentum continues, bitcoin\u2019s infamous volatility will gradually dissipate as more and more wealthy people and institutions hold the currency. Ironically, this accrual of value on the network would lead to the concentration of wealth \u2014 the antithesis of what bitcoin was created for, subject to the influence of the elite and exclusive  1%.\n In line with classical schools of financial thought, this would actually expose retail investors to greater risk, as institutional buying and selling would resemble whale-like market manipulations.\n  Bitcoin\u2019s growing popularity will no doubt lead to more people owning it, and one can argue that the people with the most money will be the ones who are going to (as usual) end up owning most of it.\n This noticeable shift of influence toward ultra-high-net-worth individuals and firms among bitcoin and other crypto circles goes against the very ethos that the Bitcoin white paper was based upon when it described a  peer-to-peer electronic cash system.\n Among the  fundamental rationales for cryptocurrencies is their need to be permissionless and  resistant to censorship and control by any given institution.\n Now, as the 1% seeks a greater slice of the crypto pie, they boost the prices of these assets in the short term in a way that traditional and less influential retail investors are unable to.\n While this move would undoubtedly make a few wealthier, there is an argument to be made that this might leave the market at the mercy of the 1%, contradicting Bitcoin\u2019s intended vision.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:15:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u7535\u529b,richer,\u8d27\u5e01", "title": "\u5bcc\u88d5\u7684\u5bcc\u4eba\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7684\u7535\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u80c0\u5bf9\u51b2", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tThe rich get richer: Rethinking Bitcoin\u2019s power as an inflation hedge\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/the-rich-get-richer-rethinking-bitcoins-power-as-an-inflation-hedge/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u7535\u529b", "richer", "\u8d27\u5e01"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b43f57bd875f3c24ccf6fb98d5d35168.jpg", "infoid": 1072508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c03\u67e5\u663e\u793a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u60f3\u8981 - \u5e76\u671f\u671b - \u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u5c06\u52a0\u8f7dWhiz-Band\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u3002 CES 2022\u5305\u88f9\u672c\u5468\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u6c7d\u8f66\u53ef\u80fd\u6301\u6709\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u535a\u4e16\u8868\u793a\u9884\u8ba1\u6c7d\u8f66\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u5e74\u589e\u957f\u7387\u76f4\u81f32030\u5e74;\u677e\u4e0b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u773c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u62ac\u5934\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u62e5\u67091000\u74e6\u548c25\u4e2a\u626c\u58f0\u5668\u7684ELS Studio 3D\u97f3\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5b9d\u9a6c\u63ed\u5f00\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e1a\u4e3b\u6539\u53d8\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5e76\u5728\u5b83\u4eec\u5185\u663e\u793a\u6570\u5b57\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u66f4\u4e0d\u7528\u8bf4\u5e26\u6709\u5185\u7f6e\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u706b\u7535\u89c6\u7684\u540e31\u82f1\u5bf8\u5267\u9662\u5c4f\u5e55\u3002\n\u6839\u636eFisher\uff0cCR 2021\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u62a5\u544a\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9ad8\u7aef\u7535\u52a8SUV\u662f\u6700\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u3002\n\u8d1d\u5c14\u5728Apple\u5ea6\u8fc7\u4e86\u8fd117\u5e74\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u90a3\u91cc\u62db\u52df\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684Lucid Tech\u56e2\u961f\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7b7e\u8ba2\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5411\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u953b\u70bc\u3002 \u201c\u4f60\u4e0d\u80fd\u8015\u79cd\uff0c\u671f\u5f85\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7ecf\u5386\uff0c\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5728Lucid\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4eceTier Whatevers\u8d2d\u4e70\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u505a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u3002\u201d\n\u4f46\u5bf9\u9ad8\u79d1\u6280\u6c7d\u8f66\u7684\u6e34\u671b\u4e0d\u592a\u53ef\u80fd\u6d88\u5931\u3002 Edmunds\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8463\u4e8b\u6770\u897f\u5361\u8003\u5fb7\u5a01\u5c14\uff08Edmunds\uff09\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u5361\u8f66\u5439\u6367\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u7528\u9014\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u548c\u751f\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e70\u5bb6\u90fd\u5f88\u611f\u6fc0\u3002", "note_en": "Surveys show that consumers want \u2014 and expect \u2014 that their next car will be laden with whiz-bang features, demand that is a driver for the current bloat. CES 2022, which wrapped this week, provides a glimpse of what the future car might hold. Bosch said to expect double-digit annual growth in automotive software until 2030; Panasonic showed off an augmented reality head-up display with eye tracking, plus the ELS Studio 3D audio system with 1,000 watts and 25 speakers. BMW unveiled future technology that will allow owners to change the exterior color of their cars and display digital art inside them, not to mention a rear 31-inch Theatre Screen with  built-in Amazon Fire TV.\n And that\u2019s just a tiny sampling of the  car tech shown at CES 2022.\n  But if that tech is unreliable \u2014 as some of it has proven \u2014 then it\u2019s not a win for consumers. Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want.\n \u201cWe don\u2019t have a chip shortage; we have software bloat,\u201d said Mike Juran, CEO and co-founder of Altia, which provides graphical user interface design and tools to many automakers. \u201cThere is way too much unnecessary software out there.\u201d\n Take the Chevrolet Volt. The plug-in hybrid had more than 10 million lines of code when it was introduced for the 2011 model year; \u00a0today\u2019s mid- to high-level vehicles have something like 100 million lines, said Michael Hill, vice president of engineering at Altia.\n \u201cIt\u2019s at the level you might have seen in a jet fighter 10 or 15 years ago,\u201d Hill told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd there is no bug-free software.\u201d\n   \u201cToday\u2019s cars are being burdened with features consumers aren\u2019t necessarily asking for or demanding,\u201d Jake Fisher, senior director of auto testing at Consumer Reports told TechCrunch.\n According to Fisher,  CR\u2019s 2021 Auto Reliability Report found that high-end electric SUVs are among the least-reliable vehicles.\n \u201cAnd it\u2019s not because their powertrains are problematic,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cInstead, automakers saw an opening with the early EV adopters to package the cars with all the technology they could come up with. They\u2019re trying to differentiate the product\u2013and justify the high cost. And that results in cars that aren\u2019t very reliable.\u201d\n Buggy software caused by inefficiency and coding problems are being driven by a shift \u2014 or more accurately, an acceleration \u2014 in the vehicle development cycle, according to Jason Williamson, vice president of marketing at Altia.\n \u201cPeople are used to seeing new phones every year, and automakers are trying to keep up with consumer electronics,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cThey\u2019re pushing to develop completely new cars in two years or less. And that means using building blocks that are maybe intended for laptops and not necessarily custom-built for automotive applications.\u201d\n It\u2019s not only expensive EVs that are enticing consumers with tech; it\u2019s happening in many mid- and upscale product lines.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more feature bloat than software bloat,\u201d said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse Insights. \u201cThe software is only there to make all the features work, and do we really need 30-way power adjustable seats with five massage-pattern options? Or sequential taillights, multi-zone automatic climate control and audio systems with concert hall and studio settings? The insatiable desire to one-up the competition is what\u2019s driving this.\u201d\n   \u201cThe hardest thing is to figure out what the feature set should be and stick to it,\u201d said Mike Bell, senior vice president of digital at Lucid Group. \u201cIt can be easier to say, \u2018We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re doing, so we\u2019re just going to throw in the whole kitchen sink.\u2019 The smart approach is to decide what customers actually want to do, then figure out how to give them the best experience. There shouldn\u2019t be seven ways to do something.\u201d\n Bell spent nearly 17 years at Apple, and recruited part of his Lucid tech team from there. He said one source of problems is that, contrary to tech company norms, automakers contract much of their software work out to suppliers. \u201cYou can\u2019t farm it out and expect to have a good experience,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Lucid, instead of buying from the tier whatevers, we do our own software and our own integration.\u201d\n  \u201cLaunching a car now is not just about the hardware, but about the software, too\u201d according to Polestar CEO Thomas Ingenlath.\u00a0 He added in an interview that the ability to do over-the-air updates of that software \u201cmakes a big difference in consumer satisfaction. We can quickly respond to issues that come up.\u201d\n  A major factor here is consumer expectations. It\u2019s true that auto buyers don\u2019t need certain features, but they do appear to want them. A November  study from CoPilot, a data-driven car-buying app, suggests that automakers are simply responding to public demand. It found that 65.7% of current lease holders expect better feature functionality in their next car or truck, and slightly more than 56% think they\u2019ll pay about the same or less than they do for their current vehicle.\n Similarly, a September  CarMax survey of more than 1,000 car owners found that almost 50% \u201csaid they wish their current car had more tech features.\u201d\n Buyers in their 20s and 30s, a highly desirable demographic for automakers, were the most likely to say that tech features were \u201cextremely important\u201d to them as a purchase consideration. Overall, 15.9% considered the tech package extremely important; 36.7% saw it as very important; and 31.8% were in the \u201csomewhat important\u201d camp. Only 3.9% said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d important.\n  Pat Ryan, CEO and founder of CoPilot, said in an interview that consumers are likely on a collision course in three areas. \u201cFirst, it may take three to six months just to get a car, and people aren\u2019t used to that,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe second issue is that shoppers may find that their new car actually has fewer features than the one they\u2019re turning in.\n Premium sound, wireless charging, even heated seats may not be available because of the chip shortage. And people used to paying maybe 95% of the sticker price may find themselves hit with stickerplus.\u201d\n But the desire for high-tech cars is not likely to go away.

The site \u2013 named McGraths Flat \u2013 contains superb examples of fossilised animals and plants from the Miocene epoch. The team\u2019s findings were published today in   Science Advances.\n The new fossil site is located in the Central Tablelands, NSW near the town of Gulgong, and represents one of only a handful of fossil sites in Australia that can be classified as a \u2018 Lagerst\u00e4tte\u2019\u2013 a site that contains fossils of exceptional quality.\n Over the last three years a team of researchers has been secretly excavating the site, discovering thousands of specimens including rainforest plants, insects, spiders, fish and a bird feather.\n  UNSW Senior Lecturer Dr McCurry said the fossils formed between 11 and 16 million years ago and are important for understanding the history of the Australian continent.\n \u201cThe fossils we have found prove that the area was once a temperate, mesic rainforest and that life was rich and abundant here in the Central Tablelands,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n \u201cMany of the fossils that we are finding are new to science and include trapdoor spiders, giant cicadas, wasps and a variety of fish.\n \u201cUntil now it has been difficult to tell what these ancient ecosystems were like, but the level of preservation at this new fossil site means that even small fragile organisms like insects turned into well-preserved fossils.\u201d\n Associate Professor Michael Frese, who imaged the fossils using stacking microphotography and a scanning electron microscope (SEM), said that the fossils from McGraths Flat show an incredibly detailed preservation.\n \u201cUsing electron microscopy, I can image individual cells of plants and animals and sometimes even very small subcellular structures,\u201d Dr Frese said.\n \u201cThe fossils also preserve evidence of interactions between species. For instance, we have fish stomach contents preserved in the fish, meaning that we can figure out what they were eating. We have also found examples of pollen preserved on the bodies of insects so we can tell which species were pollinating which plants.\n \u201cThe discovery of melanosomes \u2013 subcellular organelles that store the melanin pigment \u2013 allows us to reconstruct the colour pattern of birds and fishes that once lived at McGraths Flat. Interestingly, the colour itself is not preserved, but by comparing the size, shape and stacking pattern of the melanosomes in our fossils with melanosomes in extant specimens, we can often reconstruct colour and/or colour patterns.\u201d\n  The fossils were found within an iron-rich rock called \u2018goethite\u2019, not usually thought of as a source of exceptional fossils. \u201cWe think that the process that turned these organisms into fossils is key to why they are so well preserved. Our analyses suggest that the fossils formed when iron-rich groundwaters drained into a billabong, and that a precipitation of iron minerals encased organisms that were living in or fell into the water,\u201d Dr McCurry said.\n Dr McCurry said the fossilised plants and animals were similar to those found in rainforests of northern Australia, but that there were signs that the ecosystem at McGraths Flat was beginning to dry.\n \u201cThe pollen we found in the sediment suggests that there might have been drier habitats surrounding the wetter rainforest, indicating a change to drier conditions,\u201d he said.\n Australian Museum Chief Scientist and director of the AM\u2019s Research Institute, Professor Kristofer Helgen, said the fossil site brought to life a picture of outback Australia that we can now barely believe existed.\n \u201cAustralia is the most unique continent biologically, and this site is extremely valuable in what it tells us about the evolutionary history of this part of the world. It provides further evidence of changing climates and helps fill the gaps in our knowledge of that time and region,\u201d Prof. Helgen said.\n \u201cThe AM has a rich history of expeditions and scientific research, and we love that the public is always fascinated by these fundamental human endeavours of exploration and discovery.\u201d\n Field work at McGraths Flat was funded through the generous donation from a descendant of Robert Etheridge, an English palaeontologist who came to Australia in 1866. Etheridge joined the Australian Museum in 1887 as Assistant Palaeontologist and in 1895 was made Curator of the Museum.\n   First found in 2017, McGraths Flat is named after Nigel McGrath who discovered the first fossils from the site. The site is located near Gulgong in central NSW (Gulgong is a Wiradjuri word that means \u201cdeep waterhole\u201d).\n The Miocene Epoch (~23\u20135 million years ago) was a time of immense change in Australia. The Australian continent had separated from Antarctica and South America and was drifting northwards. When the Miocene began there was enormous richness and variety of plant and animal life in Australia. But at around 14 million years ago an abrupt change in climate known as the \u201cMiddle Miocene Disruption\u201d caused widespread extinctions. Throughout the latter half of the Miocene, Australia gradually became more and more arid, and rainforests turned into the dry shrublands and deserts that now characterise the landscape. The newly discovered fossil site, McGraths Flat, provides an unprecedented look into what Australian ecosystems were like prior to this aridification.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:34:06",

"note_en": "Study finds test works on people with concerning signs such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue\n    Scientists have developed a blood test that could help detect cancer in people with nonspecific symptoms such as unexplained weight loss or fatigue.\n If validated, the test could enable cancer patients to be identified earlier, when they are more likely to respond to treatment, and help flag up who could benefit from early access to drugs designed to tackle metastatic cancer. The test can also tell if the disease has spread.\n  There is currently no clear route through which someone with nonspecific symptoms that could be cancer is referred for further investigation. NHS rapid diagnostic centres are being set up to support faster and earlier cancer diagnosis, but often patients will be examined by their GP, and if they can\u2019t identify an obvious cause of their symptoms then the patient will simply be told to come back if they get worse.\n \u201cThe problem we\u2019ve had in the past is that if they do have cancer, that cancer is growing all the time, and when they come back the cancers are often quite advanced,\u201d said Dr James Larkin, of the University of Oxford, who was involved in the research.\n Although it is difficult to know precisely how many individuals fall into this category, \u201cit is likely to be tens of thousands of patients across the UK,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to capture these patients when they come to the GP, to give them an immediate referral option.\n \u201cThe moment you can say \u2018you have a cancer\u2019, it provides a strong incentive to send that patient for an imaging investigation to see if you can find that cancer.\u201d\n The new test utilises a technology called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which profiles levels of small molecules called metabolites in the blood. Healthy individuals have different metabolic \u201cfingerprints\u201d to those with localised or metastatic cancer.\n In a study published in the journal  Clinical Cancer Research, Larkin and colleagues analysed samples from 300 patients with nonspecific but concerning symptoms of cancer, such as fatigue and weight loss, and found that the test correctly detected cancer in 19 out of every 20 of those with the disease. It cannot yet pinpoint the type of tumour they have, but this is the ultimate goal.\n The test could also distinguish between patients with localised or metastatic cancer with 94% accuracy, making this the first blood test to be able to detect if a person\u2019s cancer has spread without knowing type of tumour they have.\n \u201cSuch information changes how you treat patients,\u201d Larkin said. For instance, certain immunotherapies have been shown to increase survival rates among people with metastatic cancer, but they are expensive and have side-effects. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to prescribe them to everyone, but there are patients out there that would absolutely benefit if you could only identify them early enough.\n A different type of  blood test that aims to detect circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) is being trialled in the NHS, but metabolic changes may be detectable earlier, while ctDNA technology also requires you to know which mutations to look for when finding a tumour.\n The next step is to confirm the accuracy of the test in 2,000 to 3000 British patients with nonspecific symptoms, which Larkin hopes could happen within the next two years. This data would then be submitted to national regulatory agencies responsible for authorising such tests.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:33:25", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bd5\u9a8c,test,\u5177\u6709", "title": "\u8840\u6db2\u8bd5\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a3\u6709\u975e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u75c7\u72b6\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u764c\u75c7", "title_en": "Blood Test Could Help Detect Cancer Earlier In People With Nonspecific Symptoms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/05/blood-test-could-help-detect-cancer-in-people-with-nonspecific-symptoms", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bd5\u9a8c", "test", "\u5177\u6709"]}]
