Ars\u3002", "note_en": "After more than four years of frustrating delays, Blue Origin is finally making significant progress toward completing development of its powerful BE-4 rocket engine. At present, engineers and technicians with the company are assembling the first two flight engines at  Blue Origin&#39;s main factory in Kent, Washington.\n  The company aspires to deliver these two flight engines to United Launch Alliance before the end of this year, although that increasingly appears to be a &#34;stretch&#34; goal. Delivery may slip into early 2022. And in order to make this deadline, Blue Origin plans to take the somewhat risky step of shipping the engines to its customer before completing full qualification testing.\n This delivery has been a long time coming. United Launch Alliance, or ULA, first agreed to buy the engines from Blue Origin back in 2014. It was a bold bet by ULA, a blueblood in space launch, on a new entrant to the market. But with the BE-4 engine, Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos was promising a relatively low-cost, high performing engine with a power output comparable to a Space Shuttle main engine. At the time of this initial agreement, Blue Origin said the BE-4 would be &#34;ready for flight&#34;  by 2017.\n The BE-4&#39;s delayed development has, increasingly, been the subject of keen interest. This is partly because ULA\u00a0has been working on its new Vulcan rocket for a number of years, and that rocket is important to the future of the company. The military is also eager for this delivery, as ULA is a primary provider of launch services to the Department of Defense alongside SpaceX. They hope Vulcan provides lower cost launch services with engines manufactured in the United States. Finally, many in the space community are genuinely curious about the cause of the delay.\n Despite this widespread interest, however, Blue Origin has said almost nothing publicly about the engine development. Therefore, this story attempts to provide some context for why the BE-4 engines are late. It is based on anonymous sources at the company&#39;s headquarters as well as industry officials, some of whom would likely be fired if they were named.\n    In response to questions for this article, a spokeswoman for Blue Origin, Linda Mills, offered only a single-sentence reply. &#34;We\u2019re on track to deliver the engines this year,&#34; she said.\n   According to these sources, the flight engines to be delivered to ULA, no. 1 and no. 2, are not yet fully assembled. But most of the components are built. The good news is that Blue Origin believes it has retired all of the significant technical risks. Engineers have already tested the BE-4 engine in a configuration close to that of the flight engines, and it has performed well during hot firings that approximate the duty cycle of a Vulcan first stage launch.\n  Blue Origin&#39;s current plan involves testing two more development engines at its facility near Van Horn, Texas, this fall. These are close to, but not  the, final version of the BE-4 engine.\n After these tests, a fully assembled flight engine no. 1 will be shipped to Texas to undergo a fairly brief round of tests, known as acceptance testing. If this engine passes, as expected, it will be shipped to ULA. Then a virtually identical BE-4 engine will be sent from Kent to Texas. This &#34;qual&#34; engine will undergo a much more rigorous series of tests, known as qualification testing. The idea is to push the engine through its paces to find any flaws. Then a similar process will follow with flight engine no. 2, followed by a second &#34;qual&#34; engine.\n The risk is that ULA will receive the flight engines before the full qualification testing is complete. This qualification work on Blue Origin&#39;s test stands will be occurring even as ULA integrates the engines with its first Vulcan rocket for testing and ultimately a launch during the second half of 2022. So if Blue Origin finds a last-minute issue with the BE-4 engine, ULA may have to unwind its work on final Vulcan development.\n &#34;This is a success oriented approach, but it could definitely backfire,&#34; one source told Ars.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 02:04:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "blue,origin,\u53d1\u52a8\u673a", "title": "Blue Origin

These drugs are thought to provide clinical benefit, but that benefit hasn\u2019t actually been demonstrated before the drug is approved. Once the drug is approved, a phase four study would need to demonstrate clinical efficacy.\n This is the pathway that allowed for the highly   controversial approval  of Aduhelm, the first Alzheimer\u2019s drug to be approved since 2003. It\u2019s this approval that set the HHS-OIG review process in motion, per the Inspector General\u2019s   Wednesday announcement .\n \u201cThe FDA\u2019s approval of Aduhelm raised concerns due to alleged scientific disputes within the FDA, the advisory committee\u2019s vote against approval, allegations of an inappropriately close relationship between the FDA and the industry, and the FDA\u2019s use of the accelerated approval pathway,\u201d the announcement reads.\n \u201cIn response to these concerns, we will assess how the FDA implements the accelerated approval pathway.\u201d\n While the FDA has   defended its decision  to approve Aduhlem via this pathway, there has been significant backlash about the drug\u2019s efficacy and how it got approved in the first place.\n Aduhelm, also known as aducanumab,   had demonstrated  it could reduce amyloid plaques in the brain (sticky compounds that disrupt communications between brain cells). However, there have been   lingering questions  about how much patients actually benefited from the drug. It was unclear whether lowering levels of amyloid plaques would actually slow rates of Alzheimer\u2019s most pernicious symptom: cognitive decline.\n  In March 2019, two phase three trials of the drug were   shut down  after independent monitoring committees found that the drug wasn\u2019t improving patients rates of cognitive decline. Another analysis conducted by Biogen in October, however, yielded different results. One phase three clinical trial of the drug did not show any improvements in cognitive decline, but the other trial did show some modest effects in patients who got the highest doses.\n In November 2020 an independent FDA committee declined to endorse the drug for approval. Yet, by June 2021, the drug was approved anyway.\n Within the pharmaceutical industry, the approval of Aduhelm initially   sparked optimism  that the FDA might open its doors to more biomarker-based approvals. However, that optimism wasn\u2019t shared by the wider scientific community.\n Three members of the independent committee that had advised against the drug\u2019s approval   resigned in protest . Based on the inconsistent data, major hospital systems like Mt. Sinai and the Cleveland Clinic have indicated they   won\u2019t prescribe the drug .\n Part of the controversy around Aduhelm\u2019s approval has centered around   allegations of an especially close working relationship  between the FDA and Biogen leading up to the drug\u2019s approval. As   STAT first reported , Biogen launched an internal effort called Project Onyx to try to convince regulators to approve the drug, and some FDA officials eventually played active roles in the drug\u2019s approval, including joint presentations before external experts.\n In a   July 9 letter,  Janet Woodcock, acting FDA Commissioner, called for HHS-OIG to conduct an external review that would investigate this working relationship.\n \u201c We believe an independent assessment is the best manner in which to determine whether any interactions that occurred between the manufacturer and the agency\u2019s review staff were inconsistent with FDA\u2019s policies and procedures,\u201d she wrote on Twitter.\n While the HHS-OIG investigation was spurred by the Aduhelm controversy, this review will not focus on reviewing the scientific evidence behind aduhlem (or any other drug, for that matter). Rather it will peek under the hood of the   entire  accelerated approval pathway to assess how, and when, the FDA chooses to allow drugmakers to go down that road.\n HHS-OIG will review interactions between the FDA and outside parties, policies and procedures, and interrogate the FDA\u2019s compliance with those procedures. The review will cover the Aduhelm review process but will also interrogate how the pathway was used to approve other drugs as well.\n In a   statement on Twitter  Woodcock also said that the FDA will \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the HHS-OIG review.\n \u201cS hould the HHS OIG identify any actionable items and provide the agency with any recommendations, the FDA would review those expeditiously to determine the best course of action,\u201d she said.\n Should actions be required, they could have significant ramifications for drugs in the future, as this pathway is already an attractive option for other companies pursuing Alzheimer\u2019s drugs.\n Eli Lilly, for instance, is also working on an Alzheimer\u2019s drug called donanemab, has released   exploratory findings  from a Phase II trial showing that the drug lowered levels of amyloid and other biomarkers, and was associated with patient improvements. However, the bulk of the results rest on the drug\u2019s efficacy against biomarkers of Alzheimer\u2019s, rather than individual patient outcomes.\n In a   Q2 earnings call this week , Eli Lilly\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Medical officer, Daniel M. Skovronsky,\u00a0 noted that the FDA\u2019s approval of Aduhelm \u201c reflects a shift in policy and sets a new path for Alzheimer\u2019s drug approval in the U.S,\u201d and  Eli Lilly still intends to file for FDA approval for donanemab using the FDA accelerated approval pathway by the end of the year.\n But, that\u2019s the same pathway that will now be under investigation by HHS-OIG.\n Still, we might not see results anytime soon, so it is unclear how this news will impact future Alzheimer\u2019s drugmakers seeking to capitalize on a perceived \u201cshift in policy.\u201d The report is

"note_en": "The provision in the bill, which is actually a piece of bipartisan legislation called the Reduce Impaired Driving for Everyone Act that was introduced in April 2021,  would direct the U.S. Department of Transportation to establish a technology safety standard for automakers within three years. Automakers would then have another two years to comply and implement tech that detects and prevents drunk driving. Reuters was the first to   notice the language .\n While the provision doesn\u2019t dictate what type of tech has to be in these vehicles, industry experts believe that companies developing camera-based driver monitoring systems (DMS) stand to benefit the most. DMS systems are already mature in the auto industry, representing a technological byproduct of autonomous driving developments. While the auto industry explores self-driving cars as a way to drastically reduce road deaths in the future, advocates and regulators say there\u2019s room to use some of this tech to solve problems that exist  now,\u00a0like drunk or distracted driving.\n \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the U.S. Senate this week potentially opens the door to a camera-based real-time solution, which will be the first time that the U.S. automakers will have the ability and the requirement to look at real-time physiological changes in your body that occur when you are inebriated,\u201d Dr. Mike Lenn\u00e9, chief science and innovation officer at Seeing Machines told TechCrunch. \u201cThere are distinct reliable changes to the way you scan the environment, to the way your eyes respond to stimuli, which is why the police use that \u2018follow the finger\u2019 test.\u201d\n The system would have to monitor the performance of a driver to detect impairment and prevent or limit vehicle operation if impairment is detected; detect whether BAC (blood alcohol concentration) is equal to or greater than the legal limit, potentially preventing operation of the vehicle at all; or a combination of both systems.\n Cameras aren\u2019t the only solution that has been trotted out in recent years.\n The Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS) program, a technology that\u2019s been developed in partnership between the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), has advocated using a breath or touch-based approach to determine BAC levels. The touch-based approach involves measuring BAC through the skin\u2019s surface by shining an infrared light through the driver\u2019s fingertip.   According to DADSS , the current timeline for bringing the breath-based approach to vehicles is by 2024, and the touch-based approach by 2025.\n  Lenn\u00e9 argues that a camera-based approach would be far more successful than a breath or touch-based approach because BAC levels can rise within minutes. Someone could theoretically down a bunch of shots immediately before getting behind the wheel and it wouldn\u2019t show up on a reading for several minutes. Or they could get wasted while driving. And BAC detection doesn\u2019t help at all when it comes to drug-impaired driving.\n  Moves are already being made in Europe to encourage automakers to include drunk driving detection technology, specifically through camera-based DMS approaches, whereas most of the discussion on this type of tech in the U.S. has been, until recently, focused on DMS for assisted driving and Level 2 autonomous driving and above. (According to the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 2 autonomy means the vehicle has combined functions like steering and acceleration but requires the driver to remain engaged.)\n The U.S. provision could propel an industry that has already seen growth in recent years as automakers like GM and Ford implement hands-free advanced driver assistance systems.\n \u201cFrom an integration viewpoint, it\u2019s actually not a step change at all from what the OEMs are doing right now for distracted driving and drowsy driving with camera-based DMS. It\u2019s just another feature to offer, another algorithm on the chip, if you like,\u201d Lenn\u00e9 said.\n  \u201cBillions of dollars have gone into developing the technology to make AVs a reality but they are really far off,\u201d Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), told TechCrunch. \u201cIn the process, automakers have developed a lot of technology that can help us right now in terms of saving lives. If this passes, it\u2019s going to be the biggest safety rulemaking that NHTSA has ever done in terms of lives saved, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. But the more we wait, the more we delay, the more people die.\u201d\n The technology is not at all far from market, said Lenn\u00e9, and he would know. Seeing Machines provides the DMS that is used in Super Cruise, GM\u2019s hands-free advanced driver assistance system. Super Cruise, once relegated to just one Cadillac model, has expanded in capability and GM\u2019s portfolio and is now in the Cadillac CT6, CT4, CT5, Escalade and Chevrolet Bolt. Seeing Machine\u2019s tech is also used in the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class and EQS sedans.\n \u201cOnce it\u2019s regulated, we can expect to see more entrants to the market because what this does is it creates a top-down demand,\u201d said Lenn\u00e9. \u201cIt takes it out of the consumers\u2019 hands and tells vehicles they must have these safety features, so the market size will increase dramatically, and so will the market opportunity.\u201d\n The global DMS market is estimated to surpass $2.1 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% from this year,  according to IndustryARC. Top-down demand due to regulations like the infrastructure bill will certainly increase demand, but it won\u2019t make the problem easier to solve.\n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to assess what\u2019s going on in someone\u2019s head, and that\u2019s really different from having a forward-facing radar that\u2019s trying to look at what\u2019s 30 meters in front of you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to interpret whether or not this person is safe to drive. So it\u2019s a really difficult technical problem to solve. Our company is 21 years old. Smart Eye has been around for over 10 years. Whilst the market size has increased dramatically, it\u2019s a hard problem to solve as a new entrant.\u201d\n Newcomers will face competition from established and large Tier 1 suppliers like Seeing Machines and Smart Eye, a Swedish computer vision company that people familiar with the industry say works with Ford (Ford did not confirm or deny this). IndustryARC also names major players as Faurecia, Aptiv PLC, Bosch, Denso, Continental AG and others. But new players are finding their way into the scene, like Israel-based Cipia, formerly Eyesight Technology, and Sweden-based Tobii Tech.\n  More entrants to market means more advancements to the technology. Smart Eye\u2019s recent acquisition of   emotion-detection startup Affectiva for $73.5 million  hints at the potential future applications of DMS in passenger vehicles. Today it might be distracted, drowsy or drunk driving, but in a few years DMS could detect other types of drug impairment, cognitive impairments or even road rage.\n Tobii, an eye-tracker technology company, just announced its entrance into the DMS market, a space it\u2019s been exploring for the past few years as it has watched the legislative changes happening first in Europe and now in the U.S.\n While a new entrant to the automotive space, Tobii has been in the eye tracking space since 2001, working in industries like marketing, scientific research, virtual reality, gaming and more. Anand Srivatsa, Tobii\u2019s division CEO, told TechCrunch he thinks one of the biggest challenges will be scaling across different populations, given the different eye shapes of different ethnicities, which he says puts Tobii at an advantage, even with its limited automotive experience.\n  \u201cBecause of this long history, we have what it takes to deliver a full solution from a component level all the way to end software because we\u2019ve done it in other parts of our business,\u201d Srivatsa told TechCrunch. \u201cSome of our automotive partners see that as a unique capability from Tobii where we can talk about the compute that is needed for eye tracking because we build our own asix, we\u2019ve built our own sensor. We have end user software in some aspects of our business, so we understand the implications and the constraints of each of these parts of the stack, and we can work with them to create a more disruptive solution. And that\u2019s something that I think is going to be quite important in this space. How do you reduce the total cost of the solution to allow it to scale efficiently across all cars?\u201d\n Srivatsa also said there\u2019s room to extend into other spaces the biometrics or physiological signals that eye tracking yields, reconfiguring information based on outside road conditions or what else is going on in the car in a way that optimizes the tech to ensure drivers are spending the bulk of their time looking at the road.\n \u201cWhat I am hoping and dreaming for is technologies like forward collision warning, or blind spot warning or even the lane swerving warnings help me out when I need it most by understanding if I\u2019m becoming complacent or tired, perhaps distracted, and then adjust how the systems perform, the warning timing and things like that, based on what I need in the moment,\u201d Kelly Funkhouser, program manager of vehicle interface testing and head of connected and automated vehicles at Consumer Reports, told TechCrunch . \u201cCounter to that is I would like it to not bother me and nag and annoy me when I am fully paying attention. I\u2019m like \u2018Yeah I know exactly what I\u2019m doing, I am purposely driving over this line so that I don\u2019t hit the mom and kids.\u2019 \u201d\n Lenn\u00e9 said there\u2019s a potential for driver monitoring systems that capture what is really going on inside of a car to become more personalized in order to provide a better driving experience.\n \u201cI think in all of this, writing a better driving experience is absolutely pivotal,\u201d said Lenn\u00e9. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do that, it risks not being accepted by the consumers.\u201d\n  Automakers have been a part of the conversation regarding drunk driving technology for years. Back in 2007,   Nissan revealed a drunk driving concept car  that would use alcohol odor sensors, facial monitoring and vehicle operational behavior to detect driver impairment.\n In the same year,   Toyota announced a similar system  that it said would be in cars by 2009. More recently,   Volvo announced in 2019  that it would install cameras and sensors in cars to monitor drivers for signs of being drunk or distracted and then signal the vehicle to intervene, but that tech is designed for Volvo\u2019s SPA2 architecture for hands-free driving, which hasn\u2019t been released yet. The bottom line is without legislation mandating drunk driving prevention and detection, automakers haven\u2019t really moved forward on implementing the tech, despite much of the building blocks being in place already.\n Manning thinks that\u2019s because automakers want to be able to upcharge for safety features.\n \u201cAutomakers want to test their supercomputers on the open road, but they don\u2019t want to put the money and time and energy into solving drunk driving, because they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s their responsibility, and they don\u2019t want this rule-making,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fully expect that they\u2019re going to fight us tooth and nail throughout the rule-making process.\u201d\n Representatives from GM and Ford could not be reached for comment, but John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which worked with NHTSA on the DADSS program, told TechCrunch that the auto industry is committed to supporting public and private efforts to address this threat to road safety.\n \u201cWe appreciate the efforts of congressional leaders and other stakeholders to advance a legislative approach that provides NHTSA the ability to review all potential technologies as options for federal regulation and, consistent with the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, to make a well-informed decision as to whether any specific technologies meet the standard for consumer vehicles,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 02:03:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6280\u672f,driving",

Of course, that interest doesn\u2019t make anyone immune from the difficulties of launching a robotics startup.\n  Last month, apple-picking robotics firm Abundant  confirmed it was closing up shop, noting, \u201cAfter a series of promising commercial trials with prototype apple harvesters, the company was unable to raise enough investment funding to continue development and launch a production system,\u201d the company noted at the time.\n An acquisition seems like a reasonable outcome for a company like Bear Flag.

intelligence models to help place thousands of 5G wireless transmitters for optimal performance.\n  Later this year, the company will begin a multibillion-dollar rollout of midband spectrum, which expands coverage of its existing ultra wideband 5G wireless service.\n  Maximizing coverage with the least number of transmitters is a priority, said Shankar Arumugavelu, senior vice president and global chief information officer of Verizon.\n  \u201cWhen we build out these networks, these are very capital-intensive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure that we are being very judicious in terms of how we are investing our capital.\u201d\n    The models, designed by in-house data scientists and other employees, factor in a number of variables that can alter the strength of 5G signals, like buildings, bridges, terrain, the position of the transmitter, as well as other transmitters nearby.\n    Verizon, along with rivals  AT&amp;T  and T-Mobile US Inc., is racing to build out nationwide 5G service,  a yearslong effort slowed by the lack of available airwaves for fast transmission and long signal ranges, and by the deployment of new network equipment, analysts have said.\n  The largest U.S. carrier, Verizon began using AI models in 2018 to determine the best spots to install transmitters for its ultra wideband spectrum and is using AI again for its midband spectrum, considered the sweet spot in terms of range and speed. Verizon expects to cover 100 million people with midband spectrum by March 2022, according to the company.\n  \u201cWithout AI, we would not be able to do this. Period,\u201d Mr. Arumugavelu said.\n  In a U.S. government airwaves auction earlier this year, Verizon  landed more than half of the midband spectrum.\n  The carrier will pay  more than $50 billion for those airwaves and related expenses and is planning a total of $10 billion in capital expenditures over the next three years to expand its midband range, the WSJ has previously reported.\n      T-Mobile, which is also bringing out its midband 5G network, has used AI models to help engineers prioritize the locations for upgrading its 4G gear to 5G, said Grant Castle, vice president of device engineering and technology labs.\n  So-called small cell 5G transmitters, or antennas, are about the size of a backpack and are placed on vertical structures like utility poles or buildings.\n  Verizon\u2019s AI system can point to the best such perches by weighing various factors within specific ZIP Codes and how well the signal could cover the area, Mr. Arumugavelu said. Using computer-vision technology, the models can analyze spatial and geographic elements\u2014bridges, trees and building heights around specific intersections, for instance\u2014and find the most viable spot for a 5G transmitter, he added.\n  The technology can also recommend the best positioning for the antennas so that the signal covers the area without causing interference with other antennas nearby, he said.\n  Billions of dollars are at stake in the rollout of midband 5G spectrum, which is why Verizon is relying on AI, said Sid Nag, vice president of research for cloud and edge computing at technology research firm  Gartner\n  \u201cThey have to be very precise and clinical to identify the places where they are going to place the nodes,\u201d he said.\n  Businesses are expected to adopt 5G faster than consumers, partly because of the technology\u2019s potential to enable connectivity for drones, autonomous vehicles and remote healthcare, Mr. Nag said.\n  Verizon and other carriers are also focused on making sure the 5G nodes are in just the right spots because they want their customers to be as satisfied as possible with the service, he said.\n      Deloitte

These &#34;clearly violated&#34; company policies, according to the CCDH.\n &#34;As a result of their failure to enforce their own rules, social media platforms like Facebook have become safe places to spread racism and propaganda against Jews,&#34; states the report, titled &#34;Failure to Act.&#34;\n By the numbers: Facebook removed 14 out of 129 posts reported to it (10.9%); Twitter removed 15 of 137 reports (11%); TikTok took down 22 of 119 posts reported (18.5%); Instagram acted in 52 of 277 of cases (18.8%) and YouTube pulled 11 of the 52 posts it was alerted to (21.2%).\n Of note: &#34;Extremist anti-Jewish hate is not acted on: platforms failed to act on 80% of posts containing Holocaust denial, 74% of posts alleging the blood libel, 70% of racist caricatures of Jewish people and 70% of neo-Nazi posts,&#34; per  a statement from the CCDH, a nongovernmental organization based in the U.S. and United Kingdom.\n &#34;Instagram, TikTok and Twitter allow hashtags used for antisemitic content such as #rothschild, #fakejews and #killthejews that were used in posts identified by our report that gained over 3.3 million impressions.&#34;\n The big picture: The report findings come despite social media giants  announcing steps in recent months to address hate speech on their platforms.\n Notably, Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg announced last October that the tech giant would be expanding its hate speech policies to ban any content that &#34;denies or distorts the Holocaust.&#34;\n What they&#39;re saying: A Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement that &#34;given the alarming rise in anti-Semitism around the world, we have and will continue to take significant action through our policies&#34; by removing antisemitic posts &#34;while educating people about it with authoritative information.&#34;\n &#34;These reports do not account for the fact that we have taken action on 15 times the amount of hate speech since 2017, the prevalence of hate speech is decreasing on our platform and of the hate speech we remove, 97% was found before someone reported it to us,&#34; the spokesperson said.\n A YouTube spokesperson said in an emailed statement that the company appreciated the CCDH&#39;s feedback, and that it has established a &#34;robust  hate speech policy,&#34; making &#34;significant progress in our ability to quickly remove hateful content that violates our Community Guidelines, including antisemitic content.&#34;\n YouTube has &#34;removed over 85,000 videos for violating our hate speech policy,&#34; as outlined in its  Q1 2021 report,&#34; the spokesperson added.\n Of the 52 videos evaluated by CCDH, YouTube removed 30 videos for violating its hate speech policy, 13 of which were removed before the nonprofit&#39;s report was released, according to YouTube. It also terminated two channels.\n A Twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Axios that &#34;improving the speed and scale of our rule enforcement is a top priority for us.&#34;\n &#34;We recognize that there&#39;s more to do, and we&#39;ll continue to listen and integrate stakeholders&#39; feedback in these ongoing efforts,&#34; the spokesperson added.\n Representatives for the other companies named in the report did not immediately respond to Axios&#39; request for comment.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:52:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5a92\u4f53,media,axios", "title": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5de8\u5934\u672a\u80fd\u5220\u9664\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53cd\u72b9\u592a\u4e3b\u4e49\u5e16\u5b50", "title_en": "Social Media Giants Failing To Remove Most Antisemitic Posts", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.axios.com/study-social-media-giants-antisemitic-posts-facebook-59b703f8-b6d8-4921-b0c2-626afd53d1c2.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5a92\u4f53", "media", "axios"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e03c3a3a172d3da3825739e82ff897d9.png", "infoid": 1071581, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4eca\u5929\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0cYelp \u5c06\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u5206\u4eab\u4ed6\u4eec\u5173\u4e8e COVID-19 \u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u6709\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u5c5e\u6027\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u4e2d\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u4eab\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u662f\u5426\u5b8c\u5168\u63a5\u79cd\u4e86\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u5b9a\u5ba2\u6237\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176 Yelp for Business \u5e10\u6237\u5217\u51fa\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u5141\u8bb8\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7528\u6237\u627e\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u6700\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5217\u51fa\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u52a0\u5165\u4e86 Yelp \u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u5e74\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u957f\u4e32\u4ee5\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u4e3a\u91cd\u70b9\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u521d\u671f\uff0c\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u6307\u5b9a\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u63d0\u4f9b\u865a\u62df\u670d\u52a1\u8fd8\u662f\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u6237\u5916\u7528\u9910\u6216\u4e3a\u5458\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\u53e3\u7f69\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0cYelp \u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5e76\u672a\u53d7\u5230\u70ed\u70c8\u6b22\u8fce\u3002\u53bb\u5e74 3 \u6708\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u8feb\u64a4\u9500\u4e00\u9879\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5373\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u7b79\u6b3e\u6d3b\u52a8\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u6570\u4e07\u5bb6\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u9875\u9762\u4e2d\u3002\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5708\u5b50\u91cc\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 Yelp \u4e5f\u5728\u5f3a\u8c03\u5b83\u6240\u505a\u7684\u9002\u5ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4f01\u4e1a\u56e0\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5ba1\u67e5\u8f70\u70b8\u3002\u5b83\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u9009\u62e9\u663e\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5220\u9664\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5ba2\u6237\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u5728 2021 \u5e74\u671f\u95f4\uff0cYelp \u8868\u793a\u5df2\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u6570\u5343\u6761\u8fdd\u53cd\u5176 COVID \u5185\u5bb9\u6307\u5357\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002", "note_en": "Yelp will let businesses share their policies on COVID-19 vaccinations, the company announced today. There are a pair of new attributes businesses can add to their profiles; one to share whether their staff are fully vaccinated, and one to specify whether customers will be required to provide proof of vaccination. Businesses can list the attributes via their Yelp for Business accounts. allowing users of the service to find places with policies they\u2019re most comfortable with.\n The ability to list vaccination policies joins a long list of pandemic-focused features Yelp has added to its service over the past year. Early on in the pandemic, the service let businesses specify  whether they offer virtual or contact-free services, and  later expanded this to other safety measures like whether they offer outdoor dining, or have a face masks policy for staff.\n   But some of Yelp\u2019s attempts to help businesses during the pandemic have been less warmly received. In March last year it was forced to  reverse a controversial decision to  automatically add fundraisers to the pages of tens of thousands of small businesses.\n Vaccination policies have become controversial in some circles, so Yelp is also emphasizing the moderation work it does to prevent businesses from being review-bombed as a result of their choices. It says it\u2019s proactively monitoring the pages of businesses that choose to display these policies, and that it will remove reviews that focus on them rather than a customer\u2019s actual experience with a business. Over the course of 2021, Yelp says it\u2019s removed thousands of reviews for violating its COVID Content Guidelines.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:52:04", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

www.befrienders.org \u4e0a\u627e\u5230", "note_en": "WG Sebald\u2019s writing on the Holocaust was driven by the anger and distress he felt over his father\u2019s service in Hitler\u2019s army\n    His books are saturated with despair. Over and over again, his emotionally traumatised characters are caught \u2013 inescapably \u2013 in plots that doom them to a life of anguish. Often, they kill themselves.\n Now, the psychological wounds and suicidal thoughts that blighted  WG Sebald\u2019s own life and secretly inspired him to begin writing fiction are to be laid bare for the first time in a forthcoming biography.\n  \u201cWhat lay behind his writing was this great trauma that he was expressing and suffering,\u201d said Carole Angier, author of   Speak, Silence: In Search of WG Sebald, the first major biography of the German author who wrote  The Emigrants and   Austerlitz.\n The book, which will be published later this month, sheds new light on why Sebald often chose to write about the Jewish and German tragedy of the  Holocaust.\n Lauded as one of the world\u2019s greatest writers when he died aged 57 in a car crash 20 years ago, Sebald always had a troubled relationship with his father, a German soldier who fought in the second world war, the biography will show.\n  He fought with his father \u2013 an \u201cold-fashioned authoritarian man\u201d \u2013 his whole life, but their relationship took a turn for the worse when, at the age of 17, Sebald was shown a film at school about concentration camps. It was the early 1960s, and at the time, Angier says, \u201cthe Holocaust was never spoken of in German families. That was Sebald\u2019s first visual and visceral encounter with it.\u201d\n The film traumatised him. \u201cHe saw his father as a Nazi, who had served without question in Hitler\u2019s army.\u201d\n Painfully aware that his parents had accepted and benefited from Hitler\u2019s rule, he began to find their silence on the subject agonising. \u201cHe could never get his parents to talk about the war,\u201d Angier says. \u201cHe would accuse his father, and his father would clam up and say he didn\u2019t remember. Then he would get angry and they would have a row.\u201d\n At around the same time, Sebald \u2013 who was brought up as a Catholic \u2013 began to question the church. \u201cHe became a dissenter.\u201d\n He grew depressed and eventually had a breakdown. \u201cHe said later he came \u2018close to the edge of his reason\u2019 at this time, and that this can happen if someone\u2019s identity that\u2019s been built up over many years is destroyed or falls to bits,\u201d Angier says.\n He would later explore these feelings in  Austerlitz, his final masterpiece, about a Jewish refugee whose parents perished in the Holocaust. Adopted by Christians after arriving in Britain on the  Kindertransport as a small child, the refugee discovers his Jewish identity on the brink of adulthood and then, after repressing the trauma of what happened to him, has a nervous breakdown later in life.\n Sebald hid his own breakdown from his family and never sought any formal treatment. He continued to suffer from serious episodes of depression, anxiety, panic and \u201cterrible feelings of isolation\u201d throughout his life, and ended up having three major breakdowns in total, the biography reveals for the first time.\n  The second occurred during his first term as a 22-year-old teacher at Manchester University. Overwhelmed by his feelings of alienation, hopelessness and panic, Sebald fell into another \u201cacute depression\u201d, similar to that of the narrator of Max Ferber\u2019s story in  The Emigrants. \u201cHe later confirmed that what he wrote there was true of himself, that he went through a crisis during that time.\u201d\n At the time, he confessed to a friend he thought he was \u201cgoing mad\u201d and that \u201csometimes he\u2019d like to let go, but there were people who were holding him back\u201d.\n Angier assumes this was his family: \u201cI think he was suicidal, or had suicidal thoughts, throughout his life.\u201d It was at this point that he started writing fiction. \u201cHe wrote his first novel, which has never been published. The hero is a very gloomy, hypersensitive character. It\u2019s definitely entirely based on himself \u2013 it\u2019s a very autobiographical piece.\u201d\n It was while he was teaching at Manchester University in his early 20s, in this vulnerable state that he got to know the first Jewish person he had ever met, his \u201cwonderful\u201d landlord, Peter Jordan, a German refugee. \u201cHere was a real person, who had grown up exactly like him, spoke his language, lived in the same way, skied on the same hills \u2013 and he\u2019d had to flee and his parents were murdered. Meeting him brought home to Sebald the human reality of these terrible crimes.\u201d\n Sebald \u2013 who, by this time, had started calling himself Max, instead of Winfried, his Nazi-approved birth name \u2013 was struck by one particular aspect of Jordan\u2019s behaviour. Like Sebald\u2019s parents, Jordan did not like to speak about the war.\n \u201cHe did that typical refugee thing of not thinking about it, not facing what happened to his parents. That is the story that Sebald is always telling, of these people who are both the survivors and victims of  Nazism, forced into exile, carrying a burden for the rest of their lives and trying not to think about it, to avoid trauma.\u201d In Sebald\u2019s books, however, this strategy never works.\n  Later, he wanted to reproduce in his readers the same sense of shocking reality he had felt, so he put photos of Peter Jordan and his family in  The Emigrants and pretended they belonged to his fictional character Max Ferber. \u201cThe character\u2019s history is the history of Peter Jordan and all the photographs are of his family,\u201d Angier reveals.\n Sebald\u2019s final breakdown, at the age of 35, was the most severe. On a journey through Italy, he started to imagine men were pursuing him around Verona with murderous intent. \u201cHe felt absolutely terrified and convinced that all these terrible, sinister things were happening around him.\u201d He feared he was going mad, an experience he recounts in his first published work of fiction,  Vertigo. \u201cHe was in a very, very disturbed state.\u201d\n He tells a friend later that when he visited Milan cathedral, he got to the top and \u201cnearly fell into the abyss\u201d.\n  It was this breakdown that \u201ctipped him over\u201d into serious writing. \u201cThat breakdown was crucial. It is then that he begins to write literary fiction. He fills his characters with his own despair.\u201d Writing fiction allowed him to express the trauma he was feeling and hiding from the world. \u201cHe always said he only started to write to get away from his academic routine. That was not true. He started to write to explore and deal with this terrible depression that he\u2019d fallen into. And it wasn\u2019t wholly personal, in fact the main trauma was the historical burden he was carrying.\u201d\n But Angier is keen to point out that his books also display his deadpan sense of humour. \u201cPeople think his books are incredibly pessimistic and gloomy, which they are, but he was also mordantly funny. Humour was a coping mechanism \u2013 a socially acceptable way of expressing his gloom. And he was very charming and funny in real life.\u201d\n In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by email-ing  jo@samaritans.org or  jo@samaritans.ie.

June,  Unity quietly updated its licensing policy requirements for developers working on \u201cclosed platforms\u201d like Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Google Stadia.\n  Unity developers starting new projects will now need either a Unity Pro license or a Preferred Platform License Key to develop for these platforms.\n  The news was delivered internally to Unity game developers on the Unity GameCore forum, and went into effect on June 30 th.\n  A Unity spokesperson confirmed to Gamasutra that the change took place, explaining that \u201cdeveloping for consoles is a complex undertaking for any studio and Unity has always recommended Unity Pro for development on these platforms.\u201d\n  The spokesperson also stressed that the change is for new developers working on new platform-approved projects that update to the 2021.2 tech stream. If your game is currently in development on an older version of Unity, you don\u2019t need Unity Pro at this time.\n  A handful of developers reached out to Gamasutra with concerns about this change because while Sony and Nintendo both make Preferred Platform License Keys available to developers, Microsoft does not. Previously if a developer had XDX (the Xbox Development SDK) on their computer, it apparently unlocked all Unity features for use on Xbox.\n  June\u2019s policy change renders that moot, and means a new developer working on an approved game for Xbox will need to pay for a Unity Pro license, which currently costs $1,800 per year per seat.\n  Unity previously required developers to use Unity Pro (or Enterprise) if their funding or revenue was greater than $200K\u00a0in the last 12 months. For smaller developers with less than $200K\u00a0in revenue or funding, Unity Plus and Unity Personal were options for development.\n  A spokesperson for Microsoft told Gamasutra that it the company is aware of the changes, but didn\u2019t indicate if the company would be creating its own Preferred Platform License Key program for developers. \u201cWe will continue to work with our development partners and engine providers, including Unity, to determine how to best support creators on Xbox,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n  They added that Microsoft is \u201cdeeply committed to independent developers and with our prioritization of the community accelerating, ensuring they have a clear path to success on Xbox and Windows.\u201d\n  Unity\u2019s changes here aren\u2019t exactly sweeping, since many developers working on the platform already pay for Unity Pro or have access to Preferred Platform License Keys. Some developers Gamasutra spoke with didn\u2019t even notice the change took place, or expressed indifference about how it would affect their future projects.\n  Those who are most impacted are developers whose projects aren\u2019t approved yet who are interested in shipping their game on Xbox or any other platform that doesn\u2019t provide the partnered license keys, and who don\u2019t quite have the cash for Unity Pro.\n  Developers reaching out to Gamasutra also expressed concern over the decision to announce this change by way of an internal forum that requires you to sign a non-disclosure agreement to access\u2014new developers most impacted by the policy change might not know about the shift in economics for publishing on these specific platforms.\n  It\u2019s\u00a0concern worth highlighting. Hopefully Microsoft is in the process of restoring the same level of access for Unity developers that was previously available with XDX.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:51:22", "source_domain":

Raft is famed for its understandability (relative to other consensus algorithms such as  Paxos) yet some aspects of the protocol still require careful treatment. For instance, determining when it is safe for a leader to commit commands from previous leaders or when it is safe for servers to delete or overwrite commands in their logs.\n Recently, byzantine agreement protocols, such as  Tendermint,  Casper FFG, and  HotStuff, have utilized the abstraction of chains to decide a sequence of commands. This is instead of the usual approach of a mutable replicated log, as used by protocols such as  Multi-Paxos, Raft &amp;  PBFT. Previously, we described a simple rotating leader consensus algorithm,  Benign HotStuff, using this chain-based approach.\n In today\u2019s post, we continue to examine chain-based approaches to consensus by describing the Raft protocol using chaining. We call the resulting protocol  Chained Raft and it gives us a new (and arguably simpler) lens through which to view Raft and the problem of consensus more generally. Importantly, the switch from mutable to immutable state can make Raft easier to reason about. Reads within the protocol never become stale and we avoid the tricky question of when it is safe to overwrite state.  We are by no means the first to use immutability to reduce the complexity of distributed systems.\n  The aim of Raft and Chained Raft is to implement  state machine replication. Specifically, a set of servers each maintain a copy of a state machine and the consensus protocol must ensure that each state machine receives the same sequence of commands.\n Both algorithms take the same high-level approach of electing one server to be the  leader. Clients send commands to the leader and the leader copies them onto a majority of servers using the AppendEntries RPC before committing them to its state machine and replying to the clients. When the leader fails, another server is elected to be the leader using the RequestVotes RPC. This process involves a majority of servers to ensure that the new leader has a copy of all commands executed by the previous leader.\n  Just like Raft, Chained Raft takes place over a series of  terms, each with at most one leader. Each server stores its current term, which is initially 0 and increases over time.\n A  block contains a command (in practice, a batch of commands) and a pointer to a previous block. A block in Chained Raft is analogous to a log entry in Raft. Note that unlike log entries in Raft, blocks in Chained Raft do not contain indexes or terms.\n Each server starts with an empty  genesis block and adds blocks over time to form a  chain. This chain is analogous to a log in Raft. Below is an example chain, it begins with the genesis block (shown in grey) which is followed by three blocks containing the commands A, B &amp; C (shown in blue).\n  New blocks are created by the current leader, which then appends these blocks to the chains of its  followers using the AppendEntries RPC. A leader can commit a command to its state machine only once it has ensured that all future leaders will do the same.\n Unlike Raft\u2019s logs, these chains are immutable thus servers never delete or overwrite blocks. The chains may fork into multiple branches (and even sub-branches) when recovering from a leader failure, however, only one branch will ever be committed. The chain below has forked into two branches so only one of D or E &amp; F could be committed.\n  The  head of a chain is the most recently added block (aka the  tip). This block will not be pointed to by any other block in the chain. In other words, the head is always one of the leaves of the \u201ctree\u201d. Initially, the head of each chain is the genesis block and the head is updated each time a block (or sequence of blocks) is added. The head is used by servers to track which of the chain branches is most up to date.\n Each server maintains a  commit marker. The commit marker points to the highest block (furthest from the genesis block) in the chain which can safely be committed to a state machine. This is analogous to the commit index in Raft. The commit marker is initially set to the genesis block and progresses along the chain over time.\n All blocks on the path from the genesis block to the commit marker can be safely committed. In the example below, only command A can be committed.\n  If there is a path from a block $b$ to a block $b\u2019$ then we say that block $b$  extends block $b\u2019$. All blocks therefore extend the genesis block.\n As well as the current term, each server also stores the  last appended term, which is the term the server was in when it last appended a block to its chain. To put it another way, this was the term when the current head was appended. The last appended term is initially 0 and increases over time. The last appended term is always equal to or less than the current term. The last appended term in Chained Raft serves the same function as the last log term in Raft.\n  A leader commits a command by first creating a new block containing the command and a pointer to its current head, the newly created block is added to the leader\u2019s chain and the head is updated to the new block. The leader then replicates this block to its followers using the  AppendEntries RPC (as in Raft). Note that the log entries in Raft\u2019s AppendEntries RPC are replaced by blocks. The previous log index and previous log term in Raft\u2019s AppendEntries RPC can be omitted as block pointers now serve the same purpose.\n After checking the term of the AppendEntries RPC, a follower will add the received blocks to its chain provided it already has the block which is pointed to by the first new block. Otherwise, the follower will reply with false and the leader will retry the AppendEntries RPC, this time with the previous block too. This process will continue until the follower successfully adds the new blocks.\n Whenever a follower adds new blocks to a chain, its head is updated accordingly. If this is the first time this follower has appended blocks in this term then it will also update the last appended term. The next index and match index used by leaders in Raft to track the state of the follower\u2019s logs is replaced with the analogous  next markers and  match markers. Once the leader learns that the majority of servers have appended a block, the commit marker can be updated. The updated commit marker is included in subsequent AppendEntries RPCs.\n The example below shows the chains of three servers. The first server is a leader which has added a new block (command C) but has not yet sent the AppendEntries RPC to its followers.\n Below shows the same example after the leader has completed the AppendEntries RPC with the followers. Both followers now have a copy of command C and the leader has updated its commit marker as a result. The followers have also learned that the previous block (command B) can be committed as the leader included its commit marker in the AppendEntries RPC.\n  Leader election in Chained Raft works much the same as it does in Raft. When a follower becomes a  candidate, it votes for itself and sends a  RequestVote RPC to all servers. Instead of including the last log term and last log index, the RequestVote RPC includes the candidate\u2019s head and last appended term.\n Like Raft, a follower votes for a candidate only if the follower has not already voted for another candidate in this term and the candidate\u2019s chain (or log) is at least as up to date as the follower\u2019s. A candidate\u2019s chain is at least as up to date, provided either:\n the candidate\u2019s last appended term is greater than the follower\u2019s last appended term or\n  the candidate\u2019s last appended term is equal to the follower\u2019s last appended term and either:\n Once a candidate receives votes from a majority of followers then it becomes a leader.\n The example below shows the state of three servers. Only the first and second servers could become leaders. The first server could receive votes from any server. The second server could receive a vote from the third server as it has a greater last appended term but it will not receive a vote from the first server. Neither the first or second server will vote for the third server.\n Consider what might happen next if the second server becomes the leader. The new leader will add the next block (command D) to its head (command B) and replicate it using the AppendEntries RPC. As shown below this would create a fork on the first server.\n A newly elected leader may have uncommitted blocks from the previous leaders. In this case, it replicates them to the followers using the AppendEntries RPC when it adds the first new block in the current term. As per usual in Raft, once this new block has been replicated onto a majority of servers, the leader can update its commit marker and thus commits the blocks from previous leaders as well. Notice that a leader will therefore always send AppendEntries RPCs containing at least one new block from its current term.\n  The chain on each server grows over time. In practice, once a commit marker passes a fork in the chain, the other branches can be safely garbage collected. These branches, which should be very rare, represent the \u201croads not taken\u201d by Chained Raft. These forks only occur when a leader fails and the new leader\u2019s chain does not contain all of the blocks added by the failed leader. It is important to note that these \u201cmissed blocks\u201d cannot have been committed by a previous leader before it failed.\n Consider the example below. Before the commit marker passes the fork, the chain includes two branches, command D and commands E/F. Later, once the commit marker has been updated to command E then the branch containing command D can be safely deleted.\n   The  Raft paper (Figure 3) identifies five properties which are useful for proving the safety of Raft. The analogous properties for Chained Raft are below:\n    In other words, leaders only move their heads forwards along a chain. Note that this is slightly different from Raft\u2019s leader append-only which states that \u201ca leader never overwrites or deletes entries in its log; it only appends new entries.\u201d. In Chained Raft, all servers only append new blocks.\n Log Matching property: If two chains contain the same block then the path from the genesis block to the block on both chains will be the same.\n This is achieved by the requirement that servers only append a new block if they already have the block pointed to by the new block.\n Leader Completeness: If a block is committed in a given term then the heads of the leaders for all greater terms will either be the block or will extend the block.\n Consider a block $b$ that was first committed by the leader in term $t$. At least a majority of servers will at some point have had last appended terms of $t$ and heads which were $b$ or which extended $b$.\n We will use a proof by induction over the terms after $t$ to show leader completeness.\n Base case Consider what happens in the next term, $t+1$. If there is a leader in term $t+1$ then it received votes from a majority of servers. At least one server with a last appended term of $t$ and a head which is also either $b$ or extends $b$ must have voted for the leader. Since the leader cannot have a last appended term greater than $t$, the leader must have had the same last appended term ($t$) and a head which is equal to the server\u2019s head or extends it. Therefore, if term $t+1$ had a leader then $b$ will be present in the path from the genesis block to the leader\u2019s head.\n Inductive case Consider what happens in some term $t+k$. We assume that leader completeness holds up to term $t+k-1$. If there is a leader in term $t+k$ then it received votes from a majority of servers. At least one server which once had a last appended term $t$ and a head which is also either $b$ or extends $b$ must vote for the leader. Any leaders since will have added blocks that extend $b$. Therefore if the term $t+k$ has a leader then the leader\u2019s head will be $b$ or extend it.\n State Machine Safety: Each copy of the replicated state machine receives the same commands in the same order.\n Combining the previous properties and the fact that servers only commit commands when they are instructed to do so by the leader, gives us state machine safety.\n  Like Raft, Chained Raft guarantees liveness  after synchrony provided at least a majority of servers are up and communicating reliably  (caveats apply).\n The proof of liveness which we will skip for now is much the same for Raft and Chained Raft, however, the following idea is useful to note. From the leader append-only property we know that if two servers have the same last appended term then their heads are either the same or one head extends the other. This means that for any pair of servers at least one server could vote for the other and thus at least one server in any majority could be elected leader.\n   Benign HotStuff is a rotating leader protocol, where each leader (aka a  primary in Benign HotStuff) adds one block before handing over leadership to the next server. In contrast, Chained Raft is a stable leader protocol, where a leader adds blocks until it fails (or at least until another server believes it has failed).\n In benign HotStuff, the role of leader is rotated between servers in a round-robin fashion, whereas in Raft and Chained Raft, servers must gain votes from a majority of servers before becoming a leader.\n Benign Hotstuff takes the  \u201cRaft-style\u201d approach to consensus of assigning terms to blocks for their lifetime and thus blocks are not \u201cpromoted\u201d to greater terms by subsequent leaders, as is the case with \u201cPaxos-style\u201d consensus. Chained Raft avoids the question of what term to assign to blocks from previous terms by storing only the term of the head (using the last appended term).\n Like Benign HotStuff, Chained Raft requires the leader to copy uncommitted blocks (called  state transfer in Benign Hotstuff) to its followers alongside adding a new block in the current term. This restriction helps to simplify both algorithms as it means that the most recently added block, the head, is always from the latest leader.\n Note that the propose message in Benign HotStuff is analogous to the AppendEntries RPC request in Chained Raft and the vote message in Benign HotStuff is analogous to a combined AppendEntries RPC response and RequestVote RPC response.\n Benign HotStuff stores a term with every block whereas Chained Raft only tracks the term of the current head (using the last appended term).\n  We have described Raft using append-only chains instead of mutable logs. Interestingly, Chained Raft and Raft are very similar protocols. Raft can be expressed naturally using chains as it already decides commands strictly in-order (unlike some other consensus protocols such as  Multi-Paxos).\n So, what do you think? Is Chained Raft simpler than the original Raft protocol? Would you be interested in seeing other log-based consensus algorithms such as  Multi-Paxos or  Fast Paxos described using chains? Let us know your thoughts on  twitter.\n Acknowledgment.

"note_en": "The federal government has banned Australians who normally live in other countries from returning home without needing government permission in a move branded as \u201cbarbaric.\u201d\n Until now, residents of other countries who are Australian are allowed to leave the country without applying for an exemption, but are regularly questioned at the border and required to prove that they live abroad as part of the international border bans brought in at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n  But on Thursday the government quietly changed the rule, effective from August 11, claiming it was a loophole.\n Now, according to the government\u2019s  explanatory statement tabled in Parliament, a person will have to demonstrate to the Australian Border Force Commissioner a \u201ccompelling reason for needing to leave Australian territory\u201d.\n  The amendment, which cannot be disallowed, \u201cwill reduce the pressure on Australia\u2019s quarantine capacity, reduce the risks posed to the Australian population from COVID-19, and assist in returning vulnerable Australians back home,\u201d the government said.\n Exemptions can be granted for business travel, but the government has previously said it intends to clamp down on the number of them being granted.\n The government did not issue a press release to alert the public to the change nor did Health Minister Greg Hunt, who tabled the amendment, raise it in any of his media interviews on Thursday.\n  \u201cThis does not stop Australians ordinarily resident outside Australia from departing. However, these people will now need to apply for an exemption,\u201d she said.\n  \u201cThe exemption\u2019s regime is based on health advice and enables people to travel if essential, but is ultimately about keeping Australians safe from overseas COVID transmission.\u201d\n  James Turbitt recently flew back to Australia from Belgium to try and say goodbye to his seriously ill mother.\n He missed out on seeing her one last time because he was told to hire a charter flight worth tens of thousands of dollars to qualify for an exemption to leave hotel quarantine. He is currently in the country sorting out her affairs before returning home.\n Turbitt said the government\u2019s changes were aimed at citizens like him and that it was \u201cbarbaric and counterproductive\u201d.\n  \u201cI came back for the passing of my mother, I was locked in a hotel room while she passed away, denied an exemption to see her, and now I am subjected to proving my life overseas, in order to leave again?\u201d the 35-year-old said.\n \u201cMy life is overseas, my work is there, my partner is there, I\u2019ve just lost my mother, and now I can be denied to go back and seek comfort from my partner?\n \u201cShe has not been allowed in with me and now I might be denied leaving? What has this country come to?\n \u201cThe [Queensland] Premier goes overseas to the Olympics, the Prime Minister goes to check out his family history in England.\n  \u201cNow someone who doesn\u2019t even want to be in this country is potentially going to be forcibly detained in a place he doesn\u2019t want to be. I do not agree that it is fair,\u201d he said.\n Australia is alone in banning its citizens, temporary visa holders, permanent residents and dual citizens from leaving the country under the international travel ban brought in March 2020.\n It is also the only country to have  temporarily threatened some of its citizens with the threat of jail and massive fines if they tried to return home from India during the height of its recent COVID wave. Several Australians who had been trying to get home died in India.\n Australia is also alone in the world in locking out its citizens through a cap on the number of people who can enter the country in a single week \u2013 recently halved to around 3000 at the request of several Labor premiers.\n This has resulted in a queue of more than 35,000 Australians around the world who are trying to get home at any one time but can\u2019t because of the restrictions on hotel quarantine spaces.\n The Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day\u2019s most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights.

Yelp for Business \u5e10\u6237\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u3002", "note_en": "While there is no federal mandate for businesses to require proof of vaccination, some cities are introducing their own policies. Recently, New York City became the first to  require proof of vaccination for indoor restaurants and gyms, and, San Francisco is  now exploring a similar set of mandates. Other cities may choose to follow suit in the future.\n In addition,  local  business  owners across the U.S. are implementing their own measures outside of federal or state guidance, including requiring masks or proof of vaccination for customers, or requiring their staff to be vaccinated. These choices often come at price, as the businesses risk social media backlash and bad reviews from the anti-vaccine crowd.\n Yelp\u2019s new features will represent an attempt to help mitigate that reaction, the company explains.\n  Yelp says it will proactively leverage a combination of automated systems and human moderators to safeguard businesses from attacks from customers if a business opts to activate either of the two new options related to their Covid vaccine policies.\n Though the company has long since had  systems in place to address \u201creview bombing\u201d incidents, Yelp says the practice has gotten worse in recent months.\n  In the past, businesses that gained negative public attention may have had an influx of reviews from those who didn\u2019t have a first-hand experience with the business in question, which violates Yelp\u2019s policy. Yelp may then alert visitor to the business\u2019s page that there\u2019s the potential for fake reviews or that thee had been spikes in unusual activity. The company will sometimes even temporarily block users from being able to leave reviews. And in some cases, Yelp will also need to  remove false reviews or those that otherwise violate its policies.\n But since January 2021, Yelp says it\u2019s had to place over 100  Unusual Activity Alerts on its pages in response to a business gaining public attention for their Covid health and safety practices. This has included if a business notified customers that vaccinations were required for its employees or for its patrons.\n As a result, Yelp has had to remove nearly 4,500 reviews for violating its content guidelines.\n  As Yelp was already handling these types of incidents, it\u2019s now more formally introducing a way for businesses to flag their Covid policies through the new products.\n The company notes it put a similar system in place when it launched our  Black-owned attribute in June 2020 and again followed the same process for other identity attributes (e.g.  Latinx-owned,  Asian-owned, and  LGBTQ-owned) by proactively monitoring business pages that activated these attributes for any hateful, racist or other harmful content that violated its content guidelines.\n The company tells TechCrunch there was demand for its new Covid policy feature from business owners, as well.\n  \u201cBoth business owners and consumers have expressed interest in Yelp releasing vaccine-related attributes,\u201d said Noorie Malik, Yelp\u2019s VP of User Operations. \u201cFor many months we\u2019ve seen businesses implement vaccine requirements for both their customers and staff. As a result, we\u2019ve also seen a rise in reviews focused on people\u2019s stance on Covid vaccinations rather than their actual experience with the business,\u201d Malik noted.\n The businesses want to be assured that their page will be more actively monitored for false reviews when they choose to share this information.\n Yelp, of course, understands that if allowed its reviews platform to become a place that veered away from customers detailing their first-hand experiences, it service overall would become less useful.\n \u201cYelp has always served as a trusted source of information on local businesses, helping the millions of people that come to Yelp every day make informed spending decisions,\u201d Malik said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that consumers have a resource for relevant first-hand information when engaging with a business. You could argue this is even more important during a public health crisis, making reviews from relevant first-hand consumer experiences critical.\u201d\n The feature is rolling out now and can be found on the  Yelp for Business account page.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 01:06:29", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6dfb\u52a0,adds,\u4f01\u4e1a", "title": "Yelp \u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9\u4f01\u4e1a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u4eab\u4e0e\u75ab\u82d7\u76f8\u5173\u7684 Covid \u653f\u7b56", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tYelp adds tools that let businesses share their Covid policies related to vaccines\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/yelp-adds-tools-that-let-businesses-share-their-covid-policies-related-to-vaccines/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6dfb\u52a0", "adds", "\u4f01\u4e1a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "60045bfb6bb4930751583e2def80e90f.jpeg", "infoid": 1071570, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u5bb6\u82af\u7247\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9ad8\u901a\u4ee5\u6bcf\u80a1 37 \u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u51fa\u4ef7 46 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u83b7\u5f97\u516c\u53f8\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u7684\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u80a1\u4e1c\u200b\u200b\u6295\u7968\u3002 Veoneer \u548c Magna \u5728 7 \u6708\u4efd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u90fd\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6b64\u6b21\u6536\u8d2d\u3002 Veoneer \u662f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u8f66\u8f86\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u7ec4\u6709\u9650\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u4e0a\u53d8\u6362\u8f66\u9053\u6216\u7d27\u6025\u5236\u52a8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1 ADAS \u4e0e\u201c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u201d\u76f8\u53bb\u751a\u8fdc\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u4e14\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5f53\u4eca\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u65b0\u8f66\u4e2d\u3002\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u548c\u9ad8\u901a\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fc5\u901f\u5c55\u5f00\u7684\u7ade\u8d2d\u6218\u770b\u597d ADAS \u6280\u672f\u7684\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u5e0c\u671b\u4e0e\u4e00\u7ea7 ADAS \u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5927\u9646\u548c\u535a\u4e16\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u9ad8\u901a\u7684\u5e02\u503c\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a 1648 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800c\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u7684\u5e02\u503c\u4e3a 253 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u9ea6\u683c\u7eb3\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u63d0\u4ea4\u53cd\u6295\u6807\u3002\u5e02\u573a\u5bf9\u65b0\u51fa\u4ef7\u505a\u51fa\u4e86\u56de\u5e94\uff0cVeoneer \u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u5728\u5468\u4e09\u548c\u5468\u56db\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0a\u6da8\u4e86\u8fd1 7 \u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ece 31.22 \u7f8e\u5143\u4e0a\u6da8\u81f3 38.20 \u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5728 7 \u6708 23 \u65e5\u5ba3\u5e03\u51fa\u552e\u7ed9 Magna \u4e4b\u524d\uff0cVeoneer \u7684\u80a1\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u80a1 19.93 \u7f8e\u5143\u3002 Veoneer \u4e8e 2018 \u5e74\u4ece\u6c7d\u8f66\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u5236\u9020\u5546 Autoliv \u5206\u62c6\u51fa\u6765\u3002 \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e0e\u6c83\u5c14\u6c83\u6c7d\u8f66\u6210\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u540d\u4e3a Zenuity \u7684\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u5408\u8d44\u4f01\u4e1a\u540e\u6765\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e74 7 \u6708\u5206\u62c6\u3002 ADAS \u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u8fd8\u4e0e\u9ad8\u901a\u516c\u53f8\u6709\u9884\u5148\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4e24\u5bb6\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u4e00\u6708\u4efd\u7b7e\u7f72\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728 ADAS \u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "note_en": "Qualcomm\u2019s $4.6 billion bid, which comes in at $37 per share, has already received approval from the company\u2019s board and would not need a stockholder vote, the chipmaker said in a statement. Veoneer and Magna said in July that both companies\u2019 boards had approved the acquisition.\n Veoneer is a developer of advanced driver assistance systems, decision-making vehicle hardware and software that can perform a limited set of actions under certain conditions, like changing lanes on a highway or emergency braking. While ADAS is a far cry from \u201cself-driving cars,\u201d it has become a popular \u2014 and attainable \u2014 set of features that are appearing in a greater share of new vehicles on offer today.\n The burgeoning bidding war between Magna and Qualcomm is bullish on the future of ADAS technology, as each company seeks to stay competitive with Tier-1 ADAS suppliers Continental and Bosch. Qualcomm\u2019s market capitalization currently sits at $164.8 billion, while Magna\u2019s is $25.3 billion. It\u2019s unclear whether Magna will submit a counter-bid.\n The market has responded to the new bid, with the stock price of Veoneer rising nearly $7 per share, from $31.22 to $38.20 between Wednesday and Thursday. Prior to the announcement of the sale to Magna on July 23, Veoneer stock sat at $19.93 per share.\n Veoneer was spun off from automotive safety system maker Autoliv in 2018. The company formed a joint venture with Volvo Cars, dubbed Zenuity, that was focused on advanced driver assistance systems. That venture was later split last July.\n The ADAS developer also has a pre-existing relationship with Qualcomm.

Mission managers held open the option of making another attempt Wednesday at 12:57 p.m. ET, weather permitting, if the problem can be resolved in time.\n The launching atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket initially was planned for last Friday, but NASA ordered a delay while Russian space station engineers   resolved problems with a newly arrived laboratory module. Over the weekend, the Starliner launch was reset for Tuesday.\n Forecasters monitoring Florida&#39;s typically stormy summer afternoon weather predicted a 60% chance of acceptable conditions then lowered the odds to 50-50. The team pressed ahead with fueling, but around 10:30 a.m., Boeing announced the launch had been called off,  tweeting, &#34;We&#39;re confirming today&#39;s #Starliner Orbital Flight Test-2 launch is scrubbed. More details soon.&#34;\n The Starliner flight marks a major milestone for Boeing and NASA as the agency transitions from hitching rides aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft to fielding commercial crew ships built by Boeing and SpaceX.\n SpaceX, under a $2.6 billion NASA contract, launched its Crew Dragon spacecraft on a successful unpiloted test flight in 2019 and a piloted test flight last year. Since then, the California rocket builder has launched two operational flights to the space station carrying two long-duration crews to the outpost.\n Boeing, under a $4.2 billion contract, launched its Starliner on an unpiloted test flight December 20, 2019, but plans to dock with the space station were   derailed by software problems. Company managers are counting on this week&#39;s second test flight to finally clear the way for piloted missions.\n Depending on lessons learned, Boeing and NASA could be ready to launch three astronauts aboard a different Starliner capsule by the end of this year or early next year.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 00:52:07", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "starliner,scrubs,\u53d1\u5c04", "title": "\u6ce2\u97f3\u516c\u53f8\u5c06 Starliner \u4e58\u5458\u8231\u53d1\u5c04\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9", "title_en": "Boeing Scrubs Launch of Starliner Crew Capsule To Space Station", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/starliner-launch-nasa-boeing-watch-live-stream-today-2021-08-03/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["starliner", "scrubs", "\u53d1\u5c04"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "00d5af5b8027c5b9da78a41db8782e06.jpg", "infoid": 1071567, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u5df2\u901a\u77e5\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u4ece 9 \u6708\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u5fae\u8f6f\u5927\u697c\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u56e0\u8eab\u4f53\u72b6\u51b5\u6216\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u539f\u56e0\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\uff09\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6b8a\u4f4f\u5bbf\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u5c06\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u7684\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u65e5\u671f\u4ece 9 \u6708\u63a8\u8fdf\u5230\u201c\u4e0d\u65e9\u4e8e 2021 \u5e74 10 \u6708 4 \u65e5\u201d\u3002\u6b63\u5982\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u59cb\u4ee5\u6765\u6240\u505a\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u5bc6\u5207\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b0\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5e76\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8c03\u6574\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5c06\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u653e\u5728\u9996\u4f4d\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u4e0e\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u534f\u5546\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5168\u9762\u5f00\u653e\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u65e5\u671f\u4e0d\u65e9\u4e8e 2021 \u5e74 10 \u6708 4 \u65e5\u3002\u4ece 9 \u6708\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd8\u5c06\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u5458\u5de5\u3001\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u4f55\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd Microsoft \u5927\u697c\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e3a\u5458\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4f4f\u5bbf\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u533a/\u56fd\u5bb6/\u5dde\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5ba1\u67e5\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u65e5\u671f\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u3002\u5fae\u8f6f\u544a\u8bc9 The Verge\uff0c\u90a3\u4e9b\u7167\u987e\u514d\u75ab\u6291\u5236\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u662f\u5b69\u5b50\u592a\u5c0f\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u7236\u6bcd\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c\u5230 1 \u6708\u4efd\u3002\u5fae\u8f6f\u7684\u516c\u544a\u662f\u5728\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185 COVID-19 \u6848\u4ef6\u6fc0\u589e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u5b9e\u65bd\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u3002 Facebook \u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u6240\u6709\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u65f6\u63a5\u79cd COVID-19 \u75ab\u82d7\u3002 Facebook \u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u5728 10 \u6708\u5168\u9762\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u3002\u8c37\u6b4c\u8fd8\u5c06\u8981\u6c42\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u4e4b\u524d\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u8fdf\u5230 10 \u6708 18 \u65e5\u3002", "note_en": "Microsoft has informed employees that it will require proof of vaccination for anyone entering a Microsoft building in the US starting in September.

Based on our continued consultation with health and data experts, our earliest date for the full opening of our U.S. worksites will be no earlier than October 4, 2021. Starting in September, we\u2019ll also require proof of vaccination for all employees, vendors, and any guests entering Microsoft buildings in the U.S., and will have an accommodation process in place for employees. We continue to review the situation on a local basis in each region/country/state where we work and will adjust dates and policies as needed.\n Staff who are caregivers to immunosuppressed people or are parents with children too young to get the vaccine will be able to work from home until January, Microsoft tells  The Verge.\n Microsoft\u2019s announcements follow a surge in COVID-19 cases around the country and stricter policies put in place by other tech companies.  Facebook is requiring all US employees to wear masks in offices and that  all employees are vaccinated against COVID-19 when they return to offices. Facebook expects to  fully reopen in October. Google will also  require employees to be vaccinated before they can return to the office and has delayed that return to October 18th.", "posttime": "2021-08-06 00:51:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,\u5efa\u7b51,\u5fae\u8f6f,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u63a5\u79cd", "title": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u5c06\u9700\u8981 COVID-19 \u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u8bc1\u660e\u624d\u80fd\u8fdb\u5165\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u7269", "title_en": "Microsoft Will Require Proof of COVID-19 Vaccination To Enter Buildings in the US", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607690/microsoft-proof-vaccination-covid-19-us-buildings-office-reopening", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "\u5efa\u7b51", "\u5fae\u8f6f", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u63a5\u79cd"]}]
