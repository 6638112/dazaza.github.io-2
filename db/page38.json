it\u2019s never been easier to find tortillas that smell like fresh popcorn, taste like the earth, and support small family farms in Mexico. In  certain cities, you can buy a bag of fresh masa for homemade tacos as readily as you can find sliced bread. Just a few years ago, your only options for quality tortillas were to scour the web for \u201ctortiller\u00edas nearby\u201d or ask your favorite taquero where they got theirs. So how did we get here?\n \u201cWe\u2019re in the era of third wave masa, and it\u2019s been 100 years in the making,\u201d Jorge Gaviria says, referring to a century of access to  nixtamalized masa in the United States culminating in our current golden age. As the cofounder of  Masienda, an importer of heirloom Mexican corn and high-quality tortilla equipment, he has earned the moniker of masa pioneer in the resurgence of premium masa. He likens the new demand for complex, aromatic, earthy Mexican corn to the  third wave specialty coffee movement\u2019s impact on our coffee appetites. \u201cMeticulous sourcing, single-origin, and geeking out about the process is now happening with masa,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of framework.\u201d\n  The first wave of masa in the U.S. was all about convenience, starting with the invention of Maseca, the first instant masa flour, in 1941. In the decades that followed, a second wave of brick-and-mortar tortilla shops began in states with large Mexican immigrant populations. These tortiller\u00edas make decent masa out of American commodity field corn and have been the backbone of American barrios for generations.\n  Masa\u2019s third wave is all about seeking the most flavorful corn varieties from small growers across Mexico. Two brands\u2014Masienda in the States and  Tamoa in Mexico\u2014are shaping this new standard by lugging heavy sacks of really good-tasting corn from Mexico to the U.S., all in the name of serious tortillas. As of now, these are the only companies with sufficient connections to Mexican farmers to ensure a consistent supply of heirloom corn. But they\u2019re not alone in building this wave. Tortiller\u00edas like  Three Sisters Nixtamal in Portland, Oregon, and  Kernel of Truth Organics in Los Angeles, as well as restaurants like  Suerte in Austin, are working with American farmers to make the best possible masa using domestic corn.\n   The difference in flavor between true nixtamalized masa made from heirloom organic corn versus Maseca-based tortillas made from conventional corn is like swapping supermarket white bread for a hot loaf of whole grain sourdough. The aroma, flavor, and even texture is incomparable. If you want to understand why, you can: Transparent sourcing is a keystone of this golden age.\n  In 2019, Gaviria published a  15-page report of Masienda\u2019s sourcing model, which includes an impact analysis, expenses, and portraits of their farmers. Gaviria shares that he expects his 2021 report to be published in the next month. \u201cWe have structures in place where we document how much corn we are purchasing each year from each community to understand a baseline over the course of a few years,\u201d he says. \u201cOur corporate interest is not to over-source, but balancing what we believe is an appropriate amount that still allows for individuals to supply their local community.\u201d It\u2019s a necessary check to protect a delicate ecosystem, ensuring a future not just for heirloom corn, but also for the culture and community that make it possible.\n  Appetites for quality masa on both sides of the border have been growing for years. Taco nerds in the U.S. have longed for a day where the tortilla was treated with as much respect as the juicy meat placed on it. But they had to wait until 2014 to see tortillas with an origin statement appear on an upscale restaurant menu, which came with the arrival of Mexican chef Enrique Olvera\u2019s  Cosme in New York City.\n  The idea behind Cosme\u2019s handmade tortillas was to tell a story of Mexico with each bite. Olvera, the celebrated chef behind  Pujol in Mexico City and  Damian in Los Angeles, insisted on a whole masa  program, nixtamalizing masa for tortillas and training American servers on the subtleties of regional corn varieties. The corn itself came from Masienda, which sold its first sack of Mexican corn to Cosme in 2014, marking it as one of the first Mexican restaurants in America to use real Mexican corn. Cosme\u2019s wild success sparked a new wave of interest in quality masa among the food-obsessed set. It also signaled to restaurant operators that despite the higher effort and cost, focusing on quality masa could be commercially viable. Masienda\u2019s base of customers grew, quickly, expanding into the direct-to-consumer market with varieties like chalque\u00f1o blanco and easier-to-nixtamalize blue varieties.\n The tortillas were a hit. In his   New York Times review of Cosme in 2015, restaurant critic Pete Wells described the tortillas aroma as \u201ccompletely wholesome\u2014like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby\u2019s cheek at the same time.\u201d\n  In the years since, Masienda has contributed two further innovations to the golden age of masa. The first, the adorably named  Molinito, is a countertop mill that grinds tortiller\u00eda-quality masa on demand. It\u2019s the first machine of its kind designed for home or restaurant kitchens that uses stone in its grinding mechanism rather than metal burrs, essential to achieving the buttery-smooth quality of premium masa. Before the Molinito, you had to pay a lot of money to ship heavy portable grinders from Mexico or seek out hand-cranked manual grinders from mom-and-pop Mexican markets. While these types of metal grinders sufficed for the average home cook, there is something extra romantic about getting that immaculate Play-Doh that only stone grind wheels can provide. The second game changer, which, like the Molinito, came to market in 2020, is a  \u201cchef grade\u201d instant tortilla flour akin to Maseca, but made from heirloom corn varieties, just like Masienda\u2019s fresh masa. As a just-add-water option, it\u2019s a historic boon to serious home taqueros and corn nerds.\n  At the same time, homegrown tortiller\u00edas around the country have been striving to make the best possible masa using American corn. Rather than relying on commodity dried field corn, enterprising tortiller\u00eda owners have been connecting with growers of varieties native to Northern California and the Midwest. It turns out that corn grown according to American organic standards makes pretty great masa too.\n  In Portland, Oregon, Adriana Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel and her husband, Pedro Ferbel-Azc\u00e1rate, founded  Three Sisters Nixtamal in 2012, after getting tired of bringing back suitcases full of enchiladas Potosinas from Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel\u2019s family\u2019s home in Mexico\u2019s state of San Luis Potosi. Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel committed to the painstaking process of showing local food lovers why they should care about the tortillas they used for their Tuesday taco nights. The couple showed up every week at Portland\u2019s famous Saturday Farmers Market and free-sampled their way to a loyal customer base. Market goers were especially drawn to an eye-catching stack of marbled tortillas. The tortillas are made from a unique formula that Three Sisters Nixtamal created by carefully layering yellow, white, and blue corn masa batches with its red masa made with dried red chiles.\n \u201cWhen we first started, you couldn\u2019t even find American corn to nixtamalize!\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel tells me in Espa\u00f1ol about her tortiller\u00eda\u2019s long journey. They wanted to get their corn as locally as possible, she says, but all the corn grown nearby in California and Washington was either a sweet corn variety or lower quality corn for animal feed. \u201cThe only organic corn that farmers were growing back then was used to feed their animals. It was hard at first.\u201d Azc\u00e1rate-Ferbel remembers vividly when she saw her first sack of Masienda corn in 2015. She was mesmerized by the sheer existence of heirloom Mexican corn in the States. \u201cBut it was $5 a pound just to buy the corn,\u201d she continues, \u201cand by the time you added labor and equipment cost to nixtamalize, we couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d So they went their own way with American-grown field corn from Northern California, which was the most local the couple could find back then. In 2021, they are still committed to masa education, and you can still find their stand\u2019s vendors slicing masa to make freshly puffed tortillas for curious passersby to try at the farmers market. Their tortillas are now in many co-ops and supermarkets along the Pacific Northwest too.\n In Austin, Texas, Ferm\u00edn Nu\u00f1ez of  Suerte has made his own contribution to the country\u2019s tortilla renaissance in the form of outrageously delicious tacos on tortillas made from local corn. \u201cSuerte came about after being obsessed with making tacos out of central Texan corn,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez says. His obsession began with a serendipitous blob of masa that his future business partner, Sam Hellman-Mass, nixtamalized from Texas corn. \u201cBy luck, a well-known farmer here in Austin gave Sam some of his quality corn grown the right way that he usually fed his pigs with, and we opened Suerte, chasing that perfect tortilla since then.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass fought the uphill battle against Austin\u2019s Tex-Mex expectations, and through each plate of constantly revolving antojitos, like his perfect triangular tetelas filled with braised greens, he\u2019s taught many the joy of great masa in a region more partial to thick  flour tortillas and crunchy \u201chard shells.\u201d The accolades came pouring in. In 2019,  Food &amp; Wine placed it at number two on its  Best New Restaurant list. Waves of new articles and public attention followed shortly after. With growing demand and no other nixtamal of that quality in town, Nu\u00f1ez and Hellman-Mass effectively created a new corn market in Texas, and they are now stretching the limits of what the local supply can allow. \u201cThe corn growing season in Texas is crazy,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez continues. \u201cYou can only plant and harvest corn in Texas in March, so that means that you gotta commit to and predict how much corn the restaurant will go through the following year.\u201d\n  Nu\u00f1ez, who was born in northeast Mexico, believes that it\u2019s all about respecting the region where your Mexican restaurant is located. \u201cIf we were in Mexico, we would probably use corn from Mexico, but we\u2019re not\u2014we\u2019re in Austin.\u201d\n   For the longest time, public demand and market competition has pushed taqueros and taqueras in the U.S. to use the least expensive tortillas possible. This led to the almighty institution of $2 tacos that has dominated taquer\u00edas for the past 20 years. Organic tortillas can cost up to five times that of tortillas made from Maseca, and that figure only rises for handmade tortillas at restaurants. The result is a double standard that venerates the idea of a well-made taco, but also prevents the taquero from using better ingredients and selling tacos at a livable price. Something weird happens when you place a tortilla under beautiful ingredients. Before it was a \u201csmall plate.\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cjust\u201d a taco. In a market where customers don\u2019t think twice about paying $6 for a cup of coffee or $25 for a bowl of pasta, why are they unwilling to spend a few more dollars for a taco made with especially flavorful heirloom corn?\n  The high price of good masa has a lot to do with the physical heaviness of dried corn, and the fact that it grows best in the southern parts of Mexico. Transporting small-but-weighty batches of corn across the country costs money. But besides making for better tortillas, buying from heirloom corn farmers brings crucial support to traditional foodways surrounding one of the world\u2019s first domesticated crops. More important, it also supports the hardworking farming families who have saved those seeds for generations and helps them continue to grow rare, flavorful varieties for all your taco-nerding needs.\n At the same time, low-income Mexican people in Mexico and the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be priced out of their own culinary heritage. A true masa revolution needs to account for the inequalities and exploitation that exist in the supply chain, and it must protect those communities in relation to the growing demand for heirloom corn.\n \u201cMaking organic nixtamal using organic corn was our way of giving the middle finger to an industry that took so much of our cultural existence,\u201d Ricardo \u201cRick\u201d Ortega says. He is the cofounder of L.A.\u2019s first organic tortiller\u00eda,  Kernel of Truth Organics. Ortega and his founding business partner, Omar Ahmed, started his revolutionary tortiller\u00eda in 2014 as a stand against the city\u2019s gentrification, which threatens to erase their hometown\u2019s Mexican heritage. Ahmed is a second-generation tortillero. After his family\u2019s longstanding tortilla shop was gentrified out of Echo Park, an L.A. neighborhood that was a hotbed for gang violence in the \u201990s but is now one of L.A.\u2019s most expensive, Ortega and Ahmed pooled their savings to launch the brand, nixtamalizing on other shops\u2019 equipment in off-hours.\n The pandemic nearly forced Kernel of Truth Organics to shut down its tortilla-making permanently, but it barely ground by. Despite an urgent need for capital, Ortega and Ahmed refuse to sell tortillas to retail locations that mark up their products. \u201cI think about my mom and our abuelas,\u201d Ortega says. He admits that he still catches his parents with Guerrero tortillas\u2014a national mass-market brand\u2014in their refrigerator, but he is not giving up. This parental tortilla treason encapsulates the challenge posed by organic and heirloom corn tortillas: \u201cHow can we make these organic tortillas affordable enough for our parents and se\u00f1oras?\u201d Ortega asks.\n  As Ortega says, tortiller\u00edas like his are fighting the long fight. \u201cThe good fight,\u201d as he calls it. \u201cTo keep true tortillas close to our hearts and to keep masa in our hands.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:28:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6765\u5230,age,\u7389\u7c73\u997c", "title":

", "note_en": "In 2006, Redfin was the first company to put homes on a map\u2070. This was even before Google Maps was a performant platform. They launched with Microsoft Virtual Earth before migrating to Google Maps in 2008\u00b9. This was a legendary achievement in proptech, massively empowering homebuyers to shop on their own. Ever since, high quality map browsing has been table stakes for any real estate shopping tool.\n Going into Q2, the maps on Opendoor were having performance issues. When a user viewed  homes in Phoenix, it could take 15+ seconds before they see anything on the map.\n  Before we could start optimizing map speed, we needed to figure out why it felt slow. After some profiling with Chrome dev tools, it became apparent that there was a slow call to our REST API to fetch the property listing data to display on the map. Looking further, Datadog showed us that the bulk of this time was spent in ActiveModelSerializers and fetching from the DB. We then constructed a metric that captured the user pain we wanted to address: p90 time to fetch property data for the map. We use a 90th percentile to capture the predominant user experience while excluding outliers.\n   The 10.54s p90 to &lt;1s p90 optimization happened in 5 parts over about 1 month:\n   We use Rails  active_model_serializers to describe the fields that the REST API will return. A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases. This causes over-fetching of data both from our APIs and from the backing DB (we store listings in MongoDB). We also updated our  Mongoid queries to use  projections to return only the data necessary to fulfill the request from MongoDB. Creating specialized serializers just for the map component and reducing data fetches solved these issues and got us nearly a 2x speedup.\n A common problem in Rails apps is the same serializer being used for multiple endpoints and bloating to contain fields needed for multiple use-cases.\n   While fixing the DB problem, we noticed that we had smart logic in place to cache the serialized list of properties when the front-end requested an unfiltered list of properties for a region. This is the most common type of query because it\u2019s the default state when a user lands on a map. Unfortunately a bug had been introduced that turned off this caching behavior in all cases. We corrected this behavior and added integration tests around the endpoint to ensure the cache is populated, then hit on subsequent requests. Alerts on latency spikes and cache hit rate will catch and flag us to investigate caching system failures in prod (more on that below).\n  Datadog showed a lot of bouncing around between our serializers and mongo. It turned out that one of the fields had added an n+1 query by doing a fetch in one of the serializer fields as it was serializing a list of properties. We did this by using  Mongoid\u2019s includes() when querying for properties from the database. Optimizing queries so that all data was fetched in bulk before anything was serialized won us a few more seconds.\n  Both the properties on the map and the properties in the list were fetched by the same query. This was a design decision made to keep the logic simple and minimize the payload size if a property appears in both the list and the map. Profiling revealed that payload size wasn\u2019t really an issue, but each list required its own CloudSearch and database query. Splitting these into two separate API calls done in parallel from the front-end was an easy win and didn\u2019t require any encounters with multi-threading in Rails.\n  Our final win came from avoiding the database entirely on some requests. Normally we fetch property listings from CloudSearch then hydrate them with a few extra fields from MongoDB. Instead, we switched the front-end to only expect latitude/longitude point locations and display clusters if there are more than 120 properties to show. This means that when point clusters are showing we don\u2019t have to touch MongoDB, and in the cases we do, it\u2019s a small number of properties and relatively quick.\n  The final step was ensuring we have a great way to catch regressions. While automated tests are useful to catch bugs at the code level, alerting is important because subtle config changes can break distributed systems (like the cache) in ways automated testing in a staging environment may not catch. We now get notified by Datadog when there\u2019s an anomalous latency change and we have useful dashboards with associated metrics.\n    As a result, we\u2019re seeing great performance from our home shopping tools and have seen even faster adoption of  Opendoor-Backed Offers, an offering that backs our buyers\u2019 home offers with all cash to give them a competitive edge in today\u2019s hot market. Performance work on web and mobile is a top priority for me and my team. We will continue investing resources into our home shopping tools with the goal of delivering the best experience possible to our customers.\n If this type of work sounds interesting, Opendoor is hiring!

", "note_en": "Patrick Doherty had always been very active. He trekked the Himalayas and hiked trails in Spain.\n  But about a year and a half ago, he noticed pins and needles in his fingers and toes. His feet got cold. And then he started getting out of breath any time he walked his dog up the hills of County Donegal in Ireland where he lives.\n  &#34;I noticed on some of the larger hill climbs I was getting a bit breathless,&#34; says Doherty, 65. &#34;So I realized something was wrong.&#34;\n  Doherty found out he had a rare, but devastating inherited disease \u2014 known as  transthyretin amyloidosis \u2014 that had killed his father. A misshapen protein was building up in his body, destroying important tissues, such as nerves in his hands and feet and his heart.\n    &#34;It&#39;s terrible prognosis,&#34; Doherty says. &#34;This is a condition that deteriorates very rapidly. It&#39;s just dreadful.&#34;\n  So Doherty was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to try to treat amyloidosis. The approach used a revolutionary gene-editing technique called  CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA.\n      On Saturday, researchers reported the first data indicating that the experimental treatment worked, causing levels of the destructive protein to plummet in Doherty&#39;s body and the bodies of five other patients treated with the approach.\n    The advance is being hailed not just for amyloidosis patients but also as a proof-of-concept that CRISPR could be used to treat many other, much more common diseases. It&#39;s a new way of using the innovative technology.\n  &#34;This is a major milestone for patients,&#34; says  Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, who shared a Nobel Prize for her work helping develop CRISPR.\n  &#34;While these are early data, they show us that we can overcome one of the biggest challenges with applying CRISPR clinically so far, which is being able to deliver it systemically and get it to the right place,&#34; Doudna says.\n  CRISPR has already been shown to help patients suffering from the devastating blood disorders  sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer and to  restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder.\n  But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab, and infusing them back in or injecting CRISPR directly into cells that need fixing.\n    The study Doherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene-editor directly into patients and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right cells. In this case, it&#39;s cells in the liver making the destructive protein.\n  &#34;This is the first example in which CRISPR-Cas9 is injected directly into the bloodstream \u2014 in other words systemic administration \u2014 where we use it as a way to reach a tissue that&#39;s far away from the site of injection and very specifically use it to edit disease-causing genes,&#34; says John Leonard, the CEO of  Intellia Therapeutics, which is sponsoring the study.\n  Doctors infused billions of microscopic structures known as nanoparticles carrying genetic instructions for the CRISPR gene-editor into four patients in London and two in New Zealand. The nanoparticles were absorbed by their livers, where they unleashed armies of CRISPR gene-editors. The CRISPR editor homed in on the target gene in the liver  and sliced it, disabling production of the destructive protein.\n  Within weeks, the levels of protein causing the disease plummeted, especially in the volunteers who received a higher dose. Researchers reported at the  Peripheral Nerve Society Annual Meeting and in a  paper published in  The New England Journal of Medicine.\n  &#34;It really is exciting,&#34; says Dr.  Julian Gillmore, who is leading the study at the University College London, Royal Free Hospital.\n  &#34;This has the potential to completely revolutionize the outcome for these patients who have lived with this disease in their family for many generations. It&#39;s decimated some families that I&#39;ve been looking after. So this is amazing,&#34; Gillmore says.\n  The patients will have to be followed longer, and more patients will have to be treated, to make sure the treatment&#39;s safe, and determine how much it&#39;s helping, Gillmore stresses. But the approach could help those struck by amyloidosis that isn&#39;t inherited, which is a far more common version of the disease, he says.\n  Moreover, the promising results potentially open the door for using the same approach to treatment of many other, more common diseases for which taking cells out of the body or directly injecting CRISPR isn&#39;t realistic, including heart disease, muscular dystrophy and brain diseases such as Alzheimer&#39;s.\n  &#34;This is really opening a new era as we think about gene-editing where we can begin to think about accessing all kinds of different tissue in the body via systemic administration,&#34; Leonard says.\n    &#34;This is a wonderful day for the future of gene-editing as a medicine,&#34;  agree  Fyodor Urnov, a professor of genetics at the University of California, Berkeley. &#34;We as a species are watching this remarkable new show called: our gene-edited future.&#34;\n  Doherty says he started feeling better within weeks of the treatment and has continued to improve in the weeks since then.\n  &#34;I definitely feel better,&#34; he told NPR. &#34;I&#39;m speaking to you from upstairs in our house. I climbed stairs to get up here. I would have been feeling breathless. I&#39;m thrilled.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:27:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u57fa\u56e0,gene,crispr", "title":

", "note_en": "Adventures with Van Gogh is a weekly blog by Martin Bailey, our long-standing correspondent and expert on the artist. Published every Friday, his stories will range from newsy items about this most intriguing artist to scholarly pieces based on his own meticulous investigations and discoveries.\n  Reproduced here for the first time: a trio of sketches from Vincent\u2019s village\u2014designed as a bookmark\n One of Van Gogh\u2019s most unusual artworks has just emerged\u2014three unknown sketches of peasants. They are drawn on a thin vertical strip of paper, a curious format for an artist to choose. The drawings were found in a novel on the French peasantry and the paper is exactly the same height as the book.\n The three sketches are reproduced by  The Art Newspaper here for the first time. Discoveries of totally unknown Van Gogh drawings are now rare\u2014perhaps once or twice in a decade. The sheet has just gone on display at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, in a new exhibition on acquisitions,   Here to Stay (until 12 September). Although it is presented in the show as simply a trio of sketches, the artwork almost certainly served an unexpected purpose.\n    Teio Meedendorp, a senior researcher at the Amsterdam museum, told us: \u201cI believe that it was made as a bookmark. It would be curious to draw three sketches in this configuration unless there was a reason, and it fits snugly inside the book in which it was found.\u201d\n    Vincent, an avid reader, gave his copy of a novel on the French peasantry to his Dutch artist friend Anthon van Rappard. Writing to Van Rappard on 15 June 1883, he said he would be posting a package to him in Utrecht, with prints and a book by the French writers Emile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian, whom he greatly admired.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan recounts the story of the French Revolution through the eyes of an Alsace peasant. Illustrated by Th\u00e9ophile Schuler, Vincent assured his friend that \u201cI do think you\u2019ll find the Erckmann-Chatrian beautiful\u201d.\n    Van Rappard died in 1892, aged just 33, and the book then passed to his wife Henri\u00ebtte, who lived until 1910.  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan, together with the bookmark, was quietly preserved by her family until 2019, when both were privately sold to the Van Gogh Museum.\n The pencil drawings are crude, since they were done soon after Vincent set out to become an artist, but they are important since so few of his early informal sketches survive. Stylistically, they can be dated to autumn 1881, when he was living in his parent\u2019s village of Etten and was deeply interested in capturing figures of the local peasants at work.\n It was not until two years later that Vincent sent  Histoire d\u2019un Paysan to Van Rappard, suggesting that the bookmark had lain forgotten in the novel and was not noticed when he wrapped up the package. If Vincent had set out to give Van Rappard a few sketches, he would have been much more likely to have sent very recent ones, to demonstrate how his art was developing.\n On the 28cm-high bookmark, the upper sketch shows a woman walking by a pollarded tree. The middle one portrays a seated man beside a fire, a work reminiscent of a finished drawing which Van Gogh made in November 1881,   Old Man at the Fireside  (now Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). The lower sketch depicts a woman in profile. Van Gogh may well have seen the figures as loosely illustrating the Erckmann-Chatrian novel.\n    The front of the book is signed \u201cVincent\u201d. He had sent the book to Van Rappard \u201cto read\u201d and it is unclear whether the signature indicates that it was a gift or was a polite reminder that it was a loan and should be returned.\n    In October, just over year after sending the book, Van Rappard visited Vincent in Nuenen\u2014but without returning the book. During the visit Van Gogh sketched a portrait of his friend, the largest drawn portrait in his entire oeuvre. Only the top half of the work survives.\n Sadly, their friendship came to an abrupt end in May 1885, after Van Rappard wrote critically about Vincent\u2019s only  lithograph, which depicted his painting of  The Potato Eaters. Vincent, who was furious, dismembered the portrait, neatly slicing it in half. The bottom half has been lost, but he soon reused the reverse of the top half to make rough sketches of a pair of women and a man carrying a bundle of wood.\n Thanks to this recycling, the most important half of the Van Rappard portrait, with the eyes, has been saved\u2014poignant evidence of Van Gogh\u2019s closest friendship during his Dutch artistic years.\n  \u2022 Christie\u2019s is to sell a drawing of   The Potato Harvester (Aardappelrooier)  in London on 30 June, estimated at \u00a3300,000-\u00a3500,000. Dating from June-July 1885, it was done in Nuenen, the village in the south of the Netherlands. Fork in hand, the peasant is digging up potatoes, while smoking his pipe.  The Potato Harvester was originally owned by the distinguished Dutch art historian H.P. Bremmer.\n    \u2022 The  Sunflowers (August 1888) is back in London this week, after being the star attraction for a tour of the National Gallery\u2019s paintings to Japan and Australia. At the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra the exhibition of 61 works was seen by 201,000 people during its 15-week run. With Covid-19, this is likely to rank among the world\u2019s best-attended 2020-21 exhibitions.\n    Martin Bailey is a leading Van Gogh specialist and investigative reporter for  The Art Newspaper. Bailey has curated Van Gogh exhibitions at the Barbican Art Gallery and Compton Verney/National Gallery of Scotland. He was a co-curator of Tate Britain\u2019s  The EY Exhibition: Van Gogh and Britain (27 March-11 August 2019). He has written a number of bestselling books, including  The Sunflowers Are Mine: The Story of Van Gogh&#39;s Masterpiece (Frances Lincoln 2013, available in the  UK and  US),  Studio of the South: Van Gogh in Provence (Frances Lincoln 2016, available in the  UK and  US) and  Starry Night: Van Gogh at the Asylum (White Lion Publishing 2018, available in the  UK and  US).

", "note_en": "Those of us who learned arithmetic using pen and paper, working with the ten digits 0\u20139 and place value, may take for granted that this is the way it\u2019s always been done, or at least the way it ought to be done. But if you think of the amount of time and energy spent in the early school years just to teach place value, you\u2019ll realize that this sort of numeracy is not preordained.\n  Over the past 5,500 years, more than 100 distinct ways of writing numbers have been developed and used by numerate societies, linguistic anthropologist Stephen Chrisomalis has found. Thousands more ways of speaking numbers, manipulating physical objects, and using human bodies to enumerate are known to exist, or to have existed, he writes in his new book \u201c Reckonings: Numerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Remarkably, each of the basic structures was invented multiple times independently of one another. In \u201cReckonings,\u201d Chrisomalis considers how humans past and present have used numerals, reinterpreting historical and archaeological representations of numerical notation and exploring the implications of why we write numbers with figures rather than words. Drawing on, and expanding upon, the enormous cross-cultural and comparative literatures in linguistics, cognitive anthropology, and the history of science that bear on questions of numeracy, he shows that numeracy is a social practice.\n Chrisomalis took time out from a busy end to the spring semester to field a few questions about his new book, his spirited defense of Roman numerals, his complicated relationships with mathematicians, and his thoughts on the validity of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.\n  Philip Laughlin: We\u2019ve worked with a number of linguists and anthropologists over the years but you are our first author to specialize in written numerical systems. What sparked your interest in this topic? Why are numerals an important area of research?\n Stephen Chrisomalis: I first became interested in numerals when I wrote a paper in an undergraduate cognitive anthropology course in the mid-1990s. After moving away from the subject for a couple years, I came back to it when I was looking for a PhD topic along with my advisor, the late Bruce Trigger at McGill. This resulted in my dissertation, which later became my first book, \u201c Numerical Notation: A Comparative History\u201d (Cambridge, 2010). It was an unorthodox project for an anthropology department \u2014 neither strictly archaeological nor ethnohistorical nor ethnographic. But that was exactly the sort of creative project that it was possible to do at McGill at that time, and that sadly, given the exigencies of the modern job market, is almost impossible to imagine doing today.\n  What brought me to numerical notation as a dissertation subject is much of what still appeals to me about it now. We have evidence from over 100 different systems used across every inhabited continent over 5,000 years, including all the world\u2019s literate traditions. Numbers are a ubiquitous domain of human existence, and written numerals are virtually everywhere that there is writing. While, of course, the historical and archaeological records are partial (which is in turn both exciting and frustrating), understanding their history and cross-cultural transmission is a tractable problem. We can tell, roughly, when and where they originate and how they relate to one another.\n Also, every user of a numerical notation system is also a speaker of one or more languages, which lets us ask great questions comparing number words to numerical notation and to show how they interact. These questions can be as simple as \u201cDo people say \u2018two thousand twenty one\u2019 or \u2018twenty twenty one\u2019?\u201d and as big as \u201cWere numbers first visual marks or spoken words?\u201d As a linguist and an anthropologist, that\u2019s very attractive. Because there is a significant and large literature on numerical cognition, the comparative, historical data I bring to the table is useful for testing and expanding on our knowledge in that interdisciplinary area.\n PL: You had the cover image and title for this book in your head for years. Can you explain the significance of the watch and why you chose the title \u201cReckonings\u201d in the first place? What were you trying to get across to potential readers with that evocative word?\n  SC: The title \u2018Reckonings\u2019 invokes the triple meaning of the word \u2018reckon\u2019 \u2014 to calculate, to think, and to judge \u2014 which parallels the three parts of the subtitle: \u201cNumerals, Cognition, and History.\u201d Reckoning is not mathematics, in its technical, disciplinary sense, but it reflects the everyday practices of working with and manipulating numbers. Then, in English and in other languages, we extend the verb for calculation to thinking in general \u2014 to reckon thus involves the more general cognitive questions I hope I\u2019ve addressed. Finally, we come to reckoning as judgement \u2014 every numerical notation faces its own reckoning as users decide whether to adopt, transmit, and eventually, abandon it. As I spend a lot of time talking about the obsolescence of numeral systems, most notably but not limited to the Roman numerals, I wanted to echo this decision-making process of judgement by which users decide to abandon one notation in favor of another. \u201cReckonings\u201d signals that the book might be about arithmetic \u2014 but it\u2019s about a lot more than that.\n  The cover image of the book is a watch designed by the French watchmaker Jean-Antoine L\u00e9pine in 1788, now held at the British Museum (BM 1958,1201.289). L\u00e9pine was one of the first horologists to consistently use Western (commonly called Arabic) numerals instead of Roman numerals for hour markers, but in the 1780s he made a number of watches like this one, where he instead playfully mixed the two systems. The hybridity on this sort of artifact is visually striking and memorable to the viewer, both then and now. But actually, it isn\u2019t as weird as it seems; we combine numerical representations all the time, like when we write something like \u201c1.2 million\u201d instead of \u201c1,200,000.\u201d Unlike the Roman numerals alone, which would be visually \u2018unbalanced\u2019 on a watch, this hybrid system expresses every number from 1 through 12 in no more than two digits. To me it embodies the passage of time in material form and the replacement of the Roman numerals. By the 1780s, they had been replaced for most purposes, but watch and clock faces are one of the places where, even today, they\u2019re pretty common. As a sort of metonym for this historical process, the L\u00e9pine watch highlights that the decline and fall of the Roman numerals was not a slow, steady, predictable replacement, but one with many disjunctures.\n PL: At the book launch, you talked a bit about the future of number systems, but with the caveat that you are not a \u201cFuturologist.\u201d So I\u2019ll ask you to put on a historian\u2019s hat instead: What kind of cultural changes are necessary for a society to switch from one number system to another? It seems to me that significant changes would have to happen at least at the political and economic level for one numerical system to supersede another, right?\n SC: One of the key arguments in \u201cReckonings\u201d is that numerical notations don\u2019t get replaced in orderly, \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019 processes. To argue that simply raises the question: fittest for what purpose? Numerical notations are principally used for representation and communication, not computation, so it\u2019s the context of writing and reading practices, rather than changes in mathematics, that motivate their history. The last time that happened was with the advent of the printing press and the rise of a more general literacy among white middle-class Europeans in the 15 th and 16 th centuries alongside mercantile capitalism \u2014 and not coincidentally, that was exactly when, where, and by whom the Roman numerals were substantially abandoned. Strikingly, this was not accompanied with a lot of fanfare or explicit comparison of the two systems. The Western numerals had been around in Europe for 500 years, and then, once conditions were right, they rapidly supplanted Roman numerals so that some commentators could even see the change within a lifetime.\n  Just in general, though, we should be very hesitant to assume that we are at the \u2018end of history\u2019 of anything, whether that\u2019s a number system or a political system. Nothing lasts forever \u2013 we may simply lack the imagination to think of how and when it could be replaced. I\u2019m confident that your average Roman or Egyptian or Aztec merchant or engineer couldn\u2019t have imagined the Western numerals. In the same way, I think we\u2019re subject to the same sort of cognitive closure \u2014 it\u2019s hard to imagine from our vantage point what could ever change to lead to the abandonment of a universal notation. While I don\u2019t see it happening soon, the sorts of massive technological changes of the past 50 years, extended for another century or two, could be such a catalyst. But alone, technology isn\u2019t deterministic \u2014 only in conjunction with changes in social, economic, and communicative practices would that be likely. And even then, there\u2019s no guarantee. Not only would such a system need to be invented, but some community of users would need to perceive it as being sufficiently better, for some purpose, to warrant abandoning what is, at this point, a universal notation. One of the costs of doing so is that, because numerical systems are for communicating, using a rare system means you aren\u2019t able to communicate with as many people as with a common one. That isn\u2019t necessarily fatal to a notation\u2019s survival, but it is an obstacle to be overcome.\n PL: I\u2019m curious to know how mathematicians have responded to your work. How do they feel about the historical perspective you bring to number systems and arithmetic, and does it have any bearing on their own work?\n SC: Well, I sometimes joke with my friends and collaborators who are mathematicians that mathematics is the branch of anthropology that focuses on numbers! Seriously, though, mathematics and anthropology seem to stand on the opposite ends of a spectrum about the degree to which the phenomena they study are fundamentally human. Mathematicians are mostly Platonists \u2014 or really, more strictly, mathematical realists \u2014 they argue very persuasively that abstract mathematical objects like numbers are in some sense real independent of our observation of them. Some of this sense is intuitive \u2014 anyone who has done mathematics has experienced this sensation of real discovery, even when \u2018discovering\u2019 something that had been known for centuries. But some of it is based on the quite proper insight that even very weird mathematical entities, like \u03c0, are not subject to cultural whim. In contrast, anthropologists tend to see most things as culturally constructed and subject to variation \u2014 a human product of specific social contexts. These are caricatures, but there\u2019s some truth to them. Anthropologists tend not to spend a lot of time on things where the human element is irrelevant.\n In the late 1940s and early 1950s this led to a debate between the Platonist mathematician and popularizer Martin Gardner and the materialist evolutionary anthropologist Leslie White. The former treats variation in the form of notation as nothing more than differences in representing a deep, underlying reality, the latter sees the construction of mathematical objects by human minds as prior to the invention of formal mathematics. And because anthropologists (as a stereotype with some validity) don\u2019t often have much training in mathematics, it\u2019s easy to fall into this binary. But actually it doesn\u2019t need to be nearly so antagonistic. Most mathematicians freely grant that humans create notations, and that different notations make some ideas easy to see and others much harder. And even a brief look at the comparative history of mathematics and numeration shows that there is much more commonality among human arithmetic than there is difference. There simply is nowhere where 1+1=3. That\u2019s because the human mind is interacting with the real world to produce insights, and that\u2019s true even for mathematics where the objects of analysis are quite abstract.\n PL: You spend a lot of time debunking the idea that the Roman numerals are an inferior notation. Why so much energy on defending an archaic system? What do the Roman numerals tell us about number systems in general?\n SC: Of all the number systems still in use today, the only one most readers will be familiar that uses a different structure to the now nearly-universal Western numerals 0-9 are the Roman numerals. They may be archaic but we still use them for all sorts of secondary and prestige functions, like counting things we really value, such as kings, popes, and Super Bowls. (Although every year, the week before the Super Bowl, there is a news article complaining about them!) But they are still taught and learned in lots of schools. And actually, that\u2019s part of the problem, because along with the signs IVXLCDM and the rules for combining them, we are also taught an ideology that the Roman numerals were no good for math, and that was why they were discarded. That ideology is so pervasive that it has rarely been questioned.\n  It\u2019s not that I think the Roman numerals are the best system available; they just aren\u2019t nearly as awful as we\u2019ve been conditioned to believe. They not only survived but thrived, throughout large swaths of Europe, for 2,000 years. Unless we believe that pre-modern people were a bunch of dupes, they can\u2019t have been so bad. Even after the Western numerals 0-9 were introduced into Europe through Arabic and Indian ancestors, it took hundreds of years for the Roman numerals to be supplanted. This is not some sort of archaism that just happened to avoid being snuffed out. It was a core representational practice throughout most of Europe for almost any purpose you can imagine numbers being used for. The one thing they weren\u2019t really used for is what we now think of as pen-and-paper arithmetic \u2014 lining up numbers in columns. That\u2019s because in classical antiquity and indeed, until the past few hundred years, arithmetic was an embodied and material practice (e.g., on a counting board or abacus) whereas numerical notation was used for writing and recording. This division of labor is very common throughout the world\u2019s numerical notations, most of which were never manipulated directly for arithmetic.\n PL: Since you are an anthropology professor and I am a cognitive science editor at The MIT Press, I would be remiss if I did not ask you about Benjamin Lee Whorf\u2019s \u201c Language, Thought, and Reality.\u201d This is probably the first cognitive science book MIT Press ever published and it has remained in print for over 60 years now. In 2021, what do you make of that book in particular and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis in general? Is it an idea that still retains power?\n SC:  \u201cLanguage, Thought, and Reality\u201d is almost certainly the most cited piece of linguistic anthropological writing ever, and still taught in hundreds of courses, including my own graduate seminar, where I regularly teach the chapter \u201cThe relation of habitual thought and behavior to language.\u201d It is also one of the most deeply misunderstood books across multiple fields. There really is no such thing as \u201cthe Sapir-Whorf hypothesis\u201d; rather, there are a set of ideas, some centuries old, about the effect that language has on thought. But everyone knows that language has some effect on thought \u2014 no reasonable person denies this. What Whorf, Sapir, and other linguistic relativists do is argue that variations in linguistic structure \u2014 patterns in syntax or morphology, or differences in how languages divide up the world \u2014 affect cognition. (Although I should note that neither Sapir nor Whorf used the term \u2018cognition\u2019 at all, because MIT Press was one of the first presses to define cognitive science as an independent subject of investigation!) What is the scope of these effects? Probably less than in some of the more programmatic statements by folks like Whorf, but significantly more than would have been assumed by linguists, say, 30 years ago when I first studied the discipline.\n Number and numeracy was one of the earliest domains of human social life studied under what we would now think of as the 19th-century ancestors of linguistic relativity \u2014 but largely in a now-rightly rejected way that saw systems of thought as part of ordered, evolutionary stages from simple to complex. I recently published  a paper on this very subject. In  LT&amp;R, Whorf argued that Newtonian physics was, in significant part, a product of the structuring influence of European languages in which Newton wrote, like Latin and English. That\u2019s a big claim and hard to justify empirically. But both number words and number notations are basically categories; they\u2019re ways of dividing up the world of quantity meaningfully, and humans do it in different ways. These notations constrain but do not determine how we solve numerical problems. A meme that floats around social media every few months asks people to describe how they solve the problem \u201c28 + 47.\u201d The answer is 75 \u2014 that\u2019s not relativistic. And there are a number of strategies for solving the problem. In a community where arithmetic is mediated through a device like an abacus, the strategies will be even more varied.

", "note_en": "On Thursday, July 13, 1995, a concentration of high pressure in the upper atmosphere above Midwest Chicago forced massive amounts of hot air to the ground, causing temperatures as high as 41\u00b0C (106\u00b0F). In a Midwestern city not built for tropical heat, roads buckled, cars broke down in the street, and schools closed their doors. On Friday, three Con Ed power transformers failed, leaving 49,000 people without electricity. In high-rise apartments with no air conditioning, temperatures hit 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F) even with the windows open. The heat continued into Saturday. The human body can only take about 48 hours of uninterrupted heat like this before its defenses begin to shut down, and emergency rooms were so crowded they had to turn away heatstroke victims. Sunday was no better, and as the death toll rose\u2014of dehydration, heat exhaustion, and renal failure\u2014the morgues hit capacity, too, and bodies were stored in refrigerated meat-packing trucks. In all, 739 people died as a result of the heat wave.\n In its aftermath, an inquiry found, unsurprisingly, that the majority of those who died were poor, old, and lived alone. More surprising was the gender imbalance: significantly more men died than women. This was especially strange considering that in Chicago in July\u00a0of 1995, there were more old women who lived alone than old men.\n What made these men more vulnerable than the women? It wasn\u2019t physical circumstances. Both groups lived mostly in \u201csingle room occupancy\u201d buildings, or   SROs\u2014apartments of one room in what used to be called flophouses. It was social circumstances. The phrase \u201cNo known relatives\u201d appears repeatedly in police reports of the dead men\u2019s homes. Letters of regret were found on floors and in backs of drawers: \u201cI would like to see you if that\u2019s possible, when you come to the city\u201d; \u201cIt seems to me that our family should have gotten along.\u201d The single rooms of the deceased are described as \u201croach infested\u201d and \u201ca complete mess,\u201d indicating few or no visitors. The women, according to Eric Klinenberg,  who wrote a book on the heat wave, had people who checked up on them and so kept them alive; the men did not. \u201cWhen you have time please come visit me soon at my place,\u201d read another letter, unsent.\n   Artie, 63, who lives in Beards Fork, West Virginia, population 200, has never married. He grew up in Beards Fork, but spent most of his life elsewhere. He moved back when he was 47 to take care of his sick mother, who died earlier this year. Now, after putting his own life on hold for sixteen years, he finds himself single, semi-retired, and without a close friend. \u201cLife goes by really fast,\u201d he said. Since his mom died, he\u2019s found himself thinking, \u201cWhere in the hell did it go?\u201d\n This is the kind of thing he used to talk about with his mother. Now that she\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t really open up to anyone. He has no close friends in the area, and he\u2019s \u201cfelt a lot of depression over the past few years.\u201d\n Artie\u2019s not an antisocial guy or a homebody. His career brought him into contact with hundreds of interesting people over the years; he lived in California for a decade, and before that he had a nine-year relationship. But back in his hometown, all the connections he made seem to have melted away. \u201cI don\u2019t really have any close friends, other than my family,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is something different.\u201d (A 2005 Australian  study agreed: while close friendships increase your longevity by up to 22\u00a0percent, family relationships make no difference.)\n Artie has a group of friends he met in his thirties and forties with whom he\u2019s still in touch, mainly on Facebook, but those relationships are \u201cnot quite the same as the friendships I had when I was younger. Less deep. Less vulnerable. And I\u2019m not even sure I want to [open up].\u201d He\u2019s somewhat close with a few of his former coworkers, but though they confide in him, he doesn\u2019t feel like he can confide in them. \u201cThey\u2019re younger,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand my problems.\u201d Despite being semi-retired, he still goes into the office every day and stays late, after everyone\u2019s gone. \u201cI\u2019m reluctant to go home,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s there.\u201d\n In many ways, Artie seems in danger of going down the path of those Chicago   SRO-dwellers. But there\u2019s an important difference between those men and Artie: what the former had in common was their  social isolation\u2014having few or no social connections. Artie\u2019s problem, on the other hand, is one of  loneliness\u2014the  feeling of being isolated, regardless of your social connectedness, usually due to having few or no confidants.\n  At first glance it seems unlikely. I\u2019m 34. I have what seems to me a pretty active social life. I\u2019m integrated into my community and I go to arts events regularly. I\u2019ve lived here in Toronto off and on since I was 18. I went to university here. I helped found an arts venue here. I know hundreds of people here, if not thousands. I have multiple jobs\u2014college instructor, freelance writer, tutor. I have friends. Whatever path led to these lonely destinations, I want to believe, is not the path I\u2019m on. When I die, my floor will be tidy, and my letters sent.\n And yet, there\u2019s something about their stories that seems eerily familiar. Slowly but surely, I feel my social world slipping away from me. All three of my jobs combined require me to be around other humans a total of about eight hours out of a week\u2019s 168. The other 160, I\u2019m mostly at home. It\u2019s not unusual for me to go several days in a row with no social contact of any kind, and the longer I go without it, the scarier it feels. I become shy, paranoid that no one would want to hang out with me. Social slights metastasize in my brain. I start to avoid social functions, convinced I\u2019ll walk into a wall of mysterious eye contact. I live close to many friends, but I hide from them when I see them in the street. I don\u2019t think of myself as antisocial\u2014I love people, love being around them, and have had so many good friendships\u2014but it often feels like an uphill battle, and mystifyingly complex, to not slip back endlessly into this pit of despair.\n The thing is, I wasn\u2019t always like this. How did I get here?\n  Friendship in adulthood is a challenge for a lot of people. On average,  both m en and women start to lose friends around age 25, and  continue to lose friends steadily for the rest of our lives. As adults, we tend to work more, commit to more serious romantic relationships, and start families, all of which end up taking priority over buddy time. Even if, like me, at age 34, you don\u2019t have full-time work, you\u2019re not in a relationship, and you\u2019re nowhere close to starting your own family, others\u2019 adulting leaves you bereft.\n Furthermore, young adults  move around the country more than any other demographic, which severs our support networks\u2014a phenomenon Robert Putnam calls the \u201cre-potting\u201d effect, referring to the injury a transplanted plant sustains losing its roots.  People are changing jobs more than ever, which interrupts connections that in previous eras would have become decades long. And freelancing, which  Forbes estimates  50\u00a0percent\u00a0of the   U.S. workforce will be doing in one way or another by 2020, deprives the worker of not only job security, but social stability. As a freelancer who\u2019s had six different jobs in the past year alone and who lived in a dozen countries throughout my twenties, I fall squarely into the most vulnerable part of this Venn diagram. I try to compensate by keeping up with, like, four or five different friend-groups on social media\u2014mostly Facebook, where I have 3,691 contacts\u2014but I often find myself using social media more like a performance art video game than a way to facilitate friendships. And studies show that I\u2019m closer to the norm than the exception. \u201cOnline social contacts with friends and family,\u201d as  one study put it, \u201cwere not an effective alternative for offline social interactions in reducing feelings of loneliness.\u201d\n And that\u2019s what I am, I guess. Lonely. Sometimes excruciatingly so. Loneliness can be measured by psychometry like the    UCLA Loneliness Scale (I scored 21 out of 40) or the  De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (I am high on emotional loneliness, low on social loneliness). For me, though, loneliness at its core is a stubborn, irrational certainty that no matter how well I know the people in my life\u2014several of whom I consider close, some of whom I\u2019ve known for decades\u2014I am not, as the poem goes, involved in mankind. I still feel, in the bad moments, frantic with isolation, and become my 16-year-old self, desperate on the edge of my parents\u2019 bathtub, mentally searching for a friend, having ruled out all the obvious candidates. I tried to summon a world in which Blake MacPhail, whose sister\u2019s apartment I visited once two years earlier, could be considered my friend. That wasn\u2019t the loneliest I ever felt, but it set the template, and I still feel that way more often than perhaps those who know me would suspect. Or maybe they would suspect it; maybe they feel it too; over the past few decades, as the structure of society has changed, loneliness has increased, and now affects  almost half the population. Just last week, the American Psychological Association issued a  press release advising that \u201cmany nations around the world now suggest we are facing a \u2018loneliness epidemic.\u2019\u201d\n And as if  feeling lonely wasn\u2019t bad enough, it also turns out that loneliness and isolation are shockingly bad for your health and wellbeing. The quality of your friendships is the largest predictor of your  happiness. Social isolation weakens your immune system, raises your blood pressure, messes with your sleep, and  can be as bad for you as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. According to the authors of  a widely cited meta-analysis, loneliness on its own can increase your chances of an early death by 30\u00a0percent\u00a0and \u201cheightened risk for mortality from a lack of social relationships is greater than that from obesity.\u201d And in practical terms, being in contact with nobody in an emergency, like the men in the Chicago heat wave, can kill you in an instant.\n Unfortunately for me, like the majority of those Chicago dead, I belong to another, perhaps counterintuitive, at-risk category: I\u2019m a man. All that freelancing and moving and adulthood stuff affects men and women alike, but, for a complex set of reasons, men face additional roadblocks to connection. On average, we have  fewer confidants\u00a0and\u00a0are  more socially isolated.\u00a0Women  do report being lonelier than men, and research says, statistically, they are\u2014if they\u2019re married and between the ages of 20 and 49. For all other demographics, though,\u00a0 men are in fact lonelier than women. On top of all that, there\u2019s a   consensus among  researchers   that due to male reluctance to self-identify as having emotional problems, the ubiquity of men\u2019s loneliness is probably being underestimated.\n  I have a photograph of my friend Tyler and myself\u00a0snuggling on my parents\u2019 cream carpet, in the sun, next to my sandy dog. It\u2019s a sweet moment, but captures something bitter, too: this was probably the last time I touched a male friend in a way that wasn\u2019t a handshake or a bro-y hug. We were, like, six.\n One avenue into understanding men\u2019s loneliness is to consider how children are socialized. In an interview, Niobe Way, a professor of developmental psychology at New York University who has been doing research with adolescent boys for almost three decades, talked about how we are failing boys. \u201cThe social and emotional skills necessary for boys to thrive are just not being fostered,\u201d she said in an interview. Indeed, when you look at the research, men do not start life as the stereotypes we become. Six-month-old boys  are likely to \u201ccry more than girls,\u201d more likely to express joy at the sight of our mother\u2019s faces, and more likely to match our expressions to theirs. In general, before the age of four or five, research shows that  boys are more emotive than girls.\n The change begins around the time we start school: at that age\u2014about five\u2014boys become  worse than girls at \u201cchanging our facial expressions to foster social relationships.\u201d This is the beginning of a socialization process in \u201ca culture that supports emotional development for girls and discourages it for boys,\u201d according to  Dan Kindlon and Michael Thompson. This begins to affect our friendships early\u2014in a study in New Haven, Connecticut, boys aged 10-18 were  significantly worse than girls at knowing who their friends  were : \u201cover a two-week period, the boys changed their nomination of who their best friend was more frequently than girls, and their nomination was less likely to be reciprocated.\u201d\n Still, there\u2019ll never be better soil than school in which to grow friendships, and most boys do find good friends as children. Way, who summarized her findings in her book  Deep Secrets, found that, up until early adolescence, boys are not shy about how much they love their friends. Way quotes one boy named Justin in his first year of high school: \u201c[My best friend and I] love each other\u2026 That\u2019s it\u2026 you have this thing that is deep, so deep, it\u2019s within you, you can\u2019t explain it. \u2026 I guess in life, sometimes two people can really, really understand each other and really have a trust, respect, and love for each other.\u201d Another high school freshman, Jason, told Way friendships were important because then \u201cyou are not lonely \u2026 you need someone to turn to when things are bad.\u201d\n However, for many boys\u2014Way calls it \u201cnear-universal\u201d\u2014a shift occurs in late adolescence,\u00a0roughly from the ages of 15-20. In a phase of life we often think of in optimistic terms\u2014self-discovery, coming of age\u2014boys\u2019 trust in each other shatters like glass. Three years after his first interview, Jason, asked if he had any close friends, said no, \u201cand immediately adds that while he has nothing against gay people, he himself is not gay.\u201d Another boy interviewed by Way in the eleventh grade who up until the year before had maintained a best friendship for ten years said he now had no friends because \u201cyou can\u2019t trust nobody these days.\u201d In interviews with thousands of boys, Way saw a tight correlation between confiding in close friends and mental health, and she observed that, across all ethnic groups and income brackets, three quarters of the boys she spoke to \u201cgrow fearful of betrayal by and distrustful of their male peers\u201d in late adolescence, and \u201cbegin to speak increasingly of feeling lonely and depressed.\u201d\n Making matters worse, in the middle of this estrangement from other boys, as we\u2019re becoming young men, we\u2019re governed more than ever by a new set of rules about what behaviour we\u2019re allowed to show. Psychologists call them display rules. \u201cExpressions of hurt and worry and of care and concern for others,\u201d  according to white high schools boys, are \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cgirly.\u201d Black and Hispanic boys, according to Way\u2019s interviews, feel pressure to conform to even stricter rules. Men who break the rules, and express \u201csadness, depression, fear, and dysphoric self-conscious emotions such as shame and embarrassment\u201d are viewed as \u201c unmanly\u201d and are  comforted less than women. Way told me when she speaks in public, she often quotes a 16-year-old boy who said, \u201cIt might be nice to be a girl, \u2018cause then I wouldn\u2019t have to be emotionless.\u201d\n  And yet, it\u2019s easy to be skeptical\u2014aren\u2019t men doing fine, compared to everyone else? How much does this actually hurt men? They still have friends, don\u2019t they? And yes, entering adulthood, and up to the age of 25, men and women do have  approximately the same number of friends. For the outsider looking in, then, and even for the man himself, it may appear that nothing\u2019s amiss. But to paraphrase University of Missouri researchers Barbara Bank and Suzanne Hansford, men have power, but are not well. In the   UK,  suicide rates among men are steadily rising. In the   US, so is\u00a0 unemployment among men, often coupled with opioid abuse. In a  2006 paper addressed to psychiatric practitioners, William S. Pollack of Harvard Medical School wrote, \u201cpresent socialization systems are dangerous to boys\u2019 physical and mental health and to those around them, leading to increased school failure, depression, suicide, lonely isolation, and, in extremis, violence.\u201d In a study Pollack did of boys age 12-18, only 15\u00a0percent\u00a0of them projected \u201cpositive, forward-looking sentiment regarding their futures as men.\u201d\n Women  keep being intimate with their friends into adulthood, and men, generally,  do not: \u201cDespite efforts to dismiss it, the finding that men\u2019s same-sex friendships are less intimate and supportive than women\u2019s is robust and widely documented.\u201d\n Perhaps you want to say that men just like it that way. Perhaps you want to say, like Geoffrey Grief, writing in  Buddy System: Understanding Male Friendships,\u00a0\u201cMen are more comfortable with shoulder-to-shoulder friendships while women prefer face-to-face friendships, which are more emotionally expressive.\u201d Shoulder-to-shoulder meaning: engaging in a shared activity, like playing a game of pick-up basketball, as opposed to confiding face-to-face and being emotionally vulnerable. This may be true for some men, who, like some women, need less intimacy than others. But when asked, men say we  wish we had more intimacy in our friendships with other men.\n \u201cWhat is wrong with men,\u201d Bank and Hansford asked, \u201cthat they can\u2019t or won\u2019t do what they enjoy to the same extent as women do?\u201d In a study of 565 undergraduates, they investigated. Six possible reasons why men shut each other out were measured by questions like \u201chow often [the subject] and their best friend showed affection for each other, had a strong influence on the other, confided in the other, and depended on the other for help.\u201d The worst offenders? Homophobia, and something they called \u201cemotional restraint,\u201d which they measured by responses to statements like \u201cA man should never reveal worries to others.\u201d\n From the vantage point of adulthood, especially in progressive circles, it\u2019s easy to forget the ubiquitous and often quasi-ironic homophobia of teen boys, which circulated among my guy friends. That\u2019s why it was amazing to read  Dude, You\u2019re a Fag by   C. J. Pascoe, 1  1I have to call attention to the fact that so much of the most insightful work on masculinity\u2014Way, Bank, Hansford, Pascoe, Fehr, and others\u2014has been done by women. who spent a year embedded in an American high school divining and taxonomizing the structures of teen male identity in intricate and systemic detail. She concluded that \u201cachieving a masculine identity entails the repeated repudiation of the specter of failed masculinity\u201d\u2014in other words, boys must earn their gender over and over again, often by \u201clobbing homophobic epithets at one another.\u201d And unfortunately, for boys both gay and straight, the rise of gay marriage and queer visibility has not made schoolyards any more tolerant. In fact, Way, who still works with kids in New York City schools, warned that, in contrast to the unselfconscious way straight men can be physically affectionate in repressive societies, in cultures where being gay is a publicly viable option, boys actually feel even   more pressure to prove their straight identity. \u201cI hear that coming from all sorts of sources\u2014parents, kids,\u201d said Way, who notes the simultaneity of the rise of gay acceptance and the phrase \u201c no homo.\u201d\n Way discusses yet another\u00a0reason men may shut each other out: a major betrayal or insult we don\u2019t have the relationship skills to get past.

It\u2019s based on my experience looking at hundreds of beginning designer login flows, thanks to my courses  Learn UI Design and  Learn UX Design.\n   Ironically, the fundamental rule of interaction design is:  remove interaction. Remove clicks, remove reading, remove waiting, remove thinking.\n An easy example: if you know that  literally 95% of people opening a signup form will  immediately click into the first field,  save them the trouble and auto-focus on it.\n   The only things certain in life are (a) death and (b) email addresses have an \u201c@\u201d and a \u201c.\u201d in them. Fortunately, mobile phones have specialized email entry keyboards showing those characters \u2013 but you must label your textbox  type=email in HTML. This is such a simple change to make mobile users\u2019 lives easier.\n Note: also applies to telephone numbers ( type=tel), URLs ( type=url), and numbers ( type=num) in your signup flow.\n   Rather than waiting for the user to fill out  the entire form before you point out any errors, let them know  as soon as your system can tell there\u2019s an error. For something like email, it makes sense to validate on  blur (that is, when they focus on another field).\n Typically I\u2019d try to catch both  blank as well as  invalid email addresses.\n   Every single labelled text input you ever create should have clickable labels. It\u2019s a wonder this isn\u2019t done by HTML by default, but simply add the input element inside its respective label element and you\u2019re good to go. Not only does this (a) allow me to absentmindedly click the label to start typing, but (b) it also helps me if my clumsy finger accidentally misses the textbox by a bit.\n   No user should have to guess at what the password requirements are. Show them  when they\u2019re relevant (P.S. And remove them when they\u2019re not).\n   Allowing users to  view the password they\u2019ve entered will prevent thorny UX issues with choosing a password they didn\u2019t mean to \u2013 while also being less onerous than requiring them to type it twice.\n    You want your sign-in to be so simple, the village idiot could still complete it half asleep without thinking.\n To those ends, don\u2019t use, say, \u201cSign in\u201d and \u201cSign up\u201d \u2013 which requires me to think for half a second whether I want \u201cin\u201d or \u201cup\u201d.\n Instead, go with options like \u201cRegister\u201d vs. \u201cSign in\u201d, or other pairs of options that are more than 2 letters apart. It may only save your users a half a second, but if you wouldn\u2019t save them half a second  now, it\u2019s not looking good for the rest of your app \ud83d\ude2c.\n   In the case that someone  does click the wrong option, you want it to be dead simple for them to switch from registration and logging in \u2013 and vice versa.\n Most commonly, this is displayed as a link ( not a button\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a mistake beginning designers make weirdly often) located at the  bottom of the form.\n   Usernames are tough to remember for every individual service, and you may have been forced to pick something besides your usual. Emails are a much easier way to log in.\n   If the user guesses a password that\u2019s both (a) wrong and (b) doesn\u2019t meet the password requirements, say which requirement the password failed to meet. Much more useful than saying \u201cincorrect password\u201d, but not giving the user a clue as to how they might fix it.\n   Far too often, if you click \u201cForgot password\u201d, you\u2019ll be forced to re-enter an email you typed just 30 seconds before. By the time the user has exhausted their guesses at their password and wants to reset, don\u2019t pester them for information you already know.\n   Having looked at hundreds of signup flows from beginning designers, these tips address some of the most frequent problems I see. Implement all of them, and you\u2019ll have a login UX that feels, well, as noticeable as air.\n Remember: no one came to your app to log in. Heck, they probably didn\u2019t even come to use your app for its own sake. In all likelihood, unless your app is for entertainment, most users probably want to use it to achieve a specific goal  as quickly as possible, then get on with their life.\n As good UX designers, let\u2019s honor our users\u2019 impatience and make this stuff as simple as possible.\n  I\u2019ll walk you through  every part of a UI project \u2014 just like I\u2019ve done for everyone from  Fortune 100 companies to  Y-Combinator startups.\n    We use this field to detect spam bots.

Advocates, lawmakers, and critics worry in particular about what the drug\u2019s $56,000 per-year list price will do to Medicare. The federal insurance program is available to those age 65 and over, which covers the vast majority of the roughly 6 million adults with Alzheimer\u2019s in the US.\n As it stands, the cost of Aduhelm\u2014a doctor-administered intravenous drug\u2014has the potential to eclipse the amount of money Medicare spends on all other doctor-administered drugs  and retail prescription drugs, combined.\n The Food and Drug Administration granted approval of Aduhelm earlier this month, sparking widespread and intense criticism. Experts and industry watchers have called the decision  \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and \u201cdangerous,\u201d noting that clinical trials of Aduhelm did not clearly show that the drug is actually effective at treating Alzheimer\u2019s. The fact that Aduhelm\u2019s maker, Biogen, set the list price so high only intensified the criticism.\n An  analysis earlier this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation pointed out that if just a quarter of the 2 million Medicare beneficiaries who currently use an Alzheimer\u2019s treatment\u2014so 500,000 or so beneficiaries\u2014begin taking Aduhelm, it would cost Medicare an estimated $29 billion a year. In 2019, Medicare spent $37 billion on all doctor-administered drugs, total.\n A new analysis released Monday by Stat pushed the numbers further. The outlet estimated that if all 5.8 million Medicare-eligible adults with Alzheimer\u2019s began taking Aduhelm, it could cost Medicare $334.5 billion a year. Stat noted that $334.5 billion is nearly half of the entire budget for the Department of Defense\u2014or about 4 million Tesla Model Xs (for those who think in terms of Teslas). The eye-popping total also significantly exceeds Medicare\u2019s spending on doctor-administered and retail prescription drugs combined, which totaled about $220 billion in 2019.\n     It\u2019s, of course, impossible to predict just how many people will end up taking Aduhelm and how long they\u2019ll stick to the treatment. But the mushrooming cost estimates are not out of the question. Among its many controversial moves, the FDA approved Aduhelm for use in all Alzheimer\u2019s patients even though Biogen only tested the drug in people with mild disease. And despite the lack of efficacy data, many patients are hopeful and eager to try the drug. Aduhelm is the first newly approved drug for Alzheimer\u2019s in nearly two decades.\n But critics say the drug has only raised false hope among patients and their families, as well as eroded regulatory standards. Earlier this month, a leading industry watchdog called for  three top FDA officials behind the decision to resign or be fired. Meanwhile,  three expert advisers to the regulator resigned their posts in protest. The advisers were part of an 11-member panel that overwhelmingly voted against approval last November.\n Now lawmakers are taking action on the contentious drug. Last week, Sens. Bill Cassidy, MD (R-La.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)  called for a hearing to \u201cexamine the vexing new questions and challenges\u201d Aduhelm&#39;s approval raises for Medicare. And on Friday, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform announced that it is  opening an investigation into Aduhelm\u2019s approval and pricing.\n \u201cWe have serious concerns about the steep price of Biogen\u2019s new Alzheimer\u2019s drug Aduhelm and the process that led to its approval despite questions about the drug\u2019s clinical benefit,\u201d Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), who are leading the investigation, said in a joint statement.\n So far, Biogen and the FDA appear to be taking the criticism in stride. Biogen CEO Michel Vounatsos\u00a0 defended the pricing, saying in a conference call earlier this month: \u201cWe believe that the price is substantiated by the value it is expected to bring to patients, caregivers, and society.\u201d And acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, meanwhile, told Stat that she is just \u201c not that concerned\u201d about the intensifying backlash.",

There\u2019s Apple world, which includes the Mac computer, iPhones and iPads, all designed to work together to help you share files, video chat and watch TV as easily as possible. There\u2019s also Google land, whose Android software powers an array of phones, tablets and computers. But with Windows 11, Microsoft wants to break that mold.\n The software giant said Thursday that its next major version of Windows will launch as a free upgrade this fall, offering a host of new features that in some ways appear designed to position Microsoft as the company whose products work with ones from Apple, Google and pretty much anyone else.\n The company\u2019s expanding its support for the Android app for example, allowing people to more easily run phone apps on their computer. Microsoft\u2019s building its Teams software into Windows in a similar way as Apple\u2019s FaceTime is built into Macs \u2014 except Microsoft doesn\u2019t want it to be exclusive. There\u2019s already a Microsoft Teams app for Mac, iPhones and Androids. (Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even told a reporter he\u2019d be happy to accept FaceTime onto Microsoft computers.)\n I really enjoyed this event; coming in at  a tight 44 minutes and 51 seconds, it had a sort of playfulness and lightness that felt like a big contrast to Apple\u2019s COVID-era commercial-like presentations. It feels like a bit of a role reversal from twenty years ago when Microsoft would have grand over-produced events at CES while Apple put on budget productions at Macworld.\n That\u2019s not a surprise, when you think about it: back then new versions of Windows meant new experiences for basically everyone who used a computer, new opportunities for developers, and new reasons to worry for competitors scared that this might be the year Microsoft made their products a feature. Apple, on the other hand, had nothing to lose.\n Today is the opposite: Apple reigns supreme over the computing landscape. iOS 15 will bring new experiences to a billion users, new APIs provide new opportunities for developers, and Apple isn\u2019t just building in features that hurt competitors, but creating new ones (i.e. Facebook and app install advertising); it is Windows that feels like it has nothing to lose.\n  Of course Windows remains essential software, with a billion-plus userbase of its own, and a critical part of the enterprise landscape in particular (although, as the company highlighted in the presentation, COVID re-established the importance of the PC for consumers as well). What gives Microsoft more freedom-of-movement, though, is that Windows is no longer the core of its business. This remains CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s biggest triumph; I recounted how he shifted the company away from its Windows-centricity in 2018\u2019s  The End of Windows:\n The story of Windows\u2019 decline is relatively straightforward and a classic case of disruption:\n Smartphones first addressed needs the PC couldn\u2019t, then over time started taking over PC functionality directly\n What is more interesting, though, is the story of Windows\u2019 decline in Redmond, culminating with last week\u2019s reorganization that, for the first time since 1980, left the company without a division devoted to personal computer operating systems (Windows was split, with the core engineering group placed under Azure, and the rest of the organization effectively under Office 365; there will still be Windows releases, but it is no longer a standalone business). Such a move didn\u2019t seem possible a mere five years ago, when, in the context of another reorganization, former-CEO Steve Ballmer wrote a memo insisting that Windows was the future\u2026\n Thus my assertion at the top, that the story of how Microsoft came to accept the reality of Windows\u2019 decline is more interesting than the fact of Windows\u2019 decline; this is how CEO Satya Nadella convinced the company to accept the obvious.\n The rest of that article walks through how Nadella led Microsoft to that point, including Office on iPad, several of his strategy memos, and killing Windows Phone; I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to say that something makes for a great business case study, but this really makes for a great business case study!\n What Nadella\u2019s change management also enabled was, to steal the title from  Joanna Stern\u2019s delightful interview with Nadella, a new \u201cStart\u201d for Windows:\n  Yes, the reference was about moving the \u2018Start\u2019 menu to the center, but it applies to the Windows opportunity as well, and that opportunity only exists because what came before was already ended.\n  To return to the Windows/Mac comparison of twenty years ago, Apple\u2019s problem was certainly a lack of developers, but that was, above all, because the company simply didn\u2019t have enough users. The way the company fixed the problem was exactly what you would expect from Apple: they relied on themselves. One of the most brilliant and underrated moves of the Steve Jobs era was the development of the iLife suite of apps \u2014 iMovie, iPhoto, iTunes, iDVD, and GarageBand. I noted last year in  Apple\u2019s Shifting Differentiation:\n OS X brought software to the forefront, delivering not simply a technically sound operating system, but one that was based on Unix, making it particularly attractive to developers. And, on the consumer side, Apple released iLife, a suite of applications that made a Mac useful for normal users. I myself bought my first Mac in this era because I wanted to use GarageBand; 16 years on and my musical ambitions are abandoned, but my Mac usage remains.\n By that point I was buying a Mac despite its hardware: while my iBook was attractive enough, its processor was a Motorola G4 that was not remotely competitive with Intel\u2019s x86 processors; later that year Jobs made the then-shocking-but-in-retrospect-obvious decision to shift Macs to Intel processors. In this case having the same hardware as everyone else in the industry would be a big win for Apple, the better to let their burgeoning software differentiation shine.\n The point of that article, which I wrote upon the release of the M1 Macs, is that Apple\u2019s software differentiation, particularly in the case of the Mac, was the smallest it had been in many years, which is why it was appropriate that the company\u2019s differentiation was shifting back to hardware. Interestingly, though, that means that Microsoft is by definition on the other side of that coin: to the extent that Apple Silicon is superior to x86 (or other ARM chips) is the extent to which Windows is at a disadvantage.\n  Microsoft, like Apple, is responding by doing what they do best, but, because it\u2019s Microsoft, it\u2019s the exact opposite of Apple: instead of more deeply integrating and doing everything themselves in an attempt to appeal to consumers, they are opening up and removing limitations in an attempt to appeal to developers, and by extension consumers who don\u2019t want to be bound into Apple\u2019s ecosystem.\n  Patel: That brings me to some of the big changes in Windows, which are fundamentally about what kind of operating system Windows is going to be and what kind of businesses you can run on it and what kind of business will that be for Microsoft.\n There is a new user interface. The Start button is in the center of the screen. There\u2019s cosmetic differences. But you\u2019re also allowing Android apps to run on Windows. You are integrating the Amazon Android app store. You\u2019ve made some changes to the store economics. You\u2019ve reduced Microsoft\u2019s cut to 15 percent. That\u2019s in comparison to the very controversial 30 percent that Apple charges.\n Then you\u2019re saying to developers, \u201cYou can be in our store and you can not pay us a cut at all if you want to use your own payment model.\u201d How much of that is opportunistic changes \u2014 you\u2019re seeing all the controversy and you sense a market opportunity? And how much of it is this being the correct way to shift your business?\n Nadella: I think it\u2019s driven by competition. What I mean by that is \u2013 what should Microsoft do to manage the platform and the platform rules such that we can thrive in that role?\n The way I\u2019ve interpreted what platforms do is: they have to create opportunity for people who build on the platform. That\u2019s the way to keep a platform relevant. If you\u2019re creating a great opportunity for others to be born on your platform and scale on your platform \u2014 that\u2019s the Microsoft I grew up in. That\u2019s the Windows I grew up with. Whether it is the Adobe folks creating their Creative Cloud or SAP building their ERP [enterprise resource planning] business. Or in today\u2019s world, whether it\u2019s Discord building their community for gamers on Windows or any other business.\n  I sense a real opportunity, because the other two ecosystems that are at scale, for their own internally consistent set of reasons, have conflated \u2014 at least in my mind \u2014 the platform and the aggregation layer with one set of rules. There\u2019s no reason why there should be one set of rules. They can be disaggregated. After all, we do have a store. We do have commerce. You can use it all or you can bring your own. That\u2019s [a] practical thing for Microsoft to do.\n I\u2019m not even trying to make some value statement that Microsoft is virtuous here and others are not. Others have chosen it for whatever reasons they have. This is a design choice and a business model choice. I want to make our own set of design and business model choices so that creators find more choice.\n It\u2019s easy \u2014 and right! \u2014 to note that Microsoft definitely has nothing to lose when it comes to app stores. They don\u2019t make that much money from the Windows App Store, and they (still) need to get more consumer apps for their platform. At the same time, Nadella\u2019s framing of history very much fits with how Microsoft has always thought about Windows; I called it  The Bill Gates Line:\n Over the last few weeks I have been exploring what differences there are between platforms and Aggregators, and was reminded of this anecdote from Chamath Palihapitiya in  an interview with Semil Shah:\n Semil Shah: Do you see any similarities from your time at Facebook with Facebook platform and connect, and how Uber may supercharge their platform?\n Chamath: Neither of them are platforms. They\u2019re both kind of like these comical endeavors that do you as an Nth priority. I was in charge of Facebook Platform. We trumpeted it out like it was some hot shit big deal. And I remember when we raised money from Bill Gates, 3 or 4 months after \u2014 like our funding history was $5M, $83 M, $500M, and then $15B. When that 15B happened a few months after Facebook Platform and Gates said something along the lines of, \u201cThat\u2019s a crock of shit. This isn\u2019t a platform. A platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it, exceeds the value of the company that creates it. Then it\u2019s a platform.\u201d\n By this measure Windows was indeed the ultimate platform \u2014 the company used to brag about only capturing a minority of the total value of the Windows ecosystem \u2014 and the operating system\u2019s clear successors are Amazon Web Services and Microsoft\u2019s own Azure Cloud Services. In all three cases there are strong and durable businesses to be built on top.\n  Nadella: In our case at Microsoft, I\u2019ve always felt that, at least the definition of a platform is: if something bigger than the platform can\u2019t be born, then it\u2019s not a platform. The web, it grew up on Windows. Think about it. If we said, \u201cAll of commerce is only mediated through us,\u201d Amazon couldn\u2019t exist, if we had somehow said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our own commerce model.\u201d\n Therefore I think each company has to choose and see what aggregation layer, what platform layer, [and] what rules work for them and their ecosystem. But, in our case, it\u2019s very clear to us that we do want to solve for the same security issues, [and] discoverability issues, because that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re emphasizing the store. At the same time, the store can be used at different levels by different creators. We want to have that flexibility be a competitive differentiation.\n There is, to be clear, some amount of motivated reasoning here; in response to a question as to whether Microsoft would allow Google\u2019s Play Store on Windows (the answer is yes), one of the examples Nadella cited positively was the existence of multiple marketplaces for games, from the Microsoft Store to the XBox Game Pass to Steam to Epic. I can tell you, though, that when I worked on the initial version of the Microsoft Store a decade ago there was a lot of consternation that Steam had built what Microsoft felt it should have; what if the company had realized the app store opportunity first? Would it be so laid back about competing models if there were billions of dollars at stake?\n Perhaps not, but I think that is a blessing in disguise. It\u2019s hard to feel great about the impact of the App Store on Apple from any angle other than a financial one; it\u2019s not simply a strategy tax, but a cultural one, not only  poisoning the company\u2019s relationship with developers but actually resulting in  a worse experience for users, and it carries huge  regulatory risk.\n   All the best hackers I know are gradually switching to Macs. My friend Robert said his whole research group at MIT recently bought themselves Powerbooks. These guys are not the graphic designers and grandmas who were buying Macs at Apple\u2019s low point in the mid 1990s. They\u2019re about as hardcore OS hackers as you can get. The reason, of course, is OS X. Powerbooks are beautifully designed and run FreeBSD. What more do you need to know?\u2026\n If you want to attract hackers to write software that will sell your hardware, you have to make it something that they themselves use. It\u2019s not enough to make it \u201copen.\u201d It has to be open and good. And open and good is what Macs are again, finally.\n So Windows is open, both in terms of the software you can write on it, the software you can run, and the business models you can employ; Microsoft has thrown the doors wide open to everyone. That leads to the next obvious question: is it good? Certainly this approach is going to lead to a lot of inconsistency; Patel asked Nadella what was the best argument against Android apps on Windows:\n Nadella: I think always the argument will be, \u201cdo we have to have a consistent app model?\u201d Because if you think about innovation \u2014 is there is some kind of NUI or even an AI chip that we want to light up? How can the APIs of that be lit up in such a way that this application can take advantage of it? When you have multiple subsystems and multiple app models, can you surface your platform system-level innovation such that all apps light up?\n That is going to be the fundamental challenge in such a world, but we feel that there are ways. One of the ways I look at this is you can light an Android app or a PWA app or a UWP app on Windows in the future, or even today, for some of the new AI APIs.\n At Microsoft we build for iOS, we build for Android, we build for Windows. That\u2019s one of [our] fundamental challenges. We\u2019re trying to make sure that as developers, we can leverage as much of the common code base, as much of the cloud, but at the same time, be native on each platform.\n Nadella\u2019s last point actually leads to another answer to Graham\u2019s challenge: does it matter? Apple\u2019s shift to increasingly differentiate the Mac via hardware isn\u2019t simply a function of the M1 being possible, but of the reality that for Macs and PCs the vast majority of essential software are web apps, or run on web technologies like Electron; meanwhile, in the one category where being native matters most \u2014 high performance games \u2014 Windows is as dominant as ever.\n Perhaps that is why this presentation felt so playful and light: it might not matter. Windows is an essential business, but Nadella reduced its importance to Microsoft not out of spite, but because the the world had already changed before the company did.", "posttime": "2021-06-29

Compute Engine platform.The technical details below is almost exactly the same as my report sent to the VRP team.\n Attackers could take over virtual machines of the Google Cloud Platform over the network due to weakrandom numbers used by the ISC DHCP software and an unfortunate combination of additional factors.This is done by impersonating the Metadata server from the targeted virtual machine&#39;s point of view.By mounting this exploit, the attacker can grant access to themselves over SSH (public key authentication)so then they can login as the root user.\n  ISC&#39;s implementation of the DHCP client (isc-dhcp-client package on the Debian flavors) relies onrandom(3) to generate pseudo-random numbers (a nonlinear additive feedback random).It is  seeded with the srandom function as follows:\n /* Make up a seed for the random number generator from current\t time plus the sum of the last four bytes of each\t interface&#39;s hardware address interpreted as an integer.\t Not much entropy, but we&#39;re booting, so we&#39;re not likely to\t find anything better. */\tseed = 0;\tfor (ip = interfaces; ip; ip = ip-&gt;next) {\t\tint junk;\t\tmemcpy(&amp;junk,\t\t &amp;ip-&gt;hw_address.hbuf[ip-&gt;hw_address.hlen -\t\t\t\t\t sizeof seed], sizeof seed);\t\tseed += junk;\t}\tsrandom(seed + cur_time + (unsigned)getpid());\n  the sum of the last 4 bytes of the ethernet addresses (MAC) of the network interface cards\n On the Google Cloud Platform, the virtual machines usually have only 1 NIC, something like this:\n root@test-instance-1:~/isc-dhcp-client/real3# ifconfigens4: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 1460 inet 10.128.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.255 broadcast 10.128.0.2 inet6 fe80::4001:aff:fe80:2 prefixlen 64 scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt; ether 42:01:0a:80:00:02 txqueuelen 1000 (Ethernet) RX packets 1336873 bytes 128485980 (122.5 MiB) RX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 frame 0 TX packets 5708403 bytes 2012678044 (1.8 GiB) TX errors 0 dropped 0 overruns 0 carrier 0 collisions 0\n Note that the last 4 bytes ( 0a:80:00:02) of the MAC address ( 42:01:0a:80:00:02) are actually the same asthe internal IP address of the box ( 10.128.0.2). This means, 1 of the 3 components is effectively public.\n The pid of the dhclient process is predictable. The linux kernel assigns process IDs in a linear way.I found that the pid varies between 290 and 315 (by rebooting a Debian 10 based VM many times andchecking the pid), making this component of the seed easily predictable.\n The unix time component has a more broad domain, but this turns out to be not a practical problem (see later).\n The firewall/router of GCP blocks broadcast packets sent by VMs, so only the metadata server (169.254.169.254)receives them. However, some phases of the DHCP protocol don&#39;t rely on broadcasts, and the packets to be sentcan be easily calculated and sent in advance.\n To mount this attack, the attacker needs to craft multiple DHCP packets using a set of precalculated/suspectedXIDs and flood the victim&#39;s dhclient directly (no broadcasts here). If the XID is correct, the victim machine appliesthe network configuration. This is a race condition, but since the flood is fast and exhaustive, the metadata serverhas no real chance to win.\n At this point the attacker is in the position of reconfiguring the network stack of the victim.\n Google heavily relies on the Metadata server, including the distribution of ssh public keys.The connection is secured at the network/routing layer and the server is not authenticated (no TLS, clearhttp only). The  google_guest_agent process, that is responsible for processing the responses of theMetadata server, establishes the connection via the virtual hostname  metadata.google.internal whichis an alias in the  /etc/hosts file. This file is managed by  /etc/dhcp/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/google_set_hostnameas a hook part of the DHCP response processing and the alias is normally added by this script at eachDHCPACK.By having full control over DHCP, the Metadata server can be impersonated. This attack has been found anddocumented by  Chris Moberly, who inspired my research with his oslogin privesc write up here:\n  The difference is, flooding of the dhclient process is done remotely in my attack and the XIDs are guessed.\n  #1 Instructing the client to set the IP address of the rogue metadata server on the NIC.No router is configured. This effectively cuts the internet connection of the box. google_guest_agent can&#39;t fall back to connecting the real metadata server.This DHCP lease is short lived (15 seconds), so dhclient sends a DHCPREQUEST soon again and starts lookingfor a new DHCPACK.\n Since a new ip address (the rouge metadata server) and new hostname ( metadata.google.com) is part of thisDHCPACK packet, the  google_set_hostname function adds two lines like like below (35.209.180.239 is the rougemetadata server I used):\n  The attacker is still flooding at this point, and since ARP is not flushed quickly, these packets arestill delivered.\n #2. Restoring a working network stack, along with the valid router address. This DHCPACK does not contain a hostname,so  google_set_hostname won&#39;t touch  /etc/hosts. The poisoned  metadata.google.internal entry remains in there.\n In case multiple entries are present in the hosts file, the Linux kernel prioritizes the link-local address(169.254.169.254) lower than the routable ones.\n At this point  google_guest_agent can establish a TCP connection to the (rouge) metadata server, where it getsa config that contains the attacker&#39;s ssh public key. The entry is populated into  /root/.ssh/authorized_keysand the attacker can open a root shell remotely.\n  Attackers would gain full access to the targeted virtual machines in all attack scenarios below.\n Attack #1: Targeting a VM on the same subnet (~same project), while it is rebooting.The attacker needs presence on another host.\n Attack #2: Targeting a VM on the same subnet (~same project), while it is refreshing the lease (so no reboot is needed).This takes place every half an hour (1800s), making 48 windows/attempts possible a day.Since an F class VM has ~170.000 pps (packet per second), and a day of unixtime + potential pids makes ~86420 potentialXIDs, this is a feasible attack vector.\n Attack #3: Targeting a VM over the internet. This requires the firewall in front of the victim VM to be fully open.Probably not a common scenario, but since even the webui of GCP Cloud Console has an option for that, there must bequite some VMs with this configuration.In this case the attacker also needs to guess the internal IP address of the VM, but since the first VM seemsto get  10.128.0.2 always, the attack could work, still.\n   As described above, you need to run a rogue metadata server running a host with port 80 open from the internet.I used 35.209.180.239 for this purpose (this is the public IP address of 10.128.0.2, a compute engine box actually),meta.py is running here:\n  My proof of concept exploits a simplified setup, when the victim box is being rebooted. In this case unixtimeof the dhclient process can be guessed easily.\n  The victim box is  10.128.0.4 here. The public IP address of this host is  34.67.219.89.Verifying first we don&#39;t have access using the RSA private key that belongs to id_rsa.pub referenced abovefor meta.py:\n    Then I type reboot on the victim host ( 10.128.0.4).

They really need to improve the srandom setup. Maybe get a new feature added that drops packets bynon-legitimate DHCP servers (so you could rely on this as an additional security measure).\n Even if ISC has improved their software, it won&#39;t be upgraded on most of your VMs. Analyze your firewall logs to learnif you have any clients that rely on these ports for any legitimate reasons.Block udp/68 between VMs, so that only the metadata server could could carry out DHCP.\n Stop using the Metadata server via this virtual hostname (metadata.google.internal). At least in your official agents.\n Stop managing the virtual hostname (metadata.google.internal) via DHCP. The IP address is documented to be stable anyway.\n Secure the communication with the Metadata server by using TLS, at least in your official agents.\n Note, using a random generated MAC address wouldn&#39;t prevent mounting the attack on the same subnet.\n   I checked only the major ones, they were not affected (at least at the time of checking) due to another factors(e.g. not using DHCP by default).\n  Google usually closes bug reports with status &#34;Unfeasible&#34; when the efforts required to fix outweigh the risk.This is not the case here. I think there is some technical complexity in the background, which doesn&#39;t allowthem deploying a network level protection measure easily.Until the fix arrives, don&#39;t use DHCP or setup a host level firewall rule to ensure the DHCP communication comesfrom the metadata server (169.254.169.254).\n  2020-09-26: Issue identified, attack #1 validated2020-09-27: Reported to Google VRP2020-09-29: VRP triage is complete &#34;looking into it&#34;2020-10-02: Further details shared about attack #2 and #32020-10-07: Accepted, &#34;Nice catch&#34;2020-12-02: Update requested about the estimated time of fix2020-12-03: ... &#34;holiday season coming up&#34;2021-06-07: Asked Google if a fix is coming in a reasonable time, as I&#39;m planning to publish an advisory2021-06-08: Standard response &#34;we ask for a reasonable advance notice.&#34;2021-06-25: Public disclosure", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:24:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "google,compute,dhcp", "title": "Google Compute\u5f15\u64ce\uff08GCE\uff09VM\u201c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u201d\u6839\u6e90\u901a\u8fc7DHCP\u6cdb\u6ee5 ", "title_en": "Google Compute Engine (GCE) VM \u201cremote\u201d root exploit via DHCP flood", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/irsl/gcp-dhcp-takeover-code-exec", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "compute", "dhcp"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d7a221699a361b32f062e280c50f8cb4.jpg", "infoid": 1068416, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u6d89\u53ca\u5177\u6709\u79f0\u4e3a\u56fa\u4ef6\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u5e38\u5e38\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5b83\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8865\u4e01\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5584\u610f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u66f4\u65b0\u6234\u5c14\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u7684\u56fa\u4ef6\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u8bbf\u95ee\u6743\u9650\u3002\n \u5b89\u5168\u516c\u53f8Eclypsium\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd128\u4e2a\u6234\u5c14\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u578b\u53f7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53f0\u5f0f\u673a\uff0c\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u548c\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6f0f\u6d1e\u603b\u5171\u63ed\u793a\u4e863000\u4e07\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5229\u7528\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u5305\u542bMicrosoft\uff06\uff0339;

It&#39;s often  riddled with vulnerabilities, it&#39;s difficult to update with patches, and it&#39;s increasingly the  target of real-world attacks. Now a well-intentioned mechanism to easily update the firmware of Dell computers is itself vulnerable as the result of four rudimentary bugs. And  these vulnerabilities could be exploited to gain full access to target devices.\n The  new findings from researchers at the security firm Eclypsium affect 128 recent models of Dell computers, including desktops, laptops, and tablets. The researchers estimate that the vulnerabilities expose 30 million devices in total, and the exploits even work in models that incorporate  Microsoft&#39;s Secured-core PC protections\u2014a system specifically built to reduce firmware vulnerability. Dell is releasing patches for the flaws today.\n \u201cThese vulnerabilities are on easy mode to exploit. It\u2019s essentially like traveling back in time\u2014it\u2019s almost like the \u201990s again,\u201d says Jesse Michael, principal analyst at Eclypsium. \u201cThe industry has achieved all this maturity of security features in application and operating system-level code, but they&#39;re not following best practices in new firmware security features.\u201d\n The vulnerabilities show up in a Dell feature called BIOSConnect, which allows users to easily, and even automatically, download firmware updates. BIOSConnect is part of a broader Dell update and remote operating system management feature called SupportAssist, which has had its own share of  potentially problematic vulnerabilities. Update mechanisms are  valuable  targets for attackers, because they can be tainted to distribute malware.\n The four vulnerabilities the researchers discovered in BIOSConnect wouldn&#39;t allow hackers to seed malicious Dell firmware updates to all users at once. They could be exploited, though, to individually target victim devices and easily gain remote control of the firmware. Compromising a device&#39;s firmware can give attackers full control of the machine, because firmware coordinates hardware and software, and runs as a precursor to the computer&#39;s operating system and applications.\n    \u201cThis is an attack that lets an attacker go directly to the BIOS,\u201d the fundamental firmware used in the boot process, says Eclypsium researcher Scott Scheferman. \u201cBefore the operating system even boots and is aware of what\u2019s going on, the attack has already happened. It\u2019s an evasive, powerful, and desirable set of vulnerabilities for an attacker that wants persistence.\u201d\n One important caveat is that attackers couldn&#39;t directly exploit the four BIOSConnect bugs from the open internet. They need to have a foothold into the internal network of victim devices. But the researchers emphasize that the ease of exploitation and lack of monitoring or logging at the firmware level would make these vulnerabilities attractive to hackers. Once an attacker has compromised firmware, they can likely remain undetected long-term inside a target&#39;s networks.\n The Eclypsium researchers disclosed the vulnerabilities to Dell on March 3. They will present the findings at the Defcon security conference in Las Vegas at the beginning of August.\n \u201cDell remediated multiple vulnerabilities for Dell BIOSConnect and HTTPS Boot features available with some Dell Client platforms,&#34; the company said in a statement. \u201cThe features will be automatically updated if customers have  Dell auto-updates turned on.&#34; If not, the company says customers should manually install the patches \u201cat their earliest convenience.\u201d\n The Eclypsium researchers caution, though, that this is one update you may not want to download automatically. Since BIOSConnect itself is the vulnerable mechanism, the safest way to get the updates is to navigate to Dell&#39;s  Drivers and Downloads website and manually download and install the updates from there. For the average user, though, the best approach is to simply update your Dell however you can, as quickly as possible.\n \u201cWe\u2019re seeing these bugs that are relatively simple like logic flaws show up in the new space of firmware security,\u201d Eclypsium&#39;s Michael says. \u201cYou\u2019re trusting that this house has been built in a secure way, but it\u2019s actually sitting on a sandy foundation.&#34;\n After running through a number of nightmare attack scenarios from firmware insecurity, Michael takes a breath. \u201cSorry,\u201d he says. &#34;I can rant about this a lot.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-26 18:35:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "pc,feature,\u56fa\u4ef6", "title": "\u4e00\u4e2a\u826f\u597d\u7684\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u6234\u5c14PC\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb ", "title_en": "A well-meaning feature leaves millions of Dell PCs vulnerable", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/06/a-well-meaning-feature-leaves-millions-of-dell-pcs-vulnerable/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pc", "feature", "\u56fa\u4ef6"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "604199403b1c65e642681da55e771d43.jpeg", "infoid": 1068415, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u4e8e\u5468\u4e94\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u671f\u7684UFO\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\uff08UAP\uff09\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4eba\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5929\uff0cODNI\u63d0\u4ea4\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\uff08UAP\uff09\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u65ad\u4e86UAP\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ec4\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u9605\u8bfb\u6b64\u5904\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff1ahttps://t.co/gjduf42xmr\n -  DNI\uff08@odnigov\uff09\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff08@odnigov\uff092021\u5e746\u670825\u65e5\n  \u56fd\u5bb6\u60c5\u62a5\u7f72\u7f72\u957f\uff08ODNI\uff09\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e86144\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u7f8e\u56fd\u519b\u961f\u57282004\u5e74\u81f32021\u5e74\u4e4b\u95f4\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u672a\u8ba4\u51fa\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002\n \u62a5\u544a\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u201c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u62a5\u544a\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u201d\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u4e0d\u80fd\u5c31UAP\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u6216\u610f\u56fe\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\n \u6839\u636e\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u8bc1\u636e\u5c06UAP\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u5916\u56fd\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\u8be5\u62a5\u544a\u6ca1\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u5916\u661f\u751f\u547d\u3002\n \u5728144\u4e2a\u906d\u9047\u4e2d\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u53ea\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u4eba\u504f\u8f6c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6c14\u7403\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u4eba\u5458\u8fd8\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u73b0\u8c61\u53ef\u80fd\u81f3\u5c11\u89e3\u91ca\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002 \n\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u201c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0cUAP\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bfb\u5e38\u7684\u98de\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u201d \u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6b3a\u9a97\u6216\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8bef\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u201d  \u8be5\u62a5\u544a\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u660e\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u73b0\u8c61\u7279\u9063\u90e8\u961f\uff08UAPTF\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u201c\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8d44\u91d1\u201d\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8c03\u67e5UAP\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u516c\u4f17\u5e0c\u671b\u6295\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u8d44\u6e90\u3002  UPTF\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e748\u6708\u7531\u56fd\u9632\u90e8\uff08DoD\uff09\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u7684\u6709\u5173\u672a\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002 ", "note_en": "The U.S. government released its highly-anticipated UFO  report on Friday, covering  Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). It may leave people wanting.\n  Today, ODNI submitted to Congress a preliminary report regarding Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) that relays the progress made by the UAP Task Force. Read the report here:  https://t.co/gjDUf42XMR\n\u2014 Office of the DNI (@ODNIgov)  June 25, 2021\n  The analysis, released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), examined 144 instances in which U.S. military planes encountered unidentified objects between 2004 and 2021.\n The report stated that investigators could not come to a conclusion on the nature or intent of UAP due to the \u201climited amount of high-quality reporting.\u201d\n No available evidence, according to investigators, links the UAP to a foreign adversary. The report makes no reference whatsoever to extraterrestrial life.\n Of the 144 encounters, investigators were only able to offer an explanation for one: a large ballon that was deflating. Investigators also argued that natural phenomenon could likely explain at least some of the incidents.\n  \u201cIn a limited number of incidents, UAP reportedly appeared to exhibit unusual flight characteristics,\u201d the report says. \u201cThese observations could be the result of sensor errors, spoofing, or observer misperception and require additional rigorous analysis.\u201d\n In the end, the report concludes by suggesting that the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) could receive \u201cadditional funding for research and development\u201d to further investigate UAP if the public wants to devote more resources to it.\n The UAPTF was set up by the Department of Defense (DOD) last August to investigate the growing number of reports concerning unexplained objects.",

", "note_en": "It was a Saturday morning. I was watching Youtube &amp; saw this video on Youtube.\n  Few week ago I was fixing a small edge case bug in one of our products. Even before starting to fix the issue, I knew it will be one line of code change. So I did the fix &amp; next day here come the QA report, because of that one line change I did, I have introduced 4 more edge cases which cause some inconsistancies. Then I started fixing those issues one by one, few hours later I managed to fix everything, but with several changes to the existing structure. In which there were few new local variables, added an optional parameter to a method, added one new state.\n I started thinking is it worth all these new additions &amp; added complexity for a small edge case bug. For few minutes I was thinking of negotiating with product team not to fix the initial edge case. Because it was not a critical bug &amp; only cause UI inconsistency.\n Then I revisited the initial bug &amp; started from the begining again. Because now I know if I do one line change it will introduce few more edge cases, I took a different approach &amp; managed to fix the initial bug without introducing any edge cases. Most importantly no new local variables or method parameter changes or new states. I continued thinking about what happened that day &amp; even though it ended up well, there was a high chance I could have gone with all additional changes without realising there was a better way. So when I watched this Youtube video today morning, I knew that is exactly the same thing happened to me. I continued building more pieces without realising removing the first piece is the better solution.\n So we can relate this brain function of adding pieces rather than removing pieces in software development. For example there is this library A, which is great at doing xyz than the current library B we are using. So we start using library A &amp; realise one of the drawbacks of library A is performing abc action is slower than Library B. So we introduce library C to optimise it. There are cases still follow this chain benifits overall. But there can be other possible solutions rather than keep adding new libraries. Most of the time we miss those options because we love adding things rather than removing.\n One more example I can think of (some of you will not agree with this), years ago we wanted our web applications to render html dynamically &amp; didn\u2019t want to refresh whole page everytime user go to a new page.

Naming of products, of paradigms and of parts of your code. The reason naming is both hard and important is because it is an act of communication; without good names your code might as well be written in, well, code. A name is not simply a label: it informs and guides the reader\u2019s mental model. Names can change the way the reader thinks. A good name is a sharing of minds; a poor name is a missed opportunity to learn and say what we mean.\n We of  ten adopt conventions to make some aspects of naming easier. Such consistency can be a good thing, but not all practices that are consistent are necessarily good. Having a common vocabulary of concepts is useful across a codebase, but the concepts named should qualify as useful information \u2014 consistent noise is just noise.\n Homeopathic naming is one of the commonest habits programmers can fall into without realising: making names longer by adding more words with the goal of adding more meaning to code, but in practice diluting the meaning with every   Factory/ Manager/ Object/ Controller/ Value/Service/\u2026 added. Diluting things dilutes them; it does not make them more potent. Affixing Lego-brick parts to an identifier does not amplify or enhance its meaning, and often serves to highlight there may have been little meaning there in the first place. A naming convention should not be used to prop up weak names. If a name doesn\u2019t communicate well, we need to see that clearly so we can address it rather than smothering it, hiding it behind a wall of Lego.\n One homeopathic naming ritual common to both the .NET and the Java worlds is adding the suffix  Exception to a class to denote that its instances are exceptions. This affectation is imprinted on developers unaware that they have acquired it as a habit \u2014 an unexamined and unchanged  factory setting absorbed from their environment.\n Exceptions in these languages are privileged and prominent, meaning that, based on their context, classes and objects that are exceptions are visibly and syntactically distinct from classes and objects that are not. They have exclusive rights to appear in specific and compiler-enforced places in your code: in a  throw, in a  catch and, in the case of the Java, in a  throws list (but  see if you can avoid this). By definition, things that appear in these places can only be exceptions \u2014 the compiler knows they must be exceptions and so does the reader, so there\u2019s nothing more to add.\n  In the first edition of this book we did a poor job of explaining what we meant by  Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself. Many people took it to refer to code only: they thought that DRY means \u201cdon\u2019t copy-and-paste lines of source.\u201d\n That  is part of DRY, but it\u2019s a tiny fraction and a fairly trivial part.\n DRY applies to names, language constructs and metadata just as much as it applies to code duplication, documentation and manual repetition of automatable processes.\n If your programming language denotes abstract classes with a keyword such as  abstract, don\u2019t repeat yourself by putting  Abstract in the name or by telling the reader that its necessary use is as base class by naming it  Base. If a class is a concrete class then, by definition, it is an implementation class, so don\u2019t repeat yourself by putting  Impl in the name. If your compiler and IDE can tell an integer from a string, don\u2019t repeat yourself by encoding that detail in a variable name, as popularised by the once-popular Hungarian encryption scheme. If your testing framework has you mark your tests with a  Test annotation, attribute or macro \u2014 and your test appears inside a class, file or folder named  Test \u2014 don\u2019t repeat yourself by including  Test in the name of your test. Use the bandwidth of a name to tell the reader things they need to know rather than repeating what is already known. Use your bandwidth for signal rather than noise \u2014 and use less bandwidth.\n We understand that a class and its instances represent exceptions by their syntactic position, but this is not the only clue. That a class represents an exception should also be obvious either by its parentage or by its name. The name should represent whatever the problem is, and should do so directly and specifically. To add  Exception to the end is either redundant \u2014 so remove it \u2014 or an indication of a poor name \u2014 so rename it.\n     These names are concise and descriptive. Even without seeing their context of use, there is little question that these are bearers of bad news. .NET exceptions use similarly negative phrasing, and other ominous words like  Invalid and  Bad. There is little room for misunderstanding.\n     Hmm, not so clear. But is that a problem with dropping the  Exception suffix? Or is it a problem revealed by dropping it? Let\u2019s try renaming these classes to the problems they actually signal:\n  These revised names are both accurate and precise, indicating the actual condition of the exception without being vague or resorting to noise words. Is security grounds for an exception? No, but a security violation is. The exception relates to security, but the name misses the opportunity to be specific. Similarly,  NumberFormat is not the problem, but attempting to use a string with an  InvalidNumberFormat is.\n Is it exception-worthy that a pointer (umm, reference) is null? No, in a language with references that can be set to null, null is an acceptable value. The problem being signalled is either that a null has been dereferenced in the JVM, such as calling a method via a null reference, or that a null has been passed to code that considers null to be invalid as an argument. Either way, the null is unexpected.\n Being more specific about names also helps highlight ambiguities and vagueness, as in this case: Java practice fails to make a clear distinction between language-signalled errors, such as dereferencing nulls, and code-signalled errors, such as rejecting a null argument as illegal. In .NET, the former case is expressed using  NullReferenceException (i.e.,  NullDereferenced) and the latter using  ArgumentNullException (i.e.,  InvalidNullArgument), which is an  ArgumentException (i.e.,  InvalidArgument). As to whether Java code is written to throw  NullPointerException or  IllegalArgumentException is largely dependent on the codebase, the team, the individual, the phase of the moon, etc.\n Just as you don\u2019t tag your verbs with  Verb or your nouns with  Noun when you write or speak, there is little reason \u2014 and many reasons not to \u2014 tack  Exception onto the end of an exception class\u2019s name. It can be considered a code smell rather than a practice to follow, often depriving programmers of the opportunity to find a better name.\n A possible exception to this guideline? The general class that indicates that its descendants are exceptions:  Exception. But then again, that\u2019s not a suffix: that\u2019s the whole of its name and the concept that it represents, so perhaps there are few exceptions on  Exception naming.", "posttime": "2021-06-26

", "note_en": "January 20, 2016   Volume 13, issue 9       There is an inexorable trend toward storing and sending immutable data. We  need immutability to coordinate at a distance, and we  can afford immutability as storage gets cheaper. This article is an  amuse-bouche sampling the repeated patterns of computing that leverage immutability. Climbing up and down the compute stack really does yield a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\n It wasn&#39;t that long ago that computation was expensive, disk storage was expensive, DRAM (dynamic random access memory) was expensive, but coordination with latches was cheap. Now all these have changed using cheap computation (with many-core), cheap commodity disks, and cheap DRAM and SSDs (solid-state drives), while coordination with latches has become harder because latch latency loses lots of instruction opportunities. Keeping immutable copies of lots of data is now affordable, and one payoff is reduced coordination challenges.\n   Storage is increasing as the cost per terabyte of disk keeps dropping. This means a lot of data can be kept for a long time. Distribution is increasing as more and more data and work are spread across a great distance. Data within a data center seems &#34;far away.&#34; Data within a many-core chip may seem &#34;far away.&#34; Ambiguity is increasing when trying to coordinate with systems that are far away\u2014more stuff has happened since you&#39;ve heard the news. Can you take action with incomplete knowledge? Can you wait for enough knowledge?\n   As various technological areas have evolved, they have responded to these trends of increasing storage, distribution, and ambiguity by using immutable data in some very fun ways. This article explores how apps use immutability in their ongoing work, how they generate immutable data sets for later offline analysis, how SQL can expose and process immutable snapshots, and how massively parallel big-data work relies on immutable data sets. This leads to looking at the ways in which semantically immutable data sets may be altered while remaining immutable.\n Next, the article considers how updatability is layered atop the creation of new immutable files via techniques such as LSF (log-structured file system), COW (copy-on-write), and LSM (log-structured merge-tree). How do replicated and distributed file systems depend on immutability to eliminate anomalies? Hardware folks have joined the party by leveraging these tricks in SSDs and HDDs (hard-disk drives). Immutability is a key architectural concept at many layers of the stack, as shown in figure 1.\n     Many kinds of computing are append-only. This section looks at some of the ways this is commonly accomplished.\n   In append-only computing, observations are recorded forever (or for a long time). Derived results are calculated on demand (or periodically precalculated).\n This is similar to a DBMS (database management system) in which transaction logs record all the changes made to the database. High-speed appends are the only way to change the log. From this perspective, the contents of the database hold a caching of the latest record values in the logs. The truth is the log. The database is a cache of a subset of the log. That cached subset happens to be the latest value of each record and index value from the log.\n   Accountants don&#39;t use erasers; otherwise they may go to jail. All entries in a ledger remain in the ledger. Corrections can be made but only by making new entries in the ledger. When a company&#39;s quarterly results are published, they include small corrections to the previous quarter. Small fixes are OK. They are append-only, too.\n Some entries describe  observed facts. For example, receiving a debit or credit against a checking account is an observed fact. Some entries describe  derived facts, meaning that, based on the observations, something new can be calculated. For example, amortized capital expenses based upon a rate and a cost are derived facts. Another example is the current bank account balance with applied debits and credits.\n   Single-master computing means changes are ordered somehow. The order can come from a centralized master or some Paxos-like 11 distributed protocol providing serial ordering. Changes are semantically applied one at a time and are layered over their predecessors. New values supersede old ones. The granularity of this may be a set of records in a relational store or a new version of a document. Distributed single-master computing means there is a space of data (relational records, documents, export files, and more) that emanates from one logical location with new versions over time.\n   Before telephones, people used messengers\u2014often kids walking through town to deliver the message. Alternatively, the postal service delivered the messages, which took a long time. Sometimes people used fancy forms with many layers, each a different color. They had multiple sections on the page. Each participant filled out a section (pressing hard with the pen), then tore off the back page of the form and filed it. Each participant got the data needed and added more data to the form. Earlier sections could not be updated; data could only be appended to the end.\n Before computers, workflow was frequently captured in paper forms with multiple parts on the form and multiple pages (e.g., &#34;Fill out Part 3 and keep the goldenrod page from the back&#34;). This &#34;distributed computing&#34; was append-only. New messages were new additions to the form\u2014each was a version and each was immutable. You were never allowed to overwrite what had been written.\n   Surprisingly (to database old-timers), not all data is kept in relational database systems. This section (based on an earlier paper 7) discusses some of the implications of unlocking data.\n   Data on the inside refers to what is kept and managed by a classic relational database system and its surrounding application code. Sometimes this is referred to as a  service.\n Data on the inside lives in a transactional world with changes applied in a serializable fashion (or something close to that).\n   Data on the outside is prepared as messages, files, documents, and/or Web pages. These are sent out from a service into the world. It is also possible that outside data has been created by some other mechanism than one using databases.\n   * Is unlocked. It is not locked in the database. A copy is extracted and sent outside.\n * Has identity. When sent outside, these files, documents, and messages have a unique identity (perhaps a URL).\n * May be versioned. Updates aren&#39;t updates but new versions with a new unique identifier.\n   There are deep differences in the representation, meaning, and usage of inside data versus outside data. Increasingly, data is being kept as outside (immutable) data (see figure 2).\n    The data set is a collection of data with a unique ID. Some data sets have structures that look like a number of tables with schema. How are these data sets referenced by a relational database, and how do relational operators span both the DBMS and data set?\n   A data set is a fixed and immutable set of tables. The schema for each table is captured in the data set. The contents of each table are captured when the data set is created. Since the data set is immutable, it is created, may be consumed for reading, and then deleted. Data sets may be relational, or they may have some other representation such as a graph, a hierarchy such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), or any other representation (figure 3). A data set is a logical set of immutable tables along with its schema.\n    Data sets may be referenced by an RDBMS (relational DBMS). The metadata is visible to the DBMS. The data can be accessed for a read, even though it may not be updated. The data set may be semantically present within the relational system even if it is physically stored elsewhere. Because the data set is immutable, there&#39;s no need for locking and no worries about controlling updates.\n   A functional calculation takes a set of inputs and predictably creates a set of outputs. This can happen with a query against locked or snapshot data in a relational database, and it can happen on a big-data MapReduce-style system. In both cases, there is still an unchanging collection of data. With snapshots or some form of isolation, database data becomes semantically immutable for the duration of the calculation. With big-data calculations, the inputs are typically stored in GFS (Google File System) or HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) files.\n There&#39;s no semantic obstacle to doing JOINs across data stored inside a relational database and data stored in external data sets. Locking (or snapshot isolation) provides a version of the relational database, which may be joined. Named and frozen data sets may be joined with relational data (see figure 4). You can meaningfully apply relational operations across data held in a DBMS and data held in immutable data sets.\n  In some ways, the ability to work across immutable data sets and relational databases is surprising. An immutable data set is defined with an identity and an optional version. Its schema, which describes the shape and form of the data set at the time of its creation, is descriptive, whereas the schema held in the RDBMS is prescriptive.\n This tailoring of the schema to meld the two connects the schema of the data set (describing its data when written) with the schema of the RDBMS (describing its data as of the snapshot). Also, the JOINs and other relational operators must necessarily combine the contents of the data set as interpreted as a set of relational tables. This sidesteps the notion of identity within the data set and focuses exclusively on the tables as interpreted as a set of values held within rows and columns.\n   A consumer may see data sets as immutable even if they change under the covers.\n   A data set is semantically immutable. It has a set of tables, rows, and columns. It may also have semi-structured data (e.g., JSON). It may have application-specific data in a proprietary format.\n Data sets may be defined as a SELECTION, PROJECTION, or JOIN over previously existing data sets. Semantically, all that data is now a part of the new data set.\n What&#39;s important about a data set is that it appears to be unchanging from the standpoint of the reader.\n   Data sets are semantically immutable but can be physically changed. You can add an index or two. It&#39;s OK to denormalize tables to optimize for read access. Data sets can be partitioned and the pieces placed close to their readers. A column-oriented representation of a data set may also make sense.\n You can make a copy of a table with far fewer columns to optimize for quick access (a skinny table). The column values can be left in both the skinny table and fat table.\n By watching and monitoring the read usage of a data set, you may realize that new optimizations (e.g., new indices) are possible.\n   Immutability is the backbone of big data. Massively parallel computations are based on immutable inputs and functional calculations. MapReduce 3 and Dryad 9 both take immutable files as input. The work is cut into pieces, each with immutable input. This functional calculation (using immutable inputs) is idempotent, making it possible to fail and restart. Immutability is the backbone of big data. MapReduce performs functional computations over immutable data to create immutable outputs. Failure and restart, so essential to reliable big data, are based on the idempotent nature of functional computation over immutable inputs.\n   Data sets show an immutable semantic prism, even if the underlying representation is augmented or completely replaced. The King James Bible is, character for character, immutable\u2014even when it is printed in a different font; even when digitized; even when accompanied by different pictures.\n Is a data set changed if there is a lossless transformation to a new schema representation? Can the new address field have more capacity? Can the enum values be mapped to a new underlying representation? Can the data be mapped from UTF-8 to UTF-16 encoding?\n Having the right bits is not enough. You have to know how to interpret them. For example, &#34;President Bush&#34; had a different meaning in 1990 than in 2005. The word &#34;napkin&#34; is interpreted differently in the US and the UK.\n   When an immutable data set is created, the semantics of the data may not be changed. The contents may only be described as they are at the time the data set is created.\n Most programmers are used to SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) supporting dynamic changes in the metadata for their tables. This happens at a transaction boundary and can prescribe a new schema for the existing data. SQL DDL can be thought of as  prescriptive metadata since it is prescribing the representation (which may change). Immutable data sets have  descriptive metadata that explains what&#39;s there.\n Of course, it is possible to create new data sets that refer to one or more existing data sets in order to create a new representation of their data. Each new data set has a unique ID. There&#39;s nothing wrong with having a data set implemented by reference and not by value.\n   The goal of normalization is to eliminate update anomalies. When the data is not stored in a normalized fashion, updates might yield unpleasant results. The classic example is an imperfectly normalized table in which each employee has his or her manager&#39;s name and phone number. This makes it very hard to update the manager&#39;s phone number since it is stored in many places. Normalization is very important in a database designed for updating.\n Normalization is not necessary in an immutable data set, however. The only reason to normalize immutable data sets may be to reduce the storage necessary for them. On the other hand, denormalized data sets may be easier and faster to process as inputs to a computation.\n   Each version is immutable. This section looks first at multiversion concurrency control; then techniques such as LSM that provide a semantic of change within a transactional space while generating immutable data that describes the state of these changes; finally, it looks at the world through the lens of COW, in which high-performance updates are implemented by writing new immutable data.\n   Versions should have immutable names. Other than the first version of something, a new version captures a replacement for or an augmentation of an earlier version. A  linear version history is sometimes referred to as being strongly consistent: one version replaces another; there&#39;s one parent and one child; each version is immutable; each version has an identity. The alternative to linear version history is a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of version history, in which there are many parents and/or many children. This is sometimes called eventual consistency.\n   Strongly consistent, or ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability), transactions appear as if they run in a serial order. This is sometimes called serializability. 2\n The database changes version by version. Transaction T1 is a version and later transaction T2 is a version. Transactions layer new versions of record and index changes atop earlier versions. The new versions can be captured as snapshots of the entire database (although this wouldn&#39;t result in high performance).\n Alternatively, the new version can be captured as changes to the previous version. In this way, a key-value store can be built, and a relational database can be built atop a key-value store. Records are deleted by adding tombstones. Changing the database is done by adding new records to the key-value store.\n If a timestamp is added to each new version, it is possible to show the state of the database at a given point in time. This allows the user to navigate the state of the database to any older version. Ongoing work can see a stable snapshot of a version of the database.\n   LSM presents a fa\u00e7ade of change atop immutable files. With an LSM tree, 15 changes to the key-value store are accomplished by writing new versions of the affected records. These new versions are logged to an immutable file. Periodically, the new versions of the key values are sorted by key and written to an immutable file known as a Level 0 file within the LSM tree. Level 0 files are merged into a collection of Level 1 files (typically 10 Level 1 files, each containing one-tenth of the key range). Similarly, Level 1 files are merged with Level 2 files on a 10-to-1 basis. As you move down the LSM tree, each level has 10 times as many files. Reading a record typically involves searching one file per level. As the LSM files merge, new immutable files with new identities can be written.\n   An LSM tree can create changeable data out of immutable files by performing a COW. The granularity of the copy is typically a key-value pair. For a relational database, this can be a key-value pair for each record or each index entry. The changes are copied into the log and then into the LSM tree (and copied a few more times for merges).\n High-performance COW happens with logging and classic DBMS performance techniques. The new versions are captured in memory and logged for failure recovery. The identity of each log file is a unique ID, and the log files are immutable. Each new log file can record the history of its preceding log files and even the identity of upcoming log files. Having one of the recent log-file IDs means the entire LSM key-value store can be reconstructed.\n   Many file systems keep immutable files consisting of immutable blocks. This section explores at a high level the implementation of GFS and HDFS and the implications of what can be done with these files. It discusses the vagaries of files that can be renamed and considers the value of storing immutable data within a consistent hash store.\n   An early example of reifying change through immutability is the log-structured file system. 16 In this wonderful invention, file-system writes are always appended to the end of a circular buffer. Occasionally, enough metadata to reconstruct the file system is added to the circular buffer. Old data must be copied forward so it is not overwritten.\n Log-structured file systems have some interesting performance characteristics, both good and bad. Today they are an important technique. As technology trends continue to move in the direction of recent years, they will become even more important.\n   GFS, 5 HDFS, 1 and others offer highly available files. Each file is a bunch of blocks (also called  chunks). The file consists of a file name and a description of the blocks needed to provide a bytestream. Each block is replicated in the cluster for durability and high availability. They are typically replicated three times over different fault zones in the data center.\n Each file is immutable and (typically) single-writer. The file is created, and one process can append to it. The file lives for a while and is eventually deleted. Multiwriters are difficult, and GFS had some challenges with this. 13\n Immutable files and immutable blocks empower this replication. The file system has no concept of a change to a complete file. Each block&#39;s immutability allows it to be easily replicated without any update anomalies because it doesn&#39;t get updated.\n   An immutable file has an identity and contents, neither of which can change. You can copy an immutable file whenever and wherever you want and share the immutable copies across users. As long as you manage reference counts (so you know when it&#39;s OK to delete it), you can use one copy of the file to share across many users. You can distribute immutable files wherever you want. With the same identity and same contents, the files are location independent.\n   GFS and HDFS both provide immutable files.
