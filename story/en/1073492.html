That’s not as catchy though is it? But it’s true.</p><p>不仅如此，还需要有足够低的恐惧感，担心未来无法满足自己最基本的需求，这样在未知的未来，在当下投资资源就不会被视为风险太大。这可没那么吸引人，不是吗？但这是真的。</p><p> We just witnessed a very large demonstration of that self-evident truth in the form of the monthly child tax credit as tens of millions of parents experienced six months of increased access to resources along with a decreased sense of economic insecurity.</p><p>我们刚刚见证了这一不言而喻的事实的一个非常大的证明，那就是每月的儿童税收抵免，因为数千万父母经历了六个月时间，获得资源的机会增加，同时经济不安全感降低。</p><p> “The CTC has helped expand our country’s small business ecosystem and is allowing more Americans to realize their entrepreneurial goals.”</p><p>“反恐委员会帮助扩大了我国的小企业生态系统，并让更多美国人实现了他们的创业目标。”</p><p> Representatives for Small Business Majority, Main Street Alliance, and the American Sustainable Business Network in a letter to Congress</p><p>代表小企业多数派、Main Street Alliance和美国可持续商业网络致函国会</p><p> After three months of the guaranteed monthly payments,  the amount of parents with incomes under $50,000 describing themselves as self-employed increased by 22%. After just the first month, the payments had  lifted in-store retail sales by 15.5%, exceeding even pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>在保证每月支付三个月后，收入低于5万美元、自称为自营职业者的父母数量增加了22%。仅在第一个月后，这些付款就让店内零售额增长了15.5%，甚至超过了大流行前的水平。</p><p> Observations like these prompted Small Business Majority, Main Street Alliance, and American Sustainable Business Network to send  a letter to Congressional leaders underscoring their support of the monthly CTC as being beneficial to America’s entrepreneurs. The letter concluded by stating, “The CTC has helped expand our country’s small business ecosystem and is allowing more Americans to realize their entrepreneurial goals.”</p><p>类似的观察结果促使小企业多数党、主街联盟和美国可持续商业网络致信国会领导人，强调他们对每月反恐委员会的支持对美国企业家有利。信的结尾写道，“反恐委员会帮助扩大了我国的小企业生态系统，并让更多美国人实现了他们的创业目标。”</p><p> A  national survey of 1,259 small business owners also found strong support for the monthly CTC. 61% of those surveyed were in favor of the payments. 59% of them  said the payments were enabling parents to spend more money to the benefit of Main Street small businesses. 62% of them believed that the payments were enabling more people to afford child care which was benefitting small businesses. And 23% of them were themselves receiving CTC checks which personally helped them as entrepreneurs to have a bit more stability in their lives.</p><p>对1259名小企业主进行的一项全国性调查也发现，每月一次的CTC计划得到了强有力的支持。61%的被调查者赞成这些付款。59%的受访者表示，这笔款项让父母能够花更多的钱，惠及主街的小企业。62%的受访者认为，这笔款项使更多人能够支付儿童保育费用，这对小企业有利。其中23%的人自己也接受了CTC检查，这有助于他们作为企业家的生活更加稳定。</p><p> Entrepreneurs know that when other people have money to spend, it’s good for them too, because it’s good for their businesses. Entrepreneurs also know that starting and running a business involves a leap of faith and a bit of capital. It’s not that entrepreneurs are a special kind of people. It’s that not everyone has the access to capital to start a business, and too many people feel that the risks of failure are too great for their own personal safety and the safety of their families. When poverty can kill, failure can kill, and  when failure can kill, good ideas go untried.</p><p>企业家们知道，当别人有钱花的时候，这对他们也有好处，因为这对他们的生意有好处。企业家们也知道，创业和经营一个企业需要一个信念的飞跃和一点资本。企业家并不是一种特殊的人。并不是每个人都能获得创业所需的资金，太多人觉得失败的风险对他们自己和家人的安全来说太大了。当贫穷可以杀死人，失败可以杀死人，当失败可以杀死人，好主意就不需要尝试。</p><p> It’s no coincidence that during the pandemic,  entrepreneurship increased in the United States by 23%, which was more than any other advanced economy. We’re the country that sent out stimulus checks to almost everyone in our economy. When millions of Americans lost their jobs and started receiving boosted unemployment checks, they didn’t sit around doing nothing. They got creative and used the capital and increased financial security provided to them in the form of government checks to launch new endeavors and adapt to the coronavirus-impacted landscape.</p><p>在大流行期间，美国的创业精神增长了23%，这比任何其他发达经济体都要多，这绝非巧合。我们是向我们经济中几乎所有人发放刺激支票的国家。当数以百万计的美国人失业并开始领取高额失业救济金时，他们并没有无所事事。他们发挥了创造力，利用政府支票形式提供给他们的资金和增加的财务安全，开展新的努力，适应新冠病毒影响的环境。</p><p> This stuff isn’t anything new either. It’s simply reinforcing what we’ve already long known. Our food assistance program is known to increase entrepreneurship simply by existing. Even when someone isn’t actively using it, the fact that would-be entrepreneurs believe it will be there for them should they fail, results in more people becoming entrepreneurs.</p><p>这东西也不是什么新鲜事。它只是在强化我们早已知道的东西。众所周知，我们的食品援助计划仅仅通过现有的食品来增加创业能力。即使有人没有积极地使用它，潜在的创业者相信，如果他们失败了，它会为他们提供帮助，这一事实也会导致更多的人成为创业者。</p><p> Specifically, it was found that  the expansion of SNAP in some states and not others increased the chance within those states that newly eligible households would own an incorporated business by 16% compared to the states that didn’t expand SNAP. There’s also something much closer to the monthly CTC than SNAP to look at, and that’s Canada’s virtually identical version of our enhanced CTC that they call the Canada Child Benefit or CCB.</p><p>具体而言，研究发现，与未扩张SNAP的州相比，SNAP在一些州（而非其他州）的扩张增加了这些州内新符合条件的家庭拥有注册企业16%的机会。还有一个比SNAP更接近每月CTC的东西，那就是加拿大的增强型CTC，他们称之为加拿大儿童福利或CCB。</p><p> Their CCB has existed in its current form since 2016 and as a direct result of it, there’s been over $256 billion in new revenue for Canadian businesses, and all that money flowing to parents in Canada has caused more than $27 billion in private capital investments. With a GDP of $1.7 trillion, that’s a healthy economic boost the CCB is providing to entrepreneurs and their customers. It’s been estimated that  without the CCB payments flowing to Canadian parents, Canada’s economy would be at least $46 billion smaller every year, which would be about a 3% annual hit to their GDP.</p><p>自2016年以来，他们的CCB一直以目前的形式存在，其直接结果是，加拿大企业获得了超过2560亿美元的新收入，所有流向加拿大家长的资金都带来了超过270亿美元的私人资本投资。GDP为1.7万亿美元，这是建行为企业家及其客户提供的健康经济增长。据估计，如果没有向加拿大父母支付建设银行的款项，加拿大的经济每年将至少减少460亿美元，这将对他们的GDP造成约3%的年度冲击。</p><p>   Entrepreneurial parents in America are already personally feeling such a hit with the expiration of their monthly CTC. In an interview with the Daily Caller, a couple by the name of  Brian and Megan Curtis described how the loss of the CTC payments, which had felt like “ a rebirth of the American Dream,” forced them to pull back on the telehealth business they’d recently launched together.</p><p>美国的创业父母在每月CTC到期后，个人已经感受到了这样的打击。在接受《每日来电报》采访时，一对名叫布莱恩（Brian）和梅根·柯蒂斯（Megan Curtis）的夫妇描述了CTC付款的损失，这让他们感觉像是“美国梦的重生”，迫使他们放弃了最近一起推出的远程医疗业务。</p><p> The CTC had allowed them to devote more resources towards growing their business without having to worry as much, and when those payments stopped, it meant fewer resources and more worry, and that combo is poison for entrepreneurship. Brian and Megan of course aren’t alone either.</p><p>反恐委员会允许他们将更多资源用于发展业务，而不必担心太多。当这些付款停止时，这意味着更少的资源和更多的担忧，而这种组合是对创业的毒药。布莱恩和梅根当然也不孤单。</p><p> As reported in the New York Times, a couple by the name of  Blayne and Kayla Midthun whose ice cream parlor business was greatly impacted by the pandemic were able to use the CTC to put money straight back into their business. How good is it for their business, and their family that their business supports, to stop receiving that extra stabilizing $750 a month? And how good is it for many of their customers to take a monthly hit to their own incomes as fellow parents newly less able to afford the luxury of a special treat like an ice cream sundae for their own kids?</p><p>据《纽约时报》报道，一对名叫布莱恩和凯拉·米德顿的夫妇的冰淇淋店业务受到疫情的严重影响，他们能够利用反恐委员会直接将资金投入到他们的业务中。停止每月750美元的额外收入对他们的企业和他们的家庭有多好？对于他们的许多客户来说，他们的收入每个月都会受到影响，这又有多好呢？因为新来的父母没有能力为自己的孩子买得起像冰淇淋圣代这样的奢侈享受？</p><p> Goldman Sachs considered questions like that and decided to downgrade their estimate of 2022 US GDP as a result of the answers. With American families hit by higher taxes and thus less disposable income as a result of the lapse of the enhanced child tax credit,  expected GDP growth in Q1 was cut by a third. Fewer customers is bad for a consumer-based economy.</p><p>高盛（Goldman Sachs）考虑了类似的问题，并决定根据这些答案下调他们对2022年美国GDP的估计。由于儿童税收优惠政策的取消，美国家庭受到更高税收的打击，从而减少了可支配收入，预计第一季度GDP增长将减少三分之一。消费者减少对以消费者为基础的经济是不利的。</p><p> Entrepreneurs need to be more than surviving every month. They need more than that to invest in their businesses.</p><p>创业者每个月需要的不仅仅是生存。他们需要更多的资金来投资自己的企业。</p><p> Scott Santens</p><p>斯科特·桑滕斯</p><p> The negative impacts of the loss of the monthly CTC payments on America’s small businesses also aren’t equally distributed.  Families in rural America, and thus Main Street USA local economies, were the ones being disproportionately boosted by the enhanced CTC. 49% of rural children were newly getting a boost from the checks compared to 39% of metro children.</p><p>每月CTC付款的损失对美国小企业的负面影响也不尽相同。美国农村地区的家庭，以及美国当地的主要街道经济，都受到了CTC增强的不成比例的推动。49%的农村儿童刚从支票中得到提振，而地铁儿童的这一比例为39%。</p><p> The Niskanen Center similarly estimated  a 1.35% boost to rural area GDP. In Idaho, the enhanced CTC was estimated as already responsible for 1.8% of its GDP, and thus with its loss, a 1.8% decline is fair to expect. A 1.8% loss is also expected in Mississippi, and a 1.6% loss in Arkansas and Montana. These are entirely unnecessary losses of economic activity.</p><p>尼斯卡宁中心同样估计，农村地区GDP将增长1.35%。据估计，在爱达荷州，增强的CTC已经占其GDP的1.8%，因此，随着其损失的增加，1.8%的下降是可以预期的。密西西比州预计将亏损1.8%，阿肯色州和蒙大拿州预计亏损1.6%。这些都是完全不必要的经济活动损失。</p><p> Small businesses are the heart and soul of the US economy.  They create two-thirds of net new jobs and account for 44% of our GDP. However, this has actually been shrinking. In 1998, they accounted for 48% of GDP. Consider what has happened since wages decoupled from productivity, and for a great many Americans, their discretionary purchasing power fell. As the American consumer has needed to focus on spending less instead of spending locally, consumers moved from Main Streets to Walmart and Amazon.</p><p>小企业是美国经济的核心和灵魂。它们创造了三分之二的净新增就业岗位，占我们GDP的44%。然而，这实际上一直在缩小。1998年，它们占GDP的48%。考虑一下自从工资与生产力脱钩后发生了什么，对很多美国人来说，他们的自主购买力下降了。由于美国消费者需要专注于减少支出，而不是在当地消费，消费者从主要街道转向沃尔玛和亚马逊。</p><p> When what matters most is the lowest price, buying locally simply isn’t as important. I think we just witnessed a temporary alleviation of that thanks to the CTC payments, where parents became a bit more free to focus a bit less on price and a bit more on other factors like local impacts and sustainability. The American small business economy can’t thrive so long as the American consumer is just trying to survive month-to-month. Small businesses need customers with money to spend after they pay the bills.</p><p>当最重要的是最低的价格时，在当地购买就不那么重要了。我认为，由于CTC支付，我们刚刚看到了这种情况的暂时缓解，家长们变得更加自由，不再那么关注价格，而更多地关注当地影响和可持续性等其他因素。只要美国消费者每月都在努力生存下去，美国的小企业经济就不会兴旺发达。小企业需要顾客在付账单后有钱消费。</p><p> Consumers aren’t the only ones that need to be free of thinking only about their basic survival needs. Entrepreneurs need to feel free to take risks without fearing for the lives of their families should they fail. Entrepreneurs need to be more than just surviving every month. They need more than that to invest in their businesses. They need someone to believe in them.</p><p>消费者并不是唯一需要摆脱只考虑基本生存需求的人。创业者需要自由地承担风险，而不必担心失败后家人的生命。创业者需要的不仅仅是每个月的生存。他们需要更多的资金来投资自己的企业。他们需要有人相信他们。</p><p> In what is considered to be perhaps “ the most effective development program in history,” Nigeria handed out cash grants to would-be entrepreneurs. 1,200 of them got $50,000 each. After three years, 93% of recipients had a company up and running versus 54% of would-be entrepreneurs who didn’t receive the cash grant. Three times as many of the companies were also bigger than those of the control group.</p><p>在被认为是“历史上最有效的发展计划”中，尼日利亚向潜在的企业家发放了现金补助。其中1200人每人得到5万美元。三年后，93%的受助者创办了一家公司，而54%的潜在企业家没有获得现金补助。这些公司的规模是对照组的三倍。</p><p> Think about just how many small businesses don’t exist simply because their would-be founders lack the capital to start them. The enhanced CTC wasn’t $50,000, but it was an investment in entrepreneurial parents, many of whom were already beginning to create new small businesses at a faster rate thanks to that cash investment.</p><p>想想有多少小企业之所以不存在，仅仅是因为它们的潜在创始人缺乏创办资金。增强型CTC不是5万美元，但它是对创业父母的投资，由于现金投资，他们中的许多人已经开始以更快的速度创建新的小企业。</p><p> When I think about the impact of monthly no-strings income on entrepreneurship, I always think about a woman named  Frieda Nembwaya who was living in a village in Namibia when everyone in her village started receiving a monthly unconditional cash grant. With her very first payment, she went out and bought baking ingredients, built a makeshift stove, and started baking small loaves of bread for the residents of her village. Her new business took off and she ended up earning far more from her bakery business than the cash payments she continued to receive that made it all possible.</p><p>当我想到每月无条件收入对创业的影响时，我总是想起一位名叫弗里达·内姆巴亚的妇女，她住在纳米比亚的一个村庄里，当时她的村庄里的每个人都开始每月无条件地领取现金补助金。第一次付款后，她出去买了烘焙原料，搭建了一个临时炉子，开始为村里的居民烤小面包。她的新生意一飞冲天，最终她从面包店赚的钱远远超过了她继续收到的现金，这一切都成为可能。</p><p>   Think for a moment what was responsible for her success. Was it Frieda alone who had a good idea and the work ethic to build a successful business? Well, here’s a thought experiment. Imagine it wasn’t monthly cash that she was receiving but a loan. She would have still been able to start her business using that money, but would her business have been successful in a village where no one had any money to buy her bread?</p><p>想一想她成功的原因是什么。是不是只有弗里达有一个好主意和职业道德来建立一个成功的企业？这是一个思维实验。想象一下，她收到的不是每月的现金，而是一笔贷款。她仍然可以用这笔钱创业，但在一个没有人有钱买她的面包的村子里，她的生意会成功吗？</p><p> Small businesses are job creators, but they don’t do it alone out of thin air. The true job creators are the customers whose spending enables businesses to succeed.</p><p>小企业是就业机会的创造者，但他们并不是凭空一人。真正的就业机会创造者是消费者，他们的消费使企业获得成功。</p><p> Scott Santens</p><p>斯科特·桑滕斯</p><p> What made Frieda’s business successful wasn’t Frieda alone. It was the fact her village suddenly became full of people with money to spend, and it was Frieda who offered them a great product that they were actually able to buy, which allowed her to continue making more.</p><p>使弗里达的生意成功的不仅仅是弗里达。事实上，她的村子里突然挤满了有钱消费的人，是弗里达给他们提供了一种他们实际上能够买到的很棒的产品，这让她能够继续赚更多的钱。</p><p> It’s this dynamic that we just witnessed here in the US with the CTC payments. Because parents had a bit more money to spend, parents with businesses had a bit more customers. That enabled more businesses to succeed, prevented some businesses from failing, and enabled some new businesses to be created. That’s the true potential of a permanent monthly child tax credit.</p><p>我们刚刚在美国目睹了CTC支付的这种动态。因为父母有更多的钱可以花，有生意的父母有更多的顾客。这使更多的企业得以成功，防止了一些企业倒闭，并创造了一些新的企业。这才是永久性每月儿童税收抵免的真正潜力。</p><p> Small businesses are job creators, but they don’t do it alone out of thin air. The true job creators are the customers whose spending enables businesses to succeed. We seem to have forgotten that over the past few decades of stagnant wages, but the monthly child tax credit is a reminder of how we can turn things around for small businesses by recentering the importance of people having money to spend, and also the importance of would-be entrepreneurs feeling less afraid of the consequences of failure.</p><p>小企业是就业机会的创造者，但他们并不是凭空一人。真正的就业机会创造者是消费者，他们的消费使企业获得成功。我们似乎忘记了，在过去几十年里，工资停滞不前，但每月的儿童税收抵免提醒我们，我们可以通过重新关注人们有钱消费的重要性，以及潜在企业家对失败后果不那么害怕的重要性，来扭转小企业的局面。</p><p> We should restore the monthly child tax credit, and we should do it not only to see a lot more kids free of poverty, but to recognize that we’ll see a lot more entrepreneurs too. The money isn’t just money. It’s a message to entrepreneurial parents that says, “America believes in you.” We need to start sending that message every month again.</p><p>我们应该恢复每月的儿童税收抵免，我们不仅应该看到更多的儿童摆脱贫困，而且应该认识到我们也将看到更多的企业家。钱不仅仅是钱。这是给创业父母的一条信息，上面写着：“美国相信你。”我们需要开始每个月再次发送这个信息。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/税收/">#税收</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/child/">#child</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
