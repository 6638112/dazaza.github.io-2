Brigham Young University in Idaho had to threaten some enterprising students with suspension to keep them from intentionally trying to contract COVID-19. The trial failed, however, and now the Barcelona-based firm is hoping to extract something far more valuable from the plasma of young volunteers: a set of microscopic molecules that could reverse the process of aging itself.</p><p>西班牙公司Grifols在去年与其他公司一起出发了一个Kerfuffle，为Covid-19治疗试验提供了几乎加倍献血的价格。位于爱达荷州的Brigham Young University不得不威胁一些有进取心的学生，以暂停，以防止他们故意努力收缩Covid-19。然而，审判失败了，现在基于巴塞罗那的公司希望从年轻志愿者的等离子体中提取更有价值的东西：一系列可以扭转老化过程的微观分子。</p><p> Earlier this year, Grifols closed on a $146 million-deal to buy Alkahest, a company founded by  Stanford University neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray, who, along with Saul Villeda, revealed in scientific papers published in 2011 and 2014 that the blood from young mice had seemingly miraculous restorative effects on the brains of elderly mice. The discovery adds to a hot area of inquiry called geroscience that &#34;seeks to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms that make aging a major risk factor and driver of common chronic conditions and diseases of older adulthood,&#34; according to the National Institutes of Health. In the last six years, Alkahest has identified more than 8,000 proteins in the blood that show potential promise as therapies. Its efforts and those of Grifols have resulted in at least six phase 2 trials completed or underway to treat a wide range of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s.</p><p> 今年早些时候，Grifols在146亿美元的交易中购买了Alkahest，由斯坦福大学Neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray成立的公司，以及Saul Villeda，在2011年和2014年发表的科学论文中展示了年轻老鼠的血液看似对老年老鼠的大脑进行了似乎是神奇的恢复效果。该发现增加了一个叫做Geroscience的热门询问区域，即＆＃34;旨在了解分子和细胞机制，使老化成为常见的慢性病症和老年人疾病的主要危险因素和司机，＆＃34;根据国家卫生研究院。在过去的六年中，Alkahest已经确定了血液中的8,000多种蛋白质，呈现为疗法。它的努力和格里韦尔的努力导致至少六阶段2次试验，以治疗各种与年龄相关的疾病，包括阿尔茨海默氏症＆＃39; s和帕金森＆＃39; s。</p><p> Alkahest and a growing number of other geroscience health startups signal a change in thinking about some of the most intractable diseases facing humankind. Rather than focusing solely on the etiology of individual diseases like heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s and arthritis—or, for that matter, COVID-19—geroscientists are trying to understand how these diseases relate to the single largest risk factor of all: human aging. Their goal is to hack the process of aging itself and, in the process, delay or stave off the onset of many of the diseases most associated with growing old.</p><p> 可怕和越来越多的其他Geroscience健康初创公司通过思考人类面临的一些最顽固的疾病的思考来表示变化。而不是仅仅关注心脏病，癌症，阿尔茨海默氏症等个体疾病的病因 - 或者，对于那么重要，或者，Covid-19-Geroscientists正试图了解这些疾病如何与单一的最大风险因素有关全部：人类衰老。他们的目标是破解自己的过程，并且在过程中，延迟或避开与生长老年人最相关的许多疾病的疾病。</p><p> The idea that aging and illness go hand and hand is, of course, nothing new. What&#39;s new is the newfound confidence of scientists that &#34;aging&#34; can be measured, reverse-engineered and controlled.</p><p> 老化和疾病的想法当然，没有任何新的东西。什么＆＃39;新的是科学家的新的信心和＃34;老化＆＃34;可以测量，反向设计和控制。</p><p> Until recently, &#34;people working on diseases did not think that aging was modifiable,&#34; says Felipe Sierra, who recently retired as director of the Division of Aging Biology at the National Institute on Aging, a part of the NIH. &#34;That is actually what many medical books say: The main risk factor for cardiovascular disease is aging, but we cannot change aging so let&#39;s talk about cholesterol and obesity. For Alzheimer&#39;s, aging is the main risk factor—but let&#39;s talk about the buildup in the brain of beta-amyloid proteins. Now that is beginning to change.&#34;</p><p> 直到最近，＆＃34;致疾病的人并没有认为老化是可修改的，＆＃34; Felipe Sierra表示，最近退休为国家老龄化学院老龄化生物学司司长，这是NIH的一部分。 ＆＃34;这实际上是许多医学书的说法：心血管疾病的主要风险因素是老化，但我们不能改变老化，所以让＆＃39;谈论胆固醇和肥胖。对于阿尔茨海默氏症，老化是主要的风险因素 - 但是谈论β-淀粉样蛋白的大脑中的累积＆＃39。现在开始改变。＆＃34;</p><p>    The result is a flood of investment money, an explosion of research into what precisely goes wrong in our bodies as we get old and the promise of clinical results down the road.</p><p>    结果是洪水的投资资金，在我们变老的情况下，在我们的身体中恰恰出错的研究爆发了，临床结果的承诺。</p><p> In the months before the pandemic, investors ponied up billions of dollars to fund biotechs aimed at commercializing the new science. Some biotech firms are developing drugs and infusions designed to clean up zombie-like cells and metabolic junk that accumulate with age. Others hope to infuse new vigor into flagging cellular components, such as stem cells, or spur the body into beneficial actions by adding obscure hormones or proteins, that decrease as we get older. The NIA, under its director, Richard Hodes, recently announced plans to spend about $100 million over the next five years on basic research aimed at understanding &#34;cellular senescence.&#34;</p><p> 在大流行前几个月，投资者将数十亿美元摧毁，以资助生物技术旨在将新科学商业化的生物技术。一些生物技术公司正在开发旨在清理僵尸样细胞和累积年龄的代谢垃圾的药物和输注。其他人希望将新的活力注入标记细胞组分，例如干细胞，或通过添加模糊的激素或蛋白质将身体转化为有益的作用，这会降低，因为我们变老。尼亚，在其董事Richard Hodes，最近宣布计划在未来五年内花费约1亿美元的基本研究，旨在理解＆＃34;细胞衰老。＆＃34; </p><p> &#34;You have no idea how many people are interested to investing money in longevity,&#34; said Nir Barzilai, the founding director of the Institute for Aging Research at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, and the founder of a company aimed at mitochondrial health. &#34;There are billions of dollars.&#34;</p><p>＆＃34;你不知道有多少人对在长寿中投入资金，＆＃34;叶伯特爱因斯坦医学院衰老研究所的创始主任NIR BARZILAI及其针对线粒体健康的公司创始人。 ＆＃34;有数十亿美元。＆＃34;</p><p> Although the vast majority of these efforts remain in preclinical development, several have recently entered  FDA trials and could potentially hit the market in a few years. Some are already appearing on the gray market, raising concerns that hucksters are peddling anti-aging snake oil. Others, meanwhile, worry what might happen if these drugs actually do deliver on their promise: Will poor young people be coerced into selling their blood to elderly billionaires? Will magical anti-aging pills become the province of the Park Avenue and Hollywood rich, like facelifts, hair plugs and botox injections? Will the rest of us senile peasants be forced to watch them age backwards as we are left to wither and die?</p><p> 虽然绝大多数这些努力留在临床前发展，但是最近进入了FDA试验，可能会在几年内潜行市场。有些人已经出现在灰色市场上，提高了哈克斯特兜售抗衰老蛇油的担忧。其他，与此同时，如果这些药物实际上确实履行其承诺，担心可能会发生什么：贫穷的年轻人会被胁迫向老年亿万富翁销售他们的血液？魔法抗衰老丸将成为公园大道和好莱坞的富人，如整容，发塞和肉毒杆菌注射？美国其他人民的老年农民将被迫倒退，因为我们留下来并死亡？</p><p>  Getting old usually doesn&#39;t end well. Despite massive gains in human life expectancy—over the last 150 years, it has almost doubled in many developed nations, though it dipped in the past year due to the pandemic—we still haven&#39;t found a way to halt the relentless toll time takes on our bodies.</p><p>  变老通常不会结束。尽管人均预期寿命大幅提升 - 在过去的150年里，它在许多发达国家几乎翻了一番，但它在过去的一年里，由于大流行 - 我们仍然没有找到一种阻止无情收费的方法时间拿到我们的身体。</p><p>  When we grow old, our immune systems begin to break down, creating a state of low-level inflammation that suppresses cellular regeneration and leads to those aches and pains. We may be living longer, but we are hurting. As our mitochondria cease to effectively produce energy for our cells, we spend many of those hard-won extra years taking afternoon naps. As our stem cells grow lethargic and quiescent, our muscle mass shrinks and our bones become increasingly fragile. In short, our bodies fall apart.</p><p>  当我们变老时，我们的免疫系统开始分解，从而产生低水平炎症的状态，抑制细胞再生并导致那些疼痛和痛苦。我们可能会更长时间，但我们伤害了。随着我们的线粒体可持续地为我们的细胞有效生产能量，我们将在下午小睡中花费许多额外的额外数年。随着我们的干细胞生长昏昏欲睡和静止，我们的肌肉质量缩小和我们的骨骼越来越脆弱。简而言之，我们的身体分开了。</p><p> The first hint that hacking the biology of aging might be possible came, improbably enough, from a series of laboratory experiments on a lowly species of roundworm. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, studies of identical twins had already shown that about 30 percent of longevity in humans could be attributed to genetics. But most scientists believed the process of aging was far too complex a phenomenon to modulate simply by tweaking a couple genes or taking a pill.</p><p> 第一次暗示破解老化生物学的暗示可能是可能的，不可能，从一系列实验室实验到较低种的蛔虫。在20世纪80年代后期和20世纪90年代初，已经表明，对同种双胞胎的研究已经表明，大约30％的人类的寿命可能归因于遗传学。但大多数科学家认为，只要通过调整夫妇基因或服用药丸，即可衰老的过程太复杂了太复杂了一种现象。</p><p> Then in 1993, Cynthia Kenyon, a biologist at the  University of California in San Francisco, doubled the lifespan of a worm from three weeks to six by mutating a single gene. The work suggested the possibility of drugs that could increase longevity without targeting specific diseases. It suggested that the process of aging itself might be manipulated.</p><p> 然后，1993年，旧金山加州大学的生物学家Cynthia Kenyon，通过突变单个基因，从三周到六个蠕虫的寿命增加了一倍。该工作表明，在不靶向特定疾病的情况下可能会增加寿命的药物的可能性。它表明，可能会操纵衰老的过程。</p><p> At the time, a fringe group of longevity enthusiasts were, unknowingly, already trying to do what Kenyon did in roundworms through the practice of calorie restriction. This idea took off when gerontologist Roy Walford of UC Los Angeles doubled the lifespan of lab mice by restricting their caloric intake and then became a vocal advocate for the practice in humans. He penned a series of best-selling books in the 1980s and adopted a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet for the last 30 years of his life. Today, his emaciated acolytes can still be spotted at longevity conferences, meticulously measuring out their food during lunch breaks.</p><p> 当时，在不知不觉中，一群人的长寿爱好者在不知不觉中，已经试图通过卡路里限制的做法做肯尼昂在蛔虫中做的事情。当UC洛杉矶的Gerontologist Roy Walford of Cerontologist Roy Walford通过限制他们的热量摄入量增加了实验室小鼠的寿命，然后成为人类实践的声音倡导者。他在20世纪80年代刊登了一系列畅销书籍，并在过去30年的生命中采用了1,600卡路里的饮食。今天，他的憔悴助剂仍然可以在长寿会议上发现，在午休期间精心衡量他们的食物。 </p><p> Emerging science now explains why there may be something to this method of bio-hacking. In humans, insulin is the hormonal signal that cues our cells to absorb sugar and convert it to energy. Along with a closely related hormone called Insulin like-Growth Factor 1 (IGF1), insulin affects a large number of other cellular processes, including the rate of cellular division, which many believe is directly related to aging. When the insulin and IGF1 in humans or analogous compounds in worms are dialed down—because we are starving, or the genes have been tweaked—a host of cellular repair mechanisms that are normally on standby kick into high-gear.</p><p>新兴科学现在解释了为什么这种生物黑客攻击方法可能有一些东西。在人类中，胰岛素是提示我们细胞吸收糖并将其转换为能量的荷尔蒙信号。除了与胰岛素相似的激素相似的密切激素，胰岛素会影响大量其他细胞过程，包括许多相信与老龄化直接相关的细胞划分的速率。当患有蠕虫中的胰岛素和IGF1或蠕虫中类似的化合物时 - 因为我们饥饿，或者基因已经调整了一系列蜂窝修复机制，通常在待机踢到高档上。</p><p> The adaptation makes sense from the perspective of evolution. Prehistoric times consisted of long periods of scarcity punctuated by precious windows of abundance. Since there was no telling how long the good times would last, our ancestors evolved the ability to grow and build fat and muscle as quickly as possible. A feast triggered the body to release insulin and IGF1, which allowed our cells to begin absorbing glucose and spurred them to pour energy into cellular reproduction and regeneration for as long as our insulin levels remain high.</p><p> 从进化的角度来看，改编是有道理的。史前时代由珍贵的窗户被丰富的窗户喷出的长时间稀缺。由于没有讲述美好时光将持续多长时间，我们的祖先演变了尽可能快地成长和建造脂肪和肌肉的能力。盛宴引发了身体以释放胰岛素和IGF1，这允许我们的细胞开始吸收葡萄糖并刺激它们，以便将能量倒入细胞繁殖和再生中，只要我们的胰岛素水平仍然很高。</p><p>  When calories were no longer easy to come by, our bodies adjusted by lowering insulin and IGF1 levels—a cue for our cells to slow regeneration and reproduction, and instead divert energy into cellular processes most likely to facilitate our survival through cold, lean times. The human body protects cells it already has: it produces more enzymes to ensure proteins don&#39;t misfold, it ramps up the machinery designed to repair broken DNA and it breaks down cellular debris and defective cells it might otherwise ignore, scavenging for parts it can use to feed its healthier cells through the lean days. In the process, it cleans up cellular garbage that, particularly as we grow older, likely promotes low-level inflammation.</p><p>  当卡路里不再易于到来时，我们的身体通过降低胰岛素和IGF1水平来调节 - 我们的细胞的提示减缓再生和繁殖，而是将能量转移到最有可能通过冷，贫时促进我们生存的细胞过程中的能量。人体保护细胞已经存在：它产生更多的酶，以确保蛋白质不折叠，它升空了设计用于修复破碎的DNA的机器，并且它可能会忽略细胞碎片和缺陷的细胞，否则会忽略零件它可以用来通过贫日喂养更健康的细胞。在此过程中，它清理细胞垃圾，特别是随着我们的增长，可能促进低水平的炎症。</p><p> Currently there is no FDA-approved indication for drugs that target the process of aging itself. To win approval, drugs must target a specific disease. It&#39;s no coincidence that some gerontologists have chosen the popular diabetes drug metformin to serve as the &#34;template&#34; for a new class of FDA-approved anti-aging drugs. It works by influencing the body&#39;s sensitivity to insulin and can have an effect on the pace of metabolism and energy expenditure. If studies now underway confirm its efficacy and it wins approval, it would create an entirely new regulatory category of drugs that, rather than treating specific diseases, will work to prevent our bodies from deteriorating further once we have already developed one.</p><p> 目前，没有FDA批准的针对瞄准老化过程的药物的指示。为了赢得批准，药物必须针对特定疾病。它没有巧合的是，一些长期性主义者选择了流行的糖尿病药物二甲双胍作为＆＃34;模板＆＃34;对于一类新的FDA批准的抗衰老药物。它通过影响胰岛素的敏感性来实现它的工作，并且可以对新陈代谢和能源支出的速度产生影响。如果现在正在进行学习，确​​认其功效并赢得批准，它将创造一个完全新的监管类别，而不是治疗特定疾病，将努力防止我们的机构一旦我们开发了一个。</p><p> &#34;Aging drives disease,&#34; says Albert Einstein&#39;s Barzilai, who is leading the study. &#34;That&#39;s our point. If we stop aging, it stops driving the diseases.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;老化驱动疾病，＆＃34; Albert Einstein说，Barzilai领导研究。 ＆＃34;我们的观点。如果我们停止老化，它会停止推动疾病。＆＃34;</p><p> A whole host of other potential anti-aging-drugs might not be far behind. Molecular biologists discovered a second important way to manipulate the aging process in the early 2000s by breeding strains of baker&#39;s yeast, fruit flies and worms to live longer. They sequenced the genomes of the hardiest strains and then worked backward to identify the specific genetic variants that seemed be associated with increased longevity. That led them to mTOR, a genetic variant that serves as the target of an anti-aging drug called rapamycin, which is now undergoing clinical trials. Among these scientific efforts is a massive longitudinal study of canine aging at the University of Washington, which has enrolled 30,000 dogs and plans to select 500 lucky pooches to participate in a rapamycin trial.</p><p> 一系列其他潜在的抗衰老药物可能不会落后。分子生物学家发现了一种通过烘焙贝克＆＃39;酵母，果蝇和蠕虫的育种菌株来操纵2000年代初的老化过程的第二重要途径。它们测序了最强烈的菌株的基因组，然后向后工作以鉴定似乎与寿命增加相关的特定遗传变异。将它们LEDOROR为MTOR，一种遗传变体，用作叫做雷帕霉素的抗衰老药物的靶标，现在正在进行临床试验。在这些科学努力中，在华盛顿大学的犬类老龄化的大规模研究，该犬已经注册了30,000只狗，并计划选择500个幸运宠物参加雷帕霉素审判。</p><p>  The hunt for other &#34;control knobs&#34; that might be targeted with drugs continues at research institutions around the world. A third approach would increase the production an enzyme called AMP-Kinase, which modulates cellular processes like growth and metabolism, based on the level of energy available for consumption. It, too, has emerged in recent years as another promising target, along with many other molecules, hormones and proteins that appear to decline with age and that play a key role in cellular repair, regeneration, protection and efficient function.</p><p>  寻找其他＆＃34;控制旋钮＆＃34;这可能是针对毒品的目标继续在世界各地的研究机构上。第三种方法将增加所谓的AMP-激酶的酶，其根据可用于消费的能量水平来调节生长和代谢等细胞过程。它也出现了近年来作为另一个有前途的目标，以及许多其他分子，激素和蛋白质随着年龄的增长，并且在细胞修复，再生，保护和有效功能中发挥关键作用。 </p><p> Vera Gorbunova, co-director of the Rochester Aging Research Center at the University of Rochester, and her colleagues compared 18 rodent species, including, beavers, hamsters and mice, sorted them by longevity, and looked for interesting patterns. Significantly, they found that &#34;more robust&#34; repair of broken DNA, the molecular-level cellular blueprints found in every one of our cells, seems to coevolve with longevity. In other words, species that live longer have a more robust ability to fix the kind of problems that inevitably occur with age. The research was recently published in the journal Cell.</p><p>罗切斯特罗切斯特老龄化研究中心的联合主任Vera Gorbunova和她的同事比较了18种啮齿动物，包括海狸，仓鼠和老鼠，用寿命来分类，并寻找有趣的模式。值得注意的是，他们发现了＆＃34;更强大的＆＃34;破碎的DNA修复，在每一个细胞中发现的分子水平细胞蓝图似乎与寿命共存。换句话说，生活更长的物种具有更强大的能力来解决年龄不可避免地发生的问题。该研究最近在杂志中公布。</p><p>  &#34;There was a very strong correlation to how long different species live and how well they repaired DNA breaks,&#34; Gorbunova said. &#34;We also look at why it&#39;s better. We found a protein that is very important in DNA repair and it is more active in long-lived species.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;与不同的种类生活有多长，以及他们修复DNA休息的程度有很强的相关性，以及＃34;戈尔巴诺瓦说。 ＆＃34;我们也看为什么它和＃39;好。我们发现一种在DNA修复中非常重要的蛋白质，它在长寿的物种中更活跃。＆＃34;</p><p> Gorbunova has done some of her most exciting work on an obscure superstar in the longevity field known as the naked mole rat, a furless, wrinkled rodent with a pair of beaver-like incisors that lives in tunnels in East Africa. The rat, sometimes referred to by its cuddly nickname, &#34;Sand Puppy,&#34; has an unusually long-life expectancy—30 years, 10 times longer than its close cousin, the North American field mouse, which rarely makes it past three.</p><p> Gorbunova在被称为裸体摩尔大鼠的长寿田间的一个晦涩的超级巨星上做了一些最令人兴奋的工作，这是一个无无根的皱纹啮齿动物，其中一对类似的海狸状的门牙，在东非的隧道中生活。老鼠，有时由其Cuddly昵称，＆＃34;沙子小狗，＆＃34;拥有异常长寿的预期寿命-30岁，比其近距离堂兄的关闭10倍，北美田鼠很少有三个。</p><p> Gorbunova traces much of the hardiness of the mole rats to an abundance of hyaluronic acid, a major component of skin that is involved in tissue regeneration. Although mice and humans also have hyaluronic acid, the tissues of naked mole rats are &#34;saturated with it,&#34; says Gorbunova. In addition to having strong antioxidant properties, and others that seem to attenuate the destructive consequences of the chronic, widespread inflammation that often accumulates with age, the abundance of hyaluronan also seems to prevent the growth of malignant cancer cells.</p><p> Gorbunova痕迹覆盖摩尔大鼠的大部分透明质酸，其皮肤的主要成分涉及组织再生。虽然小鼠和人类还具有透明质酸，但裸摩尔大鼠的组织是＆＃34;用它饱和，＆＃34; Gorbunova说。除了具有强烈的抗氧化特性外，其他似乎敏捷的慢性炎症的破坏性后果，往往累积年龄累积的广泛炎症，透明质酸的丰度也似乎预防恶性癌细胞的生长。</p><p> &#34;Hyaluronan is a very nice story because we can see the possibility of translating it to humans,&#34; Gorbunova says. &#34;We have it, but we don&#39;t have a lot of it, so I think there is room for improvement. We can find ways to increase our own levels of hyaluronan.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34; Hyaluronan是一个非常好的故事，因为我们可以看到将它翻译成人类的可能性，＆＃34;戈尔巴诺瓦说。 ＆＃34;我们拥有它，但我们没有很多，所以我认为我认为有改进的余地。我们可以找到增加我们自己的透明质酸水平的方法。＆＃34;</p><p> To Gorbunova, the differences between the mouse and naked mole rat are easily explained by evolution—their respective adaptations are geared toward increasing their chances of reproductive success. &#34;For a mouse, the best strategy to have more progeny is to be very, very prolific very quickly because then somebody&#39;s going to eat it, and it just doesn&#39;t have a chance to live longer,&#34; she explains. &#34;The naked mole rat lives underground and has very few predators. And they breed until very late in life. So they would evolve the mechanism to allow them to live longer and to breathe as long as possible just because they can. No one is there to eat them. And the longer they live the more progeny they have.&#34;</p><p> 对于Gorbunova来说，鼠标和裸体摩尔大鼠之间的差异很容易通过演化来解释 - 它们各自的改编旨在增加其生殖成功的机会。 ＆＃34;对于一只老鼠来说，有更多的后代的最佳策略是非常，非常快速地迅速，因为那么有人会吃它，它只是有机会生活更长时间，＆＃34;她解释道。 ＆＃34;赤裸鼹鼠鼠生活地下，捕食者很少。他们繁殖直到生命中很晚。所以他们会发展这种机制让他们寿命更长，只要他们能够呼吸。没有人在那里吃它们。他们生活的时间越长，他们的后代就越多。＆＃34;</p><p>  The same logic applies to humans—and it also explains why our bodies fall apart. Diseases of aging, many gerontologists now argue, are the natural consequence of the advances in modern lifespan, which now extends decades past reproductive age, and thus has not been subject to the same exquisitely efficient evolutionary sculpting that might increase our odds of surviving them. &#34;If you put this work in an evolutionary perspective, we were not supposed to live that long,&#34; says Gerard Karsenty, who chairs the Department of Genetics and Development at Columbia University Medical Center. &#34;Aging is an invention of mankind. No animal species has successfully cheated its own body—cheated nature—except mankind. Elephants may live for 100 years but they lived for 100 years a million years ago. Humans have outsmarted their own body.&#34;</p><p>  与人类相同的逻辑 - 它也解释了为什么我们的身体分开。衰老的疾病现在争辩，现在是现代寿命的进步的自然后果，现在延伸了几十年过去的生殖时代，因此并未受到同样的精致有效的进化雕塑，可能会增加我们幸存的可能性。 ＆＃34;如果你把这项工作放在进化的角度，我们不应该生活那么久，＆＃34; Gerard Karsenty说，他在哥伦比亚大学医疗中心椅子席卷遗传学和发展系。 ＆＃34;老龄化是人类的发明。没有动物物种已经成功地欺骗了自己的身体作弊的自然 - 除了人类。大象可能会活100年，但他们一百万年前住了100年。人类已经敞开了自己的身体。＆＃34; </p><p> But what does any of this have to do with Wyss-Coray and Villeda&#39;s young blood?</p><p>但是这一切与Wyss-Coray和Villeda＆＃39;年轻的血有什么关系？</p><p>  Saul Villeda now runs a lab at UCSF on a hill that Over-looks San Francisco&#39;s famed Haight-Ashbury. Winding stairs lead to a fluorescent-lit basement hallway and a cramped suite of rooms stacked wall-to-wall with mouse cages. There is something unusual about many of the mice in the room. They are ambulating through their cages, with two heads, two sets of legs and double-wide bodies.</p><p>  Saul Villeda现在在UCSF上运行一个实验室，在山上看起来过来的旧金山＆＃39;着名的Haight-Ashbury。蜿蜒的楼梯通往荧光灯地下室走廊和堆放的房间套房堆放墙壁与鼠笼笼。房间里有许多老鼠有一些不寻常的东西。他们在笼子里挥动，两个头，两套腿和双宽体。</p><p> The doublewide mice are products of a macabre procedure known as &#34;parabiosis,&#34; a technique Villeda mastered as a graduate student in the lab of Wyss-Coray for the improbable experiment that led to the founding of Alkahest and the clinical blood trials aimed at treating aging. The procedure, pioneered in the 19th century by the French scientist Paul Bert, merges the circulatory systems of two rodents by cutting open their bodies and sewing their wounds together, so that their bodies fuse as they heal.</p><p> 彻底的小鼠是一种称为＆＃34的杂种程序的产品。曲折化，＆＃34;一项技术villeda掌握了Wyss-Coray实验室的研究生，为不可分割的实验导致了Alapahest的成立和旨在治疗衰老的临床血液试验。在19世纪由法国科学家保罗伯特开创的程序，通过切割身体并将伤口缝制在一起，使两个啮齿动物的循环系统合并，使他们的身体融合在愈合时。</p><p> To learn it, Villeda had an expert teacher: Thomas Rando, a neurologist who studies longevity and occupies the office next door to Wyss-Coray. Rando first got the idea to revive the obscure technique back in the early 2000s. He had come to believe that one of the reasons our bodies lose their regenerative powers as we grow older is because our stem cells stop receiving the molecular-level signals needed to activate them. Rando did not know what those signals might be. But he knew where to find them—the blood of younger mice. Enter parabiosis.</p><p> 为了学习它，Villeda有一个专家老师：Thomas Rando是一位学习寿命的神经科学专家，占据了隔壁的办公室到Wyss-Coray。 Rando首先让想法在2000年代初期重新恢复模糊的技术。他觉得我们的身体失去了再生能力之一，因为我们年龄较大的是因为我们的干细胞停止接受激活它们所需的分子水平信号。 rando不知道这些信号可能是什么。但他知道在哪里找到它们 - 年轻小鼠的血液。进入剖腹症。</p><p> To test out his hypothesis, Rando conjoined elderly mice with younger rodents so that they shared the same circulatory system, then tested their ability to heal small wounds. The results were dramatic. Elderly mice were able to repair small tears in their muscles far faster than their peers not conjoined to younger mice. The younger mice, on the other hand, healed far slower than they normally would.</p><p> 为了试验他的假设，Rando与啮齿动物的较年轻的老年老鼠，以便他们共享相同的循环系统，然后测试他们愈合小伤口的能力。结果是戏剧性的。老年老鼠能够比他们的同龄人与年轻小鼠一起修复肌肉的小泪。另一方面，年轻的小鼠比通常愈合得多。</p><p> The results were exhilarating. They suggested that stem cells could be revitalized simply by reintroducing back into the blood stream the molecules, present in young blood, that could turn them on. The next step was finding the specific youth-promoting factors in the blood responsible for the change. But that would not be easy.</p><p> 结果令人振奋。他们表明，可以通过重新引入血液流，目前的血液流，这可能会使干细胞重新调整到年轻血液中的分子。下一步是在血液中发现特定的青年促进因子，负责变革。但这并不容易。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s as big a fishing expedition as you can possibly imagine,&#34; Rando warned at the time, noting the thousands of proteins, lipids, sugars and other small molecules in the blood serum.</p><p> ＆＃34;它和钓鱼探险一样大，因为你可能想象，＆＃34; Rando当时警告，注意到血清中的数千种蛋白质，脂质，糖和其他小分子。 </p><p>  Watching this unfold from next door, Wyss-Coray, who studied Alzheimer&#39;s Disease, and then-graduate student Villeda were dubious that they could induce a similar rejuvenation in the brain. Whatever it was in the young blood that spurred the regeneration, it seemed unlikely it would be able to pass the blood-brain barrier, the semipermeable border that keeps circulating blood, and much of the cargo it carries, from entering the central nervous system. &#34;But we did it anyways, because I was a graduate student at the time, and Tony will always support crazy ideas,&#34; Villeda recalls.</p><p>从隔壁的Wyss-coray看着这展望，他学习阿尔茨海默病＆＃39; villeda，别墅，他们可以诱导大脑中的类似恢复活力。无论它在刺激再生的年轻血液中，它似乎都不太可能能够通过血脑屏障，使循环血液的半透边缘以及它携带的大部分货物从进入中枢神经系统。 ＆＃34;但是我们做了无论如何，因为我当时是一名研究生，托尼将永远支持疯狂的想法，＆＃34; Villeda回忆道。</p><p> After conjoining elderly and young mice, Villeda sacrificed the elderly mice, cut their brains into tiny slices, and stained them with a special dye that bound to baby neurons. Then he counted up the number of new neurons and compared them to normal levels of neuronal growth in similarly aged mice. The results, when he published them in 2014, shocked the scientific world. The infusion of new blood led to a threefold increase in the number of new nerve cells generated in the brains of the elderly mice. But that was not the only revelation. He had already shown that the young members of the conjoined old-young mouse pairs generated far fewer new nerve cells than young mice left to roam free, untethered to their elderly cousins. And while the old mice grew more energetic, the younger mice suddenly behaved as if they were middle-aged.</p><p> 在连连老年人和年轻的老鼠后，别墅牺牲了老年老鼠，将脑筋切成微小的切片，并用一颗与婴儿神经元结合的特殊染料染色。然后他计算了新神经元的数量，并将它们与类似老年小鼠的正常神经元生长水平进行了比较。结果，当他在2014年发表他们时，震惊了科学的世界。新血液的输注导致了老年小鼠大脑产生的新神经细胞数量的三倍。但这不是唯一的启示。他已经表明，连体旧鼠标对的年轻成员比年轻的小鼠在留下自由的年轻小鼠那样产生的新神经细胞的较少，而不是他们的老年人表兄弟。虽然老鼠的精力充沛，但年轻的小鼠突然表现得像他们是中年人一样。</p><p> Since parabiosis is not an option for human patients, Villeda and Wyss-Coray tried to pull off the same trick with a simple infusion of blood plasma. There, too, the results were better than they expected. On spatial-navigation tasks, such as finding an underwater platform to rest on in a water-filled chamber, the young mice that had received injections of &#34;old blood&#34; performed far worse than a group that got injections of plasma from younger mice. Once infused with the blood of young mice, the old-blood mice, meanwhile, were able to locate the platform as easily as their younger brethren.</p><p> 由于Parabiosis不是人类患者的选择，因此别墅和Wysss-Coray试图用简单的血浆输注来脱离同一个伎俩。在那里，结果也比预期更好。在空间导航任务中，如寻找水下平台，以便在充满水中的室内休息，这是接受＆＃34的注射注射的年轻小鼠;老血＆＃34;表现远比从年轻小鼠中注射血浆的群体更差。同时，旧血小鼠的血小血小鼠曾经被注入，同时能够像较年轻的弟兄一样轻松地定位平台。</p><p>  The results generated worldwide headlines. And soon Wyss-Coray and his protégé Villeda began receiving many bizarre and at times macabre emails. One chilling missive came from a man who offered to provide all the blood Wyss-Coray might need for such an experiment—he claimed he could obtain it from human children of any age. There was also a flood of heartfelt pleas from Alzheimer&#39;s p</p><p>  结果在全球标题上产生。很快Wyss-Coray和他的ProtégéVilleda开始收到许多奇怪的奇怪和麦克风电子邮件。一个令人不寒而栗的传染来自一个提供所有提供所有血液Wyss-Coray的人可能需要这样的实验 - 他声称他可以从任何年龄的人类的人类获得它。来自阿尔茨海默氏症的洪水泛滥＆＃39; s p</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newsweek.com/2021/04/16/can-blood-young-people-slow-aging-silicon-valley-has-bet-billions-it-will-1581447.html">https://www.newsweek.com/2021/04/16/can-blood-young-people-slow-aging-silicon-valley-has-bet-billions-it-will-1581447.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/血液/">#血液</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/bet/">#bet</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/细胞/">#细胞</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
