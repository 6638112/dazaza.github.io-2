lot has been written about the six-pager and PR/FAQ so I\u2019m not going focus on document formats, but I wanted to share how our process benefits from document-based meetings.I also have identified some areas for improvement if you are looking to adopt document-based meetings for your workplace.\n I\u2019ve been wanting to write this blog post for a while and Jaana\u2019s tweet finally gave me the inspiration to share my thoughts.\n Meetings starting with silent document reading is the best idea ever. I have no idea why this isn&#39;t common practice in the industry.\n\u2014 Jaana Dogan \u30e4\u30ca \u30c9\u30ac\u30f3 (@rakyll)  March 10, 2021\n My role is a Sr. Developer Advocate within AWS Container Services so my experience may be different from other areas and roles at Amazon.A majority of my meetings start with reading a document.This takes \u201cthis meeting could have been\u2026\u201d and flips it upside down.Most of the time, if there isn\u2019t a doc there isn\u2019t a meeting.\n Depending on the meeting, the document could be a six-pager, a PR/FAQ, a one-pager about an idea, a narrative to help find a solution to a problem, or even a service review full of charts, graphs and bullet points.The document adapts to fit the audience and purpose of the meeting.\n Reading documents is so ingrained in our culture and process that our scheduling tools have check boxes to automatically create a document.If I\u2019m catching up on a new service or feature launch, I will find the document rather than emailing or calling the product manager.\n The interesting part to me isn\u2019t in the format of the document, but how it is used.Meetings start with reading.Depending on the length of the document, we\u2019ll read anywhere from ten minutes to half an hour.If the meeting has a long document (six-pagers are the longest) and many attendees, the meeting will be scheduled for enough time to read and discuss.\n Reading the doc is part of the scheduled time.I\u2019ve worked at plenty of places that I\u2019ve tried to document everything for a meeting ahead of time.I\u2019ve written well thought-out emails, shared links to documents, and written detailed wiki pages.In all of my meetings outside of Amazon I had one of three outcomes:* No one read the email/document and I had to explain everything in the meeting* Some people read the document but forgot what it said because they read it days or hours before* At least one person had a question that I could have answered via email\n Before I started at Amazon these were some of the expected benefits to reading in meetings.* All of the information for the meeting is contained in the doc* People are not expected to find their own time to read* The document is fresh in everyone\u2019s mind\n Some other benefits I\u2019ve found while putting it in practice are:* Presenters, including myself, don\u2019t have to feel nervous about presenting in front of people.* Documents help eliminate many biases, for or against, the person who wrote the document.* You read everything in your own voice and vocal communication barriers such as accents, vocal ticks, or handicaps (e.g. stuttering or hearing loss) are not present in the document.* There\u2019s no \u201ccan you see my screen\u201d, background noise, or call audio disconnects while understanding the main content for the meeting.* There\u2019s a wealth of current and past documents. Want to see what the PR/FAQ looked like for Amazon EKS or AWS Lambda? It exists.* You are not expected to retain document information outside of the meeting. Feedback and discussions happen during the meeting. Comments can be answered asynchronously. If more discussion is needed then the document will be revised and a new meeting will be scheduled to read and discuss it.* If a document is provided early and I have a conflict at the begining of the meeting I can read the document ahead of time and join the meeting 10-20 minutes late without missing anything.* Document reading from home has been a great way to get 10-20 minutes of exercise in.\n Reading docs at the beginning of meetings is a great way to squeeze in some exercise!  I&#39;m trying to make this a new habit. Even a 10 minute climb is enough to get my heart rate up.  Pay no attention to the cables \ud83d\ude48  pic.twitter.com/zyCbUczZAA\n\u2014 Justin Garrison (@rothgar)  January 15, 2021\n There are some limitations to document based meetings.The first I have noticed is if you\u2019re not a very good writer you will be at a disadvantage communicating your ideas.Amazon has a lot of internal training to help you write good Amazon documents, but even with training it still requires a good foundation.I\u2019m very thankful for my years of practice writing for  How-To Geek and   Cloud Native Infrastructure.Even with that background, my first one-pager review was intimidating.\n I\u2019ve been told \u201cif there\u2019s no document, it doesn\u2019t get done.\u201dThis includes meetings.If there\u2019s no document, we cancel the meeting.\n While documents can create a more level playing field it\u2019s also a high barrier to entry.Even for small ideas, features, or iterations the first thing you will likely need is a document.My perspective may be skewed because in my current role I don\u2019t write production service code, but I do affect features, design, and positioning of the services.I have a lot of feedback and ideas, but I don\u2019t implement them.\n The available wealth of historical documents can be enlightening to read through, but it also can be confusing to trace the lineage of a service with a plethora of documents and comments.I have caught myself more than once reading a document which I thought sounded similar to an existing service only to realize 20 minutes later the document  is for the service and I didn\u2019t look at the date of the document or I didn\u2019t know the product code name.\n I have the benefit of working with the service teams and providing direct feedback about new features and services.Most documents I read are very interesting.Many teams at Amazon don\u2019t have direct product input.However, they\u2019re still required to write documents to communicate plans with their team.Not all docs are interesting, but they are crucial to the decision making process.\n I\u2019ve said multiple times that Amazon has the foundation for a great remote-first company.The document-based process provides employees in multiple timezones the same context as someone in Seattle.The discussions in meetings enable faster feedback loops, but the downside is they can limit the potential for asynchronous engagements if notes and questions aren\u2019t captured in the document.\n I\u2019ve never had the benefit of attending an Amazon meeting in person.From what I\u2019ve heard document-centered meetings have been extremely successful in transitioning to remote requirements.But the content isn\u2019t the only thing that matters.\n Amazon, like many large organizations, uses a lot of tools to communicate.It\u2019s often difficult to find documents spread across so many tools without an ability to cross search or centrally organize them.I could see how a tool like  Command E could help a lot.This can be additionally difficult with the multitude of open source and social platforms I engage with on a weekly basis.I currently have a user in 53 Slack workspaces. \ud83d\udc80\n Even with areas that could use improvement I can\u2019t think of a place I have worked that wouldn\u2019t benefit from document-based meetings.I\u2019m sure with more practice I will get better at writing with a more Amazonian style.\n I thoroughly enjoy not having to prep for meetings, because I\u2019m confident the document will give me the context I need to participate.I know the person who called the meeting invested their time so they don\u2019t waste mine.I reciprocate the same thoughtfulness with meetings I create and documents I write.", "posttime": "2021-06-18

", "note_en": "Unfortunately, many comments are not particularly helpful. The most common reason is that comments repeat the code: all of the information in the comment can easily be deduced from the code next to the comment.\n  // Add a horizontal scroll barhScrollBar = new JScrollBar(scrollBar, HORIZONTAL);add(hScrollBar, BorderLayout.SOUTH);// Add a vertical scroll barvScrollBar = new JScrollBar(JScrollBar.VERTICAL);add(vScrollBar, BorderLayout.EAST);// Initialize the caret-position related valuescaretX = 0;caretY = 0;caretMemX = null;\n The argument against comments like these is that they are \u201cat the same level of detail\u201d as the code itself. The code is clear in its intention, therefore the comments are redundant.\n John goes on to state that, to be useful, comments should provide a level detail not deducible from the code:\n Comments augment the code by providing information at a different level of detail. Some comments provide information at a lower, more detailed, level than the code; these comments add  precision by clarifying the exact meaning of the code. Other comments provide information at a higher, more abstract, level than the code; these comments offer  intuition, such as the reasoning behind the code, or a simpler and more abstract way of thinking about the code.\n I think this is a very fair and rationale explanation around what makes comments in code useful or not.\n  If somebody says a comment isn\u2019t adding any value, I would ask: to whom?\n Personally, I\u2019ve never liked the advice that writing obvious comments is bad practice\u2014probably because I write obvious comments all the time.\n Comments which are at the same level of detail as the code may not be useful to you as a fluent reader and writer of code, but they are to someone like me who is still figuring out how to read and write code. I find them useful as I  write code because they allow me to state my intention (in plain English), translate it to code, then compare statements and see how well I\u2019ve achieved my goal.\n Granted, if you\u2019re collaborating with a team of people then you have to figure out how to write code together. And that might mean compromising and cutting out comments that are helpful to you but distracting to others (you can always do that at the end of your process of authoring the code).\n Maybe this is an obvious statement, but if writing \u201cuseless\u201d code comments helps you, then they are not  useless. They\u2019re the opposite:  useful.\n It reminds me of when I learned Spanish. People always said, \u201cdon\u2019t do translation word for word in your head. Let the words mean what they mean in their natural language.\u201d Yet this is precisely what I would do when I first learned the language:\n  Eventually I became fluent enough where I didn\u2019t need to do this manual, step-by-step, line-by-line translation in my head. Words had their own meaning in their own language. At that point, I realized it was useless (for me) to translate into English in my head.\n  // What is your name?\u00bfComo te llamas?// My name is JimMe llamo Jim.// Where is the library?\u00bfDonde esta la biblioteca?\n Given what people say about code comments, you might think comments like these are useless. From John\u2019s book:\n Could someone who has never seen the code write the comment just by looking at the code next to the comment? If the answer is yes...then the comment doesn&#39;t make the code any easier to understand.\n Do those comments help the code become easier to understand? Well, that depends on who you ask.\n Saying code comments are useless is a judgement from us as fluent readers of the code. It disregards the value comments have for someone less fluent than yourself who is either reading or writing code.\n If you don\u2019t consider yourself fluent, you might derive a lot of value from comments others label useless, obvious, or redundant because they help you translate something you&#39;re not that familiar with\u2014another language\u2014into something you are\u2014English, for example.\n And comments can serve a very different purpose when they\u2019re being read vs. when they\u2019re being written. Those are almost two different kinds of of activities.\n So when someone calls a particular style of code commenting useless, ask yourself: to whom?

The experience there is a big part of the draw, so his staff would only send out a few orders a day, tops, and he didn\u2019t mind partnering with companies like Seamless, he said, despite the 30 percent they\u2019d charge in fees. But once the city locked down, Fuquay did what few restaurateurs were willing to do: He cut ties with the apps. Instead, Fuquay reached out directly to customers, put flyers in people\u2019s takeout orders asking them not to use the apps, and retrained service staff so they could do delivery work.\n  Yet the Grubhub orders kept coming. So did Postmates. Fuquay didn\u2019t work with them in any official way; they simply put his restaurant on the site, and picked up orders and delivered them. Not only were they still charging his customers fees; they were using old menus, promising customers meals he hadn\u2019t made in years, like duck breast in mole sauce. That led to confused and upset customers, negative reviews, and a general frustration that tech giants are gaining from his business and leaving him with little to show for it. \u201cIt\u2019s misrepresenting my business to the public,\u201d Fuquay said. \u201cWhat I lose is the ability to control the transaction with the customer, the ability to market my own current menu and my own current prices, and to resolve any issues that come up.\u201d He tried calling them time and time again, but the response, he said, has been the same: \u201cCrickets.\u201d\n  Now, New York is on the verge of allowing restaurants like the Queensboro to have more control over their own deliveries. Mark Gjonaj, a Bronx City Council member and chair of the Committee on Small Business, is set to introduce a new bill on Thursday that would make it illegal for third-party delivery companies to add restaurants to their apps without explicit permission \u2014\u00a0and would fine the companies as much as $1,000 a day, per restaurant, for violating those terms, according to a version of the bill obtained by Curbed. \u201cOften in cases where a restaurant doesn\u2019t want to be included on a third-party marketplace, it\u2019s because they lose quality control on the food, and they give up having a direct relationship with their own customers \u2014 both put restaurants in a no-win situation,\u201d Gjonaj told Curbed. \u201cNow more than ever, locally owned restaurants should be able to control their business and how it operates. If they want to sign up for a delivery service, then great. If they don\u2019t, they shouldn\u2019t have to grovel to tech companies and hope to be taken off of a platform that may be harmful to their business.\u201d\n  The law, should it pass, would potentially double penalties imposed by a state  bill from Staten Island state senator Diane Savino that nixes the practice statewide. The state bill, which passed both legislative houses in May and will go to the governor for review in the next few weeks, also allows restaurants to pursue legal action against third-party delivery companies for adding them. And it\u2019s coming as city lawmakers are looking to redouble their efforts to rein in the middleman apps, just as restaurants that survived the pandemic are able to return at full capacity. \u201cWith the struggles that restaurants have faced over the last year, this legislation will help ensure that they are not taken advantage of,\u201d Senator Savino said. Surreptitiously adding restaurants has been a delivery  practice for years. DoorDash and Postmates, now owned by Uber, were exemplars of the practice, and used it to fuel their Silicon Valley\u2013style growth. Seamless, the parent company of Grubhub, soon  followed suit, adding hundreds of thousands of restaurants in a race for market domination. While the growth has been undeniable \u2014\u00a0especially during the pandemic \u2014\u00a0it\u2019s still a generally  unprofitable industry.\n  By the time the pandemic started in\u00a0March 2020, tension had been building for years between New York City\u2019s restaurant industry and these tech-enabled delivery companies.\u00a0Seamless and DoorDash, they complained, charged extremely high fees, discouraged indoor dining \u2014\u00a0where restaurateurs typically make more per meal \u2014\u00a0and actually made it  more confusing than before for some customers. By May, just a few weeks into the lockdown, the City Council had passed a suite of emergency laws temporarily capping fees and reining in their ability to charge commissions for orders made through their phone systems\u2014\u00a0a situation that\u2019s had the potential to\u00a0 cost restaurants thousands of dollars extra a month. Those bills expire this August, and Gjonaj\u2019s office is planning on holding a hearing later this month to discuss making them permanent as well as making phone-ordering fees more  transparent. \u201cMy colleagues and I are currently considering whether it is needed to temporarily extend, make permanent, or allow the laws to sunset,\u201d Gjonaj said.\n  The reaction from delivery companies has been mixed. Uber declined to comment. DoorDash had already  announced in November that it was ending the practice of adding restaurants to the platform without their explicit permission, though it\u00a0has retained the ones that it already listed, according to a person familiar with the business. \u201cWe\u2019re proud that the odds of staying in business during the pandemic are eight times better for restaurants on DoorDash, and we commend efforts to support local merchants and ensure that they are heard,\u201d a DoorDash spokeswoman said.\n  Grubhub, which started adding these so-called non-partner restaurants only in 2019, didn\u2019t directly address questions about the new bills, but said it\u2019s\u00a0 supportive of local restaurants that want out. \u201cWe\u2019re developing tools that make it easier for restaurants to claim their menus or request to be removed from our platform, and if a restaurant would not like to be included on Grubhub, they can reach out to us at  restaurants@grubhub.com,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n  New York has generally been among the most aggressive states in pushing back against the delivery companies. While the restaurant industry has been battered by the pandemic \u2014\u00a0Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, told Curbed  that there are still about 130,000 fewer jobs in the city \u2014  lawmakers have been more receptive to getting them back. \u201cWe need to have penalties for non-compliance,\u201d Rigie said.\u00a0\u201cMany of these are billion-dollar corporations. We\u2019ve seen they are willing to exploit local restaurants, they try to creatively wiggle around laws so they don\u2019t impact them, and even in cases when laws are in effect, they willfully break them.\u201d Fuquay said that while the Queensboro has been able to rally its customers to support it, not every restaurant would be able to pull that off. \u201cSome restaurants feel trapped, and those restaurants are usually the least well-resourced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve connected the dots in a way that a lot of restaurants don\u2019t have the resources to do, and they\u2019re being exploited by these companies.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 08:12:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6551\u63f4,finally,rigie", "title": "\u9910\u9986\u7ec8\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u6551\u63f4Grubhub\u548cUber\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce8\u518c ", "title_en": "Restaurants May Finally Get Relief from Grubhub and Uber\u2019s Automatic Sign-Ups", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.curbed.com/2021/06/uber-grubhub-seamless-apps-restaurants-automatically-added-illegal-nyc.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6551\u63f4", "finally", "rigie"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "baba7c1193cdfa7bf86391a612f658ad.png", "infoid": 1066618, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "[\u610f\u89c1]\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u5e03\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u9972\u6599\u7684\u751f\u6210;  [\u89c6\u56fe]\u751f\u6210\u6700\u8fd1\u53d1\u5e03\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u9972\u6599;  [\u7ec4\u7ec7]\u7528\u6237\u73b0\u5728\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u4f1a\u5458\u9650\u5236\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7559\u4e0b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002 ", "note_en": "[views] Generation of an Atom feed of the schemas recently published and updated on MOSP;\n [views] Generation of an Atom feed of the objects recently published and updated on MOSP;\n [organizations] A user can now join an organization which has no membership restriction and as well leave an organization.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 08:12:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "mosp,\u539f\u5b50", "title": "\u65b0\u7248\u672c\u7684MOSP\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u5171\u4eabJSON\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5de5\u5177 ", "title_en": "A new release of MOSP: A tool for creating, editing and sharing JSON objects", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/CASES-LU/MOSP/releases/tag/v0.14.0", "via": "", "real_tags": ["mosp", "\u539f\u5b50"]}]
