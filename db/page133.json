", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Quake is a  first-person shooter  video game developed by  id Software and published by  GT Interactive in  1996. It is the first game in the   Quake series.  [5] In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry. The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with many stone  textures and a rusty, capitalized  font.\n The successor to id Software&#39;s   Doom series,  Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.  [6] Unlike the   Doom engine before it, the   Quake engine offered full  real-time 3D rendering and had early support for  3D acceleration through  OpenGL. After   Doom helped to popularize  multiplayer  deathmatches in 1993,  Quake added various multiplayer options.  Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the  QuakeWorld update and software such as  QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n     In  Quake &#39;s single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, &#34;Nightmare&#34;, was &#34;so bad that it was hidden, so people won&#39;t wander in by accident&#34;;  [7] the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n Quake &#39;s single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a &#34;low gravity&#34; level that challenges the player&#39;s abilities in a different way). If the player&#39;s character dies, he must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub &#34;START&#34; level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of  Quake) has the most traditional ideology of a  boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the &#34;END&#34; level which contains a final puzzle.\n  In multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player&#39;s computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in  co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of  deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either  free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one  duels, or organized  teamplay with two or more players per team (or  clan). Players frequently implement  mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n The gameplay in  Quake was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.  [8]  Bunny hopping or strafe jumping allow faster movement, while  rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to  Quake &#39;s appeal. Multiplayer  Quake was one of the first games singled out as a form of  electronic sport.  [9] A notable participant was  Dennis Fong, who won  John Carmack&#39;s  Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored  Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.\n  In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the unnamed protagonist called Ranger in later games (voiced by  Trent Reznor)  [10] who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy  code-named &#34;Quake&#34;. The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a &#34;Slipgate&#34;; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the &#34;Human&#34; dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n The sole surviving protagonist in &#34;Operation Counterstrike&#34; is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger&#39;s main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\n The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or &#34;maps&#34;, divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game&#39;s final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of  gothic,  medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of  Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game&#39;s setting is inspired by  dark fantasy influences, including  H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s  Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the &#34;Spawn&#34; enemies are called &#34;Formless Spawn of  Tsathoggua&#34; in the manual, the  boss of the first episode is named  Chthon, and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a  Dark Young). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and  The Nameless City. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n    A preview included with  id&#39;s very first release, 1990&#39;s   Commander Keen, advertised a game entitled  The Fight for Justice as a follow-up to the  Commander Keen trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, &#34;the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent&#34;, armed with thunderbolts and a &#34;Ring of Regeneration&#34;. Conceived as a  VGA full-color  side-scrolling  role-playing game,  The Fight for Justice was never released.\n Lead designer and director  John Romero later conceived of  Quake as an  action game taking place in a fully  3D world, inspired by  Sega AM2&#39;s 3D  fighting game   Virtua Fighter.  Quake was also intended to feature  Virtua Fighter influenced third-person  melee combat, but id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after  Quake was released.  [11]  [12] Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from  Quake.  [13] In 2000, Romero released   Daikatana, the game that he envisioned  Quake being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time,  [14]  [15] he said  Daikatana was &#34;more fun to make than  Quake&#34; due to the lack of creative interference.  [16]\n Quake was given as a title to the game that  id Software was working on shortly after the release of   Doom II. The earliest information released described  Quake as focusing on a  Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer,  [17]  [18]  [19] and is able to knock away enemies by throwing the hammer (complete with real-time  inverse kinematics). [   citation needed] Initially, the levels were supposed to be designed in an  Aztec style, but the choice was dropped some months into the project. [   citation needed] Early screenshots then showed medieval environments and dragons. [   citation needed] The plan was for the game to have more  RPG-style elements. However, work was very slow on the engine, since  John Carmack, the main programmer of  Quake, was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model (Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things). [   citation needed] Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers.  [20]\n Eventually, the whole id Software team began to think that the original concept may not have been as wise a choice as they first believed.  [19] Thus, the final game was very stripped down from its original intentions, and instead featured gameplay similar to  Doom and its sequel, although the levels and enemies were closer to medieval RPG style rather than science-fiction. In a December 1, 1994 post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, &#34;Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say &#34;action&#34;? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout \u2013 probably more so than Doom&#34;.  [21]\n Quake was programmed by John Carmack,  Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by  American McGee,  Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and  Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by  Adrian Carmack,  Kevin Cloud and  Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using  Alias.  [22]\n The  game engine developed for  Quake, the   Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the first-person shooter genre: polygonal models instead of  prerendered  sprites; full 3D level design instead of a  2.5D map;  prerendered  lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with  QuakeC), which popularized fan-created  modifications (mods).\n Before the release of the full game or the shareware version of  Quake, id Software released  QTest on February 24, 1996. It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions.  QTest gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the  Quake engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.  [23]\n Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a  gun-butt.  [19] Shortly before release this was replaced with an  axe.\n   Quake &#39;s music and sound design was done by  Trent Reznor and  Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized  drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the  Quake soundtrack &#34;is not music, it&#39;s textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It&#39;s been fun.&#34;  [24] The game also includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the &#34;Nailgun&#34; and &#34;Super Nailgun&#34; decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.\n Digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original  shareware release.\n  The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor on July 5, 1996,  [3] followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. The first commercially released port was the port to Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port&#39;s release,  [25] leading to MacSoft&#39;s involvement) in late August 1997.  [4] ClickBOOM announced version for  Amiga-computers in 1998.  [26] Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by  Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the three add-ons as  Quake: The Offering.  [27]  [28]  [29]\n Quake was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the  Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself,  [30] but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by  Sega.  [31] Sega then took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent  frame rate, and assigned it to  Lobotomy Software.  [32] The Sega Saturn port used Lobotomy Software&#39;s own 3D game engine,  SlaveDriver (the same game engine that powered the Sega Saturn versions of   PowerSlave and   Duke Nukem 3D), instead of the original  Quake engine.  [33] It is the only version of  Quake that is rated &#34;T&#34; for Teen instead of &#34;M&#34; for Mature.\n Quake had also been ported to the  Sony  PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the port was cancelled due to difficulties in finding a publisher. A port of  Quake for the  Atari Jaguar was also advertized as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of   Ultimate Future Games magazine, but it was never released.  [34]  [35] Another port of  Quake was also slated for  Panasonic M2 but never occurred due to the cancellation of the system.  [36]\n On March 24, 1998, the game was released for the  Nintendo 64 by  Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on   Doom 64,  [37] at id Software&#39;s request.  [38] The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.  [39]\n Both console ports required compromises because of the limited  CPU power and  ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU.  [40] The Sega Saturn version includes 28 of the 32 single-player levels from the original PC version of the game, though the secret levels, Ziggurat Vertigo (E1M8), The Underearth (E2M7), The Haunted Halls (E3M7), and The Nameless City (E4M8), were removed. Instead, it has four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell&#39;s Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, &#34;Dank &amp; Scuz&#34;, which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a  slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Sega Saturn version; as a result of this, all of the deathmatch maps from the PC version were removed from the Sega Saturn port. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto (E1M4), The Installation (E2M1), The Ebon Fortress (E2M4), The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), The Sewage System (E4M1), and Hell&#39;s Atrium (E4M5) levels. It also does not use the hub &#34;START&#34; map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order from The Slipgate Complex (E1M1) to Shub Niggurath&#39;s Pit (END). The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, and an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death, is also included.\n Two ports of  Quake for the Nintendo DS exist,  QuakeDS  [41] and  CQuake.  [42] Both run well, however, multiplayer does not work on  QuakeDS.  [41] Since the source code for  Quake was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones.  [43]  [44]  [45] The  Rockbox project also distributes a version of  Quake that runs on some MP3 players.  [46]\n In 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of  Quake for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions.  [47] Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360.  [48]  Quake mobile was reviewed by  GameSpot on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a  Best Mobile Game&#34; in their E3 2005 Editor&#39;s Choice Awards.  [49] It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v both of which are PDAs not mobile phones.  [49]  Quake Mobile does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints.  [48]  Quake Mobile runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of  Quake Mobile is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two  Quake expansion packs,  Scourge of Armagon and  Dissolution of Eternity, are also available for  Quake Mobile.\n A  Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs  Quake at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.  [50]\n  Quake can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in  QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan created &#34;mods&#34;. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in  Quake fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software&#39;s original release.\n The first major  Quake mod was   Team Fortress. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter  Soldier class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the  Scout class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one&#39;s flag in  Threewave CTF would return the flag to the base, and in  TF the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to  Threewave CTF.  Team Fortress maintained its standing as the most-played online  Quake modification for many years. Team Fortress would go on to become   Team Fortress Classic and get a sequel,   Team Fortress 2.\n Another popular mod was   Threewave  Capture the Flag (CTF), primarily authored by Dave &#39;Zoid&#39; Kirsch.

But I was reminded of it this morning when I saw  a new report on electric vehicle accessibility. Compiled by the Consumer Choice Center (CCC), the report scores all 50 states based on how hard they make it to buy an EV, whether that&#39;s banning direct-to-consumer sales or requiring extra registration fees or  road charges. Unsurprisingly, the United States is a bit of a patchwork in this regard. But it&#39;s not quite as simple as red states making it hard and blue states making it easy to buy an EV.\n  Ten states score top marks with the CCC: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. All these states will allow direct sales of cars to individuals, and none will make you pay more to register your new EV than you&#39;d pay for a new car with an internal combustion engine (ICE). (The District of Columbia would also go in this group if DC-based CCC had included it.)\n California is conspicuous by its absence in that top 10. The state is the leading market for EVs within the US, with  the highest adoption rate and the most public chargers.\u00a0 Nearly half of all US-registered EVs\u00a0are on its roads. But California also has an escalating EV license fee that&#39;s currently $100 but is now linked to the consumer price index.\n Because it&#39;s possible to register some gasoline-powered vehicles in California for less than $100, the state joins the &#34;somewhat accessible&#34; group, along with Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Most of those states, like California, lost points because they have extra EV registration fees, but Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all have some restrictions on automakers selling cars directly to the public.\n The &#34;barely accessible&#34; states were Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. A few of these states prohibit direct auto sales but don&#39;t charge more to register an EV than an ICE vehicle, others allow Tesla (but no other automaker) to sell direct to the public, and some do both.\n  Finally, there are the inaccessible states: Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Each of these place plenty of roadblocks between their citizens and a new EV, banning any direct sales within their borders as well as making it more expensive to register an EV than an ICE vehicle.\n  In total, 28 states make it more expensive to register an EV, and 17 have completely banned Tesla and others from selling their cars straight to the public. Twelve other states have some restrictions on direct sales, including allowing Tesla (but no other automaker) to make them.\n &#34;It is clear that consumers want more access to electric vehicles. Therefore legislation should make the purchase and ownership of them as convenient as possible, and we urge legislators to put forth better policies that will reduce the significant barriers currently preventing consumers from fully\u00a0accessing EVs,&#34; said CCC&#39;s North American affairs manager David Clement, co-author of the study.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:37:54", "source_domain":

6/22\u00a0 10:55 am EDT: Prime Day has paradoxically rolled into its second day, so we&#39;ve given our mega-roundup another refresh. As expected, the pace of new discounts has slowed, but we&#39;ve still found good deals on  recommended indoor security cameras,  4K box sets of the   Lord of the Rings \u00a0and   The Hobbit trilogies, the  latest  Spider-Man game for the PS4/PS5, and more.\n Update 6/21 5:35 pm EDT: After another sweep of our Prime Day deals roundup, we have struck out a few expired offers, updated prices, and added a few new deals. Those bargains include premium OLED TVs from Sony, well-reviewed air purifiers from Blueair, Blue&#39;s popular Yeti microphone, and Samsung  SSDs we like, among other discounts you can find below.\n Update 6/21 12 pm EDT: We&#39;ve\u00a0added our first batch of new discounts, headlined by the return of  a deal we highlighted a couple weeks back: those who buy at least $40 in Amazon gift cards can  get an extra $10 in Amazon credit at no extra cost.\u00a0Elsewhere, Apple&#39;s  latest iPad Air is now down to a joint-low of $520, and we&#39;ve found new deals on Nvidia&#39;s Shield TV, recommended board games\u00a0  Dixit\u00a0and\u00a0  Mysterium, a good Anker battery pack, and more. Since this post first went live, we&#39;ve also put together roundups for those looking to  spend less than $50 and those  who don&#39;t subscribe to Prime but still want some savings.\n Original post 6/21 4:50 am EDT:\u00a0Amazon Prime Day has arrived, and  another avalanche of deals has come along with it. As ever, the vast majority of the gadget and gear discounts Amazon is advertising aren&#39;t that special: many of the products are mediocre, and many of the prices aren&#39;t much lower than usual.\n But there are still a few hidden gems\u2014and the Dealmaster team is here to help you find them. We&#39;ve spent the better part of the last week cutting through thousands of offers, looking through  price-history charts, and researching products we haven&#39;t used ourselves, all to bring you the very best Prime Day deals we can find.\n Below are the fruits of our labor, with a few special mentions for particularly notable deals. We&#39;ll update our mega-roundup over the course of Amazon&#39;s two-day event, adding good gadget deals as we see them with a &#34; NEW&#34; tag and  striking out expired ones.\n As a reminder,  Prime Day runs from June 21-22, and you&#39;ll need\u00a0 an Amazon Prime membership to access most deals. And yes, on one level, this whole thing is still a made-up holiday designed to gin up sales for an  increasingly massive\u00a0tech giant that has faced  fierce criticism of its  working conditions,  handling of customer data, and  allegedly anticompetitive practices, among other matters.\n Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0 affiliate programs.\n      Sony WH-1000XM4 Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones for\u00a0$248 (normally $315): Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4 is the  best wireless noise-canceling headphone for most people, blending good comfort, highly effective ANC, customizable sound, great battery life, and several nifty bonus features. This deal  matches the lowest price we&#39;ve seen at a major retailer.\n Get\u00a0 $10 promotional credit\u00a0when you spend\u00a0$40 or more\u00a0on select Amazon gift cards: Amazon briefly  offered this promotion\u00a0in the lead-up to Prime Day. As before, you can get a bonus $10 in Amazon credit when you spend $40 or more on certain Amazon gift cards or an existing gift card balance, be it for yourself or others. Both digital and physical gift cards are eligible. If you use the checkout code &#34; GCPRIME2021&#34; or hit the &#34;Apply code to your account&#34; button in the deal link above, you should see a notification confirming the deal at checkout. There are still caveats: Amazon says it&#39;ll email the credit code to you within two days of your purchase, the credit will only be applicable to items sold by Amazon itself, and the $10 will expire if not used by August 7. You can only utilize the deal once per account. And in general, offers like these are a way for Amazon to keep customers locked into its storefront. But if you plan to buy something from the site in the near future anyway, it&#39;s hard to complain about what is effectively free Amazon money.\n Instant Pot Duo Plus (6qt) 9-in-1 electric pressure cooker for\u00a0$54.95 (normally $110): Another all-time low, this looks like Prime Day&#39;s best deal for those deciding to jump into the Instant Pot craze. This model is generally a  minor upgrade over  the Instant Pot Duo, with a sous vide setting and a nicer display, but again, it&#39;s an easier recommendation at this discounted price. If you&#39;re mainly cooking for one, the  3-quart Instant Pot Duo Nova is on sale for $50.\n Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (8GB, ads) ebook reader for\u00a0$79.99 (normally $125): Prime Day typically brings loads of deals on Amazon-made devices, and this year is no exception. This deal matches the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked on the Kindle Paperwhite, which we have long considered the  best e-reader for most people. A version without in-built ads is  on sale for $100.\n Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K HDR media streamer for\u00a0$24.99 (normally $45): Though we consider Google&#39;s Chromecast the  better streaming stick overall, the speedy Fire TV Stick 4K becomes a much better value proposition at this deal price, which ties the best we&#39;ve tracked.\n Samsung Evo Select (256GB) microSDXC card for $25.99\u00a0(normally $33): We&#39;ve  recommended this\u00a0Class 10,  U3-rated microSD card in the past: it&#39;s not the fastest option on the market, but it&#39;s still quick and reliable enough to comfortably hold Switch games or other media. This deal is a dollar off the all-time low. If you need more space,  a 512GB model is on sale for a new low of $62.\n Jabra Elite 75t true wireless earphones for\u00a0$99.99 (normally $140): Jabra&#39;s Elite 75t are almost a couple of years old now, but they remain a  nicely well-rounded pair of true wireless earbuds. They&#39;re light, comfortable, and easily portable, with a useful control scheme, good sound quality, and active noise cancelation. This is another new low price. If you&#39;re an iPhone user looking for a step up,  Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro are more modestly discounted to $190.\n Nintendo Switch Lite + 128GB SanDisk microSD Card for Nintendo Switch for\u00a0$199.99 (normally $225): The Nintendo Switch remains highly in demand, so Prime Day&#39;s main Switch deal is predictably modest, merely bundling the Lite version of the console with the 128GB version of SanDisk&#39;s officially licensed microSD card. The latter usually goes for about $25 on its own. Still, the\u00a0 Switch Lite is a good buy in its own right, and we recommended this particular microSD card in our  guide to the best Nintendo Switch accessories. Just be aware that for the past several weeks, Nintendo has been rumored to  launch a &#34;Pro&#34; version of the console and that the Lite version can still only be used in handheld mode, not docked to a TV.\n Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-month membership for\u00a0$29.99\u00a0(normally $45): For Xbox and PC players, Microsoft&#39;s Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still one of the\u00a0 better values in gaming, bundling  hundreds of genuinely worthwhile games\u00a0(with  several more to come) for one all-you-can-eat monthly fee. This deal takes $15 off the price of a 3-month subscription, which is $5 off the best price we&#39;ve tracked for existing members. If you&#39;ve never subscribed to the service, though, note that Microsoft is running a promotion that gives this  same membership plan for just $1.\n OnePlus 8 (128GB, Green) 6.55-inch unlocked smartphone for\u00a0$349\u00a0(normally $610): The OnePlus 8  is a year old at this point, but at $349 its 90Hz display, Snapdragon 865 chip, and clean software (with  security updates through mid-2023) are a good value. This deal is a new low, but it only appears to apply to the green model linked above. Just note that this variant is meant for GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.\n Razer Viper Ultimate wireless gaming mouse for\u00a0$71.24 (normally $100): Razer&#39;s Viper Ultimate is our  favorite wireless gaming mouse thanks to its highly responsive sensor and comfortable, ultra-lightweight, and ambidextrous design. This deal marks the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked. A bundle that comes with Razer&#39;s RGB charging dock is  on sale for $90. If you&#39;d rather not pay this much,  Logitech&#39;s G305 Lightspeed, another recommendation of ours, is down to a new low of $30.\n   Get\u00a0 $10 promotional credit\u00a0when you spend\u00a0$40 or more\u00a0on select Amazon gift cards (use code:  GCPRIME2021 or hit &#34;Apply code to your account&#34; button).\n  Amazon Fire TV Cube 4K HDR media streamer + smart speaker for\u00a0 $79.99

led by specialist edtech investor Learn Capital, with other unnamed investors participating. It comes after Merlyn Mind spent about three years quietly building its first release and more recently piloting the service in 50+ classrooms in more than 20 schools.\n Co-founded by longtime IBM scientists Satya Nitta (the CEO), Ravi Kokku, and Sharad Sundararajan \u2014 all of whom spent several years leading education efforts in IBM\u2019s Watson AI research division \u2014 Merlyn Mind is coming to the market with a patented, vertically integrated solution to solve what Nitta told me in an interview he believes and has seen first-hand to be a fundamental pain point in the world of edtech.\n  In effect, education and technology may have now been merged into a single term as far as the tech world is concerned, but in terms of practical, on-the-ground application, many teachers are not making the most of the tools they have in the classroom. The majority are, he believes, facing \u201ccognitive overload\u201d (which is not to mention the kids, who themselves probably are facing the same: a problem for it to tackle down the road, I hope), and they need help.\n To be fair, this problem existed before the pandemic, with research from   McKinsey &amp; Co. published in 2020 (and gathered earlier) finding that teachers were already spending more than half of their time on administrative tasks, not teaching or thinking about how and what to teach or what help specific students might need. Other research from    Learn Platform found that teachers potentially have as many as 900 different applications that they can use in a classroom (in practice, Nitta told me a teacher will typically use between 20 and 30 applications, sites and tech services in a day, although even that is a huge amount).\n Post-Covid-19, there are other kinds of new complications to grapple with on top of all that. Not only are many educators now playing catch-up because of the months spent learning at home (it\u2019s been widely documented that in many cases, students have fallen behind), but overall, education is coming away from our year+ of remote learning with a much stronger mandate to use  more tech from now on, not less.\n The help that Merlyn Mind is proposing comes in the form of what the startup describes as an \u201cAI hub.\u201d This includes a personal assistant called Symphony Classroom, a kind of Alexa-style voice interface tailored to the educational environment and built on a fork of Android; a smart speaker that looks a bit like a soundbar; and a consumer-style remote that can be used also for navigation and commands.\n These then work with whatever screen the teacher opts to use, whether it is a TV, or an interactive whiteboard, or something else; along with any other connected devices that are used in the classroom, to open and navigate through different apps, including various Google apps, NearPod, Newsela, and so on. (That could potentially also include kids\u2019 individual screens if they are being used.)\n The idea is that if a teacher is in the middle of a lesson on a specific topic and a question comes up that can best be answered by illustrating a concept through another app, a teacher can trigger the system to navigate to a new screen to find that information and instantly show it to the students. The system can also be used to find a teacher\u2019s own materials on file. The demo I saw worked well enough, although I would love to see how an ordinary teacher \u2014 the kind they\u2019re hoping will use this \u2014 would fare.\n Everyone knows the expression \u201chardware is hard,\u201d so it\u2019s interesting to see Merlyn addressing its problem with a hardware-forward approach.\n  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why we built our own hardware,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of AI processing that\u2019s happening on the device, for various reasons, including latency and security. So it\u2019s kind of an edge AI appliance. And the second thing is the microphones. They are designed for the classroom environment, and we wanted to have complete control over the tooling of these microphones for the processing, for the environment, and that is very hard to do. If you are taking a third-party microphone array off the shelf, it\u2019s impossible, actually, you simply cannot.\u201d\n The startup\u2019s early team is rounded out with alums from the likes of HP Education, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Broadcom and Roku to help build all of this, knowing the challenges they were tackling, but also the payoff once it would be finished if it all works.\n \u201cW e have a very, very talented team, and we basically said, right, this is going to be a lot of hard work that will take us three and a half years. We have to build our own piece of hardware\u2026 and  we ended up building the entire voice stack from from scratch ourselves, too,\u201d Nitta continued. \u201cIt means we have end to end control of everything from the hardware all the way to the language models.\u201d\n He did point out though that over time, there will be some elements that will be usable without all the hardware, in particular when a teacher may suddenly have to teach outside the classroom again in a remote learning environment.\n It\u2019s a very ambitious concept, but where would education and learning be if not for taking leaps once in a while? That\u2019s where investors stand on the startup, too.\n \u201cJust as we saw with the breakthrough edtech company Coursera which reached IPO this year and was started a decade ago by two machine learning professors, in today\u2019s hypercompetitive market the best edtech companies need to start with an advanced technological core,\u201d said Rob Hutter, founder and managing partner of Learn Capital. \u201c Merlyn\u00a0is one of the first\u00a0companies\u00a0to focus on the enhancement of live teaching in classrooms, and it is developing a solution that is so intuitive it allows teachers to leverage technology with mastery while using minimal effort.\u00a0 This is a very promising platform.\u201d\n The proof will be in how it gets adopted when it finally launches commercially later this year, with pricing to be announced later.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:36:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "White Square move marks one of first closures of fund hit by surges in so-called meme stocks\n A London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against US retailer GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January is shutting its doors.\n White Square Capital, run by former Paulson &amp; Co trader Florian Kronawitter, told investors that it would shut its main fund and return capital this month after a review of its business model, according to people familiar with the fund and a letter to investors.\n White Square, which at its peak managed about $440m in assets, had bet against GameStop, say people familiar with its positioning, and suffered double-digit per cent losses in January.\n  The move marks one of the first closures of a hedge fund hit by the huge surges in so-called meme stocks. Retail investors, often co-ordinating their actions on online forums such as Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets and in some cases deliberately targeting hedge fund short sellers, drove up the price of stocks such as GameStop and cinema chain AMC Entertainment in January and again in recent weeks. GameStop, for instance, soared from less than $20 at the start of the year to more than $480 at its January peak.\n That led to  big losses for some funds, including US-based Melvin Capital, run by Steve Cohen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gabe Plotkin, and Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher, a former Tiger cub who worked at Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management. However, the funds remain in operation, and shortly after its losses Melvin received a  $2.75bn investment from Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel.\n \u201cThe decision to close down is related to thinking the equity long-short model is challenged,\u201d said Kronawitter.\n \u201cThere are way too many fish in the pond with the same strategy of long-short,\u201d he added. \u201cThe traditional edge is being arbed away [eroded by other investors], there\u2019s an oversupply of capital.\u201d\n A person close to the fund said the decision to shut was unrelated to the meme stock rally. The fund quickly rebounded in the wake of January\u2019s turmoil and made back \u201ca fair share\u201d of the losses, the person added.\n Among other funds hit, Melvin was still  down about 44.7 per cent this year to the end of last month, while Light Street was down about 20.1 per cent.\n  Kronawitter, who previously worked at US billionaire John Paulson\u2019s hedge fund and Merrill Lynch, had made double-digit gains at White Square in 2015 and 2016, said a person who had seen the numbers, while last year it made about 19 per cent.\n In the investor letter announcing the fund\u2019s closure, White Square said that last year, despite that year\u2019s strong performance, two large investors had opted to withdraw their cash and put it in cheap passive funds or private equity. \u201cWe experienced first-hand the shift in trend away from hedge fund investing to cheaper alternatives,\u201d it added.\n According to the letter, White Square had been due to receive investor inflows again in May this year, but instead decided to shut the fund.\n \u201cThe arbitrage opportunities have diminished with both the onslaught of capital caused by central bank monetary interventions, as well as much improved dissemination of information, bringing up the question to what degree the same fees can be justified,\u201d it said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:29:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u57fa\u91d1,fund", "title": "\u5bf9\u51b2\u57fa\u91d1\u8d4cGamestop\u5173\u95ed ", "title_en": "Hedge Fund That Bet Against GameStop Shuts Down", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.ft.com/content/397bdbe9-f257-4ca6-b600-1756804517b6", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u57fa\u91d1", "fund"]}]
