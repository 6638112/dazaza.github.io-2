Attention discourse is my term for the proliferation of articles, essays, books, and op-eds about attention and distraction in the age of digital media. I don’t mean the label pejoratively. I’ve made my own contributions to the genre, in this newsletter and elsewhere, and as recently as May of last year. 1 In fact, I tend to think that attention discourse circles around immensely important issues we should all think about more deliberately. So, here then, is yet another entry for the attention files presented as a numbered list of loosely related observations for you consideration, a form in which I like to occasionally indulge and which I hope you find suggestive and generative.</p><p>0.注意力话语是我对数字媒体时代有关注意力和分散注意力的文章、散文、书籍和评论文章的泛滥成灾的称呼。我不是轻蔑地指这个标签。我在这篇时事通讯和其他地方，甚至在去年5月，都为这一流派做出了自己的贡献。1事实上，我倾向于认为注意力围绕着非常重要的问题展开讨论，我们都应该更仔细地思考。因此，这里是注意力文件的另一个条目，作为一个编号的列表，列出了一些松散相关的观察结果供大家考虑，我偶尔喜欢用这种形式，希望你们能发现它具有启发性和生成性。</p><p> 1. I take Nick Carr’s 2008 piece in  The Atlantic,  “Is Google Making Us Stupid?”, to be the ur-text of this most recent wave of attention discourse. If that’s fair, then attention and distraction have been the subject of intermittent public debate for nearly fifteen years, but this sustained focus appears to have yielded little by way of improving our situation. I say the “the most recent wave” because attention discourse has a history that pre-dates the digital age. The first wave of attention discourse can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century, as historian Jonathan Crary has argued at length, especially in his 1999 book,   Suspensions of Perception: Attention, Spectacle, and Modern Culture. “For it is in the late nineteenth century,” Crary observed,</p><p>1.我拿尼克·卡尔2008年在《大西洋月刊》上的一篇文章来说，“谷歌让我们变傻了吗？”，成为最近一波关注话语的文本。如果这是公平的话，那么近15年来，注意力和注意力分散一直是断断续续的公共辩论的主题，但这种持续的关注似乎对改善我们的状况收效甚微。我之所以说“最近的浪潮”，是因为注意力话语的历史早于数字时代。正如历史学家乔纳森·克雷（Jonathan Crary）在其1999年的著作《感知的悬念：注意力、奇观和现代文化》中详细论述的那样，注意力话语的第一波浪潮可以追溯到19世纪中叶。“因为那是在19世纪末，”克雷里说，</p><p> within the human sciences and particularly the nascent field of scientific psychology, that the problem of  attention becomes a fundamental issue. It was a problem whose centrality was directly related to the emergence of a social, urban, psychic, and industrial field increasingly saturated with sensory input. Inattention, especially within the context of new forms of large-scale industrialized production, began to be treated as a danger and a serious problem, even though it was often the very modernized arrangements of labor that produced inattention. It is possible to see one crucial aspect of modernity as an ongoing crisis of attentiveness, in which the changing configurations of capitalism continually push attention and distraction to new limits and thresholds, with an endless sequence of new products, sources of stimulation, and streams of information, and then respond with new methods of managing and regulating perception […] But at the same time, attention, as a historical problem, is not reducible to the strategies of social discipline. As I shall argue, the articulation of a subject in terms of attentive capacities simultaneously disclosed a subject incapable of conforming to such disciplinary imperatives.”</p><p>在人文科学领域，尤其是科学心理学的新兴领域，注意力问题成为一个基本问题。这个问题的中心地位与一个社会、城市、心理和工业领域的出现直接相关，这个领域越来越充斥着感官输入。注意力不集中，特别是在新型大规模工业化生产的背景下，开始被视为一种危险和严重的问题，尽管往往是非常现代化的劳动安排导致注意力不集中。可以将现代性的一个关键方面视为一场持续的注意力危机，在这场危机中，资本主义不断变化的结构不断将注意力和注意力转移到新的极限和门槛，新产品、刺激源和信息流层出不穷，然后用管理和调节感知的新方法做出回应[…]但与此同时，注意力作为一个历史问题，不能简化为社会纪律的策略。正如我将要说的，一个主体在专注能力方面的表达同时揭示了一个主体无法遵守这种纪律要求。"</p><p> Many of the lineaments of contemporary attention discourse are already evident in Crary’s description of its 19th century antecedents. 2</p><p>在克雷对19世纪先例的描述中，当代注意力话语的许多轮廓已经很明显。2.</p><p> 2. One reaction to learning that modern day attention discourse has longstanding antecedents would be to dismiss contemporary criticisms of the digital attention economy. The logic of such dismissals is not unlike that of the tale of Chicken Little. Someone is always proclaiming that the sky is falling, but the sky never falls. This is, in fact, a recurring trope in the wider public debate about technology. The seeming absurdity of some 19th-century pundit decrying the allegedly demoralizing consequences of the novel is somehow enough to ward off modern day critiques of emerging technologies. Interestingly, however, it’s often the case that the antecedents don’t take us back indefinitely into the human past. Rather, they often have a curiously consistent point of origin: somewhere in the mid- to late-nineteenth century. It’s almost as if some radical techno-economic re-ordering of society had occurred, generating for the first time a techno-social environment which was, in some respects at least, inhospitable to the embodied human person. That the consequences linger and remain largely unresolved, or that new and intensified iterations of the older disruptions yield similar expressions of distress should not be surprising.</p><p>2.了解到现代注意力话语有着悠久的历史渊源，人们的一种反应是否定当代对数字注意力经济的批评。这种解雇的逻辑与小鸡的故事没有什么不同。总有人说天要塌下来，但天永远不会塌下来。事实上，这是关于技术的更广泛的公共辩论中反复出现的比喻。一些19世纪的权威人士谴责这部小说所带来的据称令人泄气的后果，这种看似荒谬的做法，在某种程度上足以抵挡现代社会对新兴技术的批评。然而，有趣的是，通常情况下，前因不会无限期地把我们带回人类的过去。相反，它们往往有一个奇怪的始终如一的起源点：在19世纪中后期的某个地方。这几乎就好像发生了某种激进的技术经济社会重组，第一次产生了一种技术社会环境，至少在某些方面，这种环境对具体化的人来说是不友好的。后果挥之不去，在很大程度上仍未解决，或者旧的破坏的新的和强化的迭代产生了类似的痛苦表达，这并不令人惊讶。</p><p>  “Never has the individual been so completely delivered up to a blind collectivity, and never have men been less capable, not only of subordinating their actions to their thoughts, but even of thinking. Such terms as oppressors and oppressed, the idea of classes—all that sort of thing is near to losing all meaning, so obvious are the impotence and distress of all men in the face of the social machine, which has become a machine for breaking hearts and crushing spirits, a machine for manufacturing irresponsibility, stupidity, corruption, slackness and, above all, dizziness. The reason for this painful state of affairs is perfectly clear. We are living in a world in which nothing is made to man’s measure; there exists a monstrous discrepancy between man’s body, man’s mind and the things which at present time constitute the elements of human existence; everything is in disequilibrium […] This disequilibrium is essentially a matter of quantity. Quantity is changed into quality, as Hegel said, and in particular a mere difference in quantity is sufficient to change what is human in to what is inhuman. From the abstract point of view quantities are immaterial, since you can arbitrarily change the unit of measurement; but from the concrete point of view certain units of measurement are given and have hitherto remained invariable, such as the human body, human life, the year, the day, the average quickness of human thought. Present-day life is not organized on the scale of all these things; it has been transported into an altogether different order of magnitude, as though men were trying to raise it to the level of the forces outside of nature while neglecting to take his own nature into account.”</p><p>“个人从来没有像现在这样完全屈服于一个盲目的集体，人们从来没有像现在这样能力不足，不仅使他们的行为服从于他们的思想，甚至连思想也服从于他们。诸如压迫者、被压迫者、阶级的观念，诸如此类的东西几乎失去了所有的意义，如此明显的是无能和无知。”d.所有人在社会机器面前的痛苦，这台机器已经成为一台让人心碎、精神崩溃的机器，一台制造不负责任、愚蠢、腐败、懒惰，尤其是头晕的机器。造成这种痛苦状况的原因非常清楚。我们生活在一个世界里，没有任何东西是按人类的标准来衡量的；人的身体、人的思想和构成人类存在要素的事物之间存在着巨大的差异；一切都处于不平衡状态[…]这种不平衡本质上是数量问题。正如黑格尔所说，数量转化为质量，尤其是数量上的一个微小差异就足以将人类的本质转化为非人类的本质。从抽象的角度来看，数量是无关紧要的，因为你可以随意改变测量单位；但从具体的角度来看，某些度量单位是给定的，并且迄今为止一直保持不变，例如人体、人的生命、年、日、人类思维的平均速度。今天的生活并不是按照所有这些事情的规模来组织的；它被转移到一个完全不同的数量级，就好像人们试图把它提升到大自然之外的力量的水平，却忽略了考虑自己的本性。"</p><p> 4. Nicholas Carr began his 2008 article with a bit of self-disclosure, which I suspect now sounds pretty familiar to most of us if it didn’t already then. Here’s what he reported:</p><p>4.尼古拉斯·卡尔（Nicholas Carr）在2008年的文章一开始就透露了一点自我，我想现在对我们大多数人来说都很熟悉，如果不是那时的话。以下是他的报道：</p><p> Over the past few years I’ve had an uncomfortable sense that someone, or something, has been tinkering with my brain, remapping the neural circuitry, reprogramming the memory. My mind isn’t going—so far as I can tell—but it’s changing. I’m not thinking the way I used to think. I can feel it most strongly when I’m reading. Immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy. My mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument, and I’d spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose. That’s rarely the case anymore. Now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages. I get fidgety, lose the thread, begin looking for something else to do. I feel as if I’m always dragging my wayward brain back to the text. The deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle.</p><p>在过去的几年里，我有一种不舒服的感觉，有人或某事一直在修补我的大脑，重新映射神经回路，重新编程记忆。我的想法并没有走到我能说的那么远，但它正在改变。我不再像以前那样思考了。当我阅读时，我能感受到最强烈的感觉。过去，让自己沉浸在一本书或一篇长篇文章中很容易。我的思想会被叙述或争论的转折所吸引，我会花几个小时在冗长的散文中闲逛。这种情况很少再发生了。现在，我的注意力往往在两三页书后开始漂移。我变得烦躁不安，失去了线索，开始寻找其他事情做。我觉得好像我总是把我任性的大脑拖回文本。过去自然而然的深度阅读变成了一场斗争。</p><p> At the time, it certainly resonated with me, and what may be most worth noting about this today is that Carr, and those who are roughly his contemporaries in age, were in the position of living before  and after the rise of the commercial internet and thus had a point of experiential contrast to emerging digital culture.</p><p>当时，这肯定引起了我的共鸣，而今天最值得注意的可能是卡尔，以及那些大致与他同龄的人，在商业互联网兴起之前和之后都处于生活状态，因此与新兴的数字文化形成了经验对比。</p><p> 5. I thought of this paragraph recently while I was reading the transcript of Sean Illing’s  interview with Johann Hari about his new book,   Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention—And How to Think Deeply Again. Not long after reading the text of Illing’s interview, I also read the transcript of his conversation with Ezra Klein, which you can read or listen to  here. I’m taking these two conversations as an occasion to reflect again on attention, for it’s own sake but also as an indicator of larger patterns in our techno-social milieu. I’ll dip into both conversations to frame my own discussion, and, as you’ll see, my interest isn’t to criticize Hari’s argument but rather to pose some questions and take it as a point of departure.</p><p>5.最近，当我阅读肖恩·伊林（Sean Illing）就约翰·哈里（Johann Hari）的新书《偷来的焦点：为什么你不能集中注意力以及如何再次深入思考》接受采访时，我想到了这一段。在阅读了伊林的采访文本后不久，我还阅读了他与埃兹拉·克莱因的谈话记录，你可以在这里阅读或收听。我把这两次对话作为一个机会，再次反思关注，这本身就是为了关注，但同时也是我们技术社会环境中更大模式的一个指标。我将深入两次对话来构建我自己的讨论，正如你们所看到的，我的兴趣不是批评哈里的论点，而是提出一些问题，并将其作为出发点。</p><p> Hari, it turns out, is, like me, in his early-40s. So we, too, lived a substantial chunk of time in the pre-commercial internet era. And, like Carr, Hari opens his conversation with Illing by reporting on his own experience:</p><p>事实证明，哈里和我一样，40出头。因此，我们也生活在商业化之前的互联网时代。和卡尔一样，哈里通过讲述自己的经历，开始了与伊林的对话：</p><p> I noticed that with each year that passed, it felt like my own attention was getting worse. It felt like things that require a deep focus, like reading a book, or watching long films, were getting more and more like running up and down an escalator. I could do them, but they were getting harder and harder. And I felt like I could see this happening to most of the people I knew.</p><p>我注意到，随着时间的流逝，我感觉自己的注意力越来越差。感觉像是需要深度聚焦的事情，比如看书，或者看长篇电影，越来越像是在自动扶梯上跑来跑去。我可以做到，但他们越来越难了。我觉得我能看到这种事发生在我认识的大多数人身上。</p><p> But, as the title of his book suggests, Hari believes that this was not just something that has happened but something that was done to him. “We need to understand that our attention did not collapse,” he tells Illing, “our attention has been stolen from us by these very big forces. And that requires us to think very differently about our attention problems.”</p><p>但是，正如他的书名所示，哈里相信这不仅仅是发生了什么，而是对他做了什么。“我们需要明白，我们的注意力并没有崩溃，”他告诉伊林，“我们的注意力被这些巨大的力量从我们身上偷走了。这要求我们对注意力问题有非常不同的思考。”</p><p> Like many others before him, Hari argues that these “big forces” are the tech companies, who have designed their technologies with a view to capturing as much of our attention as possible. In his view, we live in a technological environment that is inhospitable to the cultivation of attentiveness. And, to be sure, I think this is basically right, as far as it goes. This is not a wholly novel development, as we noted at the outset, even if its scope and scale have expanded and intensified.</p><p>和他之前的许多人一样，哈里认为这些“大军”是科技公司，他们设计技术的目的是尽可能吸引我们的注意力。在他看来，我们生活在一个不适合培养注意力的技术环境中。当然，我认为这基本上是正确的。正如我们在一开始指出的那样，这并不是一个完全新颖的发展，即使其范围和规模已经扩大和加强。</p><p> 6. There’s another dimension to this that’s worth considering because it is often obscured by the way we tend to imagine attention and distraction as solitary or a-social phenomena. What we meet at the other end of our digital devices is not just a bit of information or an entertaining video clip or a popular game. Our devices do not only mediate information and entertainment, they mediate relationships.</p><p>6.这其中还有另一个方面值得考虑，因为我们往往把注意力和分心想象成孤独或社交现象，这一点往往被掩盖了。我们在数字设备的另一端遇到的不仅仅是一点信息、一段娱乐视频片段或一款流行游戏。我们的设备不仅能调节信息和娱乐，还能调节人际关系。</p><p> As Alan Jacobs put it writing in  “Habits of Mind in an Age of Distraction”:</p><p>正如艾伦·雅各布斯在《分心时代的思维习惯》中所说：</p><p> “[W]e are not addicted to any of our machines. Those are just contraptions made up of silicon chips, plastic, metal, glass. None of those, even when combined into complex and sometimes beautiful devices, are things that human beings can become addicted to […] there is a relationship between distraction and addiction, but we are not addicted to devices […] we are addicted to one another, to the affirmation of our value—our very being—that comes from other human beings. We are addicted to being validated by our peers.”</p><p>“[W]我们对我们的任何机器都不上瘾。这些只是由硅芯片、塑料、金属、玻璃组成的装置。这些东西，即使组合成复杂、有时漂亮的设备，也不是人类可以上瘾的东西[…]分心和上瘾之间有一定的关系，但我们并没有对设备上瘾[…]我们对彼此上瘾，对来自其他人的对我们自身价值的肯定。我们沉迷于被同龄人认可。"</p><p> This is part of what lends the whole business a tragic aspect. The problem of distraction can just as well be framed as a problem of loneliness. Sometimes we turn thoughtlessly to our devices for mere distraction, something to help us pass the time or break up the monotony of the day, although the heightened frequency with which we may do so may certainly suggests the signs of compulsive behavior. Perhaps it is the case in such moments that we do not want to be alone with our thoughts. But perhaps just as often we simply don’t want to be alone.</p><p>这是让整个企业陷入悲剧的一部分。分心的问题就像孤独的问题一样。有时，我们会不假思索地使用我们的设备来分散注意力，帮助我们打发时间或打破一天中的单调，尽管我们这样做的频率增加肯定表明了强迫行为的迹象。也许在这样的时刻，我们不想独自思考。但也许我们也常常不想独处。</p><p> We desire to be seen and acknowledged. To exercise meaningful degrees of agency and judgment. In short, to belong and to matter. Social media trades on these desires, exploits them, deforms them, and never truly satisfies them, which explains a good deal of the madness.</p><p>我们渴望被看到和认可。运用有意义的能动性和判断力。简言之，归属于物质。社交媒体利用这些欲望进行交易，剥削它们，使它们变形，但从来并没有真正满足它们，这就解释了很多疯狂。</p><p> 7. In her own thoughtful and moving  reflections on the ethical dimensions of attention, Jasmine Wang cited the following  observations from poet David Whyte:</p><p>7.在她自己对关注的伦理维度进行的深思熟虑和感人的思考中，王茉莉引用了诗人戴维·怀特的以下观察：</p><p> “[T]he ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self. The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.”</p><p>“[T]友谊的终极试金石不是进步，不是他人的进步，也不是自我的进步。最终的试金石是见证，是被某人看到的特权，也是被授予看到他人本质的同等特权，是与他们同行，相信他们，有时只是陪伴他们，无论时间多么短暂，独自完成一段不可能完成的旅程。"</p><p> 8. Perhaps the first modern theorist of distraction, 17th century polymath Blaise Pascal had a few things to say about diversions in his posthumously published  Pensées:</p><p>8.17世纪的博学者布莱斯·帕斯卡（Blaise Pascal）或许是第一位现代分心理论家，他在死后出版的笔录中对分心有几点看法：</p><p> “What people want is not the easy peaceful life that allows us to think of our unhappy condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the burdens of office, but the agitation that takes our mind off it and diverts us.”</p><p>“人们想要的不是让我们想到自己不幸处境、战争危险和职务负担的安逸平静的生活，而是让我们忘却并转移注意力的激动。”</p><p> “Nothing could be more wretched than to be intolerably depressed as soon as one is reduced to introspection with no means of diversion.”</p><p>“没有什么比一个人陷入内省而无法转移注意力时就陷入极度抑郁更悲惨的了。”</p><p> “The only thing that consoles us for our miseries is diversion. And yet it is the greatest of our miseries. For it is that above all which prevents us thinking about ourselves and leads us to destruction. But for that we should be bored, and boredom would drive us to seek some more solid means of escape, but diversion passes our time and brings us imperceptibly to our death.”</p><p>“对于我们的苦难，唯一能安慰我们的是消遣。然而，它是我们最大的苦难。因为最重要的是，它阻止我们思考自己，并导致我们走向毁灭。但为此，我们应该感到无聊，无聊会驱使我们寻找更可靠的逃避方式，但消遣会消磨我们的时间，并带给我们更多的快乐。”不知不觉地我们就死了。"</p><p> 9. Pascal reminds us of something we ought not to forget, which is that there may be technology-independent reasons for why we crave distractions. Weil had a characteristically religious and even mystical take on this. “There is something in our soul,” she wrote, “that loathes true attention much more violently than flesh loathes fatigue. That something is much closer to evil than flesh is. That is why, every time we truly give our attention, we destroy some evil in ourselves.”</p><p>9.帕斯卡提醒我们不应该忘记的一件事，那就是我们渴望分心的原因可能与技术无关。威尔对这一点有着独特的宗教甚至神秘的看法。她写道：“我们的灵魂中有一种东西，它厌恶真正的关注，而不是肉体厌恶疲劳。它比肉体更接近邪恶。这就是为什么每次我们真正给予关注时，我们都会摧毁自己的邪恶。”</p><p> We should not, in other words, imagine that the ability to focus intently or to give one’s sustained attention to some matter was the ordinary state of affairs before the arrival of digital technologies or even television beforehand. But this does not mean that new technologies are of no consequence. Quite the contrary. It is one thing to have a proclivity, it is another to have a proclivity and inhabit a material culture that is designed to exploit your proclivity, and in a manner that is contrary to your self-interest and well-being.</p><p>换言之，我们不应该想象，在数字技术甚至电视出现之前，专注或持续关注某件事的能力是正常的。但这并不意味着新技术无关紧要。恰恰相反。拥有一种癖好是一回事，拥有一种癖好并生活在一种物质文化中是另一回事，这种物质文化旨在利用你的癖好，并且以一种与你的私利和幸福背道而驰的方式。</p><p> 10. Human beings have, of course, always lived in information rich environments. Step into the woods, and you’re surrounded by information and stimuli. But the nature of the information matters. Modern technological environments present us with an abundance of symbolically encoded information, which is often designed with a view to hijacking or soliciting our attention. Which is to say that our media environments aggressively beckon us in a way that an oak tree does not. The difference might be worth contemplating.</p><p>10.当然，人类一直生活在信息丰富的环境中。走进树林，你会被信息和刺激所包围。但信息的性质很重要。现代技术环境为我们提供了大量象征性编码的信息，这些信息往往是为了劫持或引起我们的注意而设计的。也就是说，我们的媒体环境以一种橡树所没有的方式积极地吸引着我们。这种差异可能值得深思。</p><p> Natural, which is to say non-human environments, can suddenly demand our attention. At one point, Klein and Hari discuss a sudden thunder clap, which is one example of how this can happen. And I can remember once hearing the distinctive sound of a rattlesnake while hiking on a trail. In cases like these, the environment calls us decidedly to attention. It seems, though, that, ordinarily, non-human environments present themselves to us in a less demanding manner. They may beckon us, but they do not badger us or overwhelm our faculties in a manner that generates an experience of exhaustion or fatigue.</p><p>自然，也就是说非人类的环境，会突然引起我们的注意。克莱因和哈里曾一度讨论过一次突然的雷声，这是如何发生的一个例子。我还记得有一次在小径上徒步时听到响尾蛇独特的声音。在这种情况下，环境肯定会引起我们的注意。然而，通常情况下，非人类环境似乎以一种不那么苛刻的方式呈现给我们。它们可能会召唤我们，但它们不会以一种产生疲惫或疲劳的方式困扰我们或压倒我们的能力。</p><p> In a human-built environment rich with symbolically encoded information—a city block, for example, or a suburban strip mall—our attention is solicited in a more forceful manner. And the relevant technologies do not have to be very sophisticated to demand our attention in this way. Literate people are compelled to read texts when they appear before them. If you know how to read and an arrangement of letters appears before you, you can hardly help but read them if you notice them (and, of course, they can be designed so as to lure or assault your attention). By contrast, naturally encoded information, such as might be available to us when we attend to how a clump of trees has grown on a hillside or the shape a stream has cut in the landscape does not necessarily impress itself upon us as  significant in the literal sense of the word, as having meaning or indicating something to us. From this perspective, attention is bound up with forms of literacy. 3 I cannot be hailed by signs I cannot recognize as such, as meaning something to me. So then, we might say that our attention is more readily elicited by that which presents itself as being somehow “for me,” by that which, as Thomas de Zengotita has put it, flatters me by seeming to center the world on me.</p><p>在一个充满象征性编码信息的人造环境中——例如，一个城市街区，或者一个郊区的带状购物中心——我们的注意力以一种更有力的方式被吸引。相关技术不必非常复杂，就能以这种方式引起我们的注意。有文化的人出现在面前时，被迫阅读文本。如果你知道如何阅读，一系列字母出现在你面前，如果你注意到它们，你会情不自禁地阅读它们（当然，它们的设计可以吸引或攻击你的注意力）。相比之下，自然编码的信息，比如当我们注意到山坡上的一丛树是如何生长的，或者溪流在景观中切割的形状时，我们可能可以获得的信息，不一定会给我们留下深刻的印象，因为在这个词的字面意义上，它对我们来说是有意义的或指示的。从这个角度来看，注意力与识字形式有关。3.我不能被我无法识别的符号所称赞，因为这些符号对我来说有意义。因此，我们可以说，我们的注意力更容易被那些以某种方式呈现为“为我”的东西所吸引，正如托马斯·德·曾戈蒂塔所说，这些东西似乎把世界的中心放在了我身上，以此来讨好我。</p><p> If I may press into this distinction a bit further, the question of purpose or intent seems to matter a great deal, too. When I hike in the woods, there’s a relative parity between my capacity to direct my attention, on the one hand, and capacity of the world around me to suddenly demand it of me on the other. I am better able to direct my attention as I desire, and to direct it in accord with my purpose. I will seek out what I need to know based on what I have set out to do. If I know how to read the signs well, I will seek those features of the landscape that can help me navigate to my destination, for example. But in media-rich human-built environments, my capacity to direct my attention in keeping with my purposes is often at odds with features of the environment that want to command my attention in keeping with purposes that are not my own. It is the difference between feeling challenged to rise to an occasion that ultimately yields an experience of competence and satisfaction, and feeling assaulted by an environment explicitly designed to thwart and exploit me.</p><p>如果我可以进一步强调这一区别的话，目的或意图的问题似乎也很重要。当我在树林里徒步旅行时，一方面，我引导注意力的能力，另一方面，我周围的世界突然要求我集中注意力的能力，是相对均等的。我能更好地按照自己的意愿来引导我的注意力，并按照自己的目的来引导它。我会根据我的计划去寻找我需要知道的东西。例如，如果我知道如何很好地阅读这些标志，我会寻找那些能帮助我导航到目的地的景观特征。但在媒体丰富的人类构建的环境中，我根据自己的目的引导注意力的能力往往与环境的特征不一致，这些特征想要根据非我自己的目的吸引我的注意力。这是两种感觉之间的区别，一种是被挑战去应对一个最终产生能力和满足感的场合，另一种是被一个明确设计来阻挠和利用我的环境所攻击。</p><p> 11. Thomas de Zengotita, writing in  Mediated: How the Media Shapes Your World and the Way You Live In It (2005):</p><p>11.Thomas de Zengotita，在《媒介：媒体如何塑造你的世界和你在其中的生活方式》（2005年）中写道：</p><p> “Say your car breaks down in the middle of nowhere—the middle of Saskatchewan, say. You have no radio, no cell phone, nothing to read, no gear to fiddle with. You just have to wait. Pretty soon you notice how everything around you just happens to be there.

It isn’t arranged so that you can experience it, you didn’t plan to experience it, there isn’t any screen, there isn’t any display, there isn’t any entrance, no brochure, nothing special to look at, no dramatic scenery or wildlife, no tour guide, no campsites, no benches, no paths, no viewing platforms with natural-historical information posted under slanted Plexiglas lectern things—whatever is there is just there, and so are you […] So that’s a baseline for comparison. What it teaches us is this: in a mediated world, the opposite of real isn’t phony or illusional or fiction—it’s optional […] We are most free of mediation, we are most real, when we are at the disposal of accident and necessity. That’s when we are not being addressed. That’s when we go without the flattery intrinsic to representation.”</p><p>“说你的车在萨斯喀彻温省中部的某个地方坏了，”你说，你没有收音机，没有手机，没有东西可以阅读，没有东西可以摆弄。你只需要等待。很快你就会发现周围的一切都恰好在那里。而且它恰巧是在这个非常精确但不熟悉的方式下……这里的一切都不是为了影响你。它的安排不是为了让你体验它，你没有计划体验它，没有任何屏幕，没有任何展示，没有任何入口，没有宣传册，没有什么特别的东西可看，没有戏剧性的风景或野生动物，没有导游，没有露营地，没有长凳，没有小径，没有在倾斜的有机玻璃讲台下张贴自然历史信息的观景平台——不管那里有什么，你也是[…]所以这是比较的基准。它告诉我们的是：在一个被调停的世界里，真实的对立面不是虚假的、幻想的或虚构的，而是可选的[…]我们最不需要调停，我们最真实，当我们处于偶然和必然的支配之下。这就是我们没有被提及的时候。这就是我们不需要表达固有的奉承的时候。"</p><p> 12. It’s interesting to me that de Zengotita’s baseline scenario would not play out quite the same way in a pre-modern cultural setting. He is presuming that nature is mute, meaningless, and literally insignificant. But—anthropologists please correct me—this view would be at odds with most if not all traditional cultures. In the scenario de Zengotita describes, premodern people would not necessarily find themselves either alone or unaddressed, and I think this indirectly tells us something interesting about attention.</p><p>12.我很感兴趣的是，在前现代文化背景下，德·曾戈蒂塔的基准情景不会以完全相同的方式出现。他认为大自然是无声的、无意义的，而且毫无意义。但是人类学家请纠正我，这种观点与大多数传统文化（如果不是所有传统文化的话）是不一致的。在Zengotita描述的场景中，前现代人不一定会发现自己要么孤独，要么不被提及，我认为这间接地告诉了我们关于注意力的一些有趣的事情。</p><p> Attention discourse tends to treat attention chiefly as the power to focus mentally on a text or task, which is to say on what human beings do and what they make. Attention in this mode is directed toward what we intend to do. We might say that it is attention in the form of actively searching rather than receiving, and this makes sense if we don’t have an account of how attention as a form of openness might be rewarded by our experience in the world. Perhaps the point is that there’</p><p>注意力话语倾向于将注意力主要视为精神上关注文本或任务的能力，也就是说，关注人类做什么和他们做什么。这种模式下的注意力指向我们打算做的事情。我们可以说，这是一种以积极搜索而非接受的形式出现的注意力，如果我们不了解作为一种开放形式的注意力如何通过我们在世界上的经验得到回报，这是有道理的。也许关键是有</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/关注/">#关注</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/attending/">#attending</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/注意力/">#注意力</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
