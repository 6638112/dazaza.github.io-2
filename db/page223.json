"note_en": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - From the high balcony of a Singapore public housing block, an environment official steadies his mosquito launcher, the latest contraption authorities have devised to combat a record outbreak of the tropical disease dengue.\n  With the click of a button and a whirr of a fan, a hatch opens and 150 lab-reared male mosquitoes are sent flying, off in search of a female companion with whom they can mate but not reproduce.\n The dengue virus, which in rare cases can be fatal, is carried and spread to humans by infected mosquitoes.\n But Singapore\u2019s specially bred mosquitoes carry a bacteria that prevents eggs from hatching, and \u201ccompete with the wild type,\u201d leading to \u201ca gradual reduction of the mosquito population,\u201d said Ng Lee Ching, the official heading the Wolbachia project, named after the bacteria.\n  Some areas with high mosquito populations have seen up to 90% declines using this technique, she added.\n Singapore - a tiny Southeast Asian island nation of 5.7 million people - has recorded more than 26,000 dengue cases this year, surpassing the previous annual record of around 22,000 in 2013 with four months still remaining.\n Twenty people have died of the disease this year, which can cause extreme fever that leads to internal bleeding and shock. By comparison, only 27 people have died of the coronavirus in the city-state out of more than 56,000 infections.\n  A new strain of the disease, combined with unseasonably wet weather and coronavirus lockdowns that left construction sites and other mosquito breeding grounds undisturbed, are all seen as factors behind the dengue outbreak.\n That has put the onus on traditional deterrents like fogging, fining people for flouting anti-mosquito regulations like leaving plant pots full of stagnant water, and deploying novel techniques such as the Wolbachia project.\n In government laboratories, scientists breed the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes in rows of pallets - separating the male pupae for release in high-risk dengue areas.\n  For every person living in those areas, up to six Wolbachia mosquitoes are released each week, the environment agency said.\n Wolbachia mosquitoes can\u2019t transmit diseases such as dengue, and only female mosquitoes bite humans.\n When male Wolbachia mosquitoes mate with females that don\u2019t carry the bacteria, none of the resultant eggs will hatch.\n  The strategy has been successful in Australia but some experts say it might have its limits in dense urban areas such as Singapore.\n \u201cYou\u2019ve got to flood the island with these mosquitoes, and people get annoyed,\u201d said Paul Tambyah, senior consultant at Singapore\u2019s National University Hospital.\n \u201cThey\u2019re not going to grab the mosquito and examine and see whether it\u2019s a male or female. They\u2019re going to swipe them away, and that kind of defeats the purpose,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:39:26", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

In this first part, we will have a small introduction to security concepts and threat modeling and then focus on some mitigation techniques to improve the security of an embedded Linux device, including secure boot, code/data encryption and secure key storage.\n If you prefer a one hour talk instead of reading this article, you can also watch the webinar  \u201cIntroduction to embedded Linux security\u201d I recorded for  Toradex. I also gave the same talk at Embedded Linux Conference North America 2020, but as I write this article it was not yet published on YouTube.\n    On the one hand, we have  owners, those who benefit from a product or service (user, manufacturer, business owner, etc). And owners want to protect  assets, anything that has some value in the product or service (data, code, reputation, etc).\n On the other hand, we have  threat actors, a person or thing (malicious hacker, government, etc) that can manifest a  threat, anything that is capable of acting against an asset in a manner that can result in harm.\n To manifest a threat, the threat actor will explore  vulnerabilities (weakness in the system) via an  attack vector, a method or pathway used by the threat actor to access or penetrate the target system.\n   In the end, is a cat-and-mouse game between owners and threat actors. How far will the owner go to protect the assets? How far will the threat actor go to compromise the assets? It really depends on the value of the assets. Indeed, the perception of value may not be the same for owners and threat actors.\n Identifying assets (and their value) to mitigate the risks of being compromised can be done in a process called  threat modeling.\n  Threat modeling is a process where potential threats can be identified, enumerated, and mitigations can be prioritized. It is basically a risk assessment process where you evaluate the value of your assets and the cost to protect them. The result of a threat modeling is the  threat model of your product.\n  There are several techniques and methodologies that can help during threat modeling, including STRIDE, DREAD, VAST, OCTAVE, and many others.\n To have a very basic introduction to the topic, let\u2019s talk about STRIDE and DREAD.\n The  STRIDE model is a very useful tool to help classify threats. It was developed by Microsoft and the name is an acronym for the six main types of threats:  Spoofing,  Tampering,  Repudiation,  Information disclosure,  Denial of service and  Escalation of privileges. STRIDE can be used to identify all threats the assets of a system could be exposed to.\n  The  DREAD methodology is a tool for risk-assessing computer security threats. The name is an acronym for five categories of security threats:  Damage (how bad would an attack be),  Reproducibility (how easy is it to reproduce the attack),  Exploitability (how much work is it to launch the attack),  Affected users (how many people would be impacted) and  Discoverability (how easy is it to discover the threat).\n  While the STRIDE model helps to identify the threats, the DREAD methodology helps to rank them. For each threat in the system, you would go over each threat category and classify it in low (1 point), medium (2 points), or high (3 points). In the end, you would have a ranked list of threats and mitigation strategies. Example:\n  We can see that threat modeling will provide a very clear view of what we want to protect, how we plan to protect it, and associated costs. This is part of the  threat model of the product, which needs to be re-evaluated for every development cycle. As a result, the threat model will provide a prioritized list of threats to work on, so we can focus on implementing the mitigations to improve the security of the product.\n How to protect the integrity and authenticity of your code? How to ensure the privacy of the data? Where to store cryptographic keys? How to minimize the risks of an application to be exploited? Let\u2019s try to answer all of those questions and many more, starting with secure boot!\n  How to make sure the code you are running was built by a trustworthy person or company? Implementing a  secure boot process.\n The objective of a secure boot process is to protect the integrity and authenticity of the code.\n Secure boot is usually based on the verification of digital signatures. An embedded Linux system normally has three major components: bootloader, kernel and root filesystem (rootfs). All these components are signed and the signatures are checked during boot.\n For example, some hardware mechanism can be used to check the signature of the bootloader, that will check the signature of the kernel, that will use a ramdisk image to check the signature of the root filesystem. Since we have one component checking the signature of the next one in the boot chain, this process is often called a  chain-of-trust.\n  Let\u2019s take a look at a real example on an  NXP iMX6 device.\n Everything starts in the ROM code inside the SoC. On NXP iMX6, there is a hardware component called High Assurance Boot (HAB) that it is able to validate the signature of the first stage bootloader, making it possible to implement a secure boot process. The High Assurance Boot inside iMX6 devices can also be called the  Root of Trust, since if it is compromised, all the secure boot process is also compromised.\n The ROM code inside the iMX6 SoC, using the HAB component, will check the signature of the bootloader. For that, it is necessary to generate a pair of keys (public and private), sign the bootloader with the private key and store the public key inside the SoC. On iMX6, OTP fuses are used to store the keys. Actually, to make it less expensive, only the hash of the public key is stored in the SoC.\n When the bootloader boots (e.g.  U-Boot), it will have to check the signature of the Linux kernel. For that, it is common to use an image format called  FIT image. The FIT image is a container for multiple binaries with hashing and signature support, and usually contains the Linux kernel image, device tree files and an initial ramdisk. After generating a pair of keys, we need to sign the binaries inside the FIT image with the private key e configure U-Boot to use the public key to check the signature of the FIT image.\n After the kernel boots, it will run the  init program from the ramdisk image. The ramdisk will have the logic to verify the integrity of the final root filesystem before mounting it. There are some options to implement this. One common option is using the device-mapper verity ( dm-verity) kernel module. The  dm-verity kernel module provides integrity checking of block devices and requires a read-only rootfs (squashfs can be a good solution). Other approaches would be  IMA or  dm-integrity if you want a read-write root filesystem.\n   This is only one example of a secure boot implementation, although it could be applied to a different set of boards and ARM SoCs.\n  Secure boot vulnerabilities in the ROM code of several NXP devices (i.MX6, i.MX50, i.MX53, i.MX7, i.MX28 and Vybrid families) were  publicly disclosed on July 17th, 2017. And if your chain of trust is compromised, everything is compromised! So we need to be aware of these types of vulnerabilities (in this case, they were fixed with new silicon).\n While secure boot ensures authenticity and integrity, it does not protect the device from being counterfeited or threat actors from extracting code/data from the device. So if you want to protect your intellectual property or ensure data confidentiality, you will need to use encryption.\n   Data encryption is a common approach when you need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the users. Data is any information generated during the executing of the device, including databases, configuration files, and so on.\n Code encryption depends on the situation, and encrypting the full root filesystem is not that common. Usually, most of the components are free and open source software, so there is nothing to hide. There is also the issue of GPLv3 and Tivoization (using any GPLv3 software will force you to provide a mechanism for the user to update the software, and that would make it more difficult if you are encrypting it). A more common use case is to encrypt only the applications you developed for the device. It\u2019s usually where your intellectual property is.\n There are basically two main approaches to encryption in Linux:  full disk encryption and  file-based encryption.\n Full disk encryption provides encryption at the block level and the whole disk or a disk partition is encrypted. For that, we can use  dm-crypt, the Linux kernel\u2019s device mapper crypto target.\n File-based encryption provides encryption at the file system level, where each directory may be separately and optionally encrypted with a different key. The two most common implementations of file-based encryption are  fscrypt and  eCryptFS. fscrypt is an API available on some filesystems like EXT4, UBIFS and F2FS, and eCryptFS is a more generic solution implemented as a layer that stacks on top of an existing filesystem.\n   Since an asymmetric key algorithm is too slow to be used in encryption, usually a symmetric-key algorithm is used in encryption. That means the same key is used for encryption and decryption, and the key should be available somewhere in the filesystem so the encrypted code/data can be decrypted.\n But we can\u2019t just leave the key lying around in the filesystem, right?\n There are several cases where companies didn\u2019t care about this and have paid the price. For example, the image below is from the first Xbox video game console.  Andrew \u201cbunnie\u201d Huang, a security researcher, was able to develop a specialized FPGA hardware to sniff the communication bus and extract the encryption keys from the device. Only because the keys were there, traveling in clear text in the communication bus, without any protection (by the way, Andrew Huang is the author of a very good book on hardware hacking called \u201cHacking the Xbox\u201d that you can  download it for free on his website).\n  The conclusion is that the protection of the encrypted code/data is as secure as the protection of the key to decrypt it!\n   On a desktop or smartphone, the key used to encrypt the filesystem could be derived from a user password (passphrase) entered interactively. That\u2019s how it works on Android smartphones for example.\n On an embedded system, usually we don\u2019t have user interaction to derive the key from a password every time we boot the device. So the key should be stored encrypted in the filesystem or in secure storage. And we need hardware support for that.\n For example, NXP i.MX processors have a unique master key (pre-programmed by NXP) that can only be accessed by a special hardware module called  CAAM (Cryptographic Accelerator and Assurance Module). This hardware device could be used to encrypt the key and store it in the filesystem (this would have to be done during manufacturing). And during boot, the CAMM module would be used to decrypt the key and restore the plain key that would be used to decrypt the filesystem. Since the key inside the CAAM module is not accessible, the encrypted key is protected.\n If you don\u2019t have security features available in the processor, you could achieve the same results with an external hardware like a  Secure Element or a  TPM device. These external devices usually provide secure storage, so they could be used to store a master key that could be used to encrypt/decrypt the filesystem encryption key. These devices also offer a lot of security features like random number generation, hash calculation, crypto and signing functions, etc.\n A Secure Element is a secure computing system. It is basically secure storage with its own secure applications (usually implemented using Java Card, but not necessary). What a secure element does is very open and depends on the implementation, but most of them implement the Public-Key Cryptography Standard 11 ( PKCS#11). Examples of Secure Elements are smart-cards and SIM-cards.\n A  TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is a specification and an international standard (ISO/IEC 11889). TPM is not a Secure Element, although it could be implemented inside one. It can be implemented in hardware or software, but most implementations are in hardware. It provides a set of limited security features defined by the standard, including secure storage and cryptographic functions.\n A third alternative for secure storage would be using a  Trusted Execution Environment. A TEE is an environment where the code executed and the data accessed is isolated and protected in terms of confidentiality (no one has access to the data) and integrity (no one can change the code and its behavior). A lot of devices around us make use of a Trusted Execution Environment, including smartphones, set-top-boxes, videogame consoles and Smart TVs. If you want more details about how a TEE works you can read my article \u201c Introduction to Trusted Execution Environment and ARM\u2019s TrustZone\u201d.\n In the end, if you care about encryption in your embedded Linux device, you will have to think about key storage and management from the beginning of the project.\n  So far we have talked about secure boot and encryption to improve the security of an embedded Linux device. But that is not enough. We should always think about security in layers, where each layer applies a mitigation technique that builds on top of other layers to improve the security of the device. And combining multiple mitigation techniques makes it harder for an attacker to compromise the device.\n Think about it. You can protect your code and data with secure boot and encryption, but if you are running an application with bugs that could be exploited, your assets are still at risk. If an application has attack vectors (user input, configuration files, network communications, etc), a bug could be used to exploit the application. Especially in programs written in memory unsafe languages like C and C++, where bugs like buffer overflows could be used in attacks like stack smashing and format strings.\n So there are more mitigation techniques to come. In the  second part of this article, we will cover secure coding, static analysis tools, runtime protections, fuzzing tools, permissions and capabilities, Mandatory Access Control, application sandboxing, and many more!\n    About the author: Sergio Prado has been working with embedded systems for more than 20 years.

"note_en": "Artificial neural networks and deep learning have taken center stage as the tools of choice for many contemporary machine learning practitioners and researchers. But there are many cases where you need something more powerful than basic statistical analysis, yet not as complex or compute-intensive as a deep neural network. History provides us with many approaches dating to the Multilayer Perceptron era. Yet many of these alternate methods languish in the shadows despite modern advances in enabling technologies. One such approach is called the  associative memory.\n  Associative memories (AM) are pattern storage and retrieval systems inspired by the psychological concept of the same name. As demonstrated by key findings in learning and memory research, a given stimulus (object, shape, word) is stored as a memory in the brain, and is associated with related stimuli. When we experience stimuli that triggers an AM, we can recall memories associated with those inputs. Have you ever smelled and/or tasted a dish and recalled strong memories of other places and times? How about listening to an old song and remembering what you were doing when you first heard it? You hear the phrase, \u201cOne small step for man\u2026\u201d, and you can recall the rest of the quote. These are all examples of AM.\n When applied to Computer Science problems, associative memories come in two high-level forms:  autoassociative and  heteroassociative memories. While both are able to recall patterns given a set of inputs, autoassociative memories are primarily focused on recalling a pattern X when provided a partial or noisy variant of X. By contrast, heteroassociative memories are able to recall not only patterns of different sizes from their inputs, but can be leveraged to map concepts between categories (hence \u201cheteroassociative\u201d). One common example from the literature is a heteroassociative memory that might recall the embedded animal concept of \u201cmonkey\u201d given the embedded food concept of \u201cbanana&#34;. Since all forms of AM are focused on the actual content being stored and retrieved, they are also commonly referred to as  content-addressable memories (CAM) in the literature.\n  While there have been many implementations, expansions, and improvements to the original AM systems, there are common features that current AMs also incorporate. Similar to artificial neural networks (ANNs), AMs include the representation of a neuron. Unlike a contemporary ANN, however, an AM neuron encompasses a kernel function that is usually not required to be differentiable, as most AM algorithms do not have a backpropagation step (although as we\u2019ll see later, Kosko\u2019s BAM may be an exception). Instead,  AMs rely on weights that get updated during forward training passes through the neurons, often implementing a Hebbian style of learning. This allows some implementations to achieve one-shot or few-shot learning over relatively simple domains (Acevedo-Mosqueda, 2013). In contrast, most deep learning approaches are tuned using some combination of educated guesses, grid searches through hyperparameters, and practitioners\u2019 intuition with no theoretical upper limit on training effort or network capacity. This often requires significant compute resources and time to fully explore. To be fair, auto-ML approaches are tackling this, but they take time and resources to train.\n An interesting feature of several modern AM systems is the ability to \u201cforget\u201d older patterns with hyperparameter tuning. It follows that these systems are fully updateable as new training data is made available. This can become an important design consideration, as there are theoretical limits on the number of patterns any given AM can learn with high precision and recall. This is often a function of the number of neurons in the model (Hopfield, 1982; Chou, 1988; Acevedo-Mosqueda, 2013; Ritter &amp; Sussner, 1998). Some herteroassociative memories also allow for relatively simple reverse traversal. Using the example above, you could train an AM to take \u201cbanana\u201d as an input and return \u201cmonkey\u201d, yet querying the AM in reverse with the concept of \u201cmonkey\u201d results in one or more food concepts related to monkeys (e.g. \u201cbanana\u201d) (Kosko, 1988). Other examples show how AMs can be optimized for temporal inference; provided a series of input patterns they are able to predict the following one or more patterns.\n  In computer science, associative memories were first proposed by Karl Steinbuch (1961) in the form of the  Lernmatrix. It would take several years before other researchers took up the concept and expanded on it (Willshaw et al, 1969; Kohonen, 1974), but the major breakthrough came with the introduction of both the discrete Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982) and the expanded continuous variant (Hopfield, 1984). Subsequent research on Hopfield networks, in combination with the Multilayer Perceptron, laid the groundwork for most supervised machine learning research today. Below we explore a few of the highest-impact AM models and how they affected the state of the art.\n  The Lernmatrix as described by Karl Steinbuch (Steinbuch, 1961) was a hardware AM proposal using ferromagnetic circuitry and overlapping connectors to provide a crude heteroassociative memory between inputs and a classification pattern. It laid out the concepts of using a matrix of weighted \u201cvalues\u201d with some set update weight to strengthen the connections between associated bits in the input and classification patterns. This approach laid the groundwork for future hardware and software AM architectures.\n  It does appear the Lernmatrix had a more immediate impact on hardware as patents referencing \u201cassociative memories\u201d began to surface at about the same time, and have been the subject of continued interest in the context of modern systems. There has even been an attempt to develop a theoretical framework for the Lernmatrix as a basis for expanding the original architecture (S\u00e1nchez-Garfias, 2005).\n   Where Steinbuch was focused on persistent hardware memories and analog representations, D. J. Willshaw attempted to take known holographic pattern storage and retrieval theories of the time and expand the approach proposed in the Lernmatrix with holographic concepts. Wilshaw\u2019s (1969) contribution became known as the  correlograph or  correlogram. The correlograph can be used to describe a simplistic neural network model that he referred to as an  associative net. The Wilshaw model was the first to propose a quantitative approach to associative memory, emphasizing neuronal activation from paired stimuli and based on the McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron model (McCulloch &amp; Pitts, 1943). Wilshaw\u2019s approach also proposed a theoretical upper limit for useful capacity and an approach that was resistant to noise in inputs.\n     While the Correlograph was a large step towards more efficient software implementations of the Lernmatrix, probably one of the most influential milestones in AM research was the advent of the Hopfield network (Hopfield, 1982). The original Hopfield network was a stochastic model that could learn discrete patterns by utilizing the memory capacity of Ising spin glasses (Ising, 1925; Wikipedia - Ising model, 2020) and energy flows mediated via the model weights. The Ising model was meant to move away from a purely \u201cwire and fire\u201d mechanism. A physical model based on energetics might allow us to \u00a0take into account latencies and pattern reinforcement. The original Hopfield network also proposed an asynchronous update approach as opposed to a purely synchronous one, more closely mimicking biological neural activity. That being said, Hopfield himself suggested this was not particularly practical due to the compute limitations of the time. Hopfield also proposed a theoretical upper limit for non-degraded pattern storage and recall in his network is 0.15N where N is the number of neurons in the network. For example, if you wanted to store 15 patterns in a Hopfield network with acceptable degradation and strong resistance to noise, you would need at least 100 neurons. He also proposed a reasonable convergence iteration limit based on the stochastic update rate W { W | 0.0 \u2264 W &lt; 1.0}, which can achieve memory stability after ~4/W iterations through the entire pattern set.\n In 1984, Hopfield proposed a continuous, deterministic version of the 1982 model that did away with the MCP neuron and used a new neuron similar to a Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1957). This approach proved to be even more resilient to errors and supported continuous (as opposed to discrete) inputs, weights, and outputs. Most contemporary AM approaches are based at least in part on this variant of the Hopfield network. We also see its influence in modern ANNs with discrete or continuous inputs, weights, and outputs; Perceptron-inspired neurons; as well as energy-based optimization approaches like simulated annealing and gradient descent.\n   Most AM research following Hopfield\u2019s seminal works focused on either autoassociative or heteroassociative unidirectional approaches. When presented with a pattern pair (A, B), such networks can only be trained in one direction to produce B if A is provided as an input. Kosko introduced the bidirectional associative memory (BAM) which allowed learning of not only the A\u2192B association, but also the B\u2192A association (Kosko, 1988). This was achieved by transforming the conventional discrete binary value set {0, 1} to a bipolar form {-1, 1}, calculating a correlation matrix, and updating the AM weight matrix M with the correlation matrix. The result was an AM that could produce B when given A in the \u201cforward\u201d direction but could leverage the transpose of the weight matrix to also produce A when given B in a \u201cbackward\u201d pass.\n The BAM approach supports continuous inputs as long as the values can be transformed via a monotonic function whose derivative always yields a value \u2267 0. Another interesting feature of the BAM is the ability to forget pairs with a simple update to the weight matrix. Temporal patterns are also supported in both directions, so training a BAM with A1\u2192A2\u2192A3 (essentially A1\u2192A2, A2\u2192A3) can be traversed in reverse as A3\u2192A2\u2192A1. Due to the flexibility and rapid training allowed by the BAM model, it has been used as the base for many heteroassociative approaches since its inception. Conceptually, the use of forward and backward passes to reinforce the association between a pair of patterns is not dissimilar to modern BiLSTM and backpropagation approaches used in recurrent deep learning models.\n  At the same time Kosko was developing the BAM to address the unidirectional shortcomings of Hopfield-based AMs, Kanerva was working towards addressing the capacity issues. Hopfield network sizes (the number of neurons) are typically limited by the input and output vector sizes. For example, if input pattern A is always 10 bits, and output pattern B is always 10 bits, then the maximum number of neurons in a Hopfield network is 10 x 10 = 100 neurons (N). With a capacity of 0.15N, this means the network can only hold up to 0.15 x 100 \u2248 15 patterns before degradation becomes an issue. Kanerva (1988) proposed a mechanism by which the capacity of a Hopfield network could be scaled without severe performance degradation, independent of its stored pattern sizes. Kanerva named this approach Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM).\n The premise for the SDM is that given a large enough virtual address space, the effective memory capacity can be increased. This increase in capacity corresponds to decreased collisions within a Hopfield network, while the virtual address space is mapped to a smaller physical address space via Hamming distance spheres. Shortly after Kanerva\u2019s publication, Chou (1988) produced an exhaustive proof of the theoretical capacities and limitations of the Kanerva SDM. While framed as an artificial neural network, the incremental contributions over Hopfield do not constitute a trainable network. Rather, the Kanerva SDM is more a preprocessing function for the patterns to be stored and retrieved within the embedded Hopfield component (Keeler, 1986).\n Several variants of the SDM approach appeared shortly after; some were independently discovered during the same timeframe, and others built on Kanerva\u2019s work (1992):\n    So far most of the AM models we\u2019ve explored have been based on some form of linear-linear or linear-nonlinear transformation. They use either the MCP or Perceptron neuron approach. Recognizing that there are limitations to these neuron-based models, Ritter and Sussner (1998) proposed morphological neural networks, and specifically a morphological autoassociative memory to address capacity and recall shortcomings of the traditional Hopfield network and its variants. Morphological approaches involve two correlation matrices and a nonlinear-nonlinear transformation based on lattice algebra. One matrix is constructed using a maximizing transform, the other matrix a minimizing transform. This is not unlike min-max pooling in some deep learning approaches. Taken together, this pair of matrices provided erosion and dilation resistance to the memories as well as unlimited pattern storage and recall provided exact inputs. Recall that Hopfield networks have a theoretical maximum capacity of 0.15N under the same conditions. Another benefit of the morphological AM is one-shot learning, which does not require multiple iterations of training for convergence as in a Hopfield network. Unlike many prior AM approaches, training can be carried out in parallel.\n    Many of the groundbreaking milestones discussed so far were published prior to the year 2000, which is around the time the conventional feed-forward multilayer perceptron with backpropagation took root as the de facto statistical ML approach by researchers. That being said, there have been pockets of active research where AMs have continued to have a strong following. Many of these are in image recognition and high-performance pattern matching systems.\n  One intriguing offshoot of AM research was initially proposed by Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-M\u00e1rquez (2002) in his Ph.D. thesis, dubbed the Alpha-Beta Associative Memory. Due to the unavailability of a public copy of his thesis in English, the earliest available publication regarding the original Alpha-Beta AM provides the basis for this discussion (Y\u00e1\u00f1ez-M\u00e1rquez et al, 2018). While the Alpha-Beta AM was based on the morphological AM proposed by Ritter &amp; Sussner, it augments the nonlinear min-max operations to additionally preprocess the X and Y patterns through so-called \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd operations prior to the min-max operations.\n  Rules for updating the pair of matrices were also updated to support the new \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd operations where the \ud835\udefc operation was used during the learning phase, and the \ud835\udefd operation was used during recall. By utilizing constrained sets of possible values for the \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd operations, the dual-matrix model could be tuned for higher capacity and one-shot learning, and in theory, improved pattern matching in the presence of noise (both additive and subtractive) over the original morphological AM. The Alpha-Beta AM and its variants have been successfully used in image processing, color matching, pollutant detection, bioinformatics, software engineering, and medical support systems, resulting in over 100 publications from 2006-2017; according to the authors, the model had a long roadmap ahead of it as of 2018. Unfortunately, the research team\u2019s website as reported in the 2018 publication is not currently available, so the status of the group\u2019s research activities is unknown at present.\n  Another intriguing offshoot of AM research involves scaling via so-called distributed associative memories. There is mention in the literature dating back to the early 1990s regarding a form of distributed AM for database resilience, but almost all of those approaches involved strategies to distribute the AM storage throughout local memory or persistent storage in a way that was resistant to faulty hardware, including Kanerva\u2019s SDM. In his Ph.D. thesis, Sterne proposed a distributed AM strategy based on a combination of modified Bloom filter, Hopfield network, and error correction algorithms that could in theory be distributed across a network and supported massively parallel training and recall (2011). While Sterne was proposing this as a computational analogue of basic biological neural systems, there has been some follow-on research in this vein that expanded on his variant of the Bloom filter as well as constructing larger AM-like networks.\n  In recent years, deep learning practitioners have come to realize that sometimes hybrid solutions yield faster learning and better results. One example is the deep belief network, which has a deep-learning front-end and the final layers are treated as an associative memory (Hinton, 2009). This model has been used on audio and NLP solutions with great success (Sarikaya et al, 2014; Mohamed et al, 2012; Mohamed et al, 2011). More recently, a deep dive into the BERT language model, transformer architecture, and related attention mechanisms uncovered an implicit, embedded Hopfield-type network in what many consider a SOTA deep learning architecture (Ramsauer et al, 2020). Further experiments proved the usefulness of Hopfield networks when blended into certain types of deep learning architectures; a PyTorch layer implementation was recently released as a result of this research (Ml-jku/hopfield-layers, 2020).\n  Many companies don\u2019t divulge their \u201csecret sauce\u201d when it comes to machine learning or AI unless it\u2019s the new hotness. As a result, documented use cases of AMs outside of academia or R&amp;D are few and far between. Two companies that have openly documented use of AM approaches in recent years are Saffron Technology and Veloxiti.\n Saffron Technology was founded in 1999 by Dr. Manuel Aparicio, an AM evangelist and researcher. The company developed AM approaches to build non-deep-learning systems to compete directly against IBM Watson and Grok. Their systems were also used in DARPA projects to construct knowledge bases for the intelligence community. Saffron was purchased by Intel in 2015, but quietly shuttered in late 2018 (Wikipedia - Saffron Technology, 2020). It is unknown whether Saffron\u2019s software is still in use by Intel. Apart from the above-referenced Wikipedia article and a handful of patent filings, there is no publicly available material regarding the details of Saffron\u2019s systems.\n Veloxiti was founded in 1987 based on knowledge-based AI (KBAI) approaches, specifically leveraging the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop to automate challenges in well-defined domains. Around 2010 the company developed a proprietary AM classification system based on sparse compressed matrices that implemented the following unique features:\n Feature engineering for complex data types like streaming real-time sensor signals and unstructured textual data\n Veloxiti\u2019s AM system was applied to petroleum production systems for real-time anomaly detection and classification of well conditions (Stephenson, 2010). It has also been embedded within OODA loops to provide explainable ML classifications at key decision nodes in a system, as well as a standalone classifier in systems with few-sample or one-shot requirements. (In full disclosure, I am employed by Veloxiti and leverage their AM system to address various ML challenges, often where datasets are too small for contemporary ML approaches to be effective.)\n  Through our exploration of the history, current state, and future directions of associative memories, I hope you have a new appreciation for the richness of the field, and the applicability not only to software but also hardware for a wide variety of applications. When tackling a new challenge, many machine learning practitioners tend to work their way up from basic statistical methods to advanced ones, maybe dabble a bit in optimization approa\n......",

Far more about this period in his life can be learned from Clark\u2019s book. After his first year, Haldane gained a First in maths. He also became a published co-author, having contributed some mathematical analysis to a paper he and his father wrote for the  Journal of Physiology. He was much happier at Oxford than at Eton and made several good friends, including Aldous Huxley and Dick Mitchison, who was to marry Jack\u2019s younger sister, Naomi. (She went on to publish more than 90 books, including works of historical fiction and fantasy, and became as well known as her celebrated brother.) For his second year, Haldane switched from mathematics to Greats. This might seem an odd thing to do, but, as Clark says, \u201cthe companionship of the classics was to be a solace in an otherwise aesthetically bleak life\u201d. It also taught him \u201cto write clearly, comprehensibly and with an economy that was to serve him well\u201d. The plan was to switch to physiology after Greats, but when, on 4 August 1914, Haldane learned he had graduated with a First, the news was, as he later put it, \u201csomewhat overshadowed by other events\u201d. Haldane, who had been an enthusiastic member of the Officers\u2019 Training Corps at Oxford, volunteered for the army as soon as war was declared, asking to serve with the Scottish regiment, the Black Watch. His wish was granted and, after four months of training, he was posted to France as a lieutenant with the regiment\u2019s First Battalion. He was made the battalion\u2019s trench mortar officer, leading small groups of men to throw hand-bombs into enemy trenches. Though it was dangerous and frightening, he had never been happier. He had always enjoyed explosions, and now he discovered that he found coming under fire and attacking others thrilling. \u201cI was well aware,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cthat I might die in these flat, featureless fields, and that a huge waste of human values was going on there. Nevertheless, I found the experience enjoyable.\u201d He was popular with the men and with his superior officers. General Haig, no less, described him as \u201cthe bravest and dirtiest officer in my army\u201d. [see also:\u00a0 Hermione Lee on how to write a life] From the Western Front, Haldane kept up a correspondence with Naomi about experiments they were conducting together on the genetics of mice. The result was a jointly authored paper that appeared in the  Journal of Genetics, making him, he boasted, \u201cthe only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward position of the Black Watch\u201d. After being injured by artillery fire, Haldane was sent back to Scotland, where he set up a Bombing School to teach Black Watch soldiers how to use grenades. In the autumn of 1916, he was sent to Mesopotamia. There he was wounded by a British bomb, keeping him out of active service for the rest of the war. He spent the last two years of it in India, where he was sent to recuperate. By the time he returned home, he had acquired a deep and abiding love of the country, its people and its culture. Before the end of the war, Haldane had been offered a fellowship at New College, Oxford, which he took up in 1919. There he lectured on physiology, which he had never formally studied himself. Four years later he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, as reader in biochemistry. In that position he published important work on enzymes, but his research became increasingly focused on using mathematics to address problems in theoretical genetics. The results of this research are contained in a series of ten papers, \u201cMathematical Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection\u201d, which he published between 1924 and 1934 and which many scientists regard as his most important work. It was in these papers that he provided his solution to the problem of how to incorporate Mendelian genetics into Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution. Gregor Mendel, now recognised as the founder of the science of genetics, died in 1884 in relative obscurity. Only in the 20th century was the importance of his investigations of the rules of heredity acknowledged. In 1886, he published the results of his painstaking observations on the inherited characteristics of pea plants of various heights, pod shapes, seed colours, etc. He discovered that if you cross breed, say, a yellow pea plant with a green one, then the resulting plants will all be yellow. However, in the next generation, there will be a mixture of three yellow plants to every green one. This gave rise to the theory of \u201crecessive\u201d and \u201cdominant\u201d traits, familiar now to every school student of biology. The problem Haldane tackled was how to incorporate this theory into Darwin\u2019s theory of natural selection. What he provided was a piece of mathematics that modelled Mendel\u2019s laws of heredity and the Darwinian notion of \u201cthe survival of the fittest\u201d. The biologist Julian Huxley (brother of Aldous and friend of Haldane) named this solution \u201cthe modern synthesis\u201d. **** During this period, Haldane began his career as a populariser of science. His slim book,  Daedalus, or Science and the Future, was published in 1924 and was a huge success, going through five impressions in its first year. Among its most enthusiastic readers was a young married woman called Charlotte Burghes, who was writing a novel set in a world in which the human race would be able to choose the sex of its children. She wanted to meet Haldane to discuss whether the science in her novel was plausible. Receiving no reply to a letter she sent, she went straight to Trinity to interview him. Within a year, she divorced her husband and married Haldane. So began a new era in Haldane\u2019s life in which politics played an increasingly important part. His and Charlotte\u2019s home became a meeting place for liberal and socialist students and staff, and, encouraged by Charlotte, Haldane became increasingly left wing. In 1928, they visited the Soviet Union, where Haldane became friends with Nikolai Vavilov, later one of Lysenko\u2019s victims. On his return, Haldane spoke with great warmth about the USSR, though he did not join the Communist Party until 1942. In 1933, Haldane moved from Cambridge to University College London to become its professor of genetics (later professor of biometry). In the same year, Hitler became chancellor of Germany. \u201cI began to realise,\u201d Haldane later wrote, \u201cthat even if professors leave politics alone, politics won\u2019t leave professors alone.\u201d As the 1930s wore on, he was pushed further into politics and yet further to the left. During the Spanish Civil War, he advised the republicans on precautions against gas attack and visited the front as an observer, seeing for himself the devastating effects of air raids. In 1937, he became the science correspondent of the  Daily Worker. Between then and 1950 he contributed nearly 350 articles, mixing scientific popularisation with propaganda. Subramanian is evidently very interested in Haldane\u2019s politics, but he does not quite succeed in making sense of them. Perhaps no sense can be made of them. Perhaps it will forever remain a mystery why someone as intelligent and critical as Haldane would declare allegiance to the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, even after the purges, the show trials, the non-aggression pact with the Nazis, the attacks on scientists and the repression of freedom. We should, however, bear in mind that he was only a member of the party for eight years. He was not, as is often said, an apologist for Lysenko. On the contrary, the Lysenko affair clearly shook him. Largely because of it, he distanced himself from communism after 1948 and left the party altogether in 1950. He remained fiercely left wing, however, and in 1956 he announced publicly that, together with his second wife Helen, he was leaving Britain for India because of the Suez Crisis. This was not the real reason. Neither was it true, as he said later, that he was settling in India in order to be free of the tyranny of wearing socks (\u201c60 years in socks is enough\u201d). He was drawn to India because of its socialism, its culture and its climate. He died there in 1964 of a cancer that he immortalised in a poem entitled \u201cCancer\u2019s a Funny Thing\u201d which Subramanian reproduces in full, beginning: \u201cI wish I had the voice of Homer/To sing of rectal carcinoma.\u201d For all its faults, Subramanian\u2019s biography does allow Haldane\u2019s booming voice to be heard, and, for all Haldane\u2019s faults, it remains a voice worth listening to.\u00a0 A Dominant Character: The Radical Science and Restless Politics of JBS Haldane  \tSamanth Subramanian   Atlantic, 400pp, \u00a320", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:37:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "jbs,haldane,\u9057\u4f20\u5b66", "title": "JBS\u970d\u5c14\u4e39\uff1a\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6240\u4e0d\u77e5\u7684\u4eba", "title_en": "JBS Haldane: the man who knew almost everything", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2020/11/jbs-haldane-man-who-knew-almost-everything", "via": "", "real_tags": ["jbs", "haldane", "\u9057\u4f20\u5b66"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1033767, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ece\u547d\u4ee4\u884c\u4f7f\u7528Perl\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u6307\u5357", "note_en": "Example based guide for text processing with Perl from the command line", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:37:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "liners", "title": "Perl One-liners Cookbook", "title_en": "Perl One-Liners Cookbook", "transed": 1, "url": "https://learnbyexample.github.io/learn_perl_oneliners/one-liner-introduction.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["liners"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b62c33571d3f0fb647d147f65b7c65c7.gif", "infoid": 1033765, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0a\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u665a2\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002\n\u57282020\u5e74\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u75ab\u60c5\u7206\u53d1\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5173\u95ed\u6216\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6559\u5b66\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u6709\u5173\u7684\u5b66\u6821\u505c\u8bfe\u5bf9\u5178\u578b\u53d1\u80b2\u671f\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7761\u7720\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e8e2020\u5e744\u670828\u65e5\u81f36\u67083\u65e5\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5bf945\u540d\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7535\u8bdd\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\n\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u75ab\u60c5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u6821\u505c\u8bfe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u201c\u81ea\u7136\u5b9e\u9a8c\u201d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5178\u578b\u53d1\u80b2\u4e2d\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u4e862\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u957f\uff0c\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u767d\u5929\u56f0\u5026\u7a0b\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\n\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdf\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5f00\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5ef6\u957f\u7761\u7720\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u7761\u7720\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u767d\u5929\u56f0\u5026\u3001\u51cf\u8f7b\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u5b66\u5e74\u538b\u529b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u56fd\u5bb6\u90fd\u5728\u60f3\u65b9\u8bbe\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5b66\u6821\u91cc\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c31\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u4e86\uff0c\u800c\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7761\u7720\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u62c5\u5f97\u8d77\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4e0e\u5e74\u9f84\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u8fdf\u5f00\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\u6765\u9519\u5f00\u5165\u5b66\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u5b66\u7684\u603b\u4eba\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u6821\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u5728\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u9752\u5c11\u5e74\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5065\u5eb7\u3002\n\u89c6\u56fe\u6458\u8981", "note_en": "Adolescents&#39; sleep schedule during the pandemic was 2\u00a0h later than during regular school times.\n During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, high schools closed or transitioned to remote teaching. The aim of this study was to describe how the COVID-19 related school shutdown impacted the sleep behaviors of typically developing adolescents.\n A qualitative study was conducted between April 28 and June 3, 2020 with 45 adolescents using one-on-one semi-structured phone interviews.\n The \u201cnatural experiment\u201d caused by the shutdown of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a 2-h shift in the sleep of typically developing adolescents, longer sleep duration, improved sleep quality, and less daytime sleepiness compared to those experienced under the regular school-time schedule.\n These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that delaying high school start times could be an effective way to extend sleep duration, improve sleep quality, reduce daytime sleepiness and lower adolescents&#39; stress during the school year. As many countries look for ways to reduce the number of interactions between students in schools so that physical distancing is feasible, following teens\u2019 delayed sleep biology could offer an affordable solution. For example, staggering arrival times by delaying school start time for older adolescents compared with younger adolescents can reduce the total number of students attending school at the same time. This strategy offers a practical means to reduce school density and the number of interactions between students which are needed to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 in schools, while improving adolescents sleep health.\n      View Abstract", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:37:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Modern marketing is all about data and however hard you might try, you can&#39;t spend any time around marketers online without  being  subjected  to  endless  think  pieces, how-to guides, ebooks or other dreck about how we need to track and measure and count every little thing.\n We&#39;ve got click rates, impressions, conversion rates, open rates, ROAS, pageviews, bounces rates, ROI, CPM, CPC, impression share, average position, sessions, channels, landing pages, KPI after never ending KPI.\n That&#39;d be fine if all this shit meant something and we knew how to interpret it. But  it doesn&#39;t and  we don&#39;t.\n The reality is much simpler, and therefore much more complex. Most of us don&#39;t understand how data is collected, how these mechanisms work and most importantly where and how they  don&#39;t work.\n 36% percent of people in the UK use an adblocker, which means your javascript based website tracking is meaningless\n Email open rates  don&#39;t  actually indicate that an email was opened, merely that a request was made to a server\n The black boxes inside Facebook and other ad exchanges give you  flat out wrong data about how your ads are performing\n And even if we know how the data is collected, what it means and what it&#39;s actually tracking, most of us don&#39;t have the technical chops to analyse the data we&#39;ve collected  1. I don&#39;t mean to rag on anyone by saying this, but we do need a reality check.\n And look. I get it. Having tangible data allows us to demonstrate that we&#39;re doing our job and we&#39;re trying to measure and improve what we&#39;re doing. But as Bob Hoffman rightly points out -  that&#39;s not how brands are built.\n The numbers are often all we have to prove our case, to get more budget and in extreme cases, to continue to stay employed. We&#39;ll remain in this mess until we can separate marketing from short sighted and poorly informed decision making. Until leaders can lead on the strength of their conviction and experience instead of second guessing themselves and their staff based on the inadequacy of data.\n I don&#39;t know what the way out of this mess is, or what the path to success looks like. All I know is this.\n  Go ahead, ask the average marketer how to properly calculate the sample size for an A/B test, or what a Chi-Squared test is, or even what power is and why it&#39;s important.\u00a0 \u21a9", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:36:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8425\u9500\u8005,addicted,\u6570\u636e", "title":

"note_en": "Welcome! You&#39;re probably here because you read  this tweet and then signed up to hear the longer-form version of how we ran founder-led sales to grow from $0 to $2m ARR in under 2 years.\n This guide is for founders who have a B2B company that is just starting out, where you&#39;re selling a product that is $250/mo or more.\n You might also find value in certain sections if you&#39;re running an agency, or a B2C company, or are selling a product &lt;$250/mo. You might find value if you&#39;re a B2B sales leader, or an account executive, or are just trying to learn more about sales.\n Like many other things - sales, marketing, pricing, and onboarding are all really case-dependent. This isn&#39;t meant to be advice, or &#34;go do this,&#34; but rather, &#34;here&#39;s the playbook that worked well for us, with a specific product, at a specific moment in time.&#34;\n  Sales should to be driven by at least one founder until you stop learning new things about your customers, the problem you are solving, and how to position your solution.\n At our last company, we had all three founders involved in sales at some level for almost 2 years.\n No one is going to understand the product and problem it solves better than the founders. If that&#39;s not the case, you have bigger problems than sales.\n Sales conversations are also your most important feedback loop. As a founder, you need a front row seat to drive product, pricing and marketing decisions.\n  I&#39;ve done a lot of sales. I&#39;ve worked at, built, founded, and sold a couple companies. Everything about a startup is sales: you&#39;re selling a product or service to a customer, you&#39;re pitching the best people to join your team, you&#39;re pitching investors, you&#39;re selling a vision to your team, you&#39;re striking a critical partnership.\n  I didn&#39;t write this alone. Our team at my new company  Laskie encouraged me to write this, and helped out a lot.", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:36:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

"note_en": "Note: this is a review of some of the more interesting features in this release. For a complete list of changes please be sure to read the  UPDATING file.\n    This release was bumped to 2.0, not because of the magnitude of features (which is actually smaller than past releases), but because of a few changes that are backward incompatible. Please read this list carefully to be aware of these changes:  When using  &lt;attach-file&gt; to browse and add multiple attachments to an email, you may use  &lt;quit&gt; to exit after tagging the files. Previously, &#34;enter&#34; had to be pressed on a non-directory file. This was awkward and non-intuitive.\n  The default value of some configuration variables is translatable. Those are marked with type  string (localized) in the manual. Examples include  $attribution and  $status_format.\n  $ssl_force_tls defaults set. If this sounds familiar, that&#39;s because I tried this before in the 1.13.0 release, but reverted it after some breakage. I&#39;m trying again with a major revision number bump. If you need to connect to a non-encrypted site, you will need to turn this setting off yourself.\n  &lt;decode-copy&gt; and  &lt;decode-save&gt; no longer perform header weeding by default. Header weeding can be toggled back on by setting  $copy_decode_weed.\n  $hostname is set after processing the muttrc and  -e command-line arguments. This was done to provide a way to skip DNS lookups of the FQDN, which on some systems can result in a delay when starting up.\n    Normal configuration variables (as opposed to  user-defined my variables) were previously escaped when used on the right hand side of an assignment. Newline was converted to &#34;\\n&#34;, carriage return to &#34;\\r&#34;, tab to &#34;\\t&#34;, backslash and double quotes where backslash escaped. This was a bug, but a long-standing one, so I note the change here.\n    This feature isn&#39;t commonly needed, but see  ticket 226 for the reasoning behind the request. This allows the use of literal IP addresses in place of the email address domain. For example  user@[IPv6:fcXX:....].\n      I believe this wasn&#39;t implemented previously because Mutt didn&#39;t resolve relative paths internally. So, starting Mutt with something like &#34; mutt -f mymailbox&#34; would cause Mutt to open &#34;mymailbox&#34; in the current directory and continue to refer to it as &#34;mymailbox&#34; internally. If the directory changed, Mutt would still refer (incorrectly) to &#34;mymailbox&#34; in the new directory.\n  Because of this, Mutt now also tries to resolve relative paths. This isn&#39;t as straightforward as you would think. So if you encounter issues, please let us know!\n    When an unplanned disconnect occurs, Mutt will try to reconnect automatically, preserving unsaved changed changes in the mailbox. This isn&#39;t bulletproof, but will hopefully at least reduce lost changes due to a mailbox connection freezing or being dropped.\n      Also, Mutt will store the Date, From, To, Cc, and Reply-To headers in protected headers. Mutt currently doesn&#39;t display or make use of those headers, but other MUA&#39;s may expect them to be there.\n    &#34;xoauth2&#34; is supported as a value in  $imap_authenticators,  $smtp_authenticators, and  $pop_authenticators. Additionally there is a  refresh token script under the contrib directory which works with Python 3. (The script is not officially supported by the Mutt team, but has been reported to work.)\n    If you sometimes forget a pattern modifier, you can type Tab after the ~ to get a list of pattern modifiers. Hitting enter on a selection will add it to the line editor.\n    Three new variables,  $copy_decode_weed,  $pipe_decode_weed, and  $print_decode_weed allow you to decouple the operation of &#34;decoding&#34; with the operation of header weeding. Pipe and print operations weed by default, preserving previous behavior.

"note_en": "Microsoft has confirmed that its new game streaming service, xCloud, will not appear on Apple devices.\n The Netflix-like game service will launch in September for Android devices, offering a library of more than 100 games for a monthly fee.\n Apple said its app store rules require that each game is submitted individually for review.\n Microsoft said Apple was the only major platform to &#34;deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services&#34;.\n Another major game streaming service, Google&#39;s Stadia, has had similar problems - it too is available on Android and not Apple&#39;s iOS.\n Microsoft is poised to roll its streaming feature into the top tier of its Game Pass product, which will cost \u00a310.99 a month in the UK.\n Some had hoped that Microsoft&#39;s service would be coming to the Apple App Store, because it has operated a test version for several months - although with only one single game available.\n  &#34;Gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store, as long as they follow the same set of guidelines applicable to all developers,&#34; the statement read.\n  However, that is not how Microsoft or Google&#39;s game streaming subscription apps work. The idea is that one app acts as a browser for all the available games, which can be streamed instantly from the menu.\n Microsoft also promises that new games will be added &#34;all the time&#34; and first-party titles will be available to stream on the same day as their general release.\n  Microsoft said its test period on iOS had expired, adding: &#34;Unfortunately, we do not have a path to bring our vision of cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to gamers on iOS via the Apple App Store.&#34;\n It said all the games in its library are rated by games&#39; rating bodies - such as the American ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) - suggesting that Apple should not need to check each game again.\n Apple &#34;consistently treats gaming apps differently, applying more lenient rules to non-gaming apps even when they include interactive content,&#34; it said.\n Strict rules about what can and cannot appear on the app store frequently cause problems between Apple and app developers.\n  The firm demands a 30% cut of all sales - including subscription sales - through its store, and  recently became embroiled in a public row with an email app developer whom it threatened with removal from the store over subscription fees.\n Apple&#39;s app store rules also ban any app with &#34;a store-like interface&#34;, and explicitly only allows these types of apps if they are a &#34;remote desktop&#34; - a streaming copy of a device from far away.\n That has been a problem for other gaming services in the past. Examples include Valve&#39;s Steam Link app, which displays a copy of the person&#39;s personal computer on a phone or tablet somewhere else in their home, or the Shadow gaming app, which gives users an entire remote computer to use.\n A Shadow spokesperson told The Verge that it had originally found itself in a disagreement with Apple, and had to remove its &#34;quick launch&#34; feature that let users go straight into a game. Shadow had to remove that to become more like a &#34;generic mirror&#34; of a gaming computer to be approved, they said.\n Microsoft says it is still committed to finding a way to bring its streaming service to Apple devices, despite there being no clear way to do so for now.", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:34:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u82f9\u679c,\u6e38\u620f,apple,blocks", "title": "\u9664\u975e\u4e2a\u522b\u6e38\u620f\u83b7\u5f97\u6279\u51c6\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u82f9\u679c\u5c06\u963b\u6b62\u6e38\u620f\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u670d\u52a1", "title_en": "Apple blocks game streaming services unless individual games are approved", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53693581", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f9\u679c", "\u6e38\u620f", "apple", "blocks"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b30b96130bfd863b04dec2625164f072.jpg", "infoid": 1033756, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u63a5\u6536\u65e5\u671f\uff1a2020\u5e7410\u670814\u65e5/\u4fee\u8ba2\u65e5\u671f\uff1a2020\u5e7410\u670829\u65e5/\u63a5\u53d7\u65e5\u671f\uff1a2020\u5e7411\u67082\u65e5/\u53d1\u5e03\u65e5\u671f\uff1a2020\u5e7411\u67083\u65e5\u3002\n(\u672c\u6587\u5c5e\u4e8e\u300a\u538b\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u953b\u70bc\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u300b\u7279\u520a)\u3002\n\u5efa\u8bae\u4f69\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u611f\u67d3\u6216\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eba\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u5fc3\u80ba\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u5982\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\u3002\u5728\u5267\u70c8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8868\u73b0\u8fd8\u5b58\u5728\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u8861\u4ea4\u53c9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005(7\u75377\u5973\uff0c28.2\u00b18.7\u5c81)\u5728\u75b2\u52b3\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u3001\u5e03\u53e3\u7f69\u6216\u4e0d\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6(\u8109\u640f\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6)\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6c27\u5408\u6307\u6570(\u8840\u7ea2\u86cb\u767d\u9971\u548c/\u51cf\u9971\u548c\u6307\u6807)(\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790)\u3002\u4f69\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u5f71\u54cd(\u5e73\u5747\u8017\u7aed\u65f6\u95f4\uff1a\u65e0\u9762\u7f69622\u00b1141s\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u9762\u7f69657\u00b1158s\uff0c\u5e03\u9762\u9762\u7f69637\u00b1153s(p=0.20)\uff1b\u5cf0\u503c\u529f\u7387\uff1a\u65e0\u9762\u7f69234\u00b156W\uff0c\u624b\u672f\u9762\u7f69241\u00b157W\uff0c\u5e03\u9762\u9762\u7f69241\u00b151W(p=0.49))\u3002\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u5f53\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5cf0\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\uff0c\u6234\u6216\u4e0d\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u7684\u52a8\u8109\u8840\u6c27\u9971\u548c\u5ea6\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6c27\u5408\u6307\u6570\u3001\u611f\u89c9\u5230\u7684\u52b3\u7d2f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6216\u5fc3\u7387\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u5267\u70c8\u8fd0\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\u4f69\u6234\u53e3\u7f69\u5bf9\u5e74\u8f7b\u3001\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8840\u6db2\u6216\u808c\u8089\u6c27\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd(ClinicalTrials.gov\uff0cNCT04557605)\u3002\u67e5\u770b\u5168\u6587\u3002\n\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\uff1a\u4f53\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\uff1b\u6700\u5927\u6444\u6c27\u91cf\uff1b\u8109\u640f\u8840\u6c27\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff1b\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\uff1b\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\uff1b\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u4f53\u529b\u6d3b\u52a8\uff1b\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\uff1b\u6700\u5927\u6444\u6c27\u91cf\uff1b\u8109\u640f\u8840\u6c27\u6d4b\u5b9a\uff1b\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\uff1b\u65b0\u51a0\u80ba\u708e\uff1b\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u3002\n\u25ba\u5c55\u793a\u4eba\u7269", "note_en": "Received: 14 October 2020 / Revised: 29 October 2020 / Accepted: 2 November 2020 / Published: 3 November 2020\n (This article belongs to the Special Issue  Exercise and Sport in Stressful Conditions and Environments)\n Wearing face masks is recommended for the prevention of contracting or exposing others to cardiorespiratory infections, such as COVID-19. Controversy exists on whether wearing face masks during vigorous exercise affects performance. We used a randomized, counterbalanced cross-over design to evaluate the effects of wearing a surgical mask, a cloth mask, or no mask in 14 participants (7 men and 7 women; 28.2 \u00b1 8.7 y) during a cycle ergometry test to exhaustion. Arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry) and tissue oxygenation index (indicator of hemoglobin saturation/desaturation) at vastus lateralis (near-infrared spectroscopy) were assessed throughout the exercise tests. Wearing face masks had no effect on performance (time to exhaustion (mean \u00b1 SD): no mask 622 \u00b1 141 s, surgical mask 657 \u00b1 158 s, cloth mask 637 \u00b1 153 s ( p = 0.20); peak power: no mask 234 \u00b1 56 W, surgical mask 241 \u00b1 57 W, cloth mask 241 \u00b1 51 W ( p = 0.49)). When expressed relative to peak exercise performance, no differences were evident between wearing or not wearing a mask for arterial oxygen saturation, tissue oxygenation index, rating of perceived exertion, or heart rate at any time during the exercise tests. Wearing a face mask during vigorous exercise had no discernable detrimental effect on blood or muscle oxygenation, and exercise performance in young, healthy participants (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04557605).

Art is knowing which ones to keep.&#34; -  Scott Adams\n This last week I finished the book, &#34; Your Joking Mr. Feynman&#34; and I have to say that Feynman would have loved to work in the Generative Arts. (And by the way, this is a great listen (free w/ Audible subscription.) . A greatly influential scientist of the 20th century but not your lab rat; but one who would have done almost anything to experience. This overly curious individual would have been so fascinating to be around and to just observe.\n Later in the book, he talks about his interest to draw the beauties of science and math to make it more accessible for individuals to understand the beauty of mathematics and nature. So it reminded me of the many particle systems that we have all created and how they show the ordered chaos systems that we see in nature.\n So for this week, there are a few posts that have been inspired by the read and I would highly recommend it if you haven&#39;t read it or are looking for something new to read.\n         Eno further describes systems which create \u201cever-changing music,\u201d that could \u201cproduce original music forever,\u201d lamenting the limitations which forced him to simply record the output of these systems as traditional albums rather than \u201csell the system itself, so that a listener would know that the music was always unique.\u201d\n  Found this interesting video on algorithmic orchestration. This is a unique way of taking orchestrated music and using  TidalCycles to orchestrate a piece of classical music.\n     Different parameters of a song like frequency curves, sound levels, dynamics etc. are extracted, mapped and drawn on paper.\n I&#39;ve always found alternative representations of certain mediums to be fascinating to look at and observe; really it is data visualization without the functional utility of being able to provide actionable insights. Although, that isn&#39;t true either, it can be rewrading to be able to find musical motifs that run through a piece of music especially when observing classical music.\n   In this section I am going to celebrate the many talented artists across the internet. I have been watching what Matt has done for years and his work has been inspirational and just exciting to watch. As of right now; I am simply adding their profiles here as a way to celebrate the work that has been done by some of the wonderful artists out there. Eventually I hope to be abloe to provide some more insight into their experiences through interviews. (Really I hope to do a video series on the works they have created and talk through some of their artist philosophies).\n Let me know if there is anyone that you would be interested in getting a closer look at their work.\n     Check out his github page to observe the tools that he has been working with\n  I believe the following is my favorite work from Matt. There is something complex in the way the light shines from the sources within the images. Then the distribution of the lighting splatter as it decays over a point in time. It has a beautiful dystopian lighting feel making it really complex.\n   Protip: A great deal of learning can come from scanning the code of these master crafters. They will help you not only find their inspirations, but also help understand the tips and tricks that may have taken hours to figure out.\n    This is a fun and interesting tutorial on creating fractal minerals; his renderings are absolutely insane and since Houdini can be used for free; it is a skill that might be worth attaining since there are so many fun and interesting simulations that can be done with it.\n    A tree grows by passing nutrients up its branch structure through its outer bark layer. As it does so, each branch segment grows in girth. Nutrients arriving at the end of a non-split branch lead to growth in length, while a split branch passes the nutrients to its child branches proportionally to some ratio.\n    Node-based programming, also known as &#34;Flow-based programming&#34;, is a way to create computer programs by using predefined functions represented visually as blocks. There are many examples of such programming models:\n The software used in the article is called  PatternNodes  by LostMinds. It is something you should check out.\n    Generative art refers to the creation of artworks using autonomous processes with no direct human control. There are two general classes of generative art: \u201cneural,\u201d where a deep neural network is trained to generate samples from a data distribution; and \u201csymbolic\u201d or \u201calgorithmic,\u201d where a human artist designs the primary parameters and an autonomous system then works within these constraints to generate samples.\n   One of the &#34;secrets&#34; of generative art is the ability to repeat the randomness of nature in the algorithms. It is what gives the swerving look or natural growth fascinating. Here is a little bit\n   This book is written for creative coders, game developers and engineers who have coding experience, a basic knowledge of linear algebra and trigonometry, and who want to take their work to an exciting new level of graphical quality. (If you want to learn how to code, I highly recommend you start with Processing and come back later when you are comfortable with it.)\n A great introduction into the world of shaders and generally a bit more complex than a simple processing recommendations that I&#39;ve given in the past couple weeks. However it&#39;s important to continue to try new things as shaders can do some amazing things.", "posttime": "2020-11-08 09:34:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f16\u7a0b,\u7b97\u6cd5,programming,algorithmic", "title": "\u8d39\u66fc\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u7f16\u6392\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b", "title_en": "Feynman, Algorithmic Orchestration and Node Based Programming", "transed": 1, "url": "https://generative.substack.com/p/feynman-algorithmic-orchestration", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f16\u7a0b", "\u7b97\u6cd5"]}]
