A french fry that no one has eaten in more than 30 years.</p><p>从朱莉娅·柴尔德（Julia Child）到保罗·博古斯（Paul Bocuse）到詹姆士·比尔德（James Beard），一些食品史上的名人也都宣称自己对同一份炸薯条的热爱-一种毫不夸张地诞生了帝国的炸薯条。 30年来没有人吃过的炸薯条。</p><p> McDonald’s original french fries were cooked in beef tallow. For that fact, they were bullied out of production by a well-funded, well-intentioned businessman and self-proclaimed health advocate named Phil Sokolof, who unknowingly dethroned what many fans claim was the greatest french fry to ever meet mass production. “The french fries were very good,” Child said in a  1995 interview, “and then the nutritionists got at them … and they’ve been limp ever since … I’m always very strong about criticizing them, hoping maybe they’ll change.”</p><p> 麦当劳原始的炸薯条是用牛脂制成的。出于这个事实，他们被一个资金雄厚，意图良好的商人和自称为健康倡导者的菲尔·索科洛夫（Phil Sokolof）欺负了他们，他们不知不觉地废除了许多粉丝认为是有史以来达到批量生产的最大炸薯条。 “炸薯条非常好，” Child在1995年的一次采访中说，“然后营养学家对他们进行了抨击……从那以后他们一直软弱无力……我一直很坚决地批评它们，希望它们会改变。”</p><p> Child never lived to see McDonald’s fries return to their former glory, and sadly, and there’s no indication they ever will. That’s why I set out on a quest to find the original recipe.</p><p> 孩子从未活着看到麦当劳的薯条恢复昔日的辉煌，可悲的是，没有迹象表明他们会。因此，我着手寻找原始食谱。</p><p> My hunt for the lost McRecipe took me up the corporate ladder and to obsessive corners of Reddit. I spoke to fast-food experts, super-fan museum curators, and a 79-year-old former employee of the very first McDonald’s. After weeks of digging, I procured a recipe for the original fries that one fast-food historian believes to be the real deal, one I recreated several times to ensure its legitimacy. I sweat over hot tallow, bled from cutting perfect shoestrings, and literally got pulverized salt in those wounds. But according to at least one expert, I have reason to believe the recipe I’ve uncovered is authentic.</p><p> 我寻找失落的McRecipe的人使我登上了公司阶梯，来到了Reddit的各个角落。我采访了快餐专家，超级粉丝博物馆策展人，以及第一个麦当劳的79岁前雇员。经过数周的挖掘，我为一个快餐历史学家认为是真正的交易购买了一份原始薯条的食谱，为确保其合法性，我多次对其进行了重新制作。我汗流满热的牛脂，因割断完美的鞋带而流血，并且在伤口上确实撒了些盐。但是，至少有一位专家认为，我有理由相信我发现的食谱是真实的。</p><p>    Ben Stacks was an employee at Richard and Maurice McDonald’s seminal location in San Bernardino, California, “from the summer of ’54 right up until I got a draft notice in ’60,” he tells me over the phone. If anything, he knew the original fry too well: On Saturdays alone, he processed 1,000 pounds of them—all of which were sold and eaten that day. “Kids I grew up with just lived for McDonald’s to open,” he says, “they’d ride their bikes over just for the fries.”</p><p>    Ben Stacks是位于加利福尼亚州圣贝纳迪诺的理查德和莫里斯·麦当劳开创性工厂的员工，“从54的夏天一直到我在60收到通知草案，”他在电话中告诉我。如果有的话，他也非常了解原始的炸薯条：仅在星期六，他就加工了1000磅-当天所有这些都被出售和食用。他说：“我长大的孩子只是为了麦当劳开张而居住的，他们只是为了炸薯条而骑着自行车。”</p><p> To the best of Stacks’s memory, the fries were made as such: Locally sourced Idaho russet potatoes were peeled, chopped, and rinsed of excess starch in a shed behind the restaurant. The prepared shoestrings sat in cold water until an hour before frying, at which point they were drained and dried before being tossed into a hot vat of 100 percent beef fat. “Cook ’em, salt ’em, sell ’em,” says Stacks. “They were wonderful. You could get a good hamburger any place—nothing special about those—but those french fries were really wonderful.”</p><p> 为了使Stacks尽其所能，炸薯条的制作方法如下：将爱达荷州红褐色马铃薯削皮，切碎，然后在餐厅后方的棚子中冲洗掉多余的淀粉。将准备好的鞋带放在冷水中，直到煎炸一个小时，然后将其沥干并晾干，然后扔入100％牛肉脂肪的热桶中。 Stacks说：“煮，盐，卖”。 “他们很棒。您可以在任何地方都可以买到一个好汉堡包-那里没什么特别的-但是那些炸薯条真的很棒。”</p><p> The fries caught the attention of Ray Kroc, then the company’s milkshake-machine salesman. Stacks says he was working the day Kroc first visited. “He was curious as to how in the heck we wore out his [milkshake] machines as soon and as often as we did,” says Stacks. With lines around the block, their milkshake machines never got much of a break and the belts often blew out within weeks. “And that’s when Kroc had his vision.”</p><p> 炸薯条引起了公司奶昔机销售员Ray Kroc的注意。斯塔克斯说，他正在克罗克第一次造访的那一天。 “他很好奇，我们怎么以及像我们一样经常穿破[奶昔]机器，”斯塔克斯说。他们的奶昔机周围有生产线，几乎没有休息过，皮带经常在几周内炸毁。 “那是克罗克有远见的时候。”</p><p>  It’s important to note that at the time, few fast-food operations were even attempting fries. According to Adam Chandler, the author of  Drive Thru Dreams: A Journey Through the Heart of America’s Fast-Food Kingdom, World War I soldiers returning to the United States from France and Belgium ushered these exotic fried potato strings into the American culinary consciousness.* But Chandler says that fries were too labor intensive and difficult to execute in a consistent, commercial manner. While most burger joints made do with potato chips, “the McDonald brothers had a secret,” he says. They used their desert setting to their advantage, curing potatoes for several days in the desert air before processing them. “They had this extra crispness to them that made them better than any fry you’d ever had.”</p><p>需要注意的是，当时很少有快餐店甚至尝试炸薯条。根据《穿越梦想的旅程：穿越美国快餐王国的心脏》一书的作者亚当·钱德勒（Adam Chandler）的说法，第一次世界大战的士兵从法国和比利时返回美国，将这些异国情调的炸土豆条​​带入了美国的烹饪意识。*但是钱德勒说，炸薯条劳动强度大，很难以一致的商业方式执行。他说，虽然大多数汉堡店都是用炸土豆片做的，但“麦当劳兄弟有一个秘密”。他们利用自己的沙漠环境优势，在沙漠中将马铃薯在沙漠中晾制了几天，然后再进行加工。 “它们给他们带来了额外的脆度，使它们比您以前吃过的任何炸薯条都要好。”</p><p> What few were even attempting, the McDonald brothers were nailing. Kroc wanted in, and he knew if he were to succeed, it would be on the back of those fries. “The fry would become almost sacrosanct for me,” Kroc later wrote in his  autobiography, “its preparation a ritual to be followed religiously.” By 1955, Kroc bought the franchising rights from the McDonalds brothers and started building what would slowly become his empire.</p><p> 麦当劳兄弟几乎没有尝试过。克罗克想进去，他知道如果他要成功，那将取决于那些炸薯条。克罗克后来在自传中写道：“炒菜对我而言几乎是神圣不可侵犯的，它的准备是一种宗教仪式，必须遵循。”到1955年，克罗克从麦当劳兄弟手中购买了特许经营权，并开始建立逐渐成为他的帝国的公司。</p><p> As McDonald’s branches crept across the nation, Kroc ensured the superlative fries would stay so at scale. As Malcolm Gladwell reported in the   New Yorker, Kroc armed field men with hydrometers to ensure the potatoes met ideal water content and solidity levels, developed his own potato-curing method that didn’t require a desert, and even hired an engineer from Motorola to design a “potato computer” that calibrated fry oil temperature to deliver consistently cooked fries. He tinkered with the frying oil as well, developing a secretive, cost-saving mixture of beef tallow and vegetable oil termed “Formula 47” (after the original 47-cent McDonald’s meal).</p><p> 麦当劳的分支机构遍布全国，克罗克（Kroc）确保最高级的薯条将保持如此规模。正如马尔科姆·格拉德威尔（Malcolm Gladwell）在《纽约客》上所报道的那样，克罗克武装部队使用液体比重计确保土豆达到理想的水分含量和固体水平，开发了自己的不需要沙漠的马铃薯腌制方法，甚至聘请了摩托罗拉的一名工程师来设计一台“马铃薯计算机”，该计算机可以校准油炸油的温度，以提供始终如一的熟炸薯条。他还修补了煎炸油，开发出一种经济，秘密，节省成本的牛脂和植物油的混合物，称为“ Formula 47”（在麦当劳最初的47美分饭后）。</p><p>  By the end of the 1960s, there were 1,000 McDonald’s franchises across the  United States. It was the largest fast-food company in the country, and its fries in particular attained iconic status. Albert Okura, fast-food devotee and CEO of the California-based Juan Pollo restaurant chain, worked at Burger King from 1970 to 1978. “All we did was monitor McDonald’s,” he says, “we copied everything they did. But nothing came close.” His love of McDonald’s, sparked in his youth, would eventually lead him to found the  unofficial museum of McDonald’s memorabilia at the site of the very first McDonald’s in San Bernardino.</p><p>  到1960年代末，麦当劳在美国的特许经营权达到1000个。它是该国最大的快餐公司，尤其是薯条获得了标志性的地位。快餐业奉献者，加利福尼亚州的胡安·波洛（Juan Pollo）连锁餐厅的首席执行官Albert Okura从1970年到1978年在汉堡王工作。“我们所做的只是监视麦当劳，”他说，“我们复制了他们所做的一切。但是没有什么接近的。”他年轻时对麦当劳的热爱最终使他在圣贝纳迪诺的第一家麦当劳博物馆所在地发现了非官方的麦当劳纪念品博物馆。</p><p> One by one, competing brands began cooking their fries in beef tallow as well, hoping to approximate what slowly became the gold standard in french fries, according to Chandler. “McDonald’s original fries took hold in such a way that when someone said ‘french fry,’ everyone thought of the same thing,” he says.</p><p> 根据钱德勒的说法，竞争品牌也开始在牛脂中烹制炸薯条，希望能逐渐接近炸薯条的黄金标准。他说：“麦当劳的原始炸薯条以一种方式被抓住，当有人说'炸薯条'时，每个人都会想到同一件事。”</p><p> In all likelihood, Phil Sokolof himself at one point loved the very fries he would come to destroy.</p><p> 菲尔·索科洛夫（Phil Sokolof）极有可能自己喜欢他要破坏的薯条。</p><p>   In 1966, at age 43, Phil Sokolof suffered a heart attack that nearly killed him. The lithe industrialist—who’d made his riches selling construction supplies—never even smoked, but was, as  he wrote in 1991, “a student in the greasy hamburger school of nutrition for [his] first 43 years.” His cholesterol was over 300, comfortably in the danger zone for heart attacks. Lack of self-control aside, it was fatty foods that nearly killed him. Thus, when he emerged from the hospital, he did so on a one-man mission to fight Big Fat.</p><p>   1966年，年仅43岁的菲尔·索科洛夫（Phil Sokolof）心脏病发作，几乎杀死了他。这位轻描淡写的实业家-靠赚钱卖建筑材料来赚钱-甚至从不抽烟，但是，正如他在1991年所写的那样，他是“在他最初43年的油腻汉堡包营养学校里的一名学生。”他的胆固醇超过300，处于心脏病发作的危险区域。除了缺乏自制力之外，高脂肪的食物几乎杀死了他。因此，当他从医院出来时，他是单人作战，与“大胖子”作斗争。</p><p> Between 1966 and 1990, Sokolof spent around $15 million fighting against the use of fatty ingredients in foods across  the United States. He founded the National Heart Savers Association with his own money, pushed Congress to declare April “Know Your Cholesterol Month,” and took out full-page ads in newspapers smearing major food brands for their ingredients.  He called himself “the little guy from Omaha”;  papers called him the “Fat Fighter” (though “Fat-Fighter” might have been more apt).  After strong-arming major players like General Foods, Kellogg’s, and Nabisco into changing their recipes, Sokolof set his sights on the Golden Arches.</p><p>1966年至1990年期间，索科洛夫（Sokolof）花了约1500万美元与全美国的食品中的脂肪成分作斗争。他用自己的钱成立了全国心脏保护者协会，促使国会宣布4月为“了解胆固醇月”，并在报纸上刊登了整版广告，涂抹了主要食品品牌的成分。他称自己为“奥马哈的小家伙”。论文称他为“胖战士”（尽管“胖子”可能更贴切）。在诸如General Foods，Kellogg's和Nabisco之类的主要武装力量改变了他们的食谱之后，Sokolof将目光投向了Golden Arches。</p><p> “McDonald’s, Your Hamburgers Have Too Much Fat,” a full-page ad in the spring of 1990 squarely declared in the  New York Times,  Wall Street Journal, and other newspapers under the sensational headline “The Poisoning of America.” McDonald’s fought back: “The papers just didn’t check the facts,” McDonald’s attorney Joseph Califano told the   AP in 1990. The ads persisted, with billboards in Times Square and Super Bowl commercial spots. McDonald’s stood their ground. “The ads are so absurd, they are starting to be tiresome,” spokeswoman Melissa Oakley told  a reporter, adding that legal action was not out of the question.</p><p> “麦当劳，您的汉堡包脂肪太多”，整版广告于1990年春季在纽约时报，《华尔街日报》和其他报纸上以耸人听闻的标题“美国中毒”正式宣布。麦当劳的反击是：“这些报纸只是没有核实事实，”麦当劳的律师约瑟夫卡利法诺（Joseph Califano）在1990年告诉美联社。广告持续存在，在时代广场和超级碗商业广告位设有广告牌。麦当劳站稳了脚跟。女发言人梅利莎·奥克利（Melissa Oakley）告诉记者：“广告是如此荒唐，令人厌烦。”他补充说，采取法律行动并非不可能。</p><p>  Tensions came to a head on live television in the summer of 1990. McDonald’s senior vice president Dick Starman squared off with Sokolof on  Good Morning America. Sokolof gave no quarter, raining nutrition-based blows on Starman as the fast-food exec stumbled over increasingly nervous rebuttals. “They just took chicken skin out of their Chicken McNugget three weeks ago. Tell them about Egg McMuffins. Tell them about your beef tallow in your french fries,” said Sokolof, to which Starman could hardly  fit a word in edgewise. Sokolof effectively berated the largest fast-food company on the planet, to its face, for all the world to see. On July 23, 1990, McDonald’s quietly changed their long-held  french fry recipe.</p><p>  1990年夏天，现场电视上的紧张局势达到了顶点。麦当劳高级副总裁迪克·史塔曼（Dick Starman）和索科夫（Sokolof）在《早安美国》上合影。索科洛夫（Sokolof）丝毫不愿对营养素施暴，因为这位快餐业高管因日益紧张的反驳而跌跌撞撞。 “三周前，他们刚刚从鸡麦块中取出了鸡皮。告诉他们关于鸡蛋松饼的信息。告诉他们炸薯条中的牛脂。”索科洛夫说，Starman很难用一个词来形容。从表面上看，索科洛夫实际上是世界上最大的快餐公司，被全世界看到。 1990年7月23日，麦当劳悄悄更改了他们长期以来使用的炸薯条配方。</p><p> As Chandler points out, however, Sokolof’s smear campaign came as part of a broader national reckoning: “You can pinpoint a lot of the changes that happened in the American diet to that era,” he says. With the obesity epidemic entering the public consciousness at the turn of the 1990s, fast-food players big and small were all scrambling to meet demands for healthier options—a series of efforts that, according to Chandler, failed at every turn. Domino’s Pizza introduced low-calorie, “light toppings” (“those obviously bombed”); Wendy’s launched a salad bar (“no one wanted it”); Burger King introduced the BK Broiler grilled chicken sandwich (“never really stuck”); and aside from ditching beef tallow, McDonald’s introduced their McLean Deluxe (“a huge flop once people found out there was seaweed derivative in it”). This was the era, Chandler points out, when Kentucky Fried Chicken became KFC, “because ‘fried’ was such a pejorative.”</p><p> 正如钱德勒指出的那样，索科洛夫的涂片运动是全国范围内的一个广泛考量：“您可以指出那个时代美国饮食中发生的许多变化，”他说。随着肥胖病的流行在1990年代初进入公众的视野，快餐企业无论大小，都在争相满足对更健康选择的需求，据钱德勒说，一系列努力最终都失败了。多米诺比萨饼（Domino's Pizza）推出了低热量的“轻馅料”（“那些明显被炸的炸弹”）；温迪推出了一个沙拉吧（“没人想要”）；汉堡王（Burger King）推出了BK肉鸡烤鸡肉三明治（“从未真正粘过”）；除了抛弃牛脂之外，麦当劳还推出了麦克莱恩（McLean Deluxe）（“一旦人们发现其中含有海藻衍生物，这将是一次巨大的失败”）。钱德勒指出，这是那个时代，当肯德基成为肯德基时，“因为'油炸'太贬义了”。</p><p>  While Sokolof’s victory dealt a blow to the corporation, it wasn’t exactly a win for consumers, either. Exchanging beef tallow for pure vegetable oil in high-temperature frying introduced consumers to a different and arguably worse dietary threat than saturated fats: trans fats, which, as we now know, are a major cause of cardiovascular disease, digestive issues,  and weight gain. Despite the best intentions, Sokolof ultimately made a bad problem worse, one that McDonald’s has spent decades trying to fix. They’ve bounced new ingredients in and out of their frying oil to reduce the levels of trans fat, claiming today to have essentially  eliminated them from their fries.</p><p>  尽管索科洛夫（Sokolof）的胜利给公司造成了打击，但对消费者而言，这也不是完全的胜利。在高温煎炸中将牛脂换成纯植物油，给消费者带来了与饱和脂肪不同的饮食威胁，而且可以说是比饱和脂肪更糟糕的饮食：反式脂肪，众所周知，这是导致心血管疾病，消化问题和体重增加的主要原因。尽管有最好的意图，索科洛夫最终还是使一个严重的问题变得更糟，麦当劳花了数十年的时间试图解决这个问题。他们在油炸油中加入和倒出了新成分，以减少反式脂肪的含量，今天声称已经从炸薯条中消除了它们。</p><p> What we are left with is a distant echo of the famed original fry. “They’re still considered to be some of the best fast-food fries there are,” says Chandler, “even if they’re a shell of what they once were.”  According to their website, McDonald’s fries are now cooked in a mixture of soybean and canola oil. This recipe ultimately leaves their fries with a flat, beanie flavor that lacks the salty crunch that made them famous. Their suppliers add hydrolyzed wheat and hydrolyzed milk, whose meaty-tasting amino acids impart a “natural beef flavor” upon their par-fry oil,  but it’s not the same. “I still eat at McDonald’s twice a week,” says former employee Ben Stacks, “but I miss those original fries. They stayed tasty longer.” Indeed, if modern McDonald’s fries aren’t eaten immediately, they soften into a mealy texture that settles on the palate like wet dust.</p><p> 我们所剩下的只是著名的原始鱼苗的遥远回声。钱德勒说：“他们仍然被认为是当时最好的快餐薯条之一，即使它们是过去的外壳。”根据他们的网站，麦当劳的薯条现在是用大豆和低芥酸菜子油的混合物烹制的。这种食谱最终使它们的薯条具有扁平的豆豆味，没有使它们出名的咸味脆皮。他们的供应商添加了水解的小麦和水解的牛奶，它们的肉质氨基酸使他们的炸油具有“天然的牛肉风味”，但事实并非如此。前员工本·斯塔克斯（Ben Stacks）说：“我仍然每周在麦当劳吃两次，”但我想念那些原始的薯条。他们保持美味的时间更长。”的确，如果不立即食用现代麦当劳的炸薯条，它们就会变软成粉状质地，像湿尘一样落在味蕾上。</p><p> Chandler told me over the phone that “McDonald’s is the place we eat when we’re taking a break from being virtuous.” In essence, Sokolof sought to enforce virtuousness upon the American public and, by extension, the halls of American food history. McDonald’s folded—but we are not McDonald’s. We can reclaim virtueless-ness. We just need one small recipe.</p><p> 钱德勒在电话中对我说：“麦当劳是我们从道德上休息的时候吃饭的地方。”本质上，索科洛夫（Sokolof）试图向美国公众以及更进一步的美国食品历史大厅加强美德。麦当劳折叠了，但我们不是麦当劳。我们可以收回愚昧无知。我们只需要一个小食谱。</p><p> I knew the original recipe had to be out there somewhere. It was simply too ubiquitous to have disappeared. It took several weeks of sleuthing, cold-calling, and taste-testing, but much to the chagrin of Sokolof’s memory, I have reason to believe my efforts uncovered an authentic recipe for the exiled original.</p><p>我知道原始食谱必须放在某个地方。这简直太普遍了，以至于消失了。经过数周的侦查，冷听和品味测试，但令索科洛夫（Sokolof）的记忆大为恼火，我有理由相信自己的努力为流亡的原件找到了真实的食谱。</p><p>   Many online recipes for do-it-yourself original McDonald’s french fries leave something to be desired. Some call for  meticulous freezing techniques, others call for factory-produced  frozen fries. Some do call for frying rinsed, shoestring russets  in straight beef tallow, but unless you grew up with Ben Stacks, these were not the “cook ’em, salt ’em, sell ’em” McDonald’s fries of your youth. Whatever Kroc had done with Formula 47, he’d kept it close to corporate’s chest. Albert Okura gets it. “He wouldn’t give out the recipe. He couldn’t. If someone knew exactly how to do it they’d be copied.”</p><p>   自己动手制作麦当劳法式炸薯条的许多在线食谱都有待改进。有些人要求采用严格的冷冻技术，而另一些人则要求采用工厂生产的冷冻薯条。有些人确实要求用直的牛脂油炸漂洗过的细红褐色，但除非您与本·斯塔克斯长大，否则这些都不是您年轻时的麦当劳薯条。无论Kroc对Formula 47所做的一切，他都会将其保持在公司的胸口附近。 Albert Okura明白了。 “他不会放弃食谱。他不能。如果有人确切知道该怎么做，他们就会被复制。”</p><p> To this day, McDonald’s still won’t give it up. I contacted  McDonald’s Golden Archives, located just outside of Chicago and staffed by two archivists who are responsible for preserving the corporation’s history. No response. I reached out to  Hamburger University, McDonald’s training facility also just outside of Chicago. No response. The only corporate office that responded was McDonald’s press wing, who was gracefully “not able to provide [the recipe] at this time.” Incessant badgering got me, predictably, nowhere.</p><p> 到今天为止，麦当劳仍然不会放弃。我联系了位于芝加哥郊外的麦当劳黄金档案馆，该档案馆由两名档案保管员组成，负责保存公司的历史。没有反应。我接触了也在芝加哥郊外的麦当劳培训机构汉堡大学。没有反应。唯一对此作出回应的公司办公室是麦当劳的新闻部门，他优雅地“目前无法提供（配方）”。不断的徽章训练使我无所适从。</p><p> But of course, it wasn’t the corporate pencil-pushers who knew those fries best anyway. They probably never set foot in a commercial kitchen, let alone made anything from the McDonald’s menu. It was the line-cooks and their managers who handled the food, folks who knew the fries like the backs of their hands, folks who might divulge.</p><p> 但是，当然，并不是公司铅笔推销员最清楚这些薯条。他们可能从未涉足商用厨房，更不用说从麦当劳菜单上做任何事情了。是食物的线厨师和他们的经理，是像手背一样了解薯条的人，或者是会泄气的人。</p><p> I took it to Reddit, asking about the long-lost recipe in  r/MimicRecipes. What I found was that someone had divulged—a lot.</p><p> 我把它带到Reddit，询问r / MimicRecipes中久违的配方。我发现有人泄露了很多东西。</p><p>  I was promptly directed to an online PDF titled  “McMenu: Do-It-Yourself McDonald’s Restaurant Recipes,” which claimed that its 33 pages of recipes were “based on the old McDonald’s production methods of the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s.” There are recipes for everything from the Big N’ Tasty, to Egg McMuffins, to the signature Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce—and, of course, McDonald’s original fries, with beef tallow—all written in first person to exhausting detail.</p><p>  我立即被引导到一个在线PDF，标题为“ McMenu：自己动手做麦当劳餐厅食谱”，该菜谱声称其33页食谱“基于麦当劳的上世纪50年代，60年代和70年代的生产方法。 。”从大N美味到蛋麦克松饼，再到招牌蜂蜜芥末蘸酱的菜谱一应俱全，当然还有麦当劳的原始薯条和牛脂，都是用第一人称写成详尽的。</p><p> I contacted the owner of the website that hosted the McMenu PDF, thinking it had to be the original author. “I was never a manager of a McDonald’s,” responded Ben Shaw, a software engineer from New Zealand, “and those aren’t my recipes.” He earned 15 minutes of fame on national news back in 2005 by trying to sell some free McDonald’s coupons on New Zealand’s equivalent of eBay. He stumbled across the McMenu PDF online and re-posted it to his website, “just trying to ride that 15 minutes a bit more, but I still can’t remember where I found it,” he told me.</p><p> 我联系了托管McMenu PDF的网站的所有者，认为它必须是原始作者。新西兰软件工程师本·肖回应道：“我从来都不是麦当劳的经理，而这些都不是我的食谱。”早在2005年，他就试图通过在相当于eBay的新西兰出售一些免费的麦当劳优惠券而在全国新闻中赢得15分钟的声誉。他告诉在线，偶然发现了McMenu PDF，然后将其重新发布到他的网站上，“只是尝试再骑15分钟，但我仍然不记得在哪里找到它了。”</p><p> While the actual author remains anonymous, they claim within their McRib Sandwich recipe to have managed a McDonald’s franchise while the McRib was still in its experimental stages. With the McRib introduced in 1981, that puts our mystery author in charge of a McDonald’s franchise well before Sokolof’s campaign. If this is true, the McMenu PDF author would have been producing hundreds of pounds of original, beefy fries every workday for years. Chandler himself couldn’t discredit the trove. “I believe in the McMenu PDF because its devotion to the cause is so apparent,” he says. “If you told me it were a lie, I wouldn’t believe you.”</p><p>尽管实际的作者仍然是匿名的，但他们在McRib Sandwich食谱中声称在McRib仍处于试验阶段时管理了麦当劳的专营权。自1981年推出McRib以来，我们的奥秘作者就在Sokolof竞选之前就掌管了McDonald的专营权。如果这是真的，那么多年以来，McMenu PDF作者本来每个工作日都会生产数百磅的原始牛肉条。钱德勒本人无法抹煞这个宝库。他说：“我相信McMenu PDF是因为它对原因的热爱如此明显。” “如果你告诉我那是骗人的话，我不会相信你的。”</p><p>   For being the most fussed-over fries in history, the McMenu recipe is pretty straightforward, but you may need some new kitchen tools.</p><p>   McMenu食谱是有史以来最繁琐的薯条，非常简单，但您可能需要一些新的厨房工具。</p><p> In making french fries generally, consistency in fry shape is paramount: If they’re all different widths, they’ll cook unevenly. I suggest something like the classic  Benriner mandoline, which aside from featuring an adjustable blade that allows for cutting ideal fry shapes, is a commercial kitchen mainstay and will serve you well outside of fry-making. (Side note: Cutting yourself on a mandoline is bad, but cutting yourself on the fry setting of a brand-new mandoline is worse. Commit to each cut as best you can, and if the spud gets stuck halfway, gently knock the end of the mandoline into your cutting board to nudge it through.)</p><p> 通常，在制作炸薯条时，保持炸薯条形状的稳定性至关重要：如果它们的宽度不同，它们的烹饪效果将不均匀。我建议像经典的Benriner mandoline这样的东西，除了具有可调节理想的炸薯条形状的可调节刀片外，还应作为商用厨房的中流and柱，并在炸薯条之外为您提供良好的服务。 （旁注：在曼陀林上割伤自己是不好的，但在全新的曼陀林上炸鱼苗的情况下会更糟。请尽最大可能进行每次切割，如果土豆块卡住了一半，请轻轻敲一下将mandoline插入您的切菜板以使其通过。）</p><p> Unless you already have a deep-fryer, you’ll also need a thermometer to know when to drop the fries into your oil. Be sure to find one that goes all the way to 400° F (most standard meat thermometers run to only 250° F or so). You can find the right instrument in most kitchen-supply stores or, as ever,  online.</p><p> 除非您已经有油炸锅，否则还需要一个温度计来知道何时将炸薯条倒入油中。一定要找到一个一直到400°F的温度计（大多数标准肉类温度计的温度只有250°F左右）。您可以在大多数厨房用品商店或网上找到合适的乐器。</p><p> The other item you may not have already is the key ingredient: beef tallow. I found some at a local butcher shop, but you could also check the oil section of your nearest supermarket. Worst case scenario, it’s also available (but not necessarily as affordable)  online.</p><p> 您可能还没有的另一项是关键成分：牛脂。我在当地的一家肉店里找到了一些，但您也可以检查最近的超市的加油站。最坏的情况是，它也可以在线（但不一定能负担得起）在线使用。</p><p> Once you have the right tools, it’s a classic brine and double-fry. A sugar bath will give the fries a subtle sweetness that sits nicely under the beefy umami, while double-frying allows the fry to cook all the way through before crisping the outer edges (single-frying, generally speaking, runs the risk of burning the skin before the insides are cooked). The recipe doesn’t call for it, but I recommend pulverizing the salt with a mortar and pestle to get a fine, even coating on the hot, finished fries (if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can roll a tin can or any hard, round object over a pile of salt to get the same effect). So without further ado, here is the closest thing to the original McDonald’s beef tallow french fry recipe the universe has to offer.</p><p> 使用正确的工具后，便可以将经典的盐水和炸薯条放入锅中。糖浴会给炸薯条带来微妙的甜味，恰好位于浓郁的鲜味下，而双炸则可让炸薯条一直煮到完全炸熟为止（一般来说，单炸有烧焦的危险。在内部煮熟之前先弄皮）。食谱没有要求，但我建议用研钵和研杵将盐磨碎，以在加热的成品炸薯条上打上均匀的涂层（如果没有研钵和研杵，则可以滚锡罐或任何坚硬的圆形物体放在一堆盐上，以获得相同的效果）。因此，事不宜迟，这是宇宙所提供的最原始的麦当劳牛肉牛油炸薯条配方。</p><p>     2 large russet potatoes  ¼ cup white sugar  2 tablespoons white corn syrup (Karo)  1–2 cups hot water  6 cups Crisco shortening  ¼ cup beef tallow  Salt to taste</p><p>     2个大赤褐色土豆¼杯白糖2汤匙白玉米糖浆（Karo）1-2杯热水6杯Crisco酥油¼杯牛脂盐调味</p><p> 1. Peel the potatoes and cut them into shoestrings. They should be about ¼ inch x ¼ inch in thickness and about 4 inches to 6 inches long.</p><p>1.将土豆去皮，切成细条。它们的厚度应为¼英寸x¼英寸，长度约为4英寸至6英寸。</p><p> 2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, corn syrup, and hot water. Stir to dissolve the sugar. Place the potatoes into the bowl of the sugar-water and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</p><p> 2.在一个大的搅拌碗中，将糖，玉米糖浆和热水混合。搅拌使糖溶解。将土豆放入糖水碗中，冷藏30分钟。</p><p> 3. While they’re soaking, pack the shortening into a deep-fryer. If you don’t have a deep-fryer, any sauce pot or dutch oven will suffice as long as you have an appropriate thermometer. Heat on the highest setting until the shortening has liquefied and reads between 375° and 400° F.</p><p> 3.浸泡时，将起酥油装入炸锅中。如果您没有油炸锅，只要有合适的温度计，任何调味锅或荷兰式烤箱就足够了。以最高设定加热，直到起酥油液化，读数在375°至400°F之间。</p><p> 4. Drain the potatoes then dump them into the fryer (be careful, it will be ferocious). Nudge them around to make sure they don’t stick to one another. After 1 to 1 ½ minutes, transfer the potatoes to a paper towel–lined plate. Let them cool 8 to 10 minutes in the refrigerator.</p><p> 4.排干土豆，然后将其倒入炸锅（小心，这将是凶猛的）。轻轻摇动它们，以确保它们不会彼此粘在一起。 1至1½分钟后，将土豆转移到衬有纸巾的盘子中。让他们在冰箱中冷却8至10分钟。</p><p> 5. While they’re cooling, add the beef tallow to the hot shortening and bring temperature back to between 375° and 400° F.</p><p> 5.冷却时，将牛脂添加到热酥油中，使温度回到375°至400°F之间。</p><p> 6. Add the potatoes and deep-fry again for 5 to 7 minutes or until golden brown. Again, nudge lightly to keep them from becoming one mega-fry. Remove and place them in a large bowl, sprinkling generously with salt and tossing to mix the salt evenly. Serve hot and enjoy.</p><p> 6.加入土豆，再炸5至7分钟或直到变成金黄色。再次，轻推，以防止他们成为一个大炸。取出并放入一个大碗中，在碗中撒上大量盐，然后将盐搅拌均匀。趁热享用。</p><p>  Done properly, the McMenu PDF will leave you with a pile of commercial-ready, golden-brown, pre-Sokolofian shoestrings. As for taste, it became clear on my first bite why it took $15 million to put them out of production. Where modern fries are bland and leave my mouth with the aforementioned uneasy beaniness, the McMenu PDF fries pack a serious punch that left my palate screaming for more. A subtle, beefy umami saddled neatly next to the underlying sweetness from brining. The crisp, browned edges provided an audible crunch. The insides retained a sweet, buttery texture. My only complaint was that I had to stop eating and photograph them. They are hands-down the best fast-food fries I’ve ever eaten.</p><p>  正确完成后，McMenu PDF将为您留出一堆准备商业使用的金棕色，索科夫式的鞋带。至于味道，我一口咬定就明白了为什么要花1500万美元使它们停产。在现代炸薯条平淡无奇的情况下，并带有上述不安的豆腐味，McMenu PDF炸薯条产生了严重的冲击，使我的口渴更加强烈。淡淡的牛肉鲜味整齐地紧贴着咸味带来的甜味。酥脆的棕色边缘提供了可听见的嘎吱声。内部保留了甜美的黄油质地。我唯一的抱怨是我必须停止进食并拍照。它们是我吃过的最好的快餐薯条。</p><p>  As for authenticity, I personally wasn’t alive to try McDonald’s original french fries before 1990, so cannot attest to the veracity of the McMenu fries’ flavor—but Chandler was, and does. “As soon as I tried a few of them, I was back in my mom’s Volvo 240 station wagon [in 1988], waiting for my sister to get distracted enough so I could steal her McNuggets.”</p><p>至于真实性，我个人还不敢尝试1990年前的麦当劳原始法式炸薯条，因此无法证明McMenu炸薯条风味的真实性，但钱德勒确实做到了。 “我尝试了其中的几辆之后，[1988年]我回到了妈妈的沃尔沃240型旅行车中，等待姐姐分心，以便我可以偷走她的McNuggets。”</p><p> Without a blessing from the Golden Arches themselves, I’ll never know if I’ve uncovered the true original recipe, and after speaking to Okura, I realize “true” here may be a moving target. As McDonald’s expanded, he says, corporate would have necessarily adapted the fry-making process to meet the scale of supply. Of course, there is a chance that t</p><p> 没有金拱门本身的祝福，我永远不会知道我是否发现了真正的原始食谱，在与大仓交谈之后，我意识到这里的“真实”可能是一个移动的目标。他说，随着麦当劳的扩张，公司一定会适应鱼苗的生产过程，以满足供应规模。当然，</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/original-mcdonalds-french-fry-recipe">https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/original-mcdonalds-french-fry-recipe</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/炸薯条/">#炸薯条</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/original/">#original</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
