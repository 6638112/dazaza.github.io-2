He reflects on what his diagnosis has taught him about hope, acting, family and medical breakthroughs</p><p>与帕金森一家住了30年后，这位演员仍然算是一个幸运的人。他思考自己的诊断教给他的关于希望，表演，家庭和医疗方面的突破</p><p>   T he  last time I spoke to Michael J Fox, in 2013, in his office in New York, he was 90% optimistic and 10% pragmatic. The former I expected; the latter was a shock. Ever since 1998, when Fox went public with his diagnosis of early-onset Parkinson’s disease, he has made optimism his defining public characteristic, because of, rather than despite, his illness. He called his 2002 memoir  Lucky Man, and he told interviewers that Parkinson’s is a gift, “ albeit one that keeps on taking”.</p><p>   上一次我在2013年与迈克尔·J·福克斯（Michael J Fox）交谈时，在纽约的他办公室里，他90％乐观，10％务实。我期望的是前者；后者令人震惊。自1998年福克斯（Fox）公开诊断出早发性帕金森氏病以来，他就一直以乐观的态度来定义自己的公共特征，因为他生病而不是生病。他给2002年的回忆录《 Lucky Man》打了个招呼，并告诉采访者帕金森的礼物是“尽管一直在服用”。</p><p> During our interview, surrounded by the memorabilia (guitars, Golden Globes) he has accrued over the course of his career, he talked about how it had all been for the best. Parkinson’s, he said, had made him quit drinking, which in turn had probably saved his marriage. Being diagnosed at the heartbreakingly young age of 29 had also knocked the ego out of his career ambitions, so he could do smaller things he was proud of –  Stuart Little, the TV sitcom Spin City – as opposed to the big 90s comedies, such as Doc Hollywood, that were too often a waste of his talents. To be honest, I didn’t entirely buy his tidy silver linings, but who was I to cast doubt on whatever perspective Fox had developed to make a monstrously unjust situation more bearable? So the sudden dose of pragmatism astonished me. Finding a cure for Parkinson’s, he said, “is not something that I view will happen in my lifetime”. Previously, he had  talked about finding “a cure within a decade”. No more. “That’s just the way it goes,” he said quietly. It was like a dark cloud had partly obscured the sun.</p><p> 在我们的采访中，他被职业生涯累积的大事记（吉他，金球奖）包围着，他谈到了一切都是最好的。他说，帕金森氏症使他戒酒，这反过来可能挽救了他的婚姻。被诊断为令人心碎的29岁年轻人，这也使他摆脱了职业野心，因此他可以做一些令他引以为傲的小事-电视情景喜剧Spin City-斯图尔特·利特（Stuart Little），而不是像90年代那样的喜剧大片Doc Hollywood，这通常是在浪费他的才华。老实说，我并没有完全购买他那条整洁的衬里，但是我对谁说福克斯（Fox）发展了什么样的观点以使巨大的不公正局面更容易忍受感到怀疑？所以突然的实用主义使我惊讶。他说，找到治愈帕金森氏症的方法，“我认为这不是我一生中都会发生的事情”。此前，他曾谈论过寻找“十年内治愈的方法”。不再。 “这就是发展的方式，”他平静地说。就像乌云遮住了部分阳光。</p><p>  I believe in all the hopeful things I said before. But you feel an idiot because you said you’d be fine and you’re not</p><p>  我相信我之前说过的所有希望。但是你觉得自己是个白痴，因为你说你会没事的</p><p> Well, seven years is a long time, especially when you have a degenerative disease, and since then, that little cloud turned into a full thunderstorm. In 2018, Fox had surgery to remove a tumour on his spine, unrelated to the Parkinson’s. The aftermath was arduous and dangerous, as tremors and a lack of balance caused by the Parkinson’s threatened the recovery of his fragile spinal cord. One day, at home on his own, after assuring his family he’d be fine without them, he fell over and smashed his upper arm so badly it required 19 screws. Thankfully, he didn’t damage his spine, but the injury plunged him into previously unplumbed despair. “There is no way to put a shine on my circumstance,” he writes in his new memoir,  No Time Like The Future: An Optimist Considers Mortality . “Have I oversold optimism as a panacea, commodified hope? In telling other patients, ‘Chin up! It will be OK’, did I look to them to validate my optimism? Is it because I needed to validate it myself? Things don’t always turn out. Sometimes things turn shitty. My optimism is suddenly finite.”</p><p> 好吧，这是很长的七年，尤其是当您患有退行性疾病时，从那以后，那小小的云变成了一场雷暴。在2018年，福克斯接受了手术以去除脊椎上与帕金森氏症无关的肿瘤。这场灾难既艰巨又危险，因为帕金森氏症引起的震颤和不平衡感威胁到了他脆弱的脊髓的恢复。有一天，他独自一人在家中，向家人保证，没有他们，他会好起来的，他摔倒了，砸碎了上臂，以至于需要19个螺丝。值得庆幸的是，他没有伤到脊椎，但受伤使他陷入了前所未有的绝望。他在他的新回忆录《没有时间像未来：乐观主义者考虑死亡率》中写道：“没有办法让我大放异彩。” “我是否将乐观主义作为灵丹妙药，商品化的希望而推销了？在告诉其他病人时，‘振作起来！没关系，我是否希望他们验证我的乐观情绪？是因为我需要自己验证吗？事情不一定总能解决。有时候事情变得糟透了。我的乐观情绪突然变得有限。”</p><p> Things being as they currently are, this time Fox and I are meeting by video chat, me in my home in London, him in his office in New York, which looks just as I remember it. “We were here last time, right? I remember,” Fox says, pointing with his chin towards the sofa. Behind him is a photo of him and his wife of 32 years, the actor  Tracy Pollan, both of them looking so young, beautiful and in love. There is also a painting of his dog, Gus, who is in his usual place, sleeping at Fox’s feet. Fox himself, still as boyishly handsome as ever, looks much better than I’d feared. He is 59 now, close to the average age for a Parkinson’s diagnosis – except that Fox has already had it for 30 years and is in the advanced stages. As he says, “You don’t die from Parkinson’s, but you do die with it,” and typically the longer you have it, the harder it becomes to carry out basic functions. He can no longer play his beloved guitar, and can’t write or type; this latest book was dictated to Fox’s assistant. He has increasing difficulty in forming words, and occasionally needs a wheelchair. I worried beforehand that talking to me for an hour would be too much, and – less professionally – that I might cry at seeing the physical degeneration of the actor who meant so much to me as a kid.</p><p> 现在的情况是这样，这次我和福克斯通过视频聊天开会，我在伦敦的家中，他在纽约的办公室中，就像我记得的那样。 “我们上次来这里是吗？我记得，”福克斯说，下巴指向沙发。在他的身后是他和32岁的妻子特蕾西·波伦（Tracy Pollan）的照片，他们看上去都很年轻，美丽且相爱。还有他的狗格斯（Gus）的画，他在往常的地方睡在福克斯（Fox）的脚下。福克斯本人依旧像男孩一样英俊，看上去比我所担心的要好得多。他现年59岁，接近帕金森氏症诊断的平均年龄-除了福克斯已经30年并且处于晚期。正如他所说：“您不会死于帕金森氏症，但您确实会死于帕金森氏症。”通常，您拥有的时间越长，执行基本功能的难度就越大。他无法再弹奏他心爱的吉他，也无法写作或打字。这本最新书是给福克斯的助手写的。他的发音难度越来越大，偶尔需要坐轮椅。我事先担心与我交谈一个小时会太多，而且（不那么专业）会令我哭泣，因为看到演员的身体退化对小时候的我意义重大。</p><p>  It soon becomes apparent that both these concerns hugely underestimate Fox. He talks for not just one hour but almost two, and while the tremors, stiffness and occasional word stumbles are more pronounced than when I last saw him, he is very much the funny, thoughtful and engaged man I remember – so much so that within minutes I stop noticing the effects of the Parkinson’s. Here’s a typical exchange: at the time of our interview, the US election is still three weeks away, so we talk about that. “Every worst instinct in mankind has been played on [by Trump], and for me that’s just anathema. Biff is president!” he says, with justified exasperation, given that Back To The Future’s evil bully Biff Tannen  was modelled on Trump.</p><p>  很快，这两种担忧都大大低估了福克斯。他不仅讲话一个小时，而且聊了将近两个小时，虽然震颤，僵硬和偶尔的单词跌倒比我上次见到他时更加明显，但他是一个我记得的非常有趣，体贴和订婚的人，以至于分钟我不再注意到帕金森氏症的影响。这是一次典型的交流：在接受采访时，距离美国大选还有三周的时间，所以我们来谈谈。 “ [特朗普]曾在人类上演过最糟糕的本能，对我来说那简直就是恶心。彼夫是总统！”他说，理由是“回到未来”的恶霸Biff Tannen模仿了特朗普。</p><p> I ask how he felt during the 2016 campaign when  Trump mocked the New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability. “When you see your particular group mocked, it’s such a gut punch. It’s so senseless and cheap. There’s no way I get up in the morning and mock orange people,” he says, and then makes the grin that, for those of us who grew up watching him in the 1980s and 90s, is our Proustian madeleine.</p><p>我问他在2016年竞选活动中特朗普嘲笑《纽约时报》记者塞尔吉·科瓦列斯基（Serge Kovaleski）时的感受。 “当您看到您的特定小组被嘲笑时，这真是直截了当。它是如此的无聊又便宜。他说，然后笑着说，对于那些在1980年代和90年代长大看他的人来说，他们就是我们的普鲁斯特马德琳。</p><p> Back in the mid-80s, Fox was one of the biggest stars in the world. He was in the TV sitcom  Family Ties, playing the Reaganite son of a pair of hippies, and the lead in the most successful movie of 1985, which was, of course,  Back To The Future. It was a meteoric rise for a former army brat who, only a few years earlier, had dropped out of high school in Vancouver to become an actor in Los Angeles. Fox’s parents couldn’t afford a colour TV until the mid-70s, by which point he was already appearing on Canadian TV shows, having taken himself off to auditions as a teenager.</p><p> 早在80年代中期，福克斯就是世界上最大的明星之一。他曾在电视情景喜剧《 Family Ties》中饰演一对嬉皮士的里根人儿子，并且是1985年最成功的电影（当然是《回到未来》）的主角。对于一个前小伙子来说，这是一个飞速的崛起，仅仅几年前，他从温哥华的高中辍学，成为洛杉矶的演员。福克斯的父母要等到70年代中期才买得起彩色电视机，那时他已经在加拿大的电视节目中露面，十几岁的时候就参加了试镜。</p><p> From the start, Fox had terrific screen presence, partly because of his athleticism. As a kid, his small size belied his hockey talents (“It’s a Canadian thing”), and directors quickly spotted his gift for physical comedy: think of when he dances to  Surfing USA on top of the van in Teen Wolf, or how he tries to mirror James Woods in the bafflingly underrated 1991 comedy  The Hard Way. And most of all, think of  the skateboarding,  the guitar-playing and all that  frantic running in Back To The Future. So for Fox to get an illness that affected his bodily control was an irony that was not lost on him. “I had always liked being an actor that editors would cut to at any time for an appropriate reaction – my character would be  animated and engaged. Gradually, with the effects of Parkinson’s, my face began retreating to a passive, almost frozen disposition,” he writes in No Time Like The Future.</p><p> 从一开始，福克斯就在银幕上表现出色，部分原因是他的运动能力。小时候，他的身材小巧地掩盖了曲棍球的才华（“这是加拿大的事情”），导演们很快发现了他的喜剧表演天赋：想想他何时在《少狼》的面包车上跳到冲浪美国，或者他如何试图在令人困惑的1991年喜剧《艰难之路》中模仿詹姆斯·伍兹。最重要的是，想想滑板，吉他演奏以及《回到未来》中所有疯狂的事情。因此，让福克斯患上影响他身体控制的疾病是一种具有讽刺意味的事情，但并没有使他失望。 “我一直很喜欢当演员，剪辑师会在任何时候做出适当的反应，因为我的角色会充满生气和参与度。逐渐地，在帕金森氏症的影响下，我的脸开始退缩到一种被动的，几乎冰冷的性格。”</p><p>  But, I tell Fox, I think he’s done some of his best acting since his diagnosis, especially as the  slippery lawyer  Louis Canning in The Good Wife, who exploits his disability to win his cases; and as the  pill-popping paraplegic Dwight on his friend Denis Leary’s show,  Rescue Me (he was nominated for three Emmys for The Good Wife, and won for Rescue Me.) “It’s like my walking. I used to walk fast, but every step is now like a frigging math problem, so I take it slow. And with acting, I used to race to the punchline. But I started to really pay attention because I couldn’t just skate over any moment.” Since 2018, he has had to put a pause on the acting. “If something changes, great, or maybe I can figure out how to do it a different way,” he says, but sounding more as if this is for my benefit than an actual expectation.</p><p>  但是，我告诉福克斯（Fox），我认为他自从被诊断出以来就表现最好，尤其是《好妻子》（The Good Wife）中的溜滑律师路易斯·坎宁（Louis Canning），他利用自己的残疾赢得了诉讼。就像在他的朋友丹尼斯·里里（Denis Leary）的表演中令人吃惊的截瘫药德怀特（Dscight）一样，抢救我（他因《好妻子》获得三项艾美奖提名，并因《抢救我》而获胜。）“就像我走路一样。我曾经走得很快，但现在的每一步都像是一个难以解决的数学问题，所以我慢慢来。演戏时，我常常冲向终点线。但是我开始真正地注意，因为我无法随时滑冰。”自2018年以来，他不得不暂停表演。他说：“如果事情有所改变，那就太好了，或者也许我可以想出一种不同的方式来做这件事。”但是听起来这似乎是对我有利，而不是实际的期望。</p><p> Fox felt uniquely prepared for lockdown. “All the virtual meetings and keeping 5ft away from people? I do that anyway,” he says. One of the most poignant moments in his book comes when he describes making a surprise visit to his mother on her 90th birthday, and his fear of knocking her over due to his worsening balance. “That is difficult. But Parkinson’s is harder for the people around me than it is on me. The wide variety of movement, from being frozen to careening down the street like a pinball, yeah, that’s hard. But in terms of my feelings about the progress of it, that’s just my situation,” Fox says.</p><p> 福克斯感到为锁定做好了独特的准备。 “所有虚拟会议都与人们保持5英尺远吗？无论如何，我做到了。”他说。他的书中最令人伤心的时刻之一是，他描述了在母亲90岁生日时突然拜访母亲，以及由于平衡状况恶化而担心打倒母亲的恐惧。 “那很难。但是帕金森氏症对我周围的人来说比对我来说更难。从冻结到像弹子弹般在街上走来走去，各种各样的动作都很难。但是就我的进度而言，这只是我的情况。”福克斯说。</p><p> His optimism has, he says, “dimmed or softened” over the years, maybe because of age, maybe because of the inexorable progress of the disease. But one thing that has not changed is his refusal to be self-pitying. “I just don’t see the upside in extracting sympathy from people, or leading with your vulnerability. I need to be understood before I’m helped, because you have to get me before you can get me there,” he says. Pollan, his wife, is not, he says, “all soft-eyed, like, ‘Are you OK?’ She’s like, ‘Are you really wearing that shirt?’”</p><p> 他说，多年来，他的乐观情绪“变暗或减弱了”，这可能是因为年龄大，或者是因为疾病的无情发展。但是没有改变的一件事是他拒绝自发。 “我只是没有看到从人们那里得到同情或导致脆弱的机会。在获得帮助之前，我需要先了解我，因为您必须先得到我，然后才能到达那里。”他说。他说，他的妻子波伦不是“全神贯注，例如，‘你还好吗？’她的意思是‘你真的穿着那件衬衫吗？’”</p><p> Because you’re not a patient to her, you’re her husband. “Exactly,” he says, with a relieved grin: I have understood him.</p><p> 因为您不是她的病人，所以您是她的丈夫。 “是的，”他笑着说：我已经理解他了。</p><p> If you show a kid today Back To The Future, they get it. It’s this thing that’s timeless</p><p>如果您今天给孩子看《回到未来》，他们就会明白。这是永恒的东西</p><p> This aversion to self-pity nearly kiboshed the book when coronavirus hit, because, he says, “I couldn’t write about myself and my inner wahhhh when the world is falling apart.” (His publishers disagreed and told him, “Use the time to make your deadline.”) It would have been a real shame if he had junked it, because the book is great: moving but also properly funny (only Fox would take up golf  after developing Parkinson’s), and now that he has, to varying degrees, jettisoned the fig leaf of determined optimism, it gives the clearest description of life with Parkinson’s I’ve ever read. Ostensibly, it’s a memoir of his past few years, but Fox describes it more accurately as “an internal travelogue”. “I believe in all the hopeful things I said before,” he says. “But that all seems silly when you’re lying on the floor, waiting for the ambulance because you broke your arm, and you feel like an idiot because you told everyone you’d be fine and you’re not,” he says.</p><p> 这种对自怜的厌恶几乎在冠状病毒袭击时使这本书ki不休，因为他说：“当世界崩溃时，我无法写关于自己和我内心的感觉。” （他的出版商不同意并告诉他，“花点时间来规定截止日期。”）如果他不喜欢这本书，那真是太可惜了，因为这本书很棒：既有趣又有趣（只有福克斯会打高尔夫球）在发展了帕金森氏症之后，现在他已经在不同程度上抛弃了坚定的乐观无花果叶，这是我所读过的帕金森氏症最清晰的人生描述。表面上看，这是他过去几年的回忆录，但福克斯将它更准确地描述为“一次内部旅行”。他说：“我相信我之前说过的所有充满希望的话。”他说：“但是，当您躺在地板上，因为伤了手臂而等待救护车时，这一切看起来都是愚蠢的，因为您告诉所有人，你会没事的，而你却不是，所以你感觉像个白痴。”</p><p> But how could he have known? By dint of having Parkinson’s, Fox has had to become the public’s and his family’s guide to the illness – the world’s highest-profile expert on it, even. But in truth, he’s just figuring it out as he goes along. “Yeah, I’m not playing this on TV,” he laughs. It must have been strange seeing his son – who looks so much like him – go past the age of 29, and to see how obscenely young he was when he was diagnosed, I say.</p><p> 但是他怎么知道？由于拥有帕金森氏症，福克斯不得不成为公众及其家人的疾病指南-即使是世界上知名度最高的专家。但实际上，他只是在继续前进时才弄清楚。 “是的，我不是在电视上播放，”他笑着说。我说，看到他的儿子-看起来很像他-超过29岁，看看他被诊断出的年龄多么卑鄙，一定很奇怪。</p><p> “Oh yeah, I was a baby. It took me a long time to get my act together and start addressing it,” he says. “It’s such an insidious disease, because when you’re first diagnosed, what you’re presenting is relatively minor. I had a twitching pinky and a sore shoulder. They said, ‘You won’t be able to work in a few years,’ and I’m thinking, ‘From this?’”</p><p> “哦，是的，我还很小。我花了很长时间才使我的行为团结起来并开始解决。”他说。 “这是一种潜伏的疾病，因为当您初次被诊断出病时，所呈现的症状相对较小。我抽动着小指，肩膀酸痛。他们说：“几年后您将无法工作。”我在想，“是从这里来的？”</p><p> When Fox was diagnosed, he had been married for three years and his son, Sam, was a toddler. At first, he couldn’t believe it; then he tried to figure out why. It is believed that a combination of  genetic and environmental factors, such as pesticides and pollution, may cause Parkinson’s; Fox later learned that at least four cast members of  Leo &amp; Me, a Canadian TV show he starred in as a teenager, also developed early-onset Parkinson’s. “But believe it or not, that’s not enough people to be defined as a cluster, so there hasn’t been much research into that. But it is interesting. I can think of a thousand possible scenarios: I used to go fishing in a river near paper mills and eat the salmon I caught; I’ve been to a lot of farms; I smoked a lot of pot in high school when the government was poisoning the crops. But you can drive yourself crazy trying to figure it out.”</p><p> 当福克斯被诊断出时，他已经结婚三年了，儿子萨姆还是个小孩。起初，他不敢相信。然后他试图找出原因。人们认为，遗传和环境因素（例如农药和污染）的结合可能会导致帕金森氏症。福克斯（Fox）后来获悉，他十几岁时出演的加拿大电视节目《狮子与我》（Leo＆Me）的至少四位演员也开发了早起的帕金森氏症。 “但不管您相信与否，将其定义为一个集群的人还不够多，因此对此的研究还很少。但这很有趣。我可以想到一千种可能的情况：我曾经在造纸厂附近的一条河里钓鱼，吃掉了我捕获的鲑鱼。我去过很多农场；政府高中毒时，我在高中时抽了很多锅。但是您可能会想尽办法使自己发疯。”</p><p> Eventually his symptoms became sufficiently noticeable that he had to quit his sitcom Spin City (for which he won three Golden Globes and an Emmy), and make his diagnosis public. He established the  Michael J Fox Foundation, which helped sustain his optimism, and in two decades raised more than $1bn for research. It is one of the most high-profile and effective organisations fighting for a cure.</p><p> 最终，他的症状变得足够明显，以至于他不得不退出情景喜剧“旋转之城”（为此他赢得了三个金球奖和一个艾美奖），并公开了他的诊断。他成立了迈克尔·J·福克斯基金会（Michael J Fox Foundation），这有助于维持他的乐观态度，并在二十年内筹集了超过10亿美元的研究资金。它是争取治愈的最著名和最有效的组织之一。</p><p>  The ultimate source of his motivation is Pollan. The couple met in 1985 on the set of Family Ties, when she guest-starred as his girlfriend. One day on a lunch break, Fox – a rising star and cocky with it – teased her about her garlic breath. Instead of being intimidated, Pollan snapped back: “That was mean and rude and you are a complete and total fucking asshole.” Fox fell in love instantly. She has helped keep him in line ever since, and he says she got him out of his depressive slump in 2018. She is, clearly, a hell of a woman. Four years after Fox’s diagnosis, they had their twin daughters, Schuyler and Aquinnah. After the twins’ fifth birthday – and only two years after he’d had brain surgery to quell the tremors on his left side (it worked, but with Parkinson’s characteristic cruelty, the tremors then moved to his right side) – Pollan told Fox she wanted another baby; their youngest, Esme, was born in 2001. I tell Fox that after my twins’ fifth birthday, I didn’t want another child, I wanted a Valium.</p><p>  他动力的最终来源是波伦。 1985年，这对夫妇在家庭亲密关系中相识，当时她以客人的身份出演他的女友。在午餐休息的一天，福克斯-一个冉冉升起的新星，并以此为傲-嘲笑她的大蒜味。波伦没有被吓倒，反而回头道：“那是卑鄙而无礼的，你是一个完整而彻底的混蛋。”福克斯立刻坠入爱河。从那以后，她一直在帮助他保持一致，他说她在2018年摆脱了抑郁症的困扰。显然，她是一个女人的地狱。福克斯被诊断出病情四年后，他们有了双胞胎女儿舒勒和阿奎那。在双胞胎五岁生日之后–仅仅两年后，他进行了脑部手术以平息左侧的震颤（虽然有效，但由于帕金森的残酷行为，震颤才移至右侧）– Pollan告诉福克斯想要另一个孩子；他们最小的孩子埃斯梅（Esme）出生于2001年。我告诉福克斯，在我双胞胎五岁生日后，我不想再要一个孩子，我想要一个安卡拉（Valium）。</p><p> “Ah, it was getting too quiet at home. We knew it needed to be noisier,” he smiles. No Time Like The Future is studded with memories of big family holidays, neither Fox nor Pollan letting the Parkinson’s hold them back. Although that, too, is starting to change: the family trips to the beach have become tricky, as it’s hard for Fox to walk around. But he’s still determined to go on one soon, with Pollan to St Barts: “Sometimes I write cheques I can’t cash, but what the hell,” he shrugs.</p><p>“啊，家里太安静了。我们知道它需要吵闹，”他微笑着。福克斯（Fox）或波伦（Pollan）都不让帕金森氏族（Pakinson's）忍受大家庭假期的回忆。尽管这种情况也开始改变：由于福克斯（Fox）很难走动，家庭前往海滩的旅行变得棘手。但是他仍然决心尽快与波兰人一起去圣巴茨：“有时候我写支票我不能兑现，但到底是什么，”他耸了耸肩。</p><p> I came to a place of gratitude. Finding something to be grateful for is what it’s about</p><p> 我来到一个感恩的地方。找到值得感激的东西是关于</p><p> Another factor that has helped is the wealth Fox reaped when he was younger, not least from Back To The Future. But he nearly wasn’t in that film at all. Eric Stoltz was originally cast as Marty McFly, until director Robert Zemeckis realised Stoltz didn’t have what was later described as  “the screwball energy”  Marty needed, and he knew which actor did. Fox has never resented being so defined by one film, but for a long time he was bemused by Back To The Future’s impact. “It’s only recently that I’ve begun to understand it. I showed my son Sam movies from that time which I loved – 48 Hrs,  The Jerk – and he didn’t get them. But if you show a kid today Back To The Future, they get it. It’s this thing that’s timeless, which is ironic because it’s about time,” he says.</p><p> 另一个有用的因素是福克斯年轻时获得的财富，尤其是《回到未来》。但是他几乎根本不在那部电影中。埃里克·斯托尔茨（Eric Stoltz）最初是演员马蒂·麦克弗利（Marty McFly）的演员，直到导演罗伯特·泽米基斯（Robert Zemeckis）意识到斯托尔兹没有马提所需要的“螺旋力量”，他才知道哪个演员需要。福克斯从未对一部电影如此定义感到不满，但很长一段时间以来，他对《回到未来》的影响感到困惑。 “直到最近我才开始理解它。我给我的儿子山姆看了那段我喜欢的电影-48小时，《混蛋》，而他没有得到。但是，如果您今天给孩子看《回到未来》，他们就会明白。这件事是永恒的，具有讽刺意味的是，因为这是关于时间的，”他说。</p><p> A large part of that timelessness is down to Fox. His bright-eyed charm and, yes, screwball energy give the film a joyful momentum that makes it an enduring pleasure. For me, it is that rarest of things: a perfect movie, easily up there with  The Godfather and  Some Like It Hot. But there is one scene that has become more painful to watch as the years have passed.  Marty (Fox) is playing guitar at the school dance where his parents, George (Crispin Glover) and Lorraine (Lea Thompson), originally got together, but it looks as if that might not happen now. As George walks away, Marty’s fingers stop working as they should. Then his legs go, and he collapses on to the floor. “I can’t play,” he mutters, shocked. Just then, George kisses Lorraine, and Marty snaps up, as if on springs. He looks with relief at his now functioning hand, and then launches into his performance of Johnny B Goode. But life, as Fox says several times in his book, is not like a movie.</p><p> 永恒的大部分归功于Fox。他明亮的魅力以及不错的螺旋式力量使这部电影充满了欢乐的气息，使之持久。对我来说，这是最稀有的东西：一部完美的电影，可以和教父一起轻松地拍到。但是随着岁月的流逝，有一个场景变得更加令人痛苦。马蒂（福克斯）在学校舞蹈中弹吉他，他的父母乔治（克里斯平·格洛弗）和洛林（李·汤普森）最初在一起，但现在看来可能不会发生。当乔治走开时，马蒂的手指停止了按需工作。然后他的腿走了，他倒在地上。 “我不能玩，”他喃喃道，震惊。就在这时，乔治亲吻了洛林，马蒂跳起来，好像是在泉水上。他松了一口气，看着自己现在正在运转的手，然后开始表演Johnny B Goode。但是正如福克斯在书中多次说过的那样，生活并不像电影。</p><p>  What is the middle ground between optimism and despair? Before talking with Fox, I’d have suggested pragmatism, but that gets dangerously close to despair when you’re having to be pragmatic about a degenerative disease with, as yet, no cure. So Fox found a different path. “When I broke my arm, it was relatively minor, but that was the thing that destroyed me. I thought, what further indignity do I have to suffer? What have I done? Maybe I was wrong to think I couldn’t complain before, maybe optimism doesn’t work,” he says. There were, he says, some dark days spent lying on the sofa, but after a while he got bored. “Then I came to a place of gratitude. Finding something to be grateful for is what it’s about,” he says. Optimism is about the promises of the future, gratitude looks at the present. Fox has retrained his focus from running towards what will be, to seeing what is.</p><p>  乐观与绝望之间的中间立场是什么？在与Fox交谈之前，我曾建议过实用主义，但是当您不得不对一种退化性疾病务实而又无法治愈时，这种危险接近绝望。因此，福克斯找到了另一条路。 “当我摔断手臂时，它相对较小，但这就是摧毁我的事情。我以为，我还必须忍受什么侮辱？我做了什么？也许我以为自己以前不能抱怨是错误的，也许乐观是行不通的，”他说。他说，过去在沙发上度过了一些黑暗的日子，但过了一会儿他感到无聊。 “然后我来到了一个感恩的地方。找到真正值得感谢的东西，”他说。乐观是关于未来的希望，感恩是在眼前。福克斯将自己的注意力从重心转移到了将要发生的事情上，再到看到了什么。</p><p> He and Pollan spent lockdown on Long Island with all their children: Sam, 31, Schuyler and Aquinnah, 25, and Esme, 19. “We were always linger-after-dinner people anyway, and now we were lingering and talking about what people were going through. Doing jigsaws, Tracy cooking up a storm, everyone there, these wonderful children and this great wife,” he says. When Fox says “I can’t believe I have this life”, he is not referring to the restrictions of Parkinson’s – he is talking about his happy home.</p><p> 他和波伦（Lol and Pollan）和他们的所有孩子一起在长岛上度过了封锁：三岁的萨姆（Schuyler）和25岁的阿奎那（Aquinnah）和19岁的埃斯梅（Esme）。正在经历。他说：“做拼图游戏，特蕾西（Tracy）席卷一场风暴，那里的每个人，这些好孩子和这位太太”。当福克斯说“我不敢相信自己有这样的生活”时，他并不是在指帕金森氏症的限制，而是在谈论他的幸福之家。</p><p> We have now gone more than 40 minutes over the allotted time, and he repeatedly assures his assistant, who comes in to check, that he wants to keep talking. I tell him that since we last met I’ve interviewed pretty much every major player from  Back To The Future.</p><p> 现在，在指定的时间里，我们走了40多分钟，他反复向来检查的助手保证，他想继续讲话。我告诉他，自从上次见面以来，我几乎采访了《回到未来》中的每个主要参与者。</p><p> If you’d told me when I was diagnosed that I’d have this life now and do the things I do, I’d have said, ‘I’ll take it’</p><p>如果您告诉我，当我被诊断出现在已经拥有这种生活并做我所做的事情时，我会说，‘我会接受’</p><p> “How’s Crispin?” he asks, with palpable curiosity about his notoriously eccentric former co-star.  Pretty out there, I say, which is an understatement.</p><p> “克里斯平怎么样？”他好奇地问他臭名昭著的怪异前合唱演员。我说，就在那儿，这是轻描淡写。</p><p> “I haven’t spoken to Crispin since the movie, but I always liked him. I remember on the first movie, him and Bob Zemeckis really going at each other about this one scene: Crispin wanted to do it with a broom and Bob didn’t, and oh my God! The indignation! As soon as they moved on and it was safe, I poked my head out of the dressing room, and Chris [Lloyd] poked his head out, and we looked at one another and were like, ‘Thank God that was nothing to do with us!’” he says, bugging his eyes out, Christopher Lloyd-style.</p><p> “自从电影问世以来，我还没有和克里斯宾谈过话，但我一直很喜欢他。我记得在第一部电影中，他和鲍勃·泽米基斯（Bob Zemeckis）确实是在互相谈论这个场景：克里斯平（Crispin）想用一把扫帚去做，鲍勃没有，哦，天哪！愤慨！他们一动身，就算安全了，我就把头从更衣室里戳了出来，克里斯[劳埃德]把头戳了出来，我们互相看着，就像是，“谢谢上帝，这与我们！！”他说着，克里斯托弗·劳埃德（Christopher Lloyd）式地睁大了眼睛。</p><p> Lloyd is no slouch in the eccentricity department himself. When  I interviewed him in 2016, the one time he showed real, non-ironised emotion was when talking about Fox: “What he’s had to deal with, and he just moves ahead with humour and sensitivity. I was watching Back To The Future recently and I thought, ‘Wow, the way he moved… ’”</p><p> 劳埃德本人在偏心部门并不懈怠。当我在2016年采访他时，他有一次表现出真正的，不被讽刺的情感是在谈论福克斯时：“他必须面对的事情，他只是幽默和敏感。我最近在看《回到未来》，我想，“哇，他的移动方式……”</p><p> Marty and Doc’s friendship feels so real on screen that it has been homaged endlessly, including the cartoon  Rick And Morty. Were they close when they made the film? “We were both so focused on what we were doing, and I was also making Family Ties at the same time, so we didn’t really hang out. But we became close after the movies, and now we’re  really tight,” Fox says.</p><p> Marty和Doc的友谊在银幕上是如此真实，以至于受到无休止的敬意，包括动画片Rick And Morty。拍电影时他们关闭了吗？ “我们俩都专注于所做的事情，我也同时制作了“家庭关系”，所以我们并没有真正闲逛。但是我们在看完电影后变得很亲密，现在我们真的很紧张。”福克斯说。</p><p> By this point, I let my guard down so much that, to my horror, I hear myself telling Fox that, whenever anyone asks me who my favourite interviewee is, in my two decades of talking to celebrities, I always say him. I also burble that interviewing him in 2013 for ever changed my perspective of chronic illness and what constitutes a life well lived. He smiles the smile of a man who is used to hyperbolic compliments from strangers, but does not doubt their authenticity.</p><p> 在这一点上，我让自己的警惕性大大降低了，令我感到恐惧的是，我听到自己告诉福克斯，无论何时有人问我最喜欢的受访者是谁，在我与名人交谈的二十年中，我总是对他说。我也很粗暴地认为，2013年面试他永远改变了我对慢性病的看法，也改变了他过着好日子的生活。他微笑着一个习惯于陌生人夸夸其谈的男人的微笑，但不怀疑他们的真实性。</p><p> “This will sound strange, but  Eddie Van Halen passed away the other day, and he had a cameo in Back To The Future,” he says. (Van Halen played  the music that Marty plays to George, to convince him he’s being visited by an alien.) “My kids found a picture of me from 1983 with Eddie Van Halen, where I look 12, and he looks 14, and I thought, ‘What a cool life I’ve lived, where my kids can find a picture of me with Van Halen on the internet.’ It’s like looking back on footprints in the sand. Look where I’ve been.”</p><p> 他说：“这听起来很奇怪，但埃迪·范·哈伦（Eddie Van Halen）前一天去世了，他在《回到未来》（Back To The Future）中担任客串。 （范·海伦（Van Halen）演奏了马蒂（Marty）向乔治（George）演奏的音乐，以说服他正在被外星人拜访。想到：“我过着多么酷的生活，我的孩子们可以在网上与Van Halen一起在网上找到我的照片。”这就像在沙子上回望脚印一样。看看我去过的地方。”</p><p>  Does he ever watch his old movies? “I don’t. I might watch for a few minutes, then I change the channel. It’s just… ” he trails off. He changes the subject to Muhammad Ali, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in his early 40s and died in 2016. “I wondered what he thought when he saw old footage of him</p><p>他曾经看过他的老电影吗？ “我不。我可能会看几分钟，然后更改频道。只是……”他走开了。他将主题更改为穆罕默德·阿里（Muhammad Ali），他在40多岁时被诊断出患有帕金森氏症，并于2016年去世。</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/21/michael-j-fox-every-step-now-is-a-frigging-math-problem-so-i-take-it-slow">https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/21/michael-j-fox-every-step-now-is-a-frigging-math-problem-so-i-take-it-slow</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/michael/">#michael</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/fox/">#fox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/福克斯/">#福克斯</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
