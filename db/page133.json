The bug that\u2019s been fixed by the update didn\u2019t appear to have affected the Android version of the app.\n Before updating to the latest version, 11.34.1.35, the app would give me a message that something went wrong, before crashing to Springboard on my iPhone 12 Mini. Now, I\u2019m no longer getting the error, and have successfully been able to send a Snap.\n   The Snapchat Support Twitter account hasn\u2019t yet tweeted about the fix (despite  having a pinned tweet talking about the bug), but Snap\u2019s SVP of Product  has tweeted about the issue being fixed. Both myself and one of my co-workers tested the update, and it fixed the crashing issue for both of us.\n If your phone isn\u2019t automatically downloading the update, you can grab it yourself by going to the App Store, tapping on your profile picture in the top right corner, and pulling down to refresh. Any available updates should appear, and you can download them. If you turned off Auto-update to avoid the bugged version, you can turn it back on by going to Settings &gt; App Store, and then toggling App Updates on under Automatic Downloads.\n Update June 28th, 7:00PM ET:  Updated to reflect that the issue appears to have been fixed by an update from Snapchat.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,ios,app,\u4fee\u590d", "title": "snapchat\u8bf4\u5b83\u5df2\u4fee\u590d\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176iOS\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u7528\u6237\u624b\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898 ", "title_en": "Snapchat says it has fixed the issue causing its iOS app to crash for some users, asks users to manually update the app if they are still facing any problem", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554376/snapchat-ios-latest-update-crash-launch-not-working?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "ios", "app", "\u4fee\u590d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068550, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for improving the delivery of healthcare and medicine worldwide, but only if ethics and human rights are put at the heart of its design, deployment, and use, according to new WHO guidance published today. The report, Ethics and governance of artificial intelligence for health, is the result of 2 years of consultations held by a panel of international experts appointed by WHO. \u201cLike all new technology, artificial intelligence holds enormous potential for improving the health of millions of people around the world, but like all technology it can also be misused and cause harm,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. \u201cThis important new report provides a valuable guide for countries on how to maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its risks and avoiding its pitfalls.\u201d Artificial intelligence can be, and in some wealthy countries is already being used to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and screening for diseases; to assist with clinical care; strengthen health research and drug development, and support diverse public health interventions, such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and health systems management. AI could also empower patients to take greater control of their own health care and better understand their evolving needs. It could also enable resource-poor countries and rural communities, where patients often have restricted access to health-care workers or medical professionals, to bridge gaps in access to health services.However, WHO\u2019s new report cautions against overestimating the benefits of AI for health, especially when this occurs at the expense of core investments and strategies required to achieve universal health coverage.It also points out that opportunities are linked to challenges and risks, including unethical collection and use of health data; biases encoded in algorithms, and risks of AI to patient safety, cybersecurity, and the environment.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For example, while private and public sector investment in the development and deployment of AI is critical, the unregulated use of AI could subordinate the rights and interests of patients and communities to the powerful commercial interests of technology companies or the interests of governments in surveillance and social control. The report also emphasizes that systems trained primarily on data collected from individuals in high-income countries may not perform well for individuals in low- and middle-income settings. AI systems should therefore be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of socio-economic and health-care settings. They should be accompanied by training in digital skills, community engagement and awareness-raising, especially for millions of healthcare workers who will require digital literacy or retraining if their roles and functions are automated, and who must contend with machines that could challenge the decision-making and autonomy of providers and patients. Ultimately, guided by existing laws and human rights obligations, and new laws and policies that enshrine ethical principles, governments, providers, and designers must work together to address ethics and human rights concerns at every stage of an AI technology\u2019s design, development, and deployment.\u00a0\u00a0Six principles to ensure AI works for the public interest in all countriesTo limit the risks and maximize the opportunities intrinsic to the use of AI for health, WHO provides the following principles as the basis for AI regulation and governance:Protecting human autonomy: In the context of health care, this means that humans should remain in control of health-care systems and medical decisions; privacy and confidentiality should be protected, and patients must give valid informed consent through appropriate legal frameworks for data protection.Promoting human well-being and safety and the public interest. The designers of AI technologies should satisfy regulatory requirements for safety, accuracy and efficacy for well-defined use cases or indications. Measures of quality control in practice and quality improvement in the use of AI must be available. Ensuring transparency, explainability and intelligibility. Transparency requires that sufficient information be published or documented before the design or deployment of an AI technology. Such information must be easily accessible and facilitate meaningful public consultation and debate on how the technology is designed and how it should or should not be used. Fostering responsibility and accountability. Although AI technologies perform specific tasks, it is the responsibility of stakeholders to ensure that they are used under appropriate conditions and by appropriately trained people. Effective mechanisms should be available for questioning and for redress for individuals and groups that are adversely affected by decisions based on algorithms.Ensuring inclusiveness and equity. Inclusiveness requires that AI for health be designed to encourage the widest possible equitable use and access, irrespective of age, sex, gender, income, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, ability or other characteristics protected under human rights codes. Promoting AI that is responsive and sustainable. Designers, developers and users should continuously and transparently assess AI applications during actual use to determine whether AI responds adequately and appropriately to expectations and requirements. AI systems should also be designed to minimize their environmental consequences and increase energy efficiency. Governments and companies should address anticipated disruptions in the workplace, including training for health-care workers to adapt to the use of AI systems, and potential job losses due to use of automated systems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 These principles will guide future WHO work to support efforts to ensure that the full potential of AI for healthcare and public health will be used for the benefits of all.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8bbe\u8ba1,\u53d1\u5e03,global,warning",

", "note_en": "Sunnyvale-based, Israeli-founded JFrog is publicly traded on Nasdaq, where it went public last September, and currently it has a market cap of  $4.65 billion. Vdoo, meanwhile, had raised about $70 million from investors that include NTT, Dell, GGV and Verizon (disclaimer: Verizon owns TechCrunch), and when we covered its  most recent funding round, we estimated that the valuation was somewhere between $100 million and $200 million, making this a decent return.\n Shlomi Ben Haim, JFrog\u2019s co-founder and CEO, said that his company\u2019s turn to focusing deeper on security, and making this acquisition in particular to fill out that strategy, are a natural progression in its aim to built out an end-to-end platform for the DevOps team.\n  \u201cWhen we started JFrog, the main challenge was to educate the market on what we saw as most important priorities when it comes to building, testing and deploying software,\u201d he said. Then sometime around 2015-2016 he said they started to realize there was a \u201ccrack\u201d in the system, \u201ca crack called security.\u201d InfoSec engineers and developers sometimes work at cross purposes, as \u201cdevelopers became too fast\u201d the work they were doing was inadvertently led to a lot of security vulnerabilities.\n JFrog has been building a number of tools since then to address that and to bring the collective priorities together, such as its XRay product. And indeed, Vdoo is not JFrog\u2019s first foray into security, but it represents a significant step deeper into the hardware and systems that are being run on software. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important leap forward,\u201d Ben Haim said.\n For its part, Vdoo was born out of a realization as well as a challenging mission: IoT and other connected devices \u2014 a universe of some 50 billion pieces of hardware as of last year \u2014 represents a massive security headache, and not just because of the volume of devices: each object uses and interacts with software in the cloud and so each instance represents a potential vulnerability, with zero-day vulnerabilities, CVEs, configuration and hardening issues, and standard incompliances among some of the most common.\n While connected-device security up to now has typically focused on monitoring activity on the hardware, how data is moving in and out of it, Vdoo\u2019s approach has been to build a platform that monitors the behavior of the devices themselves on top of that, using AI to compare that behavior to identify when something is not working as it should. Interestingly, this mirrors the kind of binary analysis that JFrog provides in its DevOps platform, making the two complementary to each other.\n But what\u2019s notable is that this will give JFrog a bigger play at the edge, since part of Vdoo\u2019s platform works on devices themselves, \u201cmicro agents\u201d as the company has described them to me previously, to detect and repair vulnerabilities on endpoints.\n While JFrog has built a lot of its own business from the ground up, it has made a number of acquisitions to bolt on technology (one example:  Shippable, which it used to bring continuous integration and delivery into its DevOps platform). In this case, Netanel Davidi, the co-founder and CEO of Vdoo (who previously co-founded and sold another security startup, Cyvera,  to Palo Alto Networks) said that this was a good fit because the two companies are fundamentally taking the same approaches in their work (another synergy and justification for DevOps and InfoSec being more closely knitted together too I might add).\n \u201cIn terms of the fit between the companies, it\u2019s about our approach to binaries,\u201d Davidi said in an interview, noting that the two being on the same page with this approach was fundamental to the deal. \u201cThat\u2019s only the way to cover the entire pipeline from the very beginning, when they go you develop something, all the way to the device or to the server or to the application or to the mobile phone. That\u2019s the only way to truly understand the context and contextual risk.\u201d\n He also made a note not just of the tech but of the talent that is coming on with the acquisition: 100 people joining JFrog\u2019s 800.\n \u201cIf JFrog chose to build something like this themselves, they could have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the uniqueness here is that we have built the best security team, the best security researchers, the best vulnerability researchers, the best reverse engineers, which focus not only on embedded systems, and IoT, which is considered to be the hardest thing to learn and to analyze, but also in software artifacts. We are bringing this knowledge along with us.\u201d\n JFrog said that Vdoo will continue to operate as a standalone SaaS product for the time being. Updates that are made will be in aid of supporting the JFrog platform and the two aim to have a fully integrated, \u201cholistic\u201d product by 2022.\n Along with the deal,\u00a0JFrog reiterated financial guidance for the next quarter that will end June 30, 2021. It expects revenues of $47.6 million to $48.6 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $0.5 million to $1.5 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.00 to $0.01, assuming approximately 104 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For Full Year 2021, revenues are expected to be $198 million to $204 million,\u00a0with non-GAAP operating income between $5 million and $7 million and an approximately 3% increase in weighted average diluted shares. JFrog anticipates consolidated operating expenses to increase by approximately $9-10 million for the remainder of 2021, subject to the acquisition closing.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:15:35",

", "note_en": "Certain suppliers are asked to give Amazon the right to buy shares at potentially lower-than-market rates as part of their contract\n   Suppliers that want to land  Amazon.com    AMZN  -0.53%  as a client for their goods and services can find that its business comes with a catch: the right for Amazon to buy big stakes in their companies at potentially steep discounts to market value.\n  The technology-and-retail giant has struck at least a dozen deals with publicly traded companies in which it gets rights, called warrants, to buy the vendors\u2019 stock in the future at what could be below-market prices, according to corporate filings and interviews with people involved with the deals.\n  Amazon over the past decade also has done more than 75 such deals with privately held companies, according to a person familiar with the matter. In all, the tech titan\u2019s stakes and potential stakes amount to billions of dollars across companies that provide everything from call-center services to natural gas, and in some cases position Amazon among the top shareholders in those businesses.\n  The unusual arrangements offer another window into how Amazon uses its market heft to increase its wealth and clout. The company has been under growing  scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers over its competitive practices,  including with companies it partners with.\n  While the deals can benefit the suppliers by locking in big contracts, which can also boost their share prices, executives at several of the companies said they felt they couldn\u2019t refuse Amazon\u2019s push for the right to buy the stock without risking a major contract. The deals in some cases also give Amazon rights such as board representation and the ability to top any acquisition offers from other companies.\n  For Amazon, the arrangements give it a piece of the potential upside their vendors can get from doing business with one of the world\u2019s biggest companies.\n  Amazon routinely leverages its size and power to force terms that benefit itself, including by getting  partners in one business to sign on to its other services; learning about  up-and-coming technology companies through its venture-capital fund; or  creating top selling Amazon branded goods that compete with small sellers on its site. It has aggressively competed to wrest market share from rivals, which Amazon says results in better deals for shoppers.\n  In its supplier deals that include warrants, Amazon throws its weight around to exact lucrative terms, knowing many companies won\u2019t refuse, according to former Amazon executives who worked on the deals.\n  An Amazon spokeswoman said the warrants it obtains in commercial agreements are typically tied to milestones that Amazon has to meet, such as large purchases from the supplier. The company declined to comment on specific deals, or say how many warrants it has exercised or the amount of money it has made from such agreements. The spokeswoman said it has warrant deals in fewer than 1% of the commercial agreements it enters into.\n  Grocery distributor  SpartanNash  last year amended a contract with Amazon to deliver groceries to its Amazon Fresh arm. The Grand Rapids, Mich.-based company had been supplying Amazon with food since 2016, but this time Amazon added a condition: if it bought $8 billion worth of groceries over seven years, it could get warrants to purchase around 15% of SpartanNash\u2019s stock at a price potentially lower than the market. Amazon also said it wanted to be notified of any takeover offers for SpartanNash and have a 10-day window to offer a counterbid.\n    SpartanNash executives were taken aback, said people familiar with the matter. No customer had requested such terms before. Executives ultimately decided they didn\u2019t want to haggle with one of SpartanNash\u2019s biggest customers, and that being tied to Amazon could raise their company\u2019s profile, one of the people said. Amazon received warrants in the company when the deal was announced that would amount to 2.5% of its stock if exercised. If it receives and exercises warrants for the additional 12.5%, according to the contract terms, it would be SpartanNash\u2019s second-largest shareholder after mutual-fund manager BlackRock Inc.\n    Amazon has been doing such deals with vendors for about a decade but has aggressively increased the practice in the past few years, said former Amazon executives and lawyers who worked on structuring the deals. In its latest quarterly report, the company valued its warrants at $2.8 billion, more than five times the level three years ago. Amazon doesn\u2019t disclose the value of stakes it owns as a result of exercising its warrants.\n  A broader measure of its warrants and the stakes it holds in companies through warrants, direct investment or other ways increased 10 times to $8.4 billion in that period, according to Amazon\u2019s quarterly filings.\n  Like stock options, warrants let the holder buy a company\u2019s shares at a set price during a set period. If the stock surpasses that strike price, the warrant holder can buy shares at a below-market price.\n  Corporate executives in a range of industries and lawyers said Amazon\u2019s push to get warrants as part of vendor deals is highly unusual. Warrant deals have more commonly been used by investors who back companies in financial trouble, in deals deemed high risk.\n    Former Amazon executives who worked on warrant deals said they found no direct precedent before the company began striking them. For a guide, an Amazon team sleuthed through financial documents from the 2008 financial crisis to find information about bank bailouts that involved warrants, one of the people said.\n  The Amazon spokeswoman pointed to a few examples of other companies striking warrant arrangements. In 2017,  Walmart  obtained warrants in  Plug Power  a few months after Amazon struck a commercial deal tied to warrants with the company. A Walmart spokeswoman said the company very infrequently obtains warrants in other companies. Plug Power declined to comment.\n  Some suppliers see granting Amazon warrants as a worthwhile competitive advantage.  Clean Energy Fuels  struck a deal with Amazon earlier this year that could give the larger company a 20% stake over the next decade, making it the No. 2 shareholder. Management had never done a commercial deal where it gave the customer warrants, according to a person familiar with the matter, but Amazon had put out a large request for proposals from other natural-gas companies, and Clean Energy determined that accepting the terms of warrants would keep Amazon from choosing to do more business with competitors, the person said. As part of the terms, Clean Energy must notify Amazon if it receives a takeover offer, the person said. Clean Energy declined to comment.\n  Amazon\u2019s first major warrants deal with a publicly traded vendor came in 2016. Amazon was seeking a partner with cargo planes to help build out its massive logistics network. Executives reasoned that the company\u2019s potential partners were all smaller, lesser-known companies with stagnant growth, and that a major contract from Amazon would invigorate their stocks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Amazon wanted some of that potential upside, the person said.\n  Amazon proposed a deal, with warrants, to Wilmington, Ohio-based  Air Transport Services Group  The aircraft-leasing company initially pushed back on the warrant stipulation, according to people familiar with the matter. Its team flew to Seattle and had \u201cintense, protracted negotiations\u201d where Amazon got ATSG to agree to the structure, one of the people said. \u201cIt took a lot of convincing,\u201d the person said. Amazon currently owns around 19.5% of ATSG, making it the biggest shareholder.\n      Amazon executives knew it would need to lease many more planes to handle explosive growth in its delivery operation, and the initial warrant deal emboldened them to demand similar terms from other companies, said one of the people involved.\n  In talks with  Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings  Amazon broached a 10-year leasing deal, with similar terms. This time Amazon demanded warrants that would amount to up to 20% of Atlas\u2019s equity over five years\u2014with an option for 10% more later\u2014depending on how much business it gave Atlas. Amazon also wanted the right to elect a director to Atlas\u2019s board, after meeting certain milestones.\n  People involved on both sides said that warrants were a condition of Amazon partnering with Atlas. \u201cThere was definitely a sense that if it wasn\u2019t agreed to there wouldn\u2019t be a deal,\u201d said one of the people. Atlas executives didn\u2019t want to pass up the revenue opportunity from Amazon and viewed giving up the warrants as the price of doing business with Amazon, said the person.\n  When it announced the deal in May 2016, Atlas lauded the deal, including the equity arrangement. Its share price soared 27% that day. Such jumps have been common when Amazon has done warrant deals with publicly traded suppliers\u2014SpartanNash\u2019s stock rose 26% on the day it announced its agreement.\n  The strike price for the Atlas warrants was $37.50, slightly below where the shares were trading before the deal was announced. Amazon later exercised warrants for 9% of Atlas\u2019 stock and sold the shares, according to an Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon declined to comment on how much it made on its sale of Atlas stock.\n    Atlas has never done a similar deal, according to the Atlas spokeswoman. Amazon never named a director to Atlas\u2019s board, she said.\n    Amazon also signed a vendor deal with  Cargojet  that included warrants. Cargojet didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n  Amazon often ties its warrants to how much business it gives a supplier. In a deal with Startek Inc., the Colorado-based call-center company agreed to give Amazon the right to acquire 20% of its shares if Amazon does $600 million of business with Startek over eight years. That would make Amazon Startek\u2019s second-largest shareholder, if it were to obtain the warrants and exercise them.

Amsterdam-based Flow Traders will provide liquidity to the platform.\n TP ICAP has broadened its footprint in global capital markets by offering new data and analytics services and rolling out new products.\n Dedicated crypto funds have seen record flows this year but major banks offering access must balance growing interest with the compliance headaches long associated with the cryptocurrency sector and increasing scrutiny by regulators.   read more\n Still, the move is the latest endorsement of the sector by Standard Chartered, whose venture capital unit said earlier this month it will set up a separate crypto brokerage and exchange platform in Britain and Europe, with Hong Kong&#39;s BC Technology Group  (0863.HK).   read more\n &#34;Investor interest in this new asset class has exploded dramatically in the last six to eight months,&#34; Duncan Trenholme, co-head of digital assets at TP ICAP, told Reuters. &#34;In most of our conversations with clients, they want a separation of custodial roles from execution capabilities which is opposite to the models that exist currently.&#34;\n TP ICAP launched bitcoin futures and options on CME in 2019 and now plans to launch other derivative products including total return swaps and non-deliverable forwards.\n The platform is awaiting approval by Britain&#39;s financial regulator. Neither Standard Chartered nor Fidelity Investments have invested in the platform, TP ICAP said.\n (This story refiles to add dropped letters to name in headline, 9th and 11th paragraphs)", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:14:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4ea4\u6613,\u8d27\u5e01,icap,\u52a0\u5bc6", "title": "\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684Interdealer\u7ecf\u7eaa\u4ebaTP ICAP\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u4fdd\u771f\u6295\u8d44\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7279\u8bb8\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ea4\u6613\u5e73\u53f0 ", "title_en": "TP ICAP, the world's largest interdealer broker, says it is launching a cryptocurrency trading platform with Fidelity Investments and Standard Chartered", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-icap-launch-crypto-trading-platform-with-fidelity-standard-chartered-2021-06-29/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ea4\u6613", "\u8d27\u5e01", "icap", "\u52a0\u5bc6"]}]
