I was in the Samarga River basin, a mountainous, roadless corner of the Russian Far East inhabited by indigenous Udege hunters, Amur tigers and—most importantly for me—Blakiston’s fish owls. These were the largest owls in the world; endangered giants that hunt for salmon in rivers and nest in enormous trees. Joined by Sergey Avdeyuk, an experienced woodsman, I was dipping my toe into my first year of fish owl fieldwork, the first of many. We were here to find fish owls to better understand their habitat needs so we could develop a conservation plan to protect them.</p><p>经过数周的耽搁，我终于狂奔了。我当时身处萨马尔加河流域，在俄罗斯远东地区的山区无人路旁，居住着土著的Udege猎人，阿穆尔虎，以及对我来说最重要的布拉基斯顿的鱼。它们是世界上最大的猫头鹰。濒临灭绝的巨人，他们在河流中捕捞鲑鱼，并在巨大的树木中筑巢。在经验丰富的伐木工人谢尔盖·阿夫德尤克（Sergey Avdeyuk）的陪同下，我开始专心从事鱼实地调查的第一年，这是许多年中的第一年。我们在这里找到鱼以更好地了解它们的栖息地需求，因此我们可以制定保护计划来保护它们。</p><p>  There were no roads here, so Sergey and I drove a snowmobile along the frozen river south of the small Udege village where we were based, and spent an afternoon searching the forest there for signs of fish owls. We found nothing, and paused an hour or so before dusk to drink hot tea from a thermos and chart our next steps. Sergey wanted to survey for owls calling downstream, from the far side of the river valley, so that we could listen from two places at once and maximize our survey coverage. He would leave me here, drive the snowmobile along the river another two to three kilometers south, then collect me on the way back to town. The sound of his receding machine carried far in the clear winter air, and I could hear the high whir of its engine long after it was out of sight.</p><p>  这里没有路，所以我和谢尔盖（Sergey）沿着我们所居住的小乌德格（Udege）村以南的冰冻河道开了一辆雪地摩托，花了一个下午在那儿的森林里搜寻鱼fish的迹象。我们什么也没发现，在黄昏之前停了一个小时左右，从热水瓶里喝热茶，并规划了下一步。谢尔盖（Sergey）想从河谷的远方调查猫头鹰叫下游处的猫头鹰，以便我们可以一次从两个地方收听，并最大程度地扩大调查范围。他会把我留在这里，沿着河往南再行驶两到三公里，然后乘雪上摩托车，然后在回城的路上接我。他的后退机器的声音在晴朗的冬天的空气中传开，在看不见它的引擎很久以后，我能听到它的高呼声。</p><p>  A light wind moved through the treetops, rattling the bare canopies of aspen, birch, elm and poplar and occasionally gathering strength and dropping to gust brashly just above the frozen river. I listened under the sound of the wind for the distinctive call of the fish owl. Fish owls hoot at frequencies in the low-200-hertz range, in the same ballpark as a great gray owl and twice as low as a great horned owl. In fact, the frequency is so low that the sound can be difficult to capture well with a microphone.</p><p>  一阵微风吹过树梢，使白杨，桦木，榆树和白杨树的裸露树冠嘎嘎作响，偶尔会聚集力量，并在冰冻的河水之上猛烈地跌落到阵风。我听着风声听着鱼猫头鹰的独特叫声。鱼的鸣叫频率在200赫兹以下，与一只大灰在同一范围内，比一只大角低两倍。实际上，频率是如此之低，以至于很难用麦克风很好地捕捉声音。</p><p>  On the tapes I’d later make, the owls always sounded far away, muffled, lost, even if they were close by. The low frequency of the vocalizations served a purpose: it ensured that sound passed cleanly through dense forest and could be heard some distance away, up to several kilometers. This was especially true in winter and early spring, when there was little tree cover and the crisp air facilitated movement of sound waves.</p><p>  在我稍后制作的录音带上，即使它们在附近，猫头鹰也总是听起来很遥远，低沉，迷失。发出声音的频率低是有目的的：它确保声音干净地穿过茂密的森林，并且可以在几公里外的远处听到。在冬季和初春时尤其如此，当时树盖很少，清新的空气促进了声波的运动。</p><p>  Fish owl pairs vocalize in duets. This is an uncommon attribute recognized in less than 4 percent of bird species globally, most of which are in the tropics. The male usually initiates a fish owl duet, filling an air sac in his throat until it’s swollen like some monstrous, feathered bullfrog. He holds that position, the white patch of his throat now a conspicuous orb contrasting against the browns of his body and the grays of the gathering dusk, a signal to his mate that the vocalization is impending. After a moment he exhales a short and wheezy hoot—the sound of someone having the breath knocked out of him—and she answers immediately with one of her own, but deeper in tone. This is unusual among owl species, where females usually have the higher voice. The male then pushes out a longer, slightly higher hoot, which the female also responds to. This four-note call-and-response is over in three seconds, and they repeat the duet at regular intervals for anywhere from one minute to two hours. It is so synchronized that many people, hearing a fish owl pair vocalize, assume it is one bird.</p><p>  鱼成对发声。在全球不到4％的鸟类中，这是一种罕见的属性，其中大多数在热带地区。雄性通常会发动一条鱼猫头鹰二重唱，在他的喉咙中充满一个气囊，直到它像一些巨大的羽毛牛蛙一样肿胀为止。他保持着这个姿势，嗓子的白色斑块现在变成了明显的球体，与他的身体的褐色和聚集的黄昏的灰色形成了鲜明的对比，这向他的同伴发出了发声即将到来的信号。片刻之后，他呼出一声短暂而喘息的声音-有人屏住呼吸的声音-她立刻用自己的声音回答，但语气更深。在猫头鹰物种中这是不寻常的，在猫头鹰物种中，雌性通常具有较高的声音。雄性然后发出更长，更高的higher声，雌性也做出反应。这个四音符的呼叫和响应在三秒钟内结束，他们以固定的间隔重复二重奏，时间从一分钟到两个小时不等。它是如此的同步，以至于许多人听到一对鱼猫头鹰发声，认为它是一只鸟。</p><p>    The duet is both a territorial call and a pair bond affirmation. The frequency of duets follows an annual cycle, with the most active vocalizations occurring in February during the breeding period. Duet bouts can be long during this time, lasting for hours, and can be heard throughout the night. Once a female is incubating eggs, however, in March, these calls are most often heard only at dusk, perhaps because the birds are reluctant to advertise their nest location. Duets increase again as their young hatch and fledge but, by summer, begin to diminish in frequency again until the next breeding season.</p><p>    二重奏既是领土号召，也是对债权的确认。二重奏的频率遵循一个年度周期，最活跃的发声发生在繁殖期的二月。在此期间，二重奏可能会持续很长时间，持续数小时，并且整夜都可以听到。然而，一旦雌鸟在3月孵化卵，通常只会在黄昏时听到这些叫声，这可能是因为这些鸟不愿宣传其巢穴位置。由于幼鱼的孵化和成年，它们的二重体再次增加，但是到了夏天，到下一个繁殖季节，二重体的频率又开始减少。</p><p>  I had some concern that the strengthening wind might cut through my insulation as I waited, still and exposed. I spotted a massive log half-buried in snow about a hundred meters away, a large tree that had been uprooted in some storm and carried there by flood. I used my feet to dig out and pound down a shallow depression in the snow by the tree’s base and crouched there to take shelter from the wind, largely concealed by roots and shadow.</p><p>  我有些担心，在等待，静止和暴露时，强风可能会穿透隔热层。我在大约一百米外的雪地里发现了一块埋在雪中的巨大原木，这棵大树在一场暴风雨中连根拔起，被洪水淹没。我用脚挖出来，在树底的雪地上的浅洼处打了个碎，然后蹲在那里躲避风，被树根和阴影遮盖了。 </p><p>  About a half hour later, focused on the joy and crunch of some hard candies I’d found in my pocket, I did not hear the roe deer approaching. It burst into view not more than 50 meters off, finding purchase on the hard crust of river ice and bounding upriver, a hunting dog at its heels. The gasping deer approached a section of deep, open river, about three meters wide and 15 meters long, and without pausing plowed into the water. Perhaps it had intended to jump clear across but too late realized it lacked the strength to do so. The dog stopped short and bayed with exposed teeth. I was frozen in place. From my low vantage point among the roots, I could see only the deer’s head—snout held high and nostrils flared—bobbing above the clean line of the river surface.</p><p>大约半小时后，我专注于我在口袋里发现的一些坚硬糖果的欢愉和紧缩感，没有听到the接近。它在不超过50米的距离内突入视野，在坚硬的河冰地壳和上游河道（紧随其后的猎狗）上找到了购买物。喘着粗气的鹿接近一段深的，宽阔的河，宽约三米，长十五米，没有停在水里。也许它打算跳过它，但是为时已晚，它没有这样做的力量。那只狗停了下来，露出牙齿咬着。我被冻结在原地。从我的低矮根源中，我只能看到那只鹿的头-高高的鼻子和鼻孔张开-在河面干净的线上方摆动。</p><p>  The deer pushed briefly against the flow and then succumbed to it, drifting like a rudderless boat, then disappearing from view at the downstream lip of ice. I stood up for a better view and saw only the open wound of quiet, rushing water. I envisioned the deer in the darkness beneath the ice, water likely filling its lungs, a victim of the Samarga floating serenely seaward, the winter and village dogs now irrelevant. The dog noticed my movement and pivoted toward me with ears erect and a quivering, questioning muzzle. It dismissed me as an unknown human, then refocused its attention on the exposed river, sniffing at it before trotting back downstream.</p><p>  鹿短暂地推向水流，然后屈服于水流，像无舵船一样漂流，然后在下游的冰唇处消失。我站起来欣赏更好的景象，只看到安静的水流的开放伤口。我设想这只鹿在冰下的黑暗中，水可能充满其肺部，萨马拉加（Samarga）的受害者静静地向海漂浮，冬天和乡村犬现在无关。那只狗注意到了我的动作，并竖立着耳朵，颤抖着，质疑着枪口，向我旋转。它把我当作一个陌生的人解散了，然后将注意力重新集中在裸露的河上，在向下游小跑之前嗅了一下它。</p><p>  I returned to my tree hole, stunned by the quiet violence of this place. Primeval dichotomies still outlined existence on the Samarga: hungry or satiated, frozen or flowing, living or dead. A slight deviation could tip the scales from one state of being to the other. A villager might drown because he went fishing in the wrong spot. A deer evaded capture by a predator only to find death anyway because of a misstep. The line between life and death here could be measured in the thickness of river ice.</p><p>  我回到了这个树洞，被这个地方的安静暴力所震惊。 Samarga上仍然存在原始的二分法：饥饿或饱足，冰冻或流淌，生死。轻微的偏差可能会使音阶从一种状态转移到另一种状态。村民可能会因为在错误的地点钓鱼而淹死。一只鹿逃避了捕食者的捕获，但无论如何还是因为失误才发现死亡。这里生死之间的界线可以用河冰的厚度来衡量。</p><p>  A muted tremor in the air pulled me from my thoughts. I sat up and took off my hat to expose my ears. After a protracted silence I heard the sound again: a distant, muffled tremor. But was it a fish owl? It must have been quite far across the river valley, and I could really hear only one note, maybe two, not the four I was expecting. I had a sense of what a fish owl sounded like only from Sergey’s coarse mimicries, and it was hard to evaluate the quality of their hoots without the real thing to compare it with. What I was hearing now didn’t really match. Perhaps this was just a single fish owl—not a pair? Or maybe a Eurasian eagle owl? But those owls had higher voices than what I was hearing and did not duet. The sound repeated every few minutes or so, until the gradual, almost imperceptible transition from day to night was complete. In the dark, the vocalizations ceased.</p><p>  空气中柔和的颤抖使我摆脱了思绪。我坐起来，脱下帽子露出耳朵。长时间的沉默之后，我再次听到了声音：一种遥远，隐约的震颤。但这是鱼fish吗？穿过河谷一定已经很远了，我真的只能听到一个音符，也许是两个，而不是我所期望的四个。我感觉到只有在谢尔盖（Sergey）的粗略模仿下，鱼猫头鹰才听起来像是什么，而且如果没有真实的东西可以与之相比，很难评估它们的蹄子质量。我现在所听到的与实际情况不符。也许这只是一只猫头鹰，而不是一对？还是欧亚雕eagle？但是那些猫头鹰的声音比我听到的声音高，没有二重唱。声音每隔几分钟左右重复一次，直到从白天到晚上的逐渐，几乎不可察觉的过渡完成为止。在黑暗中，发声停止了。</p><p>  An undulating, high-pitched whine from downriver told me that Sergey was returning, and I soon saw the snowmobile’s single headlight casting its pale beam on the snow. “Well?” he said triumphantly as I came out to meet him. “Did you hear them?” I told him that I thought so, but maybe only one bird. He shook his head. “There were two—it was a duet! The female call is even lower than the male’s and harder to hear, so maybe you missed it.”</p><p>  一条来自下游的高低起伏的wh叫声告诉我，谢尔盖正在归来，我很快看到雪地摩托的单个前大灯将其苍白的光束投射在雪地上。 “好？”我出来见他时，他兴奋地说道。 “你听到了吗？”我告诉他我也这么认为，但也许只有一只鸟。他摇了摇头。 “有两个-那是二重奏！女性的电话比男性的电话低，而且听不清，所以也许您错过了。”</p><p>  Sergey possessed a highly perceptive sense of hearing—he could confidently discriminate far-off duets when all I could make out was the breathy higher voice of the male. Later, even when I was sure there was just one bird, we would sneak closer, and only then could I make out the female as well. Fish owls are non-migratory, enduring the summer heat and winter frosts in the same places, so if we heard a duet, that meant the pair was resident to that patch of forest. These were long-lived birds—there are records of wild fish owls more than 25 years old—so duetting owls were likely to be in the same place year in and year out. If we heard just one bird hooting, however, that might mean it was a bachelor owl looking for a territory or a mate. If we heard one today, it did not mean it would be there tomorrow, much less the next few years. We needed resident pairs for our study population: birds we could track over a long period.</p><p>  谢尔盖（Sergey）具有极强的听觉感知力-当我能分辨出雄性的呼吸音更高时，他可以自信地分辨远距离的二重奏。后来，即使我确定只有一只鸟，我们也会偷偷靠近，只有那时我才能认出雌鸟。鱼是非迁徙性的，在同一地方可以忍受夏季的高温和冬季的霜冻，因此，如果我们听到二重唱，则意味着这对是居住在那片森林中的。这些是长寿的鸟类-有超过25岁的野生鱼类猫头鹰的记录-因此，二元猫头鹰可能一年又一年都在同一地方。但是，如果我们只听到一只鸟在鸣叫，那可能意味着那是单身的猫头鹰在寻找领土或伴侣。如果我们今天听到一个声音，那并不意味着明天会出现，更不用说未来几年了。我们的研究人口需要居民对：我们可以长期追踪的鸟类。</p><p>  I told Sergey about the deer and the dog. He spat and shook his head incredulously. “I passed that animal! I met its owner fishing downriver. He said his team of dogs had killed five roe deer and three red deer today alone! He complained that rich city folk have been flying into the region all winter and shooting the deer; that’s why the woods were empty. Meanwhile, his unattended dog was drowning one!”</p><p>  我告诉了谢尔盖关于鹿和狗的事。他吐口水，难以置信地摇了摇头。 “我通过了那只动物！我遇到了它的主人垂钓下游地区。他说，仅今天，他的狗队就杀死了5头and鹿和3头红鹿！他抱怨说，富有的城市居民整个冬天都在飞入该地区并射杀鹿。这就是为什么树林是空的。同时，他的无人看管的狗快被淹死了！” </p><p>    This is the 18th post in an ongoing series, “East of Siberia.” It is adapted from  Owls of The Eastern Ice, (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux),  which reached the 2020  National Book Award for Nonfiction longlist, and which was named a New York Times Notable Book for 2020.
