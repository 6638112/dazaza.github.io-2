The house had 12-inch-thick walls with gun ports to defend against attackers: first Indians, then soldiers during the Civil War. At 12, Dad wrote a novel of the Old West. He taught himself to type with the Columbus method — find it and land on it — using one finger on his left hand and two fingers on his right. Dad typed swiftly and with great passion. In this fashion, he eventually wrote and published more than 400 books. Two were science fiction and 24 were fantasy, written under his own name; the rest were pornography, using 17 pseudonyms.</p><p>我的父亲安德鲁·杰斐逊·奥法特五世(Andrew Jefferson Offutt V)在肯塔基州泰勒斯维尔的一个小木屋里长大。这座房子有12英寸厚的墙壁和炮口，用来防御袭击者：首先是印度人，然后是南北战争期间的士兵。12岁时，爸爸写了一本关于旧西部的小说。他用哥伦布的方法自学打字--找到它并落在上面--左手用一根手指，右手用两根手指。爸爸打得很快，很有激情。就这样，他最终写并出版了400多本书。其中两部是科幻小说，24部是奇幻小说，用他自己的名字写的；其余的是色情作品，使用了17个笔名。</p><p> In the mid-1960s, Dad purchased several porn novels through the mail. My mother recalls him reading them with disgust — not because of the content, but because of how poorly they were written. He hurled a book across the room and told her he could do better. Mom suggested he do so. According to her, the tipping point for Dad’s full commitment to porn, five years later, was my orthodontic needs.</p><p>20世纪60年代中期，爸爸通过邮寄购买了几本色情小说。我母亲回忆说，他读这些书时感到厌恶--不是因为内容，而是因为它们写得太糟糕了。他把一本书扔过房间，告诉她他可以做得更好。妈妈建议他这么做。据她说，五年后，父亲对色情片的全身心投入的转折点是我的正牙需求。</p><p> When I was a kid, my teeth were a terrible mess: overlapping, crooked and protruding like fangs. Mom wanted to work part time and pay for braces. Dad suggested that if he quit his job as a salesman and she typed all his final drafts, they could finance my dental care. Over cocktails in the woods of eastern Kentucky, they formed a partnership to mass-produce porn.</p><p>当我还是个孩子的时候，我的牙齿乱七八糟：重叠、歪斜，像尖牙一样突出。妈妈想做兼职，付牙套的钱。爸爸建议，如果他辞去推销员的工作，她把他所有的终稿都打出来，他们就可以支付我的牙科护理费用。在肯塔基州东部的树林里喝着鸡尾酒，他们结成了合作伙伴，大规模制作色情作品。</p><p> Many of the early publishers used a “house name,” a pseudonym shared by several writers. It concealed identity, which writers preferred, while allowing the publisher to give the illusion of a single prolific author. This was an early attempt at branding, with proven success in other genres: westerns, romance and mystery. Dad didn’t mind. He had experimented with a literary mask at the University of Louisville, using different names for articles in the school paper, as well as in his own short fiction. A pseudonym for pornography provided literary freedom while also protecting the family’s reputation in our conservative Appalachian community.</p><p>许多早期的出版商都使用“家名”，这是几位作家共用的笔名。它隐藏了作家喜欢的身份，同时允许出版商给人一种单一多产作家的错觉。这是一次早期的品牌化尝试，在其他类型的电影中都被证明是成功的：西部片、浪漫和神秘。爸爸不介意。他曾在路易斯维尔大学(University Of Louisville)试验过文学面具，对校报和他自己的短篇小说中的文章使用了不同的名称。色情的笔名提供了文学自由，同时也保护了我们保守的阿巴拉契亚社区的家庭声誉。</p><p> My father’s first published novel was “Bondage Babes,” released by Greenleaf under the name Alan Marshall in 1968. His pay was $600. The plot was a clever conceit. Someone had murdered a model for a bondage shoot, and the model’s sister was investigating the crime by posing as a model herself, which allowed for soft-core descriptions of restrained women. Greenleaf published his next novel, “Sex Toy,” a book Dad referred to as “sensitive,” under the name J. X. Williams, followed by three other books under three other names.</p><p>我父亲出版的第一部小说是1968年格林利夫以艾伦·马歇尔的名字出版的“束缚的宝贝”。他的工资是600美元。这个阴谋是一个巧妙的自负。有人为了奴役拍摄谋杀了一名模特，而这名模特的妹妹正在通过自己假扮模特来调查这起犯罪事件，这使得对受约束的女性进行了软性的描述。格林利夫以J. X.Williams的名字出版了他的下一部小说“性玩具”，父亲称这本书为“敏感”，随后又以另外三个名字出版了另外三本书。</p><p> His primary pseudonym, John Cleve, first appeared on “Slave of the Sudan,” an imitation of Victorian pornography so precisely executed that the editor suspected my father of plagiarism. Dad found this extremely flattering. He concocted his pen name from John Cleland, author of “Fanny Hill,” considered the first erotic novel published in English. Over time, John Cleve evolved into more than a mere pseudonym. Dad regarded John Cleve as his alter ego, a separate entity, the persona who wrote porn. Dad was adamant that he did not have 17 pen names. Dad had John Cleve, to whom he referred in the third person. It was John Cleve who had 16 pseudonyms, in addition to his own wardrobe, stationery and signature.</p><p>他的主要笔名约翰·克里夫(John Cleve)第一次出现在“苏丹奴隶”(Slave of the苏丹)中，这是一部模仿维多利亚时代色情作品的作品，执行得如此精确，以至于编辑怀疑我父亲抄袭了我的作品。爸爸觉得这非常讨人喜欢。他的笔名取自“范妮·希尔”(Fanny Hill)的作者约翰·克莱兰(John Cleland)，这本书被认为是第一部用英语出版的色情小说。随着时间的推移，约翰·克里夫不仅仅是一个笔名。父亲认为约翰·克利夫是他的另一个自我，一个独立的实体，写色情作品的角色。爸爸坚持说他没有17个笔名。爸爸有约翰·克利夫，他用第三人称提到了他。约翰·克利夫除了自己的衣柜、文具和签名外，还有16个笔名。</p><p>  Dad soon began publishing with Orpheus, which paid him $800 a book. He invented John Denis, based on his favorite Reds players, Johnny Bench and Denis Menke, and switched to Midwood for more money. After a falling out with an editor over a title change, he returned to Orpheus. Later, Orpheus became irritated with Dad and stopped buying his work. Curious about the changing market, he read a dozen recent Orpheus books. Dad believed he’d influenced the industry to the point where his style was consistently copied, the proof being that other authors had begun writing knowledgeably of the clitoris, which he believed he pioneered. This upset him to the point that he decided to trick the editor into buying his work.</p><p>爸爸很快开始在俄耳甫斯出版社出版，每本书付给他800美元。他根据他最喜欢的红军球员约翰尼·本奇和丹尼斯·门克创造了约翰·丹尼斯，然后为了更多的钱转投米德伍德。在与一位编辑因改名而争吵之后，他回到了俄耳甫斯。后来，奥菲斯对爸爸很恼火，不再买他的作品。由于对不断变化的市场感到好奇，他读了十几本最近出版的“俄耳甫斯”(Orpheus)书籍。父亲认为他影响了这个行业，以至于他的风格一直被模仿，证据是其他作家已经开始对阴蒂进行有知识的写作，他认为这是他的先驱。这使他心烦意乱，以至于他决定欺骗编辑买下他的作品。</p><p> To get a different font, he bought a new ball for his Selectric typewriter. He changed his usual margins, used cheaper paper and churned out two books. He invented yet another pseudonym, Jeff Morehead, a variation of his middle name and the nearest town to our home. He asked a friend in another part of the country to submit the manuscripts to Orpheus. The editor bought both. Dad called the editor, told him that he was Jeff Morehead and suggested they get back in business. The editor concurred, and Dad stayed with Orpheus throughout the 1970s, using the name Jeff Morehead on books that he believed weren’t up to the high standards of John Cleve.</p><p>为了换一种不同的字体，他为他的电动打字机买了一个新球。他改变了通常的页边距，使用了更便宜的纸张，并大量出版了两本书。他又发明了一个笔名，杰夫·莫尔黑德，这是他中间名的一个变体，也是离我们家最近的一个小镇。他让国内另一个地方的一位朋友把手稿交给俄耳甫斯。编辑两个都买了。爸爸打电话给编辑，告诉他他是杰夫·莫尔黑德，并建议他们继续做生意。编辑同意了，父亲在整个70年代一直和俄耳甫斯在一起，在他认为没有达到约翰·克利夫的高标准的书上使用杰夫·莫尔黑德这个名字。</p><p> Grove Press published the Denis novel “The Palace of Venus” under its Zebra imprint in 1973. Dad sent them a new novel, “Vendetta,” which was rejected. But, the strength of the manuscript resulted in a phone call. Barney Rosset, Grove’s publisher, wanted a pornographic historical series about a single character during the Crusades. Dad was initially resistant, writing in a letter:</p><p>1973年，格罗夫出版社以斑马印记出版了丹尼斯小说“维纳斯的宫殿”。爸爸寄给他们一本新小说“复仇者”，但被拒绝了。但是，手稿的力量导致了一个电话。格罗夫的出版商巴尼·罗塞特(Barney Rosset)想要一部关于十字军东征期间单个人物的色情历史连续剧。父亲起初很抗拒，他在一封信中写道：</p><p> “I do not know if this is or could be my thing or not. I have difficulty with series. Like, I get bored and want to go back to creating. It is most difficult for me to write as if cranking the arm of a copy machine.” He continued: “Let us not bandy terms. I am an artist, whether these series books will be ‘art’ or not. ”</p><p>“我不知道这是不是我的事。我对连续剧有困难。就像，我厌倦了，想回去创作。对我来说，像拨动复印机的手臂一样写作是最难的。“。他接着说：“让我们不要纠缠不清。我是一个艺术家，不管这些丛书是不是“艺术”。“。</p><p> He was equally uncertain about visiting New York, a city he called Babylon-on-the-Hudson. Grove offered to cover all expenses, and Dad made the trip in 1973. He returned to Kentucky with a cash advance, a contract for an unwritten book and more autonomy than he’d ever had from a publisher. Dad had been buying Grove books for 15 years, and he revered Rosset’s courage in fighting the U.S. government on obscenity charges — and winning. The “Crusader” series sold well, and for the first time in his career he earned royalties.</p><p>他同样不确定是否要访问纽约，这座他称之为哈德逊河畔巴比伦的城市。格罗夫提出支付所有费用，爸爸在1973年进行了这次旅行。他带着现金预付款回到了肯塔基州，签了一本未写书的合同，并且比他从出版商那里获得的自主权更大。父亲购买格罗夫的书籍已经有15年了，他敬佩罗塞特与美国政府就淫秽指控进行斗争的勇气-并赢得了胜利。“十字军”系列卖得很好，在他的职业生涯中，他第一次获得了版税。</p><p> At the time, pornography was still a taboo business. Paperbacks were sold in the back rooms of adult theaters, on hidden racks at newsstands and at adult bookstores in cities. In less populated areas, people bought them through the mail. By 1986, the “Crusader” series was in danger of going out of print. Grove wanted to raise the price of Dad’s paperbacks one dollar and asked him to cut his royalty percentage in half. If my father didn’t agree, Grove couldn’t afford to renew the printings. Dad got mad and refused, allowing his books to go out of print over the sum of roughly $130 per year, the only professional decision he ever regretted.</p><p>当时，色情仍然是一个禁忌行业。平装书在成人影院的后室、报摊的隐蔽货架上和城市的成人书店出售。在人口较少的地区，人们通过邮寄购买。到1986年，“十字军”系列面临绝版的危险。格罗夫想把爸爸的平装书的价格提高一美元，并要求他将版税比例降低一半。如果我父亲不同意，格罗夫就负担不起续印的费用。爸爸很生气，拒绝了，让他的书以每年大约130美元的金额绝版，这是他唯一后悔的职业决定。</p><p> The commercial popularity of American erotic novels peaked during the 1970s, coinciding with my father’s most prolific and energetic period. Dad combined porn with all manner of genre fiction. He wrote pirate porn, ghost porn, science-fiction porn, vampire porn, historical porn, time-travel porn, secret-agent porn, thriller porn, zombie porn and Atlantis porn. An unpublished Old West novel opens with sex in a barn, featuring a gunslinger called Quiet Smith, without doubt Dad’s greatest character name. By the end of the decade, Dad claimed to have single-handedly raised the quality of American pornography. He believed future scholars would refer to him as the “king of 20th-century written pornography.” He considered himself the “class operator in the field.”</p><p>美国色情小说的商业热度在20世纪70年代达到顶峰，恰逢我父亲最多产、最精力充沛的时期。爸爸把色情和各种类型的小说结合起来。他写海盗色情、幽灵色情、科幻色情、吸血鬼色情、历史色情、时空旅行色情、特工色情、惊悚片色情、僵尸色情和亚特兰蒂斯色情。一部未出版的旧西部小说以谷仓里的性开始，主角是一个名叫安静史密斯的枪手，毫无疑问，他是父亲最伟大的角色名字。到了十年末，爸爸声称自己单枪匹马提高了美国色情作品的质量。他相信未来的学者会称他为“20世纪文字色情之王”。他认为自己是“该领域的班级操作员”。</p><p>  In the 1980s, John Cleve’s career culminated with a 19-book series for Playboy Press, the magazine’s foray into book publishing. The “Spaceways” series allowed him to blend porn with old-time “space opera,” reminiscent of the 1930s pulps, his favorite kind of science fiction. Dad’s modern twist included aliens who possessed the genitalia of both genders. Galactic crafts welcomed the species as part of their crews, because they were unencumbered with the sexual repression of humans and could service men and women alike. The books were popular, in part, because of their campiness, repeating characters and entwined stories — narrative tropes that later became standard on television. The “Spaceways” series ended in 1985, coinciding with the widespread ownership of VCRs. Men no longer needed “left-handed books” for stimulation when they could watch videotapes in their own homes. The era of written pornography was over.</p><p>20世纪80年代，约翰·克利夫(John Cleve)的职业生涯达到顶峰，为该杂志进军图书出版业的花花公子出版社(Playboy Press)出版了19本丛书。“太空通道”系列让他将色情与古老的“太空歌剧”融合在一起，这让他想起了他最喜欢的科幻小说--20世纪30年代的纸浆。父亲的现代特征包括拥有两性生殖器的外星人。银河飞船欢迎这个物种作为他们船员的一部分，因为他们不受人类性压抑的束缚，可以为男性和女性提供同样的服务。这些书很受欢迎，部分原因是它们的露营性、重复的人物和错综复杂的故事-这些叙事比喻后来在电视上成为标准。“太空通道”系列于1985年结束，恰逢录像机的广泛拥有。当男人可以在自己家里看录像带时，他们不再需要“左撇子书”来刺激。文字色情的时代已经过去了。</p><p> John Cleve retired. Dad insisted that he himself hadn’t quit, but that John Cleve had. It was more retreat than retirement, a slipping back into the shadows, fading away like an old soldier. Cleve had done his duty — the house was paid off, the kids were grown and the bank held a little savings.</p><p>约翰·克利夫退休了。爸爸坚持说他自己没有辞职，但约翰·克利夫已经辞职了。与其说是退休，不如说是撤退，退回到阴影中，像老兵一样渐渐消失。克利夫履行了他的职责--房子还清了，孩子们长大了，银行也存了一点存款。</p><p> Dad was 52. As Cleve, he published more than 130 books in 18 years. He turned to self-publishing and, using an early pseudonym, Turk Winter, published 260 more titles over the next 25 years.</p><p>父亲52岁。作为克里夫，他在18年内出版了130多本书。他转向自助出版，使用早期的笔名土耳其温特，在接下来的25年里又出版了260本书。</p><p> My father died in 2013, when I was 54. Dad was 17 when his own father died. Lacking an adult relationship with his father, he didn’t know how to proceed as his children aged. In 1984, his mother died, triggering concerns for his own mortality. He made formal arrangements with a lawyer for disposal of his estate, and he sent me a secret will with the sender’s name as Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The first paragraph began: “On you, Chris, I decided, this task and this onus must fall — and I’m telling the others this without the reason. . . . The examination of the office and disposal of its contents is totally up to you, Christopher J. Offutt, and this is oh-fficial.”</p><p>我父亲于2013年去世，当时我54岁。父亲去世时，他父亲17岁。由于缺乏与父亲的成人关系，随着孩子们的年龄增长，他不知道如何继续下去。1984年，他的母亲去世，引发了人们对他自己死亡的担忧。他与一位律师就处置他的遗产作出了正式安排，并向我发送了一份秘密遗嘱，上面写着寄件人的名字是道格拉斯·麦克阿瑟将军(Gen.Douglas MacArthur)。第一段是这样开始的：“克里斯，我决定，这项任务和责任必须落在你身上--我无缘无故地告诉其他人这一点。. . .。办公室的检查和内容的处理完全取决于你，克里斯托弗·J·奥法特，这是官方的。“。</p><p> I immediately wrote to my siblings, but they had no interest, long weary of our father’s secrets and his porn. When we were young, Dad played board games with us, taught us poker, hearts, and spades. He had a vast capacity to make us laugh. We adored him and begged him to play games after supper. He made our evenings fun. But as we got older and more mature, Dad remained the same. The humor slipped away from his oft-repeated gags. His deliberate naughtiness — when a dice roll came up six, he’d call it “sex” — evolved to outright sexual comments that produced a strained silence instead of laughter. Dad missed his attentive audience, but the old ways no longer worked. One by one we did the worst thing possible: We ignored him. I believe this hurt him deeply, in a way he didn’t fully comprehend and we certainly could not fathom. In turn, he ignored us. Now that he was dead, I could give him the attention he always craved by carefully examining his papers, including 30 unpublished novels.</p><p>我立即写信给我的兄弟姐妹，但他们没有兴趣，长期厌倦了我们父亲的秘密和他的色情作品。当我们还小的时候，爸爸和我们一起玩棋盘游戏，教我们扑克、红心和黑桃。他很能逗我们笑。我们崇拜他，求他晚饭后玩游戏。他让我们的夜晚变得很有趣。但是，随着我们年龄的增长和成熟，爸爸仍然是老样子。幽默从他经常重复的笑话中消失了。他故意的淘气-当掷骰子时，他会称之为“性”-演变成直截了当的性评论，导致紧张的沉默，而不是笑声。爸爸怀念他专心的听众，但旧的方式不再奏效。我们一个接一个地做了最坏的事情：我们忽视了他。我相信这深深地伤害了他，在某种程度上，他没有完全理解，我们当然也无法理解。反过来，他对我们不屑一顾。现在他去世了，我可以通过仔细检查他的论文，包括30本未出版的小说，给他一直渴望的关注。</p><p> After his death I returned to my childhood home in the hills of Kentucky. I spent a summer clearing the house my parents lived in for 50 years. Because of ill health, he hadn’t actually worked in his office in several years. Before that it was seldom cleaned beyond an occasional vacuuming and a light dusting as high as my mother could reach, which wasn’t far. The two windows were sealed shut by paint and swollen wood. Dust pervaded the dim room. My parents added a central air-conditioning unit a few years before, but the office vent was buried between a wall of bookshelves and a large steel filing cabinet. A narrow path wound between precarious stacks of porn, an outmoded printer, the first Macintosh computer, a broken typewriter and a 20-year old copy machine that didn’t work.</p><p>他去世后，我回到了我童年时在肯塔基州山上的家。我花了一个夏天清理我父母住了50年的房子。因为身体不好，他已经有几年没有在办公室工作了。在此之前，除了偶尔用吸尘器吸尘和我母亲够得着的灯光之外，很少打扫干净，因为那并不远。这两扇窗户被油漆和膨胀的木头封住了。灰尘弥漫在昏暗的房间里。几年前，我父母增加了一台中央空调，但办公室的通风口被埋在一堵书架和一个大钢质文件柜之间。一条狭窄的小路蜿蜒在摇摇欲坠的色情书栈、一台过时的打印机、第一台麦金塔电脑、一台坏了的打字机和一台20年前不能用的复印机之间。</p><p>  My father was more hoarder than collector, and I began by discarding the obvious junk: rusted pocketknives, corroded flashlights, outdated office equipment, a hockey puck, broken swords and guns, empty bottles of expensive beer and dozens of tin boxes that once held bottles of fancy Scotch. The décor reminded me of a fraternity house, with its implied pride in drinking and manliness. His possessions consisted of gifts given by fans and all the professional mail he ever received. I learned to operate in a very specific way: examine each item, evaluate its importance, keep it or throw it away. The pressure of constant decision was relentless. I grew up banned from this room, and now I was in charge of it. I felt as if I were trespassing.</p><p>我父亲与其说是收藏家，不如说是囤积者，我一开始就丢弃了明显的垃圾：生锈的袖珍小刀、腐蚀的手电筒、过时的办公设备、曲棍球、破碎的剑和枪、昂贵的空瓶子和几十个曾经装过高档苏格兰威士忌的锡盒。这间装潢让我想起了兄弟会会所，里面隐含着对饮酒和男子气概的骄傲。他的财产包括歌迷赠送的礼物和他收到的所有专业邮件。我学会了以一种非常具体的方式操作：检查每一件物品，评估其重要性，保留或扔掉它。不断作出决定的压力是无情的。我从小就被禁止进入这个房间，现在我负责这里。我觉得我好像是在擅自闯入。</p><p> After filling 50 garbage bags, I could not see any difference other than a haze of disturbed dust hanging in the air. The room seemed more cluttered, with no space for organizing and packing. My eyes stung, and I was developing a cough. Essentially I had redistributed the contents into new piles. Emptying the bookshelves would gain space for sorting the material. Based on approximately 300 feet of shelf, I anticipated two days to pack them. The allotted time period doubled, then tripled. Every shelf held another row of books directly behind it — all pornography. I found several opened bottles of bourbon and dozens of manuscripts by Turk Winter.</p><p>装满了50个垃圾袋后，我看不出有什么不同，除了空气中悬挂着一团扰乱的灰尘。房间看起来更加凌乱，没有整理和打包的空间。我的眼睛刺痛，而且我开始咳嗽。从本质上说，我已经把里面的东西重新分配到新的一堆里了。清空书架将为分拣材料赢得空间。根据大约300英尺的货架，我预计需要两天来打包它们。分配的时间段翻了一番，然后又翻了两番。每个书架后面都放着另外一排书--全是色情书。我发现了几瓶打开的波旁威士忌和几十份土耳其·温特的手稿。</p><p> For the next several days I ate little. I guzzled water and sweated through my clothes until they were stiff with salt. I moved in a somnolent daze. Twice I noticed my mother staring at me from the hall. She said she’d been startled; I looked so much like Dad, she thought I was him. I hugged her silently and went back to work. Later she began referring to me as John Cleve Jr. At night we laughed, drank bourbon and watched her favorite TV shows. Mom was 78 and had just retired from full-time work as a receptionist for a lawyer. With the proceeds from porn, she’d gone to college for a philosophy degree and a master’s in English.</p><p>在接下来的几天里，我吃得很少。我狼吞虎咽地喝水，汗流浃背，直到衣服被盐弄得僵硬。我昏昏欲睡地走着。有两次我注意到我母亲在大厅里盯着我看。她说她被吓了一跳，我长得太像爸爸了，她以为我就是他。我默默地拥抱了她，然后又回去工作了。后来，她开始称我为小约翰·克利夫(John Cleve Jr.)。晚上我们大笑，喝波旁威士忌，看她最喜欢的电视节目。母亲现年78岁，刚刚从律师的全职接待员工作中退休。用色情片的收益，她上了大学，攻读了哲学学位和英语硕士学位。</p><p> Clearing Dad’s office felt like prospecting within his brain. The top layer was disorganized and heavy with porn. As I sorted, like an archaeologist backward through time, I saw a remarkable mind at work, a life lived on its own terms, the gradual shifting from phenomenal intellectual interest in literature, history and psychology to an obsession with the darker elements of sex.</p><p>清理爸爸的办公室感觉就像在他的大脑里探险。顶层杂乱无章，充斥着色情内容。当我整理的时候，就像一位穿越时间的考古学家一样，我看到了一颗非凡的头脑在工作，一种按照自己的方式生活的生活，从对文学、历史和心理学的非凡智力兴趣逐渐转变为对性中更黑暗的元素的痴迷。</p><p> For decades he subscribed to magazines and kept them in stacks: Ramparts. Intellectual Digest. Psychology Today. New Times. Galaxy. If. Play­boy. Omni. Geo. National Geographic. Smithsonian. Mixed throughout was pornography in every form: magazines, photographs, drawings, pamphlets, a deck of cards, cartoons, books of erotic art from antiquity to the 21st century, calendars, pinups, postcards, collections of naughty jokes — and hundreds of novels. A collection of dusty catalogs from Frederick’s of Hollywood ran back 50 years.</p><p>几十年来，他订阅杂志，并把它们堆积起来：壁垒。“智力文摘”。今日心理学。新的</p><p> His desk held dozens of file folders filled with porn. After a week I no longer considered the undertaking in terms of my father and me, or even as a writer going through another writer’s papers. My thinking shifted to a more formal role, a librarian faced with an enormous holding of raw material. I organized and collated and distributed. I stopped looking at pictures or reading, and simply made decisions in my head: This goes here, that goes over there, here’s a new one for a fresh pile. I could have been sorting marbles or Tupperware.</p><p>他的桌子上放着几十个装满色情内容的文件夹。一周后，我不再从我和父亲的角度来考虑这件事，甚至不再从一个作家的角度来考虑另一个作家的论文。我的想法转向了一个更正式的角色，一名面临着大量原材料储备的图书管理员。我整理、整理和分发。我不再看图片或阅读，只是在脑海中做了决定：这个放在这里，那个放在那里，这里有一个新的，可以再放一堆。我可能在整理弹珠或特百惠。</p><p>  Running short on time because of the movers’ strict schedule, I decided to deal with it all back at my home in Mississippi. I packed everything and taped the boxes shut. The stacked cartons made a double-rowed wall that blocked four windows in the hall outside his office. The movers charged by weight, and their estimate of Dad’s archive was 1,800 pounds — my inheritance, along with his rifle, desk and chair.</p><p>由于搬家工人的日程安排很紧，时间紧迫，我决定回到密西西比州的家中处理这一切。我把所有东西都打包好，用胶带把箱子封好。堆叠的纸箱形成了一堵双排墙，挡住了他办公室外大厅里的四扇窗户。搬家工人按重量收费，他们估计父亲的档案有1800英镑--这是我的遗产，还有他的步枪、桌子和椅子。</p><p> In Mississippi, I began with the simple goal of assembling a full bibliography of his work. He had never done it himself, and I was curious as to the extent of his output. Opening the boxes released the scent of decaying mouse dung, dust and cigarette smoke. It was familiar, the smell of Dad’s office, my childhood, the house itself. I worked 14 hours a day organizing thousands of letters and tens of thousands of novel pages.</p><p>在密西西比州，我一开始就有一个简单的目标，就是收集他的作品的完整书目。他自己从来没有做过这件事，我对他的产出有多大感到好奇。打开箱子释放出腐烂的老鼠粪便、灰尘和香烟的气味。那是熟悉的，爸爸办公室的味道，我的童年，房子本身的味道。我每天工作14个小时，整理数千封信件和数万页小说。</p><p> Months passed in which I continued to work all day and into the evening, seven days a week. When guests visited, I draped bedsheets over the tables. It occurred to me that I’d transformed into a version of my father — obsessed not with porn but with his preferences for porn. My efforts were a way of interacting with his mind, and I found a horrible sadness, a deep loneliness and self-righteous anger.</p><p>几个月过去了，在这几个月里，我一周工作七天，从早到晚都在继续工作。客人来访时，我把床单盖在桌子上。我突然想到，我已经变成了我父亲的一个版本--不是痴迷于色情，而是他对色情的偏好。我的努力是一种与他心灵互动的方式，我发现了一种可怕的悲伤，一种深深的孤独和自以为是的愤怒。</p><p> Although he lived in the Daniel Boone National Forest, I never saw my father in the woods. He didn’t walk them and remained oddly incurious about the landscape he’d chosen. It was enough for him to be surrounded by the heavy forest. The seclusion of the house matched the solitude within himself, the immense isolation of his mind and its constant, rapid machinations. His brain was a continent, an iceberg stuffed into a matchbox. I admired the psychic strength necessary to occupy this private world, maintain the structures to allow it and grant himself the freedom to flourish. A year before he died, Dad told me he was the happiest man in the world. The only complaint he had was the weekends, because Mom was in the house. They got along fine, that wasn’t the problem. He just preferred to be alone. Her presence distracted him from his solitude.</p><p>虽然我父亲住在丹尼尔·布恩国家森林里，但我从未在树林里见过他。他没有带他们去散步，而且对他选择的风景仍然保持着奇怪的不屑一顾的态度。对他来说，被茂密的森林包围就足够了。这所房子的与世隔绝与他内心的孤独、他思想的极度孤立及其不断而迅速的阴谋相匹配。他的大脑是一块大陆，一座塞在火柴盒里的冰山。我钦佩占据这个私人世界所需的精神力量，维持允许它的结构，并给予自己蓬勃发展的自由。在他去世前一年，爸爸告诉我他是世界上最幸福的人。他唯一的抱怨就是周末，因为妈妈在家里。他们相处得很好，这不是问题所在。他只是更喜欢一个人待着。她的出现分散了他对孤独的注意力。</p><p> To complete my father’s bibliography I read scholarly books on pornography and tracked down sources. I emailed collectors and cold-called former publishers and writers, surprised to learn how many prominent authors had written porn in the old days. Everyone I communicated with knew of my father, although few had met him. For decades American literary circles ignored science fiction, placing it at the very bottom of the popular genres. This gave the writers a great deal of freedom, which they used to explore sexual themes in a more overt fashion than other books could. The science-fiction market dried up as porn’s ignited, and many writers moved to pornography, most temporarily but not Dad. I came to understand that my father had passed as a science-fiction writer while actually pursuing a 50-year career as a pornographer.</p><p>为了完成我父亲的参考书目，我阅读有关色情的学术书籍，并追查来源。我给收藏家和素不相识的前出版商和作家发了电子邮件，惊讶地得知过去有这么多知名作家写过色情作品。我联系过的每个人都知道我的父亲，尽管很少有人见过他。几十年来，美国文坛一直忽视科幻小说，把它放在通俗体裁的最底层。这给了作家们很大的自由，他们用来探索性主题的方式比其他书更公开。随着色情文学的兴起，科幻小说市场枯竭，许多作家转向色情文学，大多数是暂时的，但爸爸没有。我开始了解到，我的父亲是一名科幻小说家，而实际上是一名色情作家，已经有50年的职业生涯了。</p><p> Dad’s writing process was simple — he’d get an idea, brainstorm a few notes, then write the first chapter. Next he’d develop an outline from one to 10 pages. He followed the outline carefully, relying on it to dictate the narrative. He composed his first drafts longhand, wearing rubber thimbles on finger and thumb. Writing with a felt-tip pen, he produced 20 to 40 pages in a sitting. Upon completion of a full draft, he transcribed the material to his typewriter, revising as he went. Most writers get more words per page as they go from longhand to a typed manuscript, but not Dad. His handwriting was small, and he used ampersands and abbreviations. His first drafts were often the same length as the final ones.</p><p>爸爸的写作过程很简单-他会有一个想法，集思广益地写几个笔记，然后写第一章。接下来，他会拟定一份从1页到10页的提纲。他仔细地遵循提纲，依靠它来口述叙述。他手写了他的第一个草稿，手指和拇指上戴着橡胶顶针。他用毛毡笔写字，一次写了20到40页。在完成一份完整的草稿后，他把材料转录到他的打字机上，一边走一边修改。大多数作家在从手写到打字的过程中，每页会得到更多的字数，但爸爸却不是这样。他的笔迹很小，他使用与号和缩写。他的初稿往往与最后稿的长度相同。</p><p>  Manuscripts of science fiction and fantasy received multiple revisions, but he had to work much faster on porn. After a longhand first chapter, he typed the rest swiftly, made editorial changes and passed that draft to my mother. She retyped it for final submission. At times, Mom would be typing the beginning of the book while Dad was still writing the end.</p><p>科幻和奇幻的手稿被多次修改，但他在色情方面的工作速度要快得多。在手写了第一章之后，他迅速地打出了剩下的部分，做了编辑修改，然后把草稿递给了我母亲。她把它重新打了一遍，以便最终提交。有时，妈妈在打书的开头，而爸爸还在写结尾。</p><p> His goal was a minimum of a book a month. To achieve that, he refined his methods further, inventing a way that enabled him to maintain a supply of raw material with a minimum of effort. He created batches in advance — phrases, sentences, descriptions and entire scenes on hundreds of pages organized in three-ring binders. Tabbed index dividers separated the sections into topics.</p><p>他的目标是每月至少出一本书。为了实现这一目标，他进一步改进了自己的方法，发明了一种方法，使他能够以最小的努力保持原材料的供应。他提前创作了一批-短语、句子、描述和数百页纸上的整个场景，用三圈装订机组织起来。选项卡式索引分隔符将各部分分隔为多个主题。</p><p> Eighty percent of the notebooks described sexual aspects of women. The longest section focused on their bosoms. Another binder listed descriptions of individual actions, separated by labeling tabs that included: Mouth. Tongue. Face. Legs. Kiss. The heading of Orgasm had subdivisions of Before, During and After. The thickest notebook was designed strictly for B.D.S.M. novels with a list of 150 synonyms for “pain.” Sections included Spanking, Whipping, Degradation, Predegradation, Distress, Screams, Restraints and Tortures. These were further subdivided into specific categories followed by brief descriptions of each.</p><p>80%的笔记本描述了女性的性方面。最长的部分集中在她们的胸部。另一个活页夹列出了对各个动作的描述，由标签标签分隔，标签标签包括：嘴巴。舌头。脸。腿。亲亲。性高潮的标题有之前、期间和之后的细分。最厚的笔记本是专门为B.D.S.M.小说设计的，上面有150个“痛苦”的同义词。部分包括打屁股，鞭打，降级，预降级，痛苦，尖叫，束缚和折磨。这些被进一步细分为具体的类别，然后对每个类别进行简要说明。</p><p> Dad was like Henry Ford applying principles of assembly-line production with pre-made parts. The methodical technique proved highly efficient. Surrounded by his tabulated notebooks, he could quickly find the appropriate section and transcribe lines directly into his manusc</p><p>父亲就像亨利·福特(Henry Ford)一样，用预制零件运用流水线生产的原则。事实证明，这种有条不紊的技术非常有效。在他的表格笔记本的包围下，他可以很快地找到合适的部分，并直接把台词抄写到他的手稿中。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/magazine/my-dad-the-pornographer.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/magazine/my-dad-the-pornographer.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/色情/">#色情</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dad/">#dad</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
