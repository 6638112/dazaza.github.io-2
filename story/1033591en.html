The Simpsons’ writers spent long days in the same room, sweating over jokes and storylines. The animators worked overtime to bring bigger and more ambitious episodes to life. Being funny was sometimes a chore, but those involved had a sense that they were working on something special.</p><p>改变喜剧和动画的本质，创造可能是有史以来最成功的电视节目，并不像你想象的那样迷人或令人兴奋。辛普森一家的编剧们在同一个房间里度过了漫长的一天，为笑话和故事情节而汗流浃背。动画师们加班加点地工作，把更大、更雄心勃勃的剧集搬上舞台。搞笑有时是一件苦差事，但参与其中的人有一种感觉，他们正在做一些特别的事情。</p><p>  By season four,  The Simpsons had entered what many now consider to be its golden age (although, at the time there were already suggestions that it was losing its way). “Marge vs. the Monorail” (S4, E12), with its grand scale, silly asides and abundance of absurdist humour, represented a stark departure from the show’s established formula. While initial reactions were mixed, it’s now widely regarded as one of  The Simpsons’ best-ever episodes.</p><p>到了第四季，《辛普森一家》已经进入了许多人现在认为是它的黄金时代(尽管当时已经有人说它正在迷失方向)。《玛姬大战单轨》(S4，E12)，其宏大的规模、愚蠢的旁白和丰富的荒诞幽默，代表着与该剧既定模式的赤裸裸的背道而驰。虽然最初的反应褒贬不一，但现在它被广泛认为是辛普森一家有史以来最好的剧集之一。</p><p>   With a script by Conan O’Brien – then an energetic young comedy writer – and meticulous yet joyful direction by Rich Moore – who subsequently won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature with  Zootopia – the result is a wild ride, as charming conman Lyle Lanley convinces Springfield to spend $3 million on a monorail through the power of song alone. Disaster ensues until Homer saves the day, with the help of Lard Lad Donuts.</p><p>柯南·奥布莱恩(Conan O‘Brien)当时是一位精力充沛的年轻喜剧作家，他的剧本由里奇·摩尔(Rich Moore)执导，而里奇·摩尔(Rich Moore)随后凭借《疯狂动物城》(Zootopia)获得奥斯卡最佳动画片奖。在柯南·奥布莱恩(Conan O’Brien)的剧本下，结果是一场疯狂的旅程，迷人的骗子莱尔·兰利(Lyle Lanley)说服斯普林菲尔德仅通过歌曲的力量就花了300万美元购买一辆单轨列车。灾难接踵而至，直到荷马在Lard Lad Donuts的帮助下拯救了世界。</p><p>  Featuring parodies of  The Flintstones,  The Music Man and several disaster movies, as well as a family of possums and some memorable lines from guest star Leonard Nimoy, “Marge vs. the Monorail” helped to chart a new course for  The Simpsons. It also succeeded in putting Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook on the map. Twenty-seven years on from when it first aired, five key figures involved in making the episode shared their memories of creating a classic.</p><p>《玛姬大战单轨》以滑稽的《摩登原始人》、《音乐人》和几部灾难电影为特色，还有负鼠一家和客串明星伦纳德·尼莫伊的一些令人难忘的台词，为《辛普森一家》开辟了一条新路。它还成功地让布罗克韦、奥格登维尔和北哈弗布鲁克在地图上声名鹊起。在该剧首次播出27年后，参与制作这一集的五位关键人物分享了他们创作经典的记忆。</p><p>  Mike Reiss, Showrunner: Every year, all the writers would go off on a retreat, and it was a day where we had the undivided attention of Matt Groening and James L. Brooks. We would prepare little pitches. Conan was brand new at the job and he came in with three ideas. He tested them on Al Jean [Showrunner] and me first.</p><p>迈克·赖斯(Mike Reiss)，制片人：每年，所有的编剧都会去度假，那是马特·格罗宁(Matt Groning)和詹姆斯·L·布鲁克斯(James L.Brooks)全神贯注的一天。我们会准备一些小广告。柯南是这份工作的新手，他提出了三个想法。他先在阿尔·让(节目制作人)和我身上进行了测试。</p><p>  When we heard about the monorail episode, we said, “We don’t think Jim Brooks is going to like this. We think it’s too weird, so put it in your back pocket and don’t pitch it unless you’ve pitched your other two ideas already.” It shows that we didn’t know anything, because Brooks loved the idea. Conan sold three script ideas at that meeting – his first meeting – and I don’t think anyone had ever done that, before or since.</p><p>当我们听说单轨列车这一集时，我们说：“我们认为吉姆·布鲁克斯不会喜欢这一集。我们认为这太奇怪了，所以把它放在你的后袋里，除非你已经提出了你的另外两个想法，否则不要推销它。“。这表明我们什么都不知道，因为布鲁克斯喜欢这个想法。柯南在那次会议上推销了三个剧本想法--他的第一次会议--我认为在那之前或之后，没有人这样做过。</p><p>  Jeff Martin, Producer: [Conan] hit the ground running. He happened to have the office right next to mine. Usually we were in the writers’ room, but when you go off and write your first draft you go to your little bungalow office. I remember him writing the monorail song and he knew he had something good. He was very tickled by what he was coming up with. He would pop into my office with a couplet, like Wiggum saying, “ The ring came off my pudding can / Take my pen knife, my good man.” He was narrating that to me as he wrote it.</p><p>杰夫·马丁(制片人)：(柯南)开拍。他的办公室恰好就在我的隔壁。通常我们在编剧的房间里，但当你离开去写你的初稿时，你会去你的小平房办公室。我记得他写了那首单轨列车的歌，他知道他有一些好东西。他对自己提出的想法感到非常高兴。他会突然带着一副对联走进我的办公室，就像威格姆说的那样：“戒指从我的布丁罐上掉下来了/拿走了我的钢笔刀，我的好人。”他一边写，一边向我叙述这件事。</p><p>  Mike Reiss: The writers’ room was always very funny and creative and energised, but it was such hard work. It was very long hours. Al Jean and I were running the show and we were working 100 hours a week. Even though they liked the job and loved the show, everybody left as soon as they could. Nobody could keep it up at the pace that we were going.</p><p>迈克·赖斯(Mike Reiss)：编剧的房间总是非常有趣、富有创意、充满活力，但这是一项非常艰苦的工作。那是非常长的时间。艾尔·让和我在主持这个节目，我们每周工作100个小时。尽管他们喜欢这份工作，喜欢这部剧，但每个人都尽快离开。没有人能跟上我们前进的速度。</p><p>  Josh Weinstein, Story Editor: Working with Conan was like watching a ten-hour episode of his show, every day, in the writers’ room. All the other writers are hilarious, but most of them are quiet and thoughtful, whereas Conan’s just out there. Although he’s crazy, he’s a super anal writer. Some first drafts require a lot of rewriting, but his first draft was excellent.</p><p>乔什·温斯坦(Josh Weinstein)，故事编辑：和柯南一起工作就像每天在编剧间看一集10个小时的节目。其他所有的编剧都很搞笑，但他们大多数都很安静和深思熟虑，而柯南只是在外面。虽然他疯了，但他是个超级肛门作家。有些初稿需要大量重写，但他的初稿非常出色。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: My personal memory of doing  The Simpsons is 98 percent sitting in one room, in one spot on a couch, for an average of 11 hours a day. Eating my lunch and my dinner in that room, and watching a bunch of relatively young men age quickly and put on weight.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：我个人对拍摄《辛普森一家》的记忆是98%坐在一个房间里，坐在沙发上的一个位置上，平均每天11个小时。在那个房间里吃我的午餐和晚餐，看着一群相对年轻的男人迅速变老和体重增加。</p><p>  Josh Weinstein: Season three and season four are kind of the ultimate seasons. That’s when they got the formula right. The first couple of seasons are brilliant, but they’re a little slow and there aren’t as many jokes. I think by the third season they’d figured out the perfect balance of story, characters and jokes. By season four, the show was operating on all pistons.</p><p>乔什·温斯坦：第三季和第四季是终极季。就在那时，他们得到了正确的公式。前几季很精彩，但有点慢，也没有那么多笑话。我认为到了第三季，他们已经找到了故事、人物和笑话的完美平衡。到了第四季，这部剧已经在所有活塞上运行了。</p><p>  Mike Reiss: By the fourth season, the three executive producers left us alone. We barely saw Matt Groening, Sam Simon and James L. Brooks. They’d established  The Simpsons and set the tone for the show, and then they were all off developing new things. We couldn’t have made the show without them, but it was nice not to have this extra layer of people overseeing the project. Al and I just got to do the show, with the staff, that we wanted to do.</p><p>迈克·赖斯：到了第四季，三位执行制片人都离我们而去了。我们几乎没有看到马特·格罗宁、萨姆·西蒙和詹姆斯·L·布鲁克斯。他们已经建立了辛普森一家，并为这部剧定下了基调，然后他们都开始开发新的东西。如果没有他们，我们就不可能完成这部剧，但没有这一层额外的人来监督这个项目，这是一件很好的事情。艾尔和我只是要和工作人员一起做我们想做的节目。</p><p>  David Silverman, Supervising Director: We were getting better at our craft certainly, but it was still those years of exploration, and it felt like every episode was trying something different. We were just adding to the whole structure of Springfield – the world and the cast of characters.</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼(David Silverman)：当然，我们的手艺越来越好了，但这仍然是那些年的探索，感觉每一集都在尝试不同的东西。我们只是增加了斯普林菲尔德的整体结构--世界和角色阵容。</p><p>  Rich Moore, Director: For me as a director, “Marge vs. The Monorail” was a real turning point, because it was the beginning of these big spectacle episodes. We had a musical number every now and then, but the stories had been more intimate. Very domestic and around the house. Here comes this one that has a full-blown disaster movie ending.</p><p>导演里奇·摩尔：作为一名导演，《玛吉大战单轨列车》是一个真正的转折点，因为它是这些大型奇观剧集的开始。我们时不时地有一首音乐剧，但故事更亲密。非常有家庭感，而且在房子周围。这部电影有一个完整的灾难电影结尾。</p><p>   Mike Reiss: The show was slowly drifting into surrealism. At the end of that episode, when Leonard Nimoy beams out of there like on  Star Trek, I remember Jeff Martin said he was thinking, ‘Alright, I guess we’re doing this now.  The Simpsons has decided it can break physical laws.’ It wasn’t a vision we had for the show or anything like that, Al and I were just trying to get laughs. The show had to get a little bigger and weirder all the time for it to do that.</p><p>迈克·赖斯(Mike Reiss)：这部剧正慢慢转向超现实主义。在那一集的结尾，当伦纳德·尼莫伊(Leonard Nimoy)像《星际迷航》(Star Trek)中那样笑容满面地走出来时，我记得杰夫·马丁(Jeff Martin)说过他在想，‘好吧，我想我们现在要这么做了。“辛普森一家认为这会违反身体法则。”这不是我们对这部剧的设想，艾尔和我只是想让大家开怀大笑。这部剧必须一直变得更大、更怪异，才能做到这一点。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: There was a creed put in place early on, principally by Matt Groening and Jim Brooks, that the show would have a basic, core reality. That they were a family and essential laws of physics and gravity would be observed. I remember Matt Groening said, “We don’t do anything that sends the message that the show isn’t real.” Fine, but that’s the sort of principle that’s very hard to maintain over dozens, never mind hundreds, of episodes. Just to keep doing stories you almost have to push it a bit.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：很早就有一个信条，主要是马特·格罗宁(Matt Groning)和吉姆·布鲁克斯(Jim Brooks)，那就是该剧将有一个基本的、核心的现实。他们是一个大家庭，会遵守物理学和地心引力的基本定律。我记得马特·格罗宁(Matt Groning)说过：“我们不会做任何让人觉得这部剧不是真的的事情。”好吧，但这种原则很难在几十集，更不用说数百集的剧集中保持下去了。仅仅是为了继续写报道，你几乎不得不再推一点。</p><p>    Rich Moore: As a kid,  The Flintstones was something that was really close to my heart, and so the fact the episode was opening with the classic intro, I was like, ‘Okay, we’re going to do this right. We’re going to dissect the opening and we’re going to get the camera moves and the timing down.’ This was pre-YouTube and the internet. I guess we were watching that opening on an old VCR and just going through and taking extensive notes. We were nuts to get it right, or at least I was.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：当我还是个孩子的时候，《摩登原始人》非常贴近我的心，所以这一集以经典的开场白开场，我当时就想，‘好吧，我们会把这件事做好的。’我们要仔细分析开场，我们要让镜头移动，把计时降下来。这是在YouTube和互联网出现之前。我猜我们是在用一台旧录像机看开场白，只是浏览了一下，做了大量的笔记。我们都疯了，不想把事情做对，至少我是这样做的。</p><p>  That kind of tells you where animation was at the time. We weren’t using computers. We were still animating on paper and pencil. There weren’t as many tools to dissect a piece of video like you have now. That was the result of a lot of hard work on the part of a lot of people.</p><p>这在某种程度上告诉了你动画在当时的位置。我们没有使用电脑。我们还在纸和铅笔上做动画。没有像你现在这样用来分析一段视频的工具。这是很多人辛勤工作的结果。</p><p>  David Silverman:  The Flintstones bit was actually a longer song [originally]. Al Jean and Mike Reiss came to Sam Simon and were like, ‘We’re having trouble with this opening.’ Sam Simon ends up singing, “ Simpson, Homer Simpson, he’s the greatest guy in history / From the town of Springfield, he’s about to hit a chestnut tree.” He came up with that off the top of his head and that became the opening. Sometimes it’s nice when you overwrite, and suddenly it’s like, “Okay, how do we solve this?”</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼(David Silverman)：《原始人》实际上是一首更长的歌。艾尔·让(Al Jean)和迈克·赖斯(Mike Reiss)找到萨姆·西蒙(Sam Simon)说，“我们在开业时遇到了麻烦。”山姆·西蒙最后唱道：“辛普森，荷马·辛普森，他是历史上最伟大的人/来自斯普林菲尔德镇，他要撞上一棵栗树。”他突然想出了这一点，这就成了开场白。有时候改写很好，突然就像是，“好吧，我们怎么解决这个问题呢？”</p><p>  David Silverman: The only thing I can claim some credit for is helping to design Lyle Lanley. I think we were going after a little bit of the outfit of Professor Harold Hill – Robert Preston in  The Music Man. A little bit in the face too, but only with the broadness of the smile. I wanted to do something graphically interesting like curls in his hair.</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼：我能说的唯一的功劳就是帮助设计了莱尔·兰利(Lyle Lanley)。我认为我们是在追逐哈罗德·希尔-罗伯特·普雷斯顿教授在《音乐人》中的服装。脸上也有一点，但只是带着灿烂的笑容。我想做一些生动有趣的事情，比如在他的头发上做卷发。</p><p>  Rich Moore: Unless it was an actor doing their own voice, we never tried to overtly caricature people. We always tried to evoke them. He was greatly influenced by Robert Preston’s character in  The Music Man and a lot of it came from Phil Hartman [Voice Actor] too. I loved him. He even had that larger-than-life persona. A good part of it was from watching Phil and how he carried himself. I loved working with all his shady characters.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：除非是演员自己配音，否则我们从来没有试图公开讽刺人们。我们总是试图唤起他们。他深受罗伯特·普雷斯顿(Robert Preston)在《音乐人》(The Music Man)中扮演的角色的影响，其中很大一部分也来自菲尔·哈特曼(Phil Hartman)(配音演员)。我爱他。他甚至有一种超凡脱俗的形象。很大一部分原因是看了菲尔的表演和他的举止。我喜欢和他所有阴暗的角色一起工作。</p><p>  Mike Reiss: Dealing with Phil was like dealing with Lyle Lanley. He was just  that guy. He was always pretending to be a glad-handing salesman. I don’t even know what he was like deeply as a person. He would come in and be enormously engaging, friendly and a pleasure to work with. He would come in to record his part and he’d nail every bit instantly. He was perfect on every line on the first take.</p><p>迈克·赖斯：和菲尔打交道就像和莱尔·兰利打交道一样。他就是那个人。他总是假装是一个热情好客的推销员。我甚至不知道他作为一个人到底是什么样的。他会进来，非常有魅力，很友好，很乐意与之共事。他会进来录制他的角色，他会立刻抓住每一个细节。在第一次拍摄时，他的每一句台词都很完美。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: Conan had done two seasons on  Saturday Night Live and had described Hartman as absolutely the same at all times. I think, in a flattering way, he compared him to a coffee maker. Fill it with water, put in a filter and hit the button! He was always in a pleasant mood, always knew his lines and was no trouble. While he himself was very nice, I would have to say he was very good at portraying slick, empty people. I think he brought a lot of joy to it.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：柯南在《周六夜现场》上演了两季，他形容哈特曼在任何时候都是完全一样的。我认为，他以一种恭维的方式，把他比作咖啡机。加满水，放入过滤器，然后按下按钮！他总是心情愉快，总是记得台词，一点都不麻烦。虽然他本人非常和善，但我不得不说他非常擅长刻画圆滑、空洞的人。我认为他给比赛带来了很多欢乐。</p><p>   Josh Weinstein: This was one of the first big all-Springfield episodes, where the fact that everyone in the town is so stupid that they’re taken in by this conman is really enjoyable. Phil Hartman’s performance is so full of gusto that you just really love him even though he’s a shyster.</p><p>乔什·温斯坦：这是首批大型全斯普林菲尔德剧集之一，镇上的每个人都很愚蠢，竟然被这个骗子骗了，这真的很有趣。菲尔·哈特曼(Phil Hartman)的表演是如此充满热情，以至于你真的很爱他，尽管他是个害羞的人。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: It tickles me no end, then and now, that a character could introduce himself simply by singing a song and win over the entire town. Even the smarter, sceptical characters like Lisa – all Lyle Lanley has to do is pay her a compliment and she melts too.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：当时和现在，一个角色只要唱一首歌就可以介绍自己，然后赢得整个小镇的支持，这让我兴奋不已。即使是像丽莎这样更聪明、更多疑的角色，莱尔·兰利所要做的就是恭维她，她也会融化。</p><p>    Jeff Martin: Mindless groupthink is a recurrent theme on  The Simpsons, and I think the monorail episode is the best – and certainly my favourite – example of Springfield mob mentality. Watching the episode, I decided to go ahead and time it. From Lanley whistling in the back of the auditorium to the entire town marching on the town hall steps singing “Monorail!” is a little less than two minutes. I think it took Harold Hill at least four minutes to whip up River City.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：盲目的群体思维是《辛普森一家》反复出现的主题，我认为单轨列车这一集是斯普林菲尔德暴徒心态最好的--当然也是我最喜欢的--例子。看了这一集，我决定开始计时。从兰利在礼堂后面吹口哨，到整个小镇在市政厅台阶上高唱“单轨电车！”不到两分钟。我想哈罗德·希尔至少花了四分钟才把河城搞得一团糟。</p><p>  Rich Moore: That musical number was almost harder to pull off than the whole third act climax. I’d done “A Streetcar Named Marge” before. That was a big musical spectacular, so it felt like, ‘Okay, we’re going to have to pull off what we did on that episode.’ That’s hard to do when you’re not working under the same roof as the animators. We would send a very complete blueprint, with all the key posing and animation timing, to Korea [where the bulk of animation is done by a studio called AKOM], but there was a bit of crossing your fingers and hoping, since you’re not there in the room to direct them. Everything is being communicated through instructions on exposure sheets, which have been translated from English to Korean.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：这个音乐数字几乎比整个第三幕的高潮都难完成。我以前拍过《街车叫玛姬》。这是一场声势浩大的音乐盛会，所以感觉就像，‘好吧，我们将不得不完成我们在那一集里做的事情。’如果你和动画师不是在同一屋檐下工作，这是很难做到的。我们会把一份非常完整的蓝图，包括所有关键的造型和动画时机，送到韩国(那里的大部分动画都是由一家名为AKOM的工作室完成的)，但有一点祈祷和希望，因为你不在房间里指导他们。一切都是通过曝光表上的说明进行沟通的，这些说明已经从英语翻译成了韩语。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: Every single word of the monorail song was unchanged from Conan’s first draft, which is impressive. My niche on the show in those days was to actually write the tunes to the songs. I wrote a bunch of songs, so I was assigned to set the monorail song to music. It’s sort of like, “Bum, bum, bum, bum. I think I’m done!” It’s barely a song. It’s just sort of a rhythm and “Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!” The notion that Conan and I co-wrote that song is laughable. I’ve told Conan over the years that he had his part in that song. Elton John, meaning me, needs Bernie Taupin, meaning him.</p><p>杰夫·马丁：这首单轨列车歌曲的每一个字都与柯南的初稿保持不变，令人印象深刻。那段时间，我在这个节目中的定位就是为歌曲写曲子。我写了几首歌，所以我被指派为单轨列车的歌曲配乐。就像是，“笨蛋，笨蛋。我想我完了！“。这几乎算不上一首歌。这只是一种节奏和“单轨列车！单轨列车！单轨电车！“。认为柯南和我合写了这首歌的想法是可笑的。多年来，我一直告诉柯南，他在这首歌中扮演了自己的角色。埃尔顿·约翰(Elton John)指的是我，他需要伯尼·陶平(Bernie Taupin)。</p><p>  Josh Weinstein: I love the musical numbers and Lyle Lanley. I know it’s all based on  The Music Man, but the character is so good. The musical routine is really brilliant and hilarious, and it’s one of the best  Simpsons musical numbers. I think that really started people going, “We can really do funny musical numbers.”</p><p>乔什·温斯坦：我喜欢音乐数字和莱尔·兰利。我知道这一切都是根据《音乐人》改编的，但是这个角色太棒了。这段音乐套路真的很精彩，也很搞笑，是《辛普森一家》中最棒的音乐剧之一。我认为这真的让人们开始说，“我们真的可以做有趣的音乐数字。”</p><p>  Rich Moore: I think we went over schedule and over budget. I would get into these theoretical arguments with the head of production, who would say, “We’ve got to ship this over to Korea so it gets done, because we have to meet our schedule.” I would say, “Who cares if we meet the schedule if the episode is bad?” If we have a little pad, I need that pad to put it over the top. The fact that we’re having this conversation, and the episode is held in as high regard as it is, I feel like I won that argument now. That was the right thing to do. It was worth all the pain to get it there.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：我认为我们超出了计划和预算。我会和生产主管进行理论上的争论，他们会说，“我们必须把这些东西运到韩国，这样才能完成，因为我们必须满足我们的时间表。”我会说，“如果这一集不好，谁会在乎我们能不能如期完成呢？”如果我们有一个小垫子，我需要那个垫子把它放在上面。事实上，我们正在进行这场对话，而且这一集受到了如此高的评价，我觉得我现在赢得了这场争论。这是正确的做法。为了把它送到那里，所有的痛苦都是值得的。</p><p>  David Silverman: I remember first hearing about the idea when the script came in. It was just like, ‘Wow, this is another big show.’ I think Rich felt the same way. He was happy to direct it, but at the same time, yikes, it was a lot of work. It had a song and dance routine. It had a monorail. It had North Haverbrook. There was just a lot to design. It was a lot of extra work, but it just seemed worthwhile. It was a combination of trepidation and also thinking that this could be a lot of fun.</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼：我记得第一次听到这个想法是在剧本出来的时候。这就像是在说，‘哇，这又是一场盛大的演出。’我想里奇也有同感。他很乐意执导这部电影，但同时，哎呀，这部电影也有很多工作要做。它有一套歌舞套路。它有一条单轨列车。它有北哈弗布鲁克。要设计的东西实在太多了。这是一项额外的工作，但似乎是值得的。这是一种恐惧的结合，也是认为这可能会很有趣的一种组合。</p><p>  Rich Moore: David Silverman was like, ‘I don’t know how we’re going to pull this off.’ They have the means to do huge, spectacular episodes now, but at the time the staff was smaller. In TV animation you’re always behind schedule. The day you start, you’re three days behind. It was asking a lot. The challenge was huge to try to produce and direct this kind of episode in the short amount of time that we had.</p><p>里奇·摩尔(Rich Moore)：大卫·西尔弗曼(David Silverman)说，“我不知道我们要怎么做。”他们现在有办法制作大型、壮观的剧集，但当时的员工人数较少。在电视动画中，你总是落后于计划。从你开始的那一天起，你就落后了三天。这是一个很高的要求。在我们拥有的短时间内制作和执导这类剧集的挑战是巨大的。</p><p>   Josh Weinstein: In my mind it’s this episode that broke new territory. Even though it still involves the family and the town and everything like that, it’s a crazier and bigger idea that worked. I think, until then, there had been smaller stories, and this was suddenly like, ‘No, you can have the monorail come to town, and you can even have it be a musical episode, and it will work.’ I think you can say it’s probably the first modern  Simpsons episode, in a way.</p><p>乔什·温斯坦：在我看来，是这一集开辟了新的领域。尽管它仍然牵涉到家庭和城镇以及诸如此类的一切，但这是一个更疯狂、更宏大的想法，它奏效了。我认为，在那之前，还有一些小故事，突然之间就像是，‘不，你可以让单轨列车进城，你甚至可以让它成为一集音乐剧，它会起作用的。’在某种程度上，我想你可以说这可能是现代版《辛普森一家》的第一集。</p><p>  Rich Moore: Because we had limited design resources at that time, you couldn’t just say to the background designers, “Okay, I need another building. I need this. I need that. I need the design of the Lanley Institute. It needs to look nice but it’s only in for one shot.” I can’t ask these guys to put that much time into things that are just throwaways, or to design all the locations of a new town. I was living in Pasadena, so I went around with a camera. The Lanley Institute came from a building in old town Pasadena.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：因为我们当时的设计资源有限，你不能只对后台设计师说，“好的，我需要另一栋楼。”我需要这个。我需要那个。我需要兰利学院的设计。它需要看起来漂亮，但只有一次机会。“。我不能要求这些人把那么多时间花在那些被丢弃的事情上，或者设计一个新城镇的所有地点。我住在帕萨迪纳，所以我带着相机四处走动。兰利学院来自帕萨迪纳古镇的一栋建筑。</p><p>  I just bypassed the design team and gave the photos to the background layout artist, who was a friend of mine, Nancy Kruse. The different locations in North Haverbrook were all photos taken around North Hollywood. I think at one point I was using an old polaroid to take shots quickly, because there wasn’t time to develop the film. We’d never been asked to do such big, ambitious locations before, and it put a huge strain on the design team. That was kind of my solution to it.</p><p>我只是绕过了设计团队，把照片交给了背景布局艺术家，她是我的朋友南希·克鲁斯(Nancy Kruse)。北哈弗布鲁克的不同地点都是在北好莱坞周围拍摄的照片。我想有一次我用旧的宝丽来快速拍摄，因为没有时间冲洗胶卷。我们以前从未被要求设计如此宏大、雄心勃勃的地点，这给设计团队带来了巨大的压力。这在某种程度上是我的解决方案。</p><p>  Mike Reiss: We [initially] offered the part to George Takei. He’d been on the show already and he was a great guest, a really fun guy to have around, but he was on the committee of a mass transit project in Los Angeles and he didn’t want to make fun of monorails. So, because we were already thinking  Star Trek, we decided to ask Leonard Nimoy. We didn’t think we’d get him, but we did. He came in and he was game to do anything. He was game to make fun of himself.</p><p>迈克·赖斯：我们(最初)把这个角色提供给乔治·武井。他已经上过节目了，他是一位很棒的嘉宾，周围的人真的很有趣，但他是洛杉矶一个公共交通项目的委员会成员，他不想取笑单轨铁路。所以，因为我们已经在考虑《星际迷航》了，所以我们决定问问伦纳德·尼莫伊。我们以为抓不到他，但我们抓到了。他进来了，他准备做任何事。他玩起了自嘲的把戏。</p><p>  David Silverman: We were most excited about having Leonard Nimoy as a guest star. It’s Spock! We all adored  Star Trek and we all adored Spock. It’s no secret that they’d gone after George Takei, but he’d requested a lot of changes because he was on the Southern California transportation board and he was worried about that.</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼：我们最兴奋的是有伦纳德·尼莫伊客串。是史波克！我们都很喜欢《星际迷航》，也都很喜欢斯波克。他们追查乔治·竹井已经不是什么秘密了，但他要求做出很多改变，因为他是南加州运输委员会的成员，他对此感到担忧。</p><p>  Rich Moore: We had a great character designer called Dale Hendrickson. He would really capture the celebrity in  The Simpsons style like nobody else. I love that caricature of Leonard Nimoy because I’m a huge  Star Trek fan. Dale was the man. He could caricature any celebrity in  The  Simpsons style and just really capture the essence of the person.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：我们有一个很棒的角色设计师，叫戴尔·亨德里克森(Dale Hendrickson)。他真的会以“辛普森一家”的风格捕捉到这位名人，这是无人能及的。我喜欢伦纳德·尼莫伊的漫画，因为我是《星际迷航》的超级粉丝。戴尔就是那个男人。他可以用辛普森一家的风格来讽刺任何名人，并且能真正捕捉到这个人的本质。</p><p>  Jeff Martin: [Nimoy] was just very gracious and easy to work with, and a good sport when we went and recorded his voice. I remember the line, “The solar eclipse, the cosmic ballet goes on.” When he got to that line he said, “Okay, I know how to deliver this one,” meaning, “I can be pompous and windy, just like you want me to be.”</p><p>杰夫·马丁(Nimoy)：(尼莫伊)非常亲切，很容易合作，当我们去录制他的声音时，他是一个很好的运动员。我记得那句台词，“日食，宇宙芭蕾舞继续上演。”当他说到那句台词时，他说，“好的，我知道怎么说这句话，”意思是，“我可以像你想要的那样，傲慢自大，爱吹牛。”</p><p>  Josh Weinstein: I really like the Leonard Nimoy stuff. Where Barney says, “You didn’t do anything,” and he says, “Didn’t I?” then he beams out. That’s one of my favourites. Somebody beaming out from Springfield hadn’t been done before. There were a lot of wall-breaking jokes that just worked because they were so funny. I think it broke new ground for joke-telling as well. It was just such a funny joke that we had to do it, but then that opened the door to more absurd jokes.</p><p>乔什·温斯坦：我真的很喜欢伦纳德·尼莫伊的作品。巴尼说，“你什么都没做，”他说，“不是吗？”然后他笑容满面地走了出去。那是我最喜欢的之一。有人从斯普林菲尔德发出灿烂的光芒，这是以前从未有人做过的事。有很多破墙的笑话都很管用，因为它们太有趣了。我认为这也为讲笑话开辟了新天地。这只是一个非常有趣的笑话，我们不得不这么做，但这为更多荒谬的笑话打开了大门。</p><p>  Rich Moore: It’s one of those things where you’re working on it and thinking, ‘This is weird, and funny, and obtuse. I love it, and I hope everyone loves it the way I do.’ It’s very validating when you’re working in a bubble on this stuff and it’s making you crack up, and you hope that people see it the same way that you do. I just love that kind of thing, and to know that it’s become so well-known, with all the memes and the references, is really satisfying as an artist and a director.</p><p>里奇·摩尔(Rich Moore)：这是你正在做的事情之一，你会想，‘这很奇怪，很有趣，也很迟钝。’我喜欢它，我希望每个人都像我一样喜欢它。当你在泡泡里做这件事，让你崩溃的时候，这是非常有效的，你希望人们和你一样看待它。我就是喜欢这种东西，知道它已经这么有名了，有这么多的迷因和参考，作为一个艺术家和导演，我真的很满意。</p><p>  Mike Reiss: I was speaking at an animation festival in Slovakia and they said: “Bring an episode we can show on the big screen.” I brought the monorail episode. It was the first time I’d seen it in 20 years and I went, ‘Holy crap, this thing’s good!’ On the big screen it doesn’t even play like a  Simpsons episode, it plays like a movie. A lot of credit goes to Rich Moore, who directed it like a movie. The climax of it, with the monorail tearing through town, as crazy and silly as it is, is very exciting and dynamic.</p><p>迈克·赖斯：我在斯洛伐克的一个动画节上发言，他们说：“带上一集我们可以在大屏幕上播放的剧集。”我带来了单轨列车那一集。这是我20年来第一次看到它，我说，‘天哪，这东西太棒了！’在大屏幕上，它甚至不像《辛普森一家》剧集那样播放，而是像电影一样播放。很多功劳都归功于里奇·摩尔，他像执导了一部电影一样执导了这部电影。它的高潮，随着单轨列车在镇上飞驰而过，尽管它是疯狂和愚蠢的，但却非常令人兴奋和充满活力。</p><p>  Rich Moore: It was all done with coverage. It was scenes out of order. It was really just guesswork. “I’m going to need this kind of shot – I’m going to need it going away from the camera, I’m going to need it coming towards the camera, dragging this giant ‘M’ around as an anchor, and it bouncing around.” Since there wasn’t a whole lot of time up front, before it was animated, it was just like, ‘Okay, I’m going to have to let go a little bit and trust that if I create this group of shots, we’re going to be able to construct something worthwhile at the back end.’</p><p>里奇·摩尔：这一切都是在报道的基础上完成的。场面乱七八糟。这真的只是一种猜测。“我需要这样的镜头--我需要它离开摄像机，我需要它靠近摄像机，把这个巨大的‘M’作为锚拖来拖去，然后它就会弹来弹去。”“我需要这样的镜头--我需要它离开镜头，我需要它走到镜头前，把这个巨大的‘M’拖来拖去，然后它就会弹跳。”因为在动画之前没有太多时间，所以就像是在说，‘好吧，我得放手一点，相信如果我创作了这组镜头，我们就能在后期创作出一些有价值的东西。’</p><p>  David Silverman: The shot of the monorail, where the camera zips by really fast, is really great. There are a lot of what we call multi-plane shots of the monorail racing profile, with things in the foreground and the background moving slower, giving a real sense of dimension. It made that really sing.</p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼：单轨列车的镜头非常棒，镜头飞驰而过。有很多我们所说的单轨赛车侧面的多平面镜头，前景中的东西和背景移动得更慢，给人一种真正的立体感。它让这首歌唱得很好听。</p><p>  Rich Moore: You have to remember, there was a huge crew of people at the animation studio working on this show. It’s one thing if you’re on board with it, but my job was to get everyone else on board with it. This is huge and ambitious, and we’re going to put in a lot of overtime on this one. It was really cool that everyone jumped in and did everything they could to make it happen. The crew really rose to the occasion, because they really loved the show. Nobody was working just to make a paycheque. The people involved in it – from top to bottom – really had a lot of passion.</p><p>里奇·摩尔：你必须记住，动画工作室有一大群人在制作这部剧。如果你同意这是一回事，但我的工作是让其他所有人都同意。这是一个巨大而雄心勃勃的项目，我们将在这方面投入大量的加班费。真的很酷，每个人都跳了进来，并尽其所能来实现这一目标。剧组真的抓住了机会，因为他们真的很喜欢这部剧。没有人工作只是为了挣钱。参与其中的人--从上到下--真的很有激情。</p><p>  David Silverman: What I really love about Rich’s work is that everything he does is so well designed. He has a strong sense of comic timing in animation performance – setting up a joke and paying it off, and staging it properly. He’s keenly aware of that. He’s also really dedicated. He works tirelessly and wants to get things just perfect. He’s very exacting. He knows what he wants to see, and he </p><p>大卫·西尔弗曼：我真的很喜欢里奇的作品，因为他做的每件事都是精心设计的。他在动画表演中有很强的喜剧时间感-设置一个笑话，然后付诸实施，并恰当地上演。他很清楚这一点。他也非常敬业。他不知疲倦地工作，想把事情做得尽善尽美。他非常严格。他知道他想看什么，他。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akdzx5/an-oral-history-of-marge-vs-the-monorail-the-simpsons">https://www.vice.com/en/article/akdzx5/an-oral-history-of-marge-vs-the-monorail-the-simpsons</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/口述/">#口述</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/history/">#history</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/认为/">#认为</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
