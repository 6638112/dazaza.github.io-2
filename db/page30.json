Those retailers can then sell those products to their own customers. It\u2019s a B2B2C play with a focus on offline sales at the end of the chain.\n You can find a bit of everything on Ankorstore, from household supplies to maple syrup, candles, headbands, bath salts and stationery items. Some verticals have been working quite well in particular, such as non-perishable groceries, beauty products and items for your home.\n  And it\u2019s been working extremely well given the company\u2019s trajectory. There are currently 200,000 retailers using the marketplace and sourcing items from 15,000 brands. In May 2021, when Ankorstore  raised its Series B, the company told me it was working with 50,000 shops and 5,000 brands.\n This leads us to today\u2019s funding round. Bond and Tiger Global led the Series C. Eurazeo and Coatue also participated in the round. Some existing investors put more money on the table, such as Index Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, GFC, Alven and Aglae Ventures.\n There aren\u2019t a lot of companies competing in the space. The best known wholesale marketplace is probably  Faire, a U.S.-based company that has raised  over $1 billion \u2014 it has recently started its  European expansion.  Creoate and  Orderchamp also operate wholesale marketplaces in Europe.\n   Ankorstore has teams in five countries \u2014 France, the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden. It sells products in 23 European markets. Retailers can pay up to 60 days after ordering something and there are no hidden fees for them. Essentially, Ankorstore helps retailers focus on curation, service while the startup takes care of procurement.\n As for brands listing their items on Ankorstore, they give a 10% cut on each transaction following a higher 20% cut on the first order through Ankorstore.\n Some brands still have direct deals with massive retailers, such as department stores. And Ankorstore doesn\u2019t prevent brands from hiring sales people, going to fairs, etc. The marketplace is just another sales channel and another opportunity to find customers.\n And this is the beauty of the business model of wholesale marketplaces. Ankorstore doesn\u2019t have any warehouse and doesn\u2019t own any inventory. The company only facilitates transactions between brands and retailers without any capital investment.\n \u201cWe think we\u2019re closer to LinkedIn in the way we operate \u2014 it\u2019s a network of professionals and we help them connect with each other,\u201d co-founder and co-CEO Nicolas Cohen told me.\n And like all social networks, there are some strong network effects as the platform gets bigger. In particular, Ankorstore expects to expand to new categories, such as perishable food.\n The startup already has a deal with UPS to help brands with shipping. But the company hasn\u2019t done much when it comes to warehousing solutions for small brands. That\u2019s another opportunity down the road.\n With 400 employees and a lot of money in its bank account, Ankorstore could act as the unifying layer of this highly fragmented industry.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 13:41:31", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u63a8\u51fa,reaches,\u9500\u552e", "title": "Ankorstore\u5728\u63a8\u51fa\u6279\u53d1\u5e02\u573a\u540e\u4e24\u5e74\u8fbe\u523020\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4f30\u503c", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAnkorstore reaches $2 billion valuation two years after launching its wholesale marketplace\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63a8\u51fa", "reaches", "\u9500\u552e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072592, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u9ece\u660eBasciano\u7684\u7956\u5148\u5728\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u4e94\u4eba\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5974\u5f79\u7684\u4eba\uff0c\u88ab\u8feb\u7559\u4e0b\u5a74\u513f\u513f\u5b50\u5974\u5f79\u5230\u5bc6\u82cf\u91cc\u5dde\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u3002\n\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u975e\u5e38\u6e05\u695a\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u201d\u5979\u57286\u6708\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u542c\u8bc1\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u4eec\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8c01\uff1f\u201d\n\u5728\u5e9f\u9664\u5974\u96b6\u5236\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u5230\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u7ea2\u7ebf\u5386\u53f2 \u200b\u200b- \u5426\u5b9a\u4e86\u5426\u8ba4\u91d1\u878d\u670d\u52a1\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u6c11\u7684\u6b67\u89c6\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4ed6\u4eec\u642c\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u5730\u533a - \u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u6b67\u89c6\u4f4f\u623f\u5b9e\u8df5\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u6821\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5f53\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u9ed1\u4eba\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u9003\u5230\u4e86\u5357\u90e8\u548c\u5409\u59c6\u00b7\u4e4c\u9e26\uff0c\u5982\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u201c\u6392\u9664\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u969c\u788d\u201d\uff0c\u5982\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7684\u4f4f\u623f\u5951\u7ea6\uff0c\u7981\u6b62\u623f\u4e3b\u5356\u7ed9\u9ed1\u4eba\u4eba\u4eec\u8bf4\uff0cIsabel Wilkerson\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\u592a\u9633\u7684\u6e29\u6696\u7684\u4f5c\u8005\uff1a\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u53f2\u8bd7\u822c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u201c\u8d54\u507f\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\uff1f Basciano\u8bf4\uff0c\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u51e0\u4e4e\u611f\u5230\u5185\u759a\uff0c\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u6211\u6240\u611f\u53d7\u5230\u7684\u75db\u82e6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u4e0e\u6211\u5171\u9e23\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u7684\u5bb6\u4eba\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u662f\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u544a\u77e5\u548c\u91cd\u73b0\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f24\u5bb3\u4e86\u3002\u4f60\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1f\u4f60\u600e\u4e48\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5982\u6b64\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff1f\u201c", "note_en": "Dawn Basciano\u2019s ancestors arrived five generations ago in Coloma,  California, as enslaved people, forced to leave behind an infant son enslaved to another family in Missouri.\n Those ancestors, Nancy and Peter Gooch, were freed in 1850 when California joined the union as a free state, and 20 years later, their son and his family were able to join them in the fertile agricultural land north-east of Sacramento. Their journey west was funded by the sweat and hard work of Nancy, who grew and sold fruit, mended clothes and cooked for the local miners.\n  Nancy and her descendants would go on to purchase more than 400 lush acres of farmland in Coloma. But what should have been a story of triumph ended instead as a tale all too familiar to formerly enslaved Black Americans across the US. The state of California seized the majority of that land under the guise of eminent domain to build a state park, and the family never received just compensation.\n The economic injustices, the education injustices, the social injustices, the judicial injustices go on and on and on\n \u201cWe were denied the financial security and wealth associated with land ownership,\u201d Basciano said. Pearley Monroe \u2013 Nancy\u2019s grandson, and Basciano\u2019s great-grandfather \u2013 spent the rest of his life mourning the loss.\n Now, the story of Basciano\u2019s family and others are under review by a California reparations taskforce. The first of its kind in the nation, the committee is tackling the daunting and unprecedented work of recommending reparations \u2013 whether they be monetary or through policy \u2013 for Black Californians, particularly those who are descended from enslaved people.\n Shirley Weber, the California secretary of state, who authored the law that formed the taskforce, has said California must forge its own path on the thorny topic of reparations, an issue the federal government has  tried and  failed to resolve for decades.\n \u201cWe came to understand very clearly that California has the ability and the power to do it,\u201d she said at a public hearing in June. \u201cAnd if not us, then who?\u201d\n The taskforce was formed in 2020 after the legislature and Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, approved a law requiring  the study and development of reparations proposals. Since then, the nine-person taskforce, comprising civil rights leaders, attorneys, lawmakers and academics, has spent months gathering evidence, listening to expert testimony, hosting public meetings and considering proposals, with the goal of submitting its recommendations to the legislature next summer.\n  The taskforce is undertaking this vast challenge with the knowledge that the historic injustices suffered by the descendants of slavery are deep, systemic and difficult to quantify.\n \u201cThe economic injustices, the education injustices, the social injustices, the judicial injustices go on and on and on,\u201d said Weber in June. \u201cWe must be aggressive in our efforts to be honest and direct and to figure out what we need to do in California and be an example to the rest of the nation in how we begin to reckon with ourselves.\u201d\n  California\u2019s unique history with slavery and its aftermath has made addressing reparations a particularly complicated task.\n Though California joined the union as a free state in 1850, 11 years before the civil war, many who took to the Sierra Nevada foothills during the Gold Rush in the years before statehood brought enslaved people with them. While the state constitution proclaimed \u201cneither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for punishment of a crime, shall ever be tolerated\u201d, the legislature passed a fugitive slave law in 1852 that allowed those who had been brought to California before it became a free state to be returned to the south.\n In one case that went all the way to the state supreme court, a slaveholder brought a man, Archie Lee, to California after statehood and after the fugitive slave law had lapsed . But the courts argued that the slaveholder was so \u201cyoung and ignorant\u201d of California\u2019s laws that he should not be deprived of his human property, Stacey Smith, an associate history professor at Oregon State University, testified at a public taskforce meeting in September.\n  Other experts testified about the years of discrimination that followed after slavery was abolished, from environmental racism to the state\u2019s history of redlining \u2013 a discriminatory practice of denying financial services to specific people to prevent them from moving to or living in certain areas \u2013 and how discriminatory housing practices led to segregation in schools. They also testified about the Great Migration, when millions of Black Americans fled the south and Jim Crow to places like California, hoping for a better life, but found instead \u201cstructural barriers of exclusion\u201d like restrictive housing covenants that forbade homeowners from selling to Black people, said Isabel Wilkerson, author of The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration.\n \u201cThe caste system followed the migrants wherever they went and became not merely a southern phenomenon, but a national one,\u201d she testified. Black Californians also faced rampant racism in the communities where they tried to settle. Wilkerson spoke of how after Emory Hestus Holmes, a second world war veteran, purchased a three-bedroom home for his family in Pacoima, California, in 1959, the neighbors led a relentless harassment campaign in an effort to get them to move away. They prank-called them at all hours, threw rocks through their windows, burned a cross on their lawn and spray-painted on their garage: \u201cBlack Cancer Lives Here, Don\u2019t Let It Spread\u201d.\n  Early on in the process, the taskforce reviewed other examples of reparations programs throughout the world. Germany paid $89bn in restitution to Holocaust victims while the United States paid $20,000 each to the 82,219 Japanese Americans who were unlawfully incarcerated during the second world war. In 2015, the United States authorized payments of up to $10,000 per day \u2013 a total of $4.4m each \u2013 for the dozens of people taken hostage in Iran in 1979. A Kirsten Mullen, co-author of From Here to Equality, told the taskforce that following that same math, the payment for one Black American who endured a single decade under Jim Crow would be $36.5m.\n But the challenge before this taskforce is that so many of the injustices suffered and opportunities lost by Black Americans \u201ccan\u2019t be quantified\u201d, Weber said at a September meeting.\n Weber\u2019s father was a sharecropper in Hope, Arkansas, who had to flee to California after he tried to organize for fairer wages. Descended from enslaved people, his community had been terrorized into deference following a number of race riots that ripped through the country. \u201cYou can\u2019t quantify my father\u2019s lack of education and the negative experience that he had just trying to survive for himself and his family,\u201d Weber said. \u201cYou have to begin to say, OK, what do we do in terms of opening up this particular society in a way that really makes an effort to create the opportunities not just for those who are here but also for the next generation to come?\n  The scale of the injustices under assessment by the committee is almost inconceivably vast. Given stolen land and housing discrimination alone, Black Americans were denied the greatest source of family wealth today \u2013 home ownership, Wilkerson testified. This robbery of family inheritance and generational wealth has created a wealth gap between Black and white Americans that  some studies say would take 228 years to close.\n  For Dawn Basciano\u2019s family, the loss was enormous. Not only did they lose the majority of their farmland on her paternal side \u2013 land that would have provided steady employment for extended family as well money and legacy \u2013 her fourth great-grandmother on her mother\u2019s side had assets unfairly taken from her as well when her brother died and the state auctioned off the swaths of property he owned in downtown Sacramento under the pretense that he had no living heirs or descendants \u2013 \u201calthough his sister, my fourth great-grandmother, was alive and well\u201d, Basciano testified in September.\n \u201cWhat do reparations look like? There is so much,\u201d Basciano said. \u201cI almost feel guilty for feeling the pain that I feel, but it\u2019s real. It resonates with me. This is my family. These are the stories that have been told and retold, and it hurts. How do you fix that? How do you right a wrong that is so systemic?\u201d\n Basciano pointed out that there were hundreds of thousands of families that had stories like hers. In September, Newsom signed a law that would return a lucrative beachfront property in Manhattan Beach, California, that had been taken from the  Bruce family in the 1920s through eminent domain.  The Manhattan Beach city council had voted to oppose issuing a symbolic proclamation to apologize to the Bruces, citing concerns it would make the city liable for future lawsuits.\n Though any recommendations made by the taskforce will not be binding, Weber urged its members to be bold in their proposals, including universal preschool for all children to help address educational and childcare inequities. Other witnesses and experts have suggested monetary reparations, low-interest loans, public apologies, just compensation for stolen land, the return of historically stolen land and ways for descendants of slavery to attend university at no cost.\n The taskforce will continue to meet in the new year. Weber acknowledged that whatever the body comes up with will probably only be the beginning.\n \u201cThis 400-year challenge is not going to be solved in 400 days,\u201d Weber said. \u201cIt will take much more than that, and a commitment from the state of California, the fifth-largest economy in the world, to make that happen.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 13:29:30", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u63a8\u52a8,push,\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a", "title": "'\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8c01\uff1f'\uff1a\u5730\u6807\u63a8\u52a8\u9ed1\u8272\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a\u4eba\u7684\u8d54\u507f", "title_en": "\u2018If not us, then who?\u2019: The landmark push for reparations for Black Californians", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/california-reparations-slavery-african-americans", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u63a8\u52a8", "push", "\u52a0\u5229\u798f\u5c3c\u4e9a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c3c4f7fcfdd0315b47d1f08722f70ca6.jpeg", "infoid": 1072591, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u9662\u8003\u8651\u5230\u62dc\u767b\u653f\u5e9c\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1 - \u5305\u62ec\u5468\u4e94\u7684\u53e3\u5934\u8bba\u636e\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u6cd5\u9662 - \u5df2\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u884c\u653f\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6cd5\u4ee4\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5baa\u6cd5\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u636e\u8bf4\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8981\u6c42\uff1aomicron\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5d1b\u8d77\u3002", "note_en": "Federal courts considering the Biden administration\u2019s vaccination mandates\u2014including the Supreme Court at Friday\u2019s oral argument\u2014have focused on administrative-law issues.

I first saw the illusory nature of space when I was in high school. In the late forties I saw that causality was an illusion.\u201d\n This\u00a0is a reflective Philip K. Dick, writing in the last few years of his life, trying to put into words a social and metaphysical philosophy that had been haunting him for decades as he wrote dozens of science fiction stories that aimed to, as he said, \u201cpierce the veil of what is only apparently real to find out what is  really  real.\u201d The world was not real, everything was an illusion and everyday life was but a living dream.\n It\u2019s fitting that Berkeley \u2014 a city of artists and intellectuals and mechanics and squatters \u2014 was the place where the epiphany revealed itself to him; that Berkeley would become the locale of inspirational fodder for decades to come.\n His family moved to the city in 1931 when he was just 2. School records at the nursery he attended described Dick as \u201ca lover of peace,\u201d with an \u201cintellectual curiosity and keen interest in everything about him.\u201d\n This was, in part, a reflection of both his upbringing by his well-educated parents and his new home in a town with a large population of freethinking academics and bohemians attending UC Berkeley. Back then, a small trolley car used to run along Telegraph Avenue, flanked by small shops and restaurants that catered to the cosmopolitan tastes.\n More traditional forms of entertainment and leisure seemed to escape him, even at an early age: After watching a Cal football game at age 6, he later told his dad that he didn\u2019t understand why the players were constantly chasing each other back and forth across the field.\n Of course, Berkeley is more than just a university, and later in life, Dick would base many of his stories \u2014 science fiction and   otherwise  \u2014 in the blue-collar neighborhood of West Berkeley that was populated by warehouses, used car lots, greasy-spoon cafes and bars.\n As constant upheaval in his everyday life \u2014 Dick and his mother frequently moved from cottage to apartment around Berkeley\u00a0\u2014 began to take a toll on the young Berkeleian, he found solace in the stories and rhetoric of imaginary worlds.\n Dick would base many of his stories  in the blue-collar neighborhood of West Berkeley that was populated by warehouses, used car lots, greasy-spoon cafes and bars.\n He became obsessed with L. Frank Baum\u2019s \u201cOz\u201d  series and its tales of flying homes and evil witches and enchanted roads (though he later said as an adult that he struggled to find every book installment because \u201clibrarians haughtily told me that they \u2018did not stock fantastic material,\u2019 their reasoning being that books of fantasy led a child into a dreamworld and made it difficult for him to adjust properly to the \u2018real\u2019 world.\u201d)\n When Dick was 10, he and his dad paid 50 cents each to attend the 1939 World\u2019s Fair in San Francisco. In an   short film  promoting the event, an announcer proclaims how the city is straddled by \u201cthe two largest bridges in the world, symbolizing both pioneering vision and modern courage, in the conquest of space and time.\u201d As his father went to see a striptease performance, Dick wandered the fair\u2019s Hall of Science.\n  The next year, he took a crack at writing, his first attempt being a poem titled \u201cHe\u2019s Dead.\u201d The last two lines of the piece read, \u201cNo longer shall he scorn his bed. / Alas for us! Our dog is dead.\u201d The poem, along with several short stories, was published in the \u201cYoung Authors\u2019 Club\u201d section of the now-defunct local paper Berkeley Gazette. A mature Dick would go on to say that he considers the beginning of his writing career to be the same year he wrote the elegy to his late family dog.\n During this time, like most kids his age in Berkeley, he attended Garfield Junior High School, now known by its current name, Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School. But, like any good tortured artist, he hated the academic structure of public school with a passion. His health had never been particularly good (he was already taking amphetamines for his asthma), and constant bouts of panic attacks and vertigo made school almost unbearable.\n Often staying home from school, his discovery of his first science fiction magazine in 1940 unfurled the infinite opportunities of fantasy before him. Dick began to haunt various Berkeley secondhand bookstores, trying to get his hands on as many sci-fi pulps as possible. By the time he entered Berkeley High School four years later, \u201cthe battles were drawn,\u201d writes biographer Lawrence Sutin.\n Dick would need to take refuge in the realm of imaginative art or be swallowed whole by physical and psychological trauma of the real world.\n But back to that high school epiphany, that first glimpse of \u201cdivine madness.\u201d A student at Berkeley High School, still suffering from a debilitating combination of vertigo, agoraphobia and claustrophobia \u2014 he once, as he walked down the aisle of a classroom, said he felt as though the floor was tilting away from him, as if the whole world were shifting under him.\n During the middle of a high school physics final, he struggled to answer a question on Archimedes\u2019 principle, which states that when an object is submerged, it is met with a force equal to the volume of the water it has displaced. In an anxiety-fueled panic, the test seemed to be all that stood between him and entrance to UC Berkeley (the university that most of his friends were expected to attend).\n \u201cI prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and then this voice clicked on and said, \u2018The principle is really very simple,\u201d Dick later recalled in an interview. \u201cThen it went on and stated the principle and explained how it was applied.\u201d\n All the mental barriers that had plagued him through schooling suddenly melted away, with a mechanical \u201cclick\u201d and the guidance of an almost android-like entity. He got an A on the test.\n It was a revelation that would still follow him many years later: The technological female voice of artificial intelligence just beyond the event horizon of reality, weaving its way into published words and burrowing into his increasingly unstable mind, providing a dizzying clarity and obscurity.\n For a teen with as much social anxiety as Dick had, it\u2019s surprising that he ended up getting jobs at local radio and records shops in Berkeley at the tender age of 15. But Dick thrived in the seeder art community in Berkeley, debating and joking with his co-workers about politics and music and life.\n His first task at University Radio, then located near Shattuck Avenue and Center Street, was salvaging vacuum tubes and adapters for parts (World War II continued to rage in Dick\u2019s teen years). Dick sold radios and other appliances for the store and, later, a new form of technology called television.\n The store imparted more than work experience: He lost his virginity to a former customer of his in its basement storage closet. Interestingly enough, in his 1965 novel \u201cDr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb,\u201d a basement storage closet becomes the last place of refuge for a couple of TV store employees in Berkeley during a nuclear strike.\n \u201cBecause I was fortunate enough to live in Berkeley, which is probably as much an intellectual center as you\u2019d find anywhere in the world, I was not limited as my other friends who write science fiction are.\u201d\n As hard as it is to imagine now, Dick\u2019s love of science fiction and fantasy began to wane when he left his mother\u2019s home as a 19-year-old with no plan to go to college. An older Dick posited that it was because Berkeley culture of the 1940s \u201crequired you to have a really thorough groundbreaking in the classics.\u201d\n \u201cBecause I was fortunate enough to live in Berkeley, which is probably as much an intellectual center as you\u2019d find anywhere in the world, I was not limited as my other friends who write science fiction are,\u201d Dick   said .\n In a kind of parallel to the days of his childhood with his then-recently-divorced mother, Dick\u2019s early 20s were marked by constant moving: One year at McKinley Avenue, another Bancroft Way, another on Dwight Way. During this time, Dick struggled under his desire to write, a deeper desire to attain celebrity status and a desperate need to make money. He wrote dozens of mainstream short stories at the time. Editors didn\u2019t bite, and it stung.\n In 1949, he gave college one last try. At UC Berkeley, he majored in philosophy, taking classes in history and zoology. One year later, however, he quit. In a later interview, he described his exasperation with the whole institution of academia:\n \u201cI had a whole bunch of courses that were just so much birdshit. \u2026 I was standing there looking in the microscope. And there aren\u2019t even any paramecia in there at all, \u2018cause the slide moved. And the instruction is, \u2018draw what you see,\u2019 and I realize that there\u2019s nothing there, nothing at all.\u201d\n He would never return to school, but stated on several occasions the importance and value he placed in his UC Berkeley library card. It would be at UC Berkeley\u2019s very own Main Stacks that, in the coming decade, he would spend years looking up Gestapo documents and other Nazi propaganda, gathering research for a possible story about an alternative world where the Axis won World War II.\n In 1962, the years of writing and researching and soul-searching would culminate in the publication of the \u201cThe Man in the High Castle,\u201d a novel set in the shimmering, gritty and exotic city just across the bay. The novel received critical acclaim and put the short story writer on the map. The book won Dick a Hugo Award, the science fiction and fantasy literature world\u2019s highest award.\n  The whole story, though, of Dick\u2019s life after the end of his youthful years in Berkeley is just as dystopian as many of his works. For most of his life he was impoverished \u2014 In 1950, he bought a house on Francisco Street, but as the decade went on, he was still writing mostly short stories that didn\u2019t pay nearly enough. Dick and his then-wife would sometimes eat ground horse meat purchased at 35 cents a pound from the\u00a0Lucky Dog Pet Shop\u00a0in Berkeley. And, eventually, he would move away.\n The amphetamines he had started taking for his asthma as a child morphed into an addiction to speed that fueled the breakneck pace of his writing (he wrote three novels, \u201cDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u201d \u201cUbik\u201d and \u201cNick and the Glimmung,\u201d all in 1966) but also destroyed his body and mind. From that first consummation in the basement of University Radio, Dick had a procession of failed marriages and romances, almost always with a woman whose intelligence and seductive charm appeared to him both terrifyingly cold but deliriously irresistible.\n In 1974, Dick proclaimed that a pink light had appeared before him and\u00a0a benevolent being he nicknamed Zebra had zapped his brain with \u201cmystical information.\u201d Zebra, he said, was camouflage in the form of everyday objects, and had revealed to him that our history and present was an illusion.\n By the end of his life, the visionary of alternative worlds believed that his own world was a simulacrum of some unattainable reality. Dick would remain largely unknown to the mainstream public whose attention he had so desperately craved until just before his death in 1982, just a few months before the first release of a major film based on his work: \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d\n  He only ever saw glimpses of the film, but in a   letter  to the production company, Dick\u2019s excitement for the future is palpable: \u201cMy life and creative work are justified and completed by Blade Runner. Thank you, \u2026 and it is going to be one hell of a commercial success. It will prove invincible.\u201d\n Even with his larger-than-life narratives of space travel and technological advances and apocalyptic societies, Dick\u2019s works always seemed to present an uncanny valley version of everyday life \u2014 who\u2019s to say that goat in the Berkeley hills or that toad croaking at Strawberry Creek isn\u2019t  a machine?\n In fact, Berkeley\u2019s unique fingerprints on the sci-fi vanguard\u2019s work become obvious on closer inspection: the repairmen and tinkerers, the anxiety of a dilapidated urban cityscape, the lofty metaphysical philosophies of men long since dead, robot-life femmes fatales, and even a neighbor\u2019s dog. Every aspect of his life in Berkeley was rendered imaginative fodder for his creative tales. Everything was material.\n It makes sense, perhaps, that the first short story Dick ever sold in 1953 was entirely based on the utterly mundane situation of a Berkeley neighbor\u2019s dog barking at the garbage man. The story of \u201cRoog\u201d goes like this: A dog named Boris, who believes that garbage is actually precious food, is shocked to see that his owner not only tosses the garbage into cans, but that it is also dumped into garbage trucks. The twist? With his keen perception, Boris is able to sense that the garbage men are actually \u201cRoogs,\u201d predatory creatures disguised as humans that accept the garbage as sacrifices until they eventually tire of trash and devour the humans.\n Trying to alert the humans, Boris cries \u201cRoog! Roog!\u201d but they all mistake the alerts as simple barking, letting the garbagemen escape to prey another day.\n Kyle Arnold puts it best in his biography \u201cThe Divine Madness of Philip K. Dick\u201d:  \u201cThe dog wouldn\u2019t let him dream, so he dreamed   it  by writing it into his story.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-10 11:33:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "android,\u68a6\u60f3,dream,\u8fea\u514b", "title": "Androids\u68a6\u60f3\u4f2f\u514b\u5229\u5417\uff1f Philip K.

It all seemed so promising. Amazon Pay would provide an easier checkout experience for my customers, with the shipping address and payment details already filled, and I\u2019d save a small amount in transaction fees. What could go wrong? But six weeks later, Amazon has $2300 of my money with no way for me to access it, and their support has been worthless. I can only hope that a public shaming article will spur somebody at Amazon to take notice and intervene, otherwise that money is probably just gone.\n I created the Amazon Pay account on November 29, and configured my business bank account info so I could receive electronic disbursements. This is a normal business checking account at a normal US bank, using US dollars, and that works fine with other payment processors like PayPal and Shopify Payments. I entered the bank\u2019s ACH routing number and my account number, which ends with the digits 622. Soon I was able to receive payments in my store using Amazon Pay, and everything seemed good.\n The problem started on December 8, when Amazon Pay attempted the first disbursement to my bank account. I received a failure notification by email:\n \u201cYour most recent transfer of funds in the amount of $XXX was not successfully deposited into your bank account on file (ending in 622). The funds were returned to us, and we have removed the current bank account information from your account.\u201d\n Amazon Pay\u2019s merchant support was unable to explain what went wrong. They sent me some generic troubleshooting info that looked like it was written by a bot. It\u2019s not clear why they couldn\u2019t provide any specific details about why this transfer failed. The generic info suggested the routing or bank account numbers might be wrong, so I re-entered the numbers again, being extra careful to get them correct. Then I waited a week\u2026 and the exact same thing happened. This same dance played out five more times on December 16, 17, 18, 20, and 21. Each time Amazon Pay attempted a disbursement to my bank, then a few days later I got the same email saying the money wasn\u2019t successfully deposited to my bank account ending in 622, and \u201cwe have removed the current bank account information from your account.\u201d\n On December 23 I contacted my bank and gave them the trace IDs for all the failed transfers. My bank determined that the account number was wrong on every transfer. All the failed ACH transfers used an account number ending in 62 instead of 622:  the last digit of the account number was missing!\n Armed with this information, I returned to Amazon Pay merchant support, and here\u2019s where I really started to get frustrated. I discovered that my original support case had been unilaterally closed without resolution, because five days had passed since the last reply, and apparently that\u2019s their support policy. It\u2019s not possible to reopen or reply to a closed case, so I had to create a new case and explain the issue all over again. This did not go well. Imagine this support exchange happening slowly by email over a series of two days:\n Me (paraphrasing):  I\u2019m still having trouble with disbursements. You closed my last case number XXXX about this issue, so I had to create this new case. My bank says the last digit of the bank account number is missing on all the ACH transfers from Amazon Pay, but the bank account number is correct in my Amazon Pay settings.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings.\n Me:  Please see attached screenshot showing my bank account info is already set up correctly. I have already done this several times, but every time there\u2019s a failed disbursement attempt, Amazon Pay removes my bank account information. The fundamental problem is that the last digit of the bank account number is missing in all of Amazon\u2019s ACH transfers. Please look at the ACH transfers yourself to confirm.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings. The screenshot you sent doesn\u2019t show what account it\u2019s associated with so we can\u2019t tell anything from that.\n Me:  The bank account info has already been entered. I\u2019ve attached a full-page screenshot showing this. The deposit method isn\u2019t assigned, because every time there\u2019s a failed disbursement attempt, Amazon Pay removes my bank account information. Please respond to the fundamental issue of the missing digit in the ACH transfers. Here are all the trace IDs again. You can verify them yourself.\n Amazon Pay:  Your bank account may not be compatible with our system. Your account needs to be ACH-ready. Please contact your bank.\n Me:  Yes it\u2019s ACH-ready, it\u2019s a standard business checking account at a USA bank, and I\u2019m already receiving ACH transfers there from PayPal and Shopify. I mentioned all this already in the first case that I opened, that Amazon Pay closed without resolution. You still have not addressed or even mentioned the fundamental problem that I\u2019ve asked about four times now, the missing digit in the ACH transfers. Kindly investigate why this digit is missing in all the ACH transfers from Amazon Pay.\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you are having problems with your bank account. Thank you for your continued patience. At this time I am working with our internal team to reach a resolution on your case.\n (five days later) Me:  Has there been any progress on this? I\u2019m still unable to access the funds in my Amazon Pay account.\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you are having problems with your bank account. Thank you for your continued patience. At this time I am working with our internal team to reach a resolution on your case.\n (five days later): Case closed with no further response from Amazon. Can\u2019t reopen or reply.\n Now I was really upset. Since I couldn\u2019t reopen the old cases, I opened a third case to explain the issue with failed disbursements and the missing account number digit, all over again.\n Amazon Pay:  To receive disbursements, you need to set up your bank account info in your Amazon Pay settings. You do not have a bank account configured in your settings.\n  I was able to reach a phone support agent, and told him I just wanted to close my Amazon Pay account and get a final payout by paper check, since they seem unable to resolve the problem with electronic transfers to my bank.  I was told they can\u2019t do it. Basically the options were 1) electronic transfer to bank, or 2) electronic transfer to bank.\n I asked the phone agent to review the previous case, and see what information the \u201cinternal team\u201d had found before that case was closed. There was none. All the discussion from the previous case was essentially gone and worthless.\n So I went through all the same conversation again with the phone agent, arguing about why my bank account info wasn\u2019t set up in my Amazon Pay settings. I gamely played along while he had me delete my browser cookies and other irrelevant troubleshooting. Since closing the account didn\u2019t appear to be a viable option, I tried once again to delete and re-enter all my bank account info. The phone agent insisted that everything would be OK now that I\u2019d entered my bank account info, and I would receive a disbursement within the next few days. He didn\u2019t seem to understand or care that I\u2019d already been through this same loop several times before without success. Skeptical, I thanked him and hung up. I then received a follow-up email:\n Amazon Pay:  I understand that you would like to know how you can see the transaction and how disbursements work for the Amazon Pay platform. If you want to find your transactions coming from Amazon Pay just remember to switch from \u201cAmazon.com\u201d to \u201cAmazon Pay (Production View)\u201d. You would be able to see that next to your Seller name and the USA flag where there is a scroll down. etc\u2026\n What the actual fuck?! What is this and how is it relevant in any way? Is Amazon Pay\u2019s merchant support even staffed by human beings, or is it all just chatbots and  GPT-3-driven natural language text generation? Amazon needs to understand that merchants have many choices for payment processing, including PayPal and traditional credit card processors, who have professional support staffs to respond to account problems in a timely and constructive way. Many people complain about PayPal, but at least PayPal\u2019s support team responds to me with useful and relevant information that answers my questions. After a month of trying, I\u2019ve failed to get anyone at Amazon Pay to even acknowledge my problem with the missing account number digit, let alone give me any constructive help. Their merchant support seems designed to frustrate merchants into simply giving up and going away. I\u2019ve lost $2300 thanks to Amazon Pay, with no further options for resolution.

Nationwide expansion will begin in the following weeks.\n Hertz will offer Tesla Model 3, assumedly Standard Ran  ge Plus, for $334/week with plans available in the near future that will lower the price to $299 or less. Insurance and maintenance are both included. Drivers will have to currently maintain a 4.7 star rating and have completed at least 150 trips to be eligible for the program.\n Uber and Hertz have partnered since 2016 to provide drivers with vehicle rental options. With this partnership, Hertz will kick off the program by providing up to 50,000 vehicles by 2023 exclusively to drivers. If successful, the program could expand to 150,000 Teslas during the next three years. Hertz pointed out that these ambitions could be affected by factors outside of its control, such as semiconductor chip shortages or other constraints.\n Uber CEO Dara Khosrowhshahi issued a statement to CNN at the time of release that he hopes drivers who rent Tesla\u2019s through Hertz will eventually end up buying them in an effort to accelerate Uber\u2019s sustainability efforts.\n Uber is additionally offering a $1-a-ride bonus of up to $4,000 per year for Uber drivers who rent a Tesla through Hertz. Less than 10% of Uber drivers currently rent a vehicle.\n The rollout will be completed in 2023, with up to 50,000 Tesla\u2019s available for rent to Uber drivers. These Tesla\u2019s will be taken out of the 100,000 total purchase commitment that Herz made earlier this week, which pushed Tesla to a one-trillion dollar valuation.\n  Uber\u2019s CEO is completely spot-on: once drivers experience a Tesla, which is the goal of this program, they won\u2019t want to go back to driving an internal-combustion engine vehicle. This won\u2019t be a difficult sell either, as a recently-conducted survey of 6,000 Uber drivers found that 47% of drivers want their next vehicle to be fully electric.\n We do have to ponder the economics, as for many this will be a way to trial a Tesla as a taxi without the necessary commitments. $334/week, with a goal of getting prices to $299/week with volume, may sound slightly expensive at its surface but nonetheless carries a number of benefits along with the lack of a commitment.\n It is currently possible to finance a Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus with $0 down for $789/month, or lease it for $672/month. This is with a market-adjusted starting price of $43,990 \u2014 up $7,000 from February of this year. While both figures ultimately represent a lower cost, Hertz is including all insurance and maintenance. We\u2019d have to presume that mileage limits will be high, or nonexistent, as well. There is also a variable of whether Hertz plans to enable Full Self-Driving Capability at a cost of $10,000 per Tesla, although we would assume they aren\u2019t planning to do so.\n Long-term it absolutely does become more cost-effective to purchase a Tesla, as on the used market they hold value well even with extremely high miles. Rental fees of ~ $1200/month are a sunken cost, whereas there is added utility to financing a new or used Tesla which includes a potential to use the vehicle on Tesla\u2019s own autonomous taxi network once it\u2019s ready. It\u2019s also possible to sell it once it\u2019s no longer in commission.\n Model 3 already lends itself to being the perfect electric taxi, so making it more accessible for Uber drivers will lead to a big push towards sustainability as well as increased driver satisfaction. We would recommend that drivers consider buying a Tesla, either new or used, to make it more economical over time \u2014 which is the goal here for both companies.\n  Interested in Listing or Upgrading YOUR Tesla?

This post is an attempt to remedy that.\n In 1929,  Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding. He observed that light emitted from distant celestial objects was redder than expected, due to the downward shift in frequency as their light receded from Earth.\u00a0And the further away the objects were, the proportionately greater their redshift. Since objects were getting further apart from each other, figures like  Lema\u00eetre and  Friedmann reasoned that there must have been some point in the past at which the whole universe was compressed into a single point.\n Embarrassingly, linear extrapolation implied an age of the universe of 1-2 billion years, shorter than the known age of the oldest rocks on Earth. One of the difficulties is that expansion flipped from slowing down to speeding up after several billion years, and this requires complex observations of supernovae to account for. In any case, astronomers eventually measured the age of the universe at about 13.8 billion years. This implies three tempting definitions for the observable universe \u2014 that part of the whole universe which we can theoretically see \u2014 only one of which is correct.\n Universe age in light-years: You would be forgiven for thinking that the observable universe is a sphere with a radius of 13.8 billion light-years centred on the Earth, since that\u2019s how long light has had to reach us.\u00a0However, this assumes the universe isn\u2019t expanding or contracting.\n The Hubble radius: Hubble found that the distance to a given galaxy was proportional to its recessional velocity, with a constant of proportionality now called the Hubble constant  H.\u00a0This implies there is a sphere past which everything is travelling away from us faster than the speed of light.\u00a0This is known as the Hubble sphere, and it has a radius of around 14.4 billion light-years.\n You may worry that this faster-than-light travel violates Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity, which says that nothing can travel faster than light.\u00a0However, what relativity says is that\u00a0matter\u00a0within space can\u2019t travel faster than light, but nothing about how fast space\u00a0itself\u00a0can travel.\n The Hubble sphere isn\u2019t the observable universe either.\u00a0The radius of the Hubble sphere will be given by\u00a0c/H, where  c is the speed of light.\u00a0And the Hubble constant is decreasing: the relative velocities of celestial objects are (on average) growing more slowly than the distances between them. Therefore the Hubble sphere is expanding.\u00a0If the Hubble sphere expands fast enough, light leaving an extremely distant object can get \u2018caught\u2019 and drop from the faster-than-light region outside the sphere to the slower-than-light region inside.\u00a0Once this light is within the Hubble sphere, it can make its way to Earth (this is explained well in  this video).\u00a0If you work out their present distance from us, it turns out that all\u00a0of the photons we receive from the first five billion years of the universe\u2019s existence were all caught by the Hubble sphere.\u00a0These objects were, are, and always will be travelling away from us faster than the speed of light!\n The particle horizon: The full extent of the observable universe is bounded by the\u00a0particle horizon, which is the region from which light has had time to reach us since the beginning of the universe, taking into account its expansion.\u00a0The particle horizon has a radius of 46.5 billion light-years, so the observable universe is 93 billion light-years across.\n The famous  cosmic microwave background is at the particle horizon, and its light has taken 13.8 billion years to reach us (the fact that it consists of microwaves is an extreme version of redshifting).\u00a0In the  jargon, the  proper distance (the actual distance not taking into account the expansion of the universe) is 46.5 billion light-years but the  comoving distance (taking account of expansion) is 13.8 billion years.\n The particle horizon limits how far in distance we can observe, while the Hubble sphere limits how far back in  time we can observe.\u00a0We could never\u00a0see objects outside the Hubble sphere\u00a0as they are now, no matter how long we waited.\u00a0Moreover, just as light can get caught in the Hubble sphere, the expansion of space can push light out of it.\u00a0Every second, 20,000 stars become newly unobservable from Earth.\u00a0In a few billion years, the observable universe will consist of only our  Local Group of a few dozen galaxies.\u00a0Future astronomers would gaze upon a barren universe.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 10:36:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89c2\u5bdf,observable,\u5b87\u5b99", "title": "\u6f84\u6e05\u201c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u5b87\u5b99\u201d\u5305\u62ec\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "Clarifying what the 'Observable Universe' includes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://samenright.com/2022/01/09/disambiguating-the-observable-universe/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c2\u5bdf", "\u5b87\u5b99"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072582, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u684c\u9762\u4e0a\u67e5\u770b\u6b64\u7ad9\u70b9\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u5bf9DMARC\u5982\u4f55\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "note_en": "View this site on your desktop to get the full visual explanation on how DMARC works.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:44:24", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "dmarc,spf,\u67e5\u770b", "title": "\u770b\u770bDMARC\uff0cSPF\u548cDKIM\u5982\u4f55\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f", "title_en": "See how DMARC, SPF, and DKIM work interactively", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.learndmarc.com/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["dmarc", "spf", "\u67e5\u770b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "63a98cbd80d0907ccb96e8b98a63c103.jpg", "infoid": 1072581, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Iconic Comedian Bob Saget\u5728\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u9152\u5e97\u623f\u95f4\u6ca1\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u540e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u3002\n\u7740\u540d\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u5728ABC SItcom\u5168\u623f\u5c4b\u53ca\u5176Netflix efreer House\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u7740\u540d\u7684\u7535\u89c6\u4eba\u683c\u662f\u6700\u4e3a\u95fb\u540d\u7684\u804c\u4f4dDanny Tanner\u3002\u4ed6\u8fd8\u4ece1989\u5e74\u52301997\u5e74\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "note_en": "Iconic comedian Bob Saget has died after he was found unresponsive in a hotel room.\n  JACKSONVILLE, Fla. \u2013 Stand-up comedian, actor, television host and director Bob Saget has died at a hotel in Orlando,  according to the Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n Hotel staff found Saget unresponsive in his room at the Ritz Carlton on Sunday afternoon around 4, according to police.

As talk of \u201cthe metaverse\u201d grows, and people float theories about owning items and cosmetic skins and being able to take between games, interest in what that means practically for gamers has lead to a wild array of theories, but they\u2019re largely pushed by people who know nothing about game development. So, as a developer, it falls to people like me who live and work in these spaces to share our knowledge, and so over the next couple of weeks, I\u2019ll attempt to do just that, so subscribe and stick around for the rest of the series.\n  The myth of \u2018storing an item\u2019 on the blockchain (or anywhere else) as an NFT (\u2190 You are Here)\n Thing is, being able to tell what someone owns in a game is a solved problem. APIs have been doing it for decades \u2014 that\u2019s how PSN and XBox Live tell games what people bought in their stores, and grant them access to stuff like games, or DLC. We\u2019ll dig into how that works in a later episode.\n The blockers to cross-game itemization are, and always have been, logical, technical, legal, and business issues.\n Before we start, I need to explain what an NFT is, and what it does.\n  At it\u2019s simplest form, an NFT is just a record in a kind of database. You can retrieve the wallet address that owns it, the contract address that created it, the transaction history of its previous owners and sales, and the contents itself, which are arbitrary. In most public use cases, the NFT contains  JSON \u2014 a structured text file containing data. It can execute arbitrary code or perform a function when certain conditions are met. Then it records the transaction on a blockchain. The NFT can never be edited or changed, and you can cryptographically prove that all transactions happened the way the blockchain says.\n You can think of it just like a database that anyone can read. If you don\u2019t understand why the kind of database a game uses is important, then this article is for you.\n   In this pitch, there are two games, and the concept is that Game A could store items people earn or buy in-game as an NFT on a blockchain, and then people who own it could use it in Game B.\n Some definitions: - Item: some in-game functional piece of gear, like a sword, gun, or armour. - Cosmetic: some non-functional appearance change, like a skin for an item. - Inventory: a collection of things you have, made up of both items and cosmetics.\n While there are many problems with this idea from the get-go, this article focuses on the idea that the NFT, or any off-platform storage, could contain an item in its entirety for use in another game, which it could load at will.\n To put names to it - here\u2019s one example I hear a lot.\n \u201cWith NFTs I could earn a rare sword in Diablo 3 and take it into Path of Exile!\u201d\n And there are fundamental problems with that idea, that are unrelated to blockchains or NFTs.\n You can\u2019t actually store the items or cosmetics themselves on the blockchain in a way that will let them be used automatically. They\u2019re big, complex, and games can\u2019t interpret them without a lot of manual work. In reality, if you were attempting to do this, the NFT would contain a string that uniquely represents them, the same ones the game uses internally, like \u201cWEAPON_ENERGY_SWORD_01\u201d, then it would be up to the other game to implement that in a way that can work with yours. This is how things like Twitch Prime drops are granted.\n Even if you could store the raw asset data and send it to the other game straight off the blockchain, the other game has to spend time and money implementing those items and cosmetics.\n To dig into these, we have to learn a little bit about how game assets are actually made, so let\u2019s start with some of the basics, and the processes that a human has to go through to take something out of one game, and put it in another.\n Since you can download assets from online stores and put them in games, you might think you can just export  meshes (what most people think of when you say a 3D model) between games as well. But the truth is much more complex, and simply put: no.\n  Game engines can\u2019t even agree on which way is up, let alone a myriad of other things. You cannot simply \u2018export\u2019 and \u2018import\u2019, let alone have that happen automatically without knowing the intricate details of how the asset was created, and what specific tasks need to be done to make it work in your game. These assets aren\u2019t just a model and textures - they all contain code of some sort that fundamentally ties them to the game they were created in. Even moving items or cosmetics between two games made in Unreal Engine is an extremely manual process, because they all depend on things in the codebase that don\u2019t exist in other games.\n At a high level, some of the things that can\u2019t be imported are:\n Behaviour. Every game has its own custom ways of storing and recalling that data. Even moving guns between two shooters can\u2019t be done programmatically without customizing the task. For example, one might store rate of fire as a \u2018rounds per second\u2019, and the other might store a \u2018delay between rounds\u2019. Others might use curves to represent ramp speed, while some might just use a number. Recoil might be a central library or a function per gun. You need to recode the objects.\n Audio. You could store wav files, but how they actually behave and produce sound are totally dependent on whatever audio middleware they might be using, like  WWise or  FMod. You need to reprogram the audio.\n VFX and Fabric. Many of the cool visuals that you see in a game are built off the same tools and plugins, and again, switching between games means losing those tools. You need to rebuild the behaviors in equivalent modules.\n Shaders. They\u2019re like tiny programs that you use to generate the look of a surface in a game. It\u2019s not as simple as just painting a surface with a texture, you code in how it handles reflections, how it emits light, what it does when you look at it. I\u2019ve written shaders that adjust colours depending on what\u2019s happening to the item, which refers back to the weapon code powering it, which can\u2019t work without bits of my core engine. Shaders are used to  simulate the liquid contents of bottles in Half-Life: Alyx. Some people use them to make it so text always faces the camera, which links back to the original font. So even the appearance of an item or cosmetic is likely to be tied to the internals of the game that created it. You need to rebuild these.\n Animation. In animation, you start with a mesh, and build out a rig for it, which you can roughly consider to be the skeletal structure that the body moves around. It sets the rules for the ranges of how bones can move, but also how bones pull on the rest of the character, like how if you push your hand forward, how your elbow also moves, and maybe your shoulder stretches out at full extension. So if you\u2019re moving a mesh that has a certain rig attached to it into a different engine that has a different rig, they\u2019re going to have different bones, with different rules. At a minimum, you\u2019ll have to go through something called Animation Retargeting in which you manually tell the game which bones in one rig correspond to the bones in a different one. You will need to manually reanimate or retarget.\n Procedural animation. Even after you\u2019ve done your retargeting, it\u2019s normal to need to make programmatic adjustments, with things like Control Rig.  This video from Epic shows Control Rig in action, and how despite having models and rigs for a gauntlet that\u2019s already compatible with the game engine, it needs additional manual work to be used on a Fortnite character to stop the gauntlet clipping through their hand, and sitting how it should. You need to reprogram this.\n Levels of detail. All of this is made more complex by that games all have different rules about what levels of complexity are shown at what draw distances. You might need to see all the details of a gun up close, but at 30 yards, perhaps it uses a simpler model to claw back some performance. Even simple 2D images like sprays or icons are not exempt from this. Mipmaps are a sequence of sequentially lower-resolution textures to be used at different distances, and it\u2019s likely that every game will be using slightly different rules. You need to regenerate the assets.\n QA. Adding items and cosmetics to games and their in-game data tables needs to be done  at build time, and be tested before you let players see it. And even if you could do all of this at run time, live, why would any game just  trust that some other game\u2019s stuff was going to go through this process and magically turn out production-ready?\n This is  not even close to the full list of problems; I\u2019ve stuck to the things that I think people who don\u2019t work on games will be able to understand easily. The systems that enable games to display moving, animated 3D objects go multiple layers deeper than this \u2014 mesh deformations as the rigs move, how much of the appearance comes from rendering and shading, which again, are both deeply tied to the game itself. One of my prototypes used anime-style cell-shaded characters, and their stylization had nothing to do with the character models; they got their look from a post-processing volume that encapsulated the Actor, which is something the engine provided.\n    Each game has its own processes (asset pipeline) that it goes through to manually take raw data like WAV files and meshes and turns them into functional things inside the game. So even  just having the raw assets doesn\u2019t help you. Converting them costs time, which costs money.\n So even if you were to arrange all this ahead of time for specific items, why would a game studio spend all that money and time to produce another game\u2019s items and cosmetics in their game, that they can\u2019t sell, QA, control, buff, nerf, or protect themselves against?\n And even if the myriad of things that you need to do to set something up in your game were done in advance, the only thing you\u2019d be checking off the blockchain is that User A has Item B. But since you know this item can  only come from Game B, you would just use an API to check for it. This is how games tell when people bought things like DLC for our games from the PlayStation or Xbox store. If someone\u2019s account claims to have bought something from PSN, clearly the best way to tell is to check PSN.\n Even if you were able to wave a magic wand and make all of the things that prevent it irrelevant, you\u2019d  still just be left with something that adds complexity while providing no additional value. The only extra functionality that would provide over a regular cross-game promotional item (like Little Big Planet was doing 10 years ago) is the ability to trade those items between users .. which Steam was doing 9 years ago.\n If you\u2019re currently thinking something about \u2018but decentralization\u2019, hold that thought. That\u2019s a falsehood people have been selling, and I\u2019ll address it in a future article. The point of  this article is singular - to show how NFTs do nothing to mitigate any of the difficulties of asset sharing.\n Game development is a complex, exciting, interdependent web of complexities that are largely invisible to people who never see them, and while I\u2019m thrilled to see people taking an interest in game development tech, I hope this has opened at least a small window into challenges at play.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:40:29", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6e38\u620f,nft,fantasy", "title": "NFT

"note_en": "ANALYSIS:  \u2018Promoting a climate of fear and repression \u2026 damages creativity and drives excellent young scientists out of the field\u2019\n In December, Stanford University\u2019s Department of Computer Science released a  statement on the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict accompanied by an anti-racism  toolkit comprised of images of what looks like the reading list for a racial studies course.\n \u201cWe condemn the violence, trauma, and suffering that the Black community has both historically and contemporarily endured,\u201d the computer science department stated.\n \u201cThe pervasiveness of anti-Black racism reaffirms our department\u2019s mission to create an equitable, diverse, and inclusive community that centers, affirms, and uplifts everyone and prioritizes an enduring sense of belonging and community for all.\u201d\n Although academic departments related to science, technology, engineering, and math, collectively known as STEM, once operated largely unadulterated by the social and political ideologies that plague much of academia, many professors and students in those departments now find that espousing the proper views on a plethora of topics related to race, sex, and the broader Diversity, Equity and Inclusion philosophy has become prerequisite for a meaningful career.\n Patanjali Kambhampati, a chemistry professor at McGill University, recalled when he was a student in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n \u201cSome of my friends and professors in science were saying, \u2018Oh the people in sociology are trying to study us and judge us and tell us how to do better and be better people,\u2019 and we were laughing at that seeing how silly that was because we\u2019re the rational ones,\u201d he said in a phone interview with  The College Fix.\n  Kambhampati, whose research pertains to ultrafast lasers with the potential to play a role in numerous technological advancements, was recently  denied a grant by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada for failing to \u201cadequately describe specific, concrete practices that will be put in place to ensure that EDI is intentionally and proactively supported\u201d in his lab.\n Responding via email to a series of questions sent by  The College Fix, Dorian Abbot, a professor in the Department of the Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago, wrote that \u201c20 years ago the emphasis was on reducing biases and identifying the most promising candidates from a scientific perspective regardless of their background, which I strongly support.\u201d\n But today, as a prominent critic of DEI\u2019s tendency to prioritize skin color above skills, Abbot was disinvited from giving a lecture at MIT about his geological studies.\n DEI has become \u201cfocused on trying to hit quotas for group membership, discriminating against members of undesirable groups, and suppressing the speech of those who disagree with any aspect of it,\u201d Abbot told  The Fix.\n \u201cThe effect,\u201d he added, \u201chas been that we are hindering our ability to produce the best science by (1) selecting young scientists partially using criteria other than scientific merit and potential and (2) promoting a climate of fear and repression, which damages creativity and drives excellent young scientists out of the field.\u201d\n Illustrating Abbot\u2019s point is a growing list of prominent victims of this systemic infection of STEM by DEI who have lost funding and professional opportunities due to their failure to take what Abbot described as an \u201cideological loyalty oath.\u201d\n  Academic departments in STEM routinely  post DEI statements to their websites, replete with all the proper slogans.\n Science departments issue statements on news stories unrelated to science if the story has any perceived racial overtones, as Stanford did with the Rittenhouse verdict and as many other STEM departments did in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death.\n For example, in the summer of 2020, the chair of Northern Illinois University\u2019s Department of Biological Sciences at the time sent out an unnecessary but seemingly heartfelt email condemning Floyd\u2019s death.\n Ironically, this also got him publicly scolded via mass email by a graduate student because he failed to use this opportunity to call for more race-based hiring and mandatory in-person anti-racism training within NIU\u2019s biology department.\n Further exemplars of Abbot\u2019s concerns include recent postings for faculty positions at both Illinois State University and the University of Hartford, with ISU  requiring aspiring neuroethologists to submit a \u201cone-page statement describing [their] interest in or effort toward furthering diversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d and Hartford  informing would-be anatomy and physiology instructors, \u201cA review of applicant diversity statements will precede that of any other application materials.\u201d\n None of this however has any apparent benefit to science or scientists. None of it furthers understanding of human disease, life on Earth, or the universe beyond.\n The net result, according to Abbot, is academic institutions are \u201cscreening out scientists with alternative political and moral viewpoints,\u201d which led him to ask: \u201cDo you care if the person who will come up with the cure for cancer agrees with you politically?\u201d\n For most people the answer is no. However, given today\u2019s academic climate, perhaps the better answer is that we should hope that the person who can come up with the cure for cancer agrees with the right people politically.\n \u201cSome topics which were topics taught in biology have become controversial over time. \u2026 A good example would be that sexes are binary,\u201d Luana Maroja, a professor of biology at Williams College and author of a 2019  Atlantic  piece on self-censorship by scientists, told  The College Fix.\n Debra Soh, who formerly did neurocognitive research on human sexuality as a graduate student, felt she needed to  self-exile from academia if she wished to comment on politicized scientific issues related to her area of expertise like  gender dysphoria in children.\n Former friendly neighborhood spider researcher Colin Wright gave up on an academic career after, according to his  account, he was blacklisted from long-term employment in academia upon penning several popular articles containing heretical truths pertaining to biological sex in humans.\n Commenting on the examples of Soh and Wright, Maroja stated, \u201cI don\u2019t think that just holding [these] views would have been detrimental\u2026I don\u2019t think their view is a niche view\u2026I think most people agree with them \u2013 especially biologists.\u201d\n However, Maroja said, \u201cThey were very open about it.\u201d In today\u2019s academic climate, \u201ca person having those views is fine. If they publish it and it becomes widely known, it\u2019s another story,\u201d she said.\n One of the greatest ironies of these types of requirements, according to Maroja, who is originally from Brazil, is that immigrants are sometimes among the most negatively impacted by them.\n \u201cPeople who are not Americans\u2026\u201d, she said, \u201cdon\u2019t understand what it is that they are expected to say.\u201d\n Many Americans working in academic STEM, however, have come to understand what they are expected to say, and, whether sincere or not, make a grand display of saying it as loudly as they can.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 09:39:34", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u963b\u788d,takeover,\u6545\u4e8b", "title": "Dei\u63a5\u7ba1\u830e\u963b\u788d\u80fd\u529b'\u4ea7\u751f\u6700\u597d\u7684\u79d1\u5b66'", "title_en": "DEI takeover of STEM hinders ability \u2018to produce the best science\u2019", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thecollegefix.com/dei-takeover-of-stem-hinders-ability-to-produce-the-best-science-say-scientists/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u963b\u788d", "takeover", "\u6545\u4e8b"]}]
