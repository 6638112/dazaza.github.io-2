Ford is betting that the software developed by the three-year-old San Francisco startup will help it capture more than $1 billion in revenue just from charging by 2030. Ford Pro has financial ambitions beyond charging. The business unit said it expects to generate $45 billion in revenue from hardware and adjacent and new services by 2025 \u2014 up from $27 billion in 2019.\n Electriphi, along with its 30-person team, will be folded into the newly minted Ford Pro business unit, which is focused on providing services to commercial customers of its electric Transit van and F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck. Ford will start shipping E-Transit to customers later this year. The F-150 Lightning Pro, a commercial variant of the all-electric Lightning pickup truck, is expected to come to market in spring 2022.\n  \u201cAs commercial customers add electric vehicles to their fleets, they want depot charging options to make sure they\u2019re powered up and ready to go to work every day,\u201d said Ford Pro CEO Ted Cannis. \u201cWith Electriphi\u2019s existing advanced technology IP in the Ford Pro electric vehicles and services portfolio, we will enhance the experience for commercial customers and be a single-source solution for fleet-depot charging.\u201d\n Electriphi launched in 2018 when it became obvious that upcoming state and federal mandates would drive heavy duty vehicles and mid-sized commercial fleets towards electrification, co-founder and CEO Muffi Ghadiali told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The company has focused on segments deploying commercial electric vehicles in the U.S. and internationally, a list that includes school buses and transit buses.\n \u201cIf you just think about what\u2019s going to happen in the next 10 years \u2014 it\u2019s a massive transformation in mobility for energy and software,\u201d\u00a0 Ghadiali said. \u201cThe stakes are incredibly high and time is running out.\u201d He noted fleet operators are nervous about that upcoming mandates that will require moving to zero-emissions vehicles by the end of the decade. \u201cTo turn over your entire fleet in 10 years, you have to start now; they\u2019re going, \u2018I have to make sure that my fleet operations don\u2019t skip a heartbeat, while this transition is happening.&#39;\u201d\n Ford first approached Electriphi in early 2021. The startup had raised just $4.2 million at a valuation of about $11 million prior to the deal with autoomaker.\n While Ford\u2019s focus is building out the software for its E-Transit and Lightning Pro, it is possible that it will also continue to serve Electriphi\u2019s customer base.\n \u201cInterestingly, as it turns out, the underlying Ford platform is used across many different vehicle types as well as school buses,\u201d Ghadiali said. \u201cSo it\u2019s hard to say which segments we won\u2019t still be in because they are you know they are very relevant to what we do. Of course, our focus will be the large volume that the Ford is going to ship in the next year.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-18 09:46:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u798f\u7279,\u6536\u8d2d,acquires", "title": "\u798f\u7279\u6536\u8d2dElectivehi\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u51c6\u5907Woo EV\u8230\u961f\u5ba2\u6237 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFord acquires Electriphi as it prepares to woo EV fleet customers\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ford-acquires-electriphi-as-it-prepares-to-woo-ev-fleet-customers/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u798f\u7279", "\u6536\u8d2d", "acquires"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ccac20c28dfb2c5abb7f7aa763a60e06.jpeg", "infoid": 1066628, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JPMORGAN CHASE\uff06amp;\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u8d2d\u4e70\u6570\u5b57\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ecf\u7406Nutmeg\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u5728U.K\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n  \u8089\u8c46\u853b\uff0c\u6210\u7acb\u4e8e2012\u5e74\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7140,000\u591a\u540d\u5ba2\u6237\u548c35\u4ebf\u82f1\u9551\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e50\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u6536\u8d2d\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u672a\u62ab\u9732\uff0c\u4f46\u719f\u6089\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4eba\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u4e3a10\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n  JPMORGAN\u57281\u6708\u4efd\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5728U.K\u4e2d\u53d1\u8d77\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u3002\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u8d39\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3aChase\uff0c\u5b83\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5728\u4eca\u5e74\u665a\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u63a8\u51fa\u4e4b\u524d\u4e0eJPMORGAN\u5458\u5de5\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\n  \u94f6\u884c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8089\u8c46\u853b\u7684\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e0d\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\n      JPMORGAN\u6b63\u5728U.K.\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u8fdb\u5165\u62e5\u6324\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u9f13\u52b1\u65b0\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5305\u62ecStarling Bank Ltd.\u548cMonzo Bank Ltd.\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684\u5168\u7403\u91d1\u878d\u5371\u673a\u4e4b\u540e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u6311\u6218\u94f6\u884c\u8feb\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u8d37\u65b9\u6539\u5584\u5176\u6570\u7801\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u4f46\u52aa\u529b\u8d5a\u53d6\u5229\u6da6\u3002\n  \u636e\u719f\u6089\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u53bb\u5e74\u53bb\u5e74\u53bb\u5e74\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u7531Anne Boden\u6210\u7acb\u7684\u690b\u9e1f\u94f6\u884c\u3002\n  JPMORGAN\u5148\u524d\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u57ce\u5e02\u548c\u5e02\u573a\u63a8\u51fa\u6570\u5b57\u94f6\u884c\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u8ffd\u9010\u5206\u652f\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u6162\u62fe\u53d6\u540e\uff0c\u4e8e2019\u5e746\u6708\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u82ac\u6069\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002\u94f6\u884c\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ece\u8be5\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u6559\u8bad\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8ffd\u9010\u54c1\u724c\u7684\u5171\u9e23\u6bd4\u65b0\u540d\u79f0\u66f4\u597d\u3002 \nNutmeg\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5c06\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ba1\u7406\u66f4\u52a0\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002 \u8089\u8c46\u853b\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9999\u6599\uff0c\u5982\u8d22\u5bcc\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u66fe\u7ecf\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u3002  \u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6295\u8d44\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u5b83\u9500\u552e\u83b7\u5f97\u8d44\u91d1\uff0cETF\u548c\u517b\u8001\u91d1\u3002 Nutmeg\u4e0a\u8bc9\u6295\u8d44\u65b0\u624b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u672f\u8bed\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5de5\u5177\u548cQ\uff06amp;\u5173\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u4e16\u754c\u7684INS\u548c\u51fa\u5c40\u3002  \u672c\u516c\u53f82019\u5e74\u7684\u6536\u5165\u589e\u957f\u4e8629\uff05\u81f3\u4e0a\u4e00\u5e74\u7684930\u4e07\u82f1\u9551\uff0c\u5176\u635f\u5931\u589e\u52a0\u4e8615\uff05\u301c2120\u4e07\u82f1\u9551\u3002 \u5176\u80a1\u4e1c\u5c06\u5728\u8be5\u4ea4\u6613\u4e2d\u4e70\u51fa\u6765\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9ad8\u76db\u96c6\u56e2\u548c\u65bd\u7f57\u5fb7\u65af\u00b7\u666e\u5c14\uff08Schroders Plc\uff09\u3002  \u51fa\u73b0\u57282021\u5e746\u670818\u65e5\uff0c\u6253\u5370\u7248\u4f5c\u4e3a\uff06\uff0339;

A price for the acquisition wasn\u2019t disclosed but people familiar with the transaction said it was about $1 billion.\n  JPMorgan said in January it would  launch a new digital bank in the U.K., offering consumer banking services there for the first time. Called Chase, it is currently being tested internally with JPMorgan employees ahead of a public launch later this year.\n  Nutmeg\u2019s savings and investment products won\u2019t initially be offered through the retail banking project, the bank said.\n      JPMorgan is entering a crowded digital banking marketplace in the U.K. Regulators encouraged new startups, including Starling Bank Ltd. and Monzo Bank Ltd., to boost competition in the wake of the last global financial crisis. These so-called challenger banks have forced traditional lenders to improve their digital offerings but have struggled to earn profits.\n  JPMorgan last year considered making a bid for Starling Bank, founded by Anne Boden in 2014, according to people familiar with the situation.\n  JPMorgan previously tried to launch a digital bank in U.S. cities and markets where it didn\u2019t have Chase branches, but closed the product, called Finn, in June 2019 after slow pickup. Bank executives have said they learned lessons from that program, including that the Chase brand resonated better than a new name.\n  Nutmeg aims to make wealth management more accessible through the internet, Neil Alexander, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. Nutmeg was chosen as a name because the spice, like wealth and investment services, was once rare and costly but is now widely available.\n  Like other investment sites, it sells access to funds, ETFs and pensions. Nutmeg appeals to investment novices, avoids jargon and provides tools and Q&amp;As about the ins and outs of the finance world.\n  The company\u2019s revenue grew 29% in 2019 to \u00a39.3 million from the previous year, and its loss increased 15% to \u00a321.2 million.

Brand safety has been a real concern for advertisers and their clients for the last few years. It\u2019s been top of mind as more search marketers are finding their ad content served up next to negative, fake, and downright spammy sites. Google\u2019s own 2020 Ad Safety Report focused on sensitivity \u201cto brands\u2019 need for control over where their ads displayed as there were increases in hate speech and calls to violence online,\u201d  we wrote earlier this year. But this new data indicates that unless advertisers are paying careful attention to their  exclusion lists, there\u2019s a chance that they could be showing up next to fake news and misleading content online.\n       Carolyn Lyden serves as the Director of Search Content for Search Engine Land and SMX.

"note_en": "Futures for July delivery ended Tuesday at $1,009.90 per thousand board feet, down 41% from the record of $1,711.20 reached in early May. Futures have declined 14 of the past 16 trading days.\n  Cash lumber prices are also crashing. Pricing service Random Lengths said Friday that its framing composite index, which tracks on-the-spot sales, dropped $122 to $1,324, its biggest ever weekly decline. The pullback came just six weeks after the index rose $124 during the first week of May, its most on record. Random Lengths described a chaotic rout in which sawmill managers struggled to provide customers with price quotes. It said late Tuesday that its index had dropped another $114, to $1,210.\n  Economists and investors have wondered if sky-high prices for wood products would doom  the booming housing market. Builders raised home prices and many stopped selling houses before the studs were installed, lest they misjudge costs and sell too cheaply. Lumber became central to  the inflation debate: whether a period of runaway inflation was afoot or high prices were temporary shocks that would ease as the economy moved further from lockdown.\n    The rapid decline suggests a bubble that has burst and the question is how low lumber prices will fall. Even after tumbling, lumber futures remain nearly three times what is typical for this time of year. Lumber producers and traders expect that prices will remain relatively high due to the strong housing market, but that the supply bottlenecks and frenzied buying that characterized the economy\u2019s reopening and sent prices to multiples of the old all-time highs are winding down.\n      During the run-up, wood was hoarded by builders, retailers and others worried about running out of material during a construction season set into overdrive by low mortgage rates and federal stimulus payments.\n  \u201cEveryone was buying more than they needed,\u201d said Mike Wisnefski, a former lumber trader and chief executive of online marketplace MaterialsXchange. \u201cThere was this fear of lack of availability.\u201d\n  Now the market is being flooded by what Mr. Wisnefski calls shadow inventory as businesses that are normally big buyers, such as home builders and companies that prefabricate the trusses that hold up roofs and floors, sell from their own stockpiles.\n    Lumber producers say that prices should remain relatively high as home builders try to erase the country\u2019s deficit of housing. Mortgage-finance firm Freddie Mac estimated in April that the U.S.  is about 3.8 million houses shy of meeting demand, thanks largely to the lack of construction following the 2008 housing crash.\n  \u201cI don\u2019t think $1,000 lumber prices are the new normal,\u201d Devin Stockfish, chief executive of lumber producer  Weyerhaeuser    WY  -0.99%  , told investors at a conference last week. \u201cBut that being said, when you think about the amount of housing that we\u2019re going to have to build in the U.S. over the next three, five, 10 years, that\u2019s just a significant amount of demand for wood products.\u201d\n  At the same conference, executives from lumber producer  PotlatchDeltic    PCH  -0.40%  said they expect lumber to trade in a range of $700 to $800 through next year. That is still more than the pre-pandemic record of $639 and is based on their estimation of the price that mills in British Columbia need to break even sawing North America\u2019s most-expensive logs. Prices below that could prompt mills in Canada to dial back output or shut down, which would eventually force prices higher to meet demand, they said.\n    The stock market is assuming even lower lumber prices ahead. Analysts with BMO Capital Markets recently calculated that the share prices of three Canadian firms that have become  the biggest sawyers in the southern pinelands have priced in expectations of $447 lumber next year. That would be a little more expensive than normal, but more in line with historical prices.\n  Those firms\u2014  Interfor    IFP  -3.35%  ,  Canfor    CFPZF  -2.97%  and  West Fraser Timber    WFG  -3.18%  \u2014along with U.S. rivals Weyerhaeuser and PotlatchDeltic  have notched record profits since ramping up mills to meet an  unexpected rush of demand last summer.\n  Sawmill owners have had some of the best performing stocks of the pandemic, though all five lumber producers are down at least 9.5% over the past month.\n  A flurry of stock sales by forest-products executives last quarter suggests that those at the top of these firms believe peak lumber is in the rearview, said Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore, which tracks executive stock sales and purchases.\n  What impact has the price of lumber had on your home construction or renovation project? Join the conversation below.\n  Executives at Weyerhaeuser sold $14.6 million worth of company shares last quarter, the most since the third quarter of 2016, according to InsiderScore. PotlatchDeltic executives sold $12.1 million during that time, the most since InsiderScore began keeping track in 2003. Timberland owner  Rayonier    RYN  -0.99%  also disclosed the heaviest selling by insiders in more than a decade. Rayonier doesn\u2019t own any sawmills but holds timberland in New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest, where log prices have risen along with those of lumber. Spokesmen for Weyerhaeuser and Rayonier declined to comment.
