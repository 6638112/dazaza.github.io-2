It also feels like we’ve reached an inflection point for game streaming: Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all have services that allow you to play games on any device by streaming them over the internet — a plan that has led to controversy and conflict with Apple, which has put up roadblocks for these services in the iOS App Store.</p><p>假期对于游戏来说总是很大，但今年更大了：微软新的Xbox系列X / S和索尼PS5迎来了新一代的游戏机，在大流行期间游戏本身也越来越融入主流文化。感觉就像我们已经到了游戏流传输的拐点：Google，Amazon和Microsoft都提供了允许您通过在互联网上流传输任何设备来在任何设备上玩游戏的服务-这项计划引起了争议和冲突苹果，已在iOS App Store中为这些服务设置了障碍。</p><p> On this week’s episode of   Decoder with Nilay Patel, I interviewed Phil Spencer, the executive vice president of gaming at Microsoft — or, more simply, the guy in charge of Xbox. We had a lot to talk about: how much the pandemic has accelerated trends in gaming, why he chose to launch two next-gen consoles at the same time, the issues with preorders and supply he’s seeing, and how he sees Xbox growing over time. And we talked about game streaming, where it is now, where it might go, and how it’s going with Apple and Google to get his streaming service in their app stores. We also talked about the community and culture of gaming, which Phil is very passionate about. He told me he thinks game developers need to be actively engaged in creating safe and inclusive environments all the time.</p><p> 在本周的Nilay Patel的Decoder节目中，我采访了Microsoft游戏执行副总裁Phil Spencer，或更简单地说，是Xbox负责人。我们有很多话题要讨论：这种流行病在多大程度上加速了游戏的发展趋势，为什么他选择同时启动两个下一代游戏机，他所看到的预购和供应问题，以及他如何看待Xbox随着时间的增长。我们还讨论了游戏流媒体，现在的位置，可能的发展方向以及与苹果和谷歌在他们的应用商店中获取其流媒体服务的方式。我们还谈到了Phil所热衷的游戏社区和游戏文化。他告诉我，他认为游戏开发人员必须一直积极参与创建安全，包容的环境。</p><p>   You’re a Microsoft lifer: you started as an intern in 1988 screwing around in video games. You’re now the executive vice president of gaming — I think you report to the CEO now.</p><p>   您是Microsoft的老手：您从1988年作为实习生开始涉足视频游戏。您现在是游戏执行副总裁-我想您现在就向CEO汇报。</p><p>   This moment seems like a particularly gigantic inflection point in gaming. We’re talking about the entire architecture of games moving to streaming. You’ve got two big consoles. [Gaming] has exploded in the mainstream culture. Is this what you expected? When you were an intern in 1988, does this look like your wildest dreams, or is it meaningfully different? What’s your view on where we are right now?</p><p>   这一刻似乎是游戏中一个特别巨大的拐点。我们正在谈论游戏向流媒体过渡的整个架构。您有两个大型控制台。 [游戏]在主流文化中爆炸了。这是您所期望的吗？当您是1988年的实习生时，这看起来像是您最疯狂的梦想，还是有意义的不同？您对我们现在的位置有何看法？</p><p> Definitely not what I expected as an intern. I mean, just from both my own career, if we’re going into my side of it… I’ve never been one with a huge career roadmap. I follow my passion and what I’m passionate about, teams I get to work with. In terms of where we are in gaming, I think it’s somewhat regretful, but it’s also nice to see that during this time of social distancing and disconnect from our friends and our family, that gaming is really pushed to the forefront as a real communal way for people to connect. I think the world needs more of that.</p><p> 绝对不是我期望的实习生。我的意思是，从我自己的职业生涯来看，如果我们站在自己的一边……我从来没有一个制定过宏伟的职业路线图的人。我跟随着我的激情以及与之合作的激情。对于我们在游戏中的位置，我觉得有些遗憾，但也很高兴看到在这段社交距离和与朋友及家人断开联系的时期，游戏确实作为一种真正的社区方式而被推到了最前沿。供人们连接。我认为世界需要更多。</p><p> I’ve been on my “gaming as a connective tissue opportunity for people of different backgrounds, different beliefs coming together” — during the C-19 pandemic, people staying at home, we’ve really seen a rise in gaming. I think we’ve seen the acceleration of some of the timelines and trends in gaming over the last six months. We’ve definitely accelerated maybe a year or two in terms of adoption of some of this. I think gaming has always been building towards this moment of being a real unifier.</p><p> 我一直在“为不同背景，不同信仰的人们聚会提供结缔组织的机会进行游戏” –在C-19大流行期间，人们呆在家里，我们确实看到了游戏的兴起。我认为在过去六个月中，我们看到了游戏时间表和趋势的加速发展。在采用其中一些方面，我们肯定加速了大约一两年。我认为游戏一直在朝着成为真正的统一者的方向发展。</p><p> It’s interesting you said a year or two. I’ve heard e-commerce is a five-year acceleration because of the pandemic. Streaming — cable television is falling apart, and everyone moving to streaming services way faster than people thought was going to happen. You’re thinking with games, it’s only a year acceleration?</p><p> 你说一两年有趣。我听说电子商务由于流行病而加速了五年。流媒体-有线电视正在崩溃，每个人转向流媒体服务的速度都比人们想象的要快。您在考虑游戏，这只是一年的加速？</p><p> It could be longer. I think gaming was further along some of those communal aspects of our art form than some of those other ... When I’m watching streaming video services, I don’t know that I feel connected to anybody that’s not in the room while I’m doing that. Some of the shopping stuff, maybe in different parts of the world. Sitting in Seattle, we see a lot of online shopping and delivery, we just always have. Maybe it’s different ...</p><p>可能会更长。我认为游戏在我们艺术形式的某些公共方面比其他方面更远...当我观看流媒体视频服务时，我不知道自己与不在房间里的任何人有联系正在这样做。一些购物的东西，也许在世界的不同地方。坐在西雅图，我们经常看到很多在线购物和送货。也许不一样...</p><p>   [ Laughs] Yeah, there’s a few of them now. It’s funny. We used to be like the sole outpost here at Microsoft, but everybody’s around here now.</p><p>   [笑]是的，现在有几个。这很有趣。我们曾经像是Microsoft在这里的唯一前哨基地，但现在每个人都在这里。</p><p> For gaming though, I think with... you’ve seen Twitch, you’ve seen the power of gaming on YouTube. You’ve seen Discord and other places where people come together to talk about games, watch games, watch others play games. I say the acceleration — and I don’t know if I’m accurate in my timeline — but I feel like it’s a little more gradual for us in gaming because we’ve already been so far along using community and virality as a way for people to get into gaming. But we’ve definitely seen a surge. And I don’t think it’s something that’s going to reverse. I think we’ve just become more and more a part of the way people entertain and connect.</p><p> 不过，对于游戏而言，我认为您看到了Twitch，就已经看到了YouTube上游戏的力量。您已经看到Discord和其他人们聚集在一起谈论游戏，观看游戏，观看其他人玩游戏的地方。我说的是加速-我不知道我的时间表是否准确-但我觉得这对我们来说在游戏中是渐进的，因为到目前为止我们一直在使用社区和病毒式传播作为一种方式人们参与游戏。但是我们肯定看到了激增。而且我认为这不会逆转。我认为我们已经越来越成为人们娱乐和联系方式的一部分。</p><p> Anything about that surge surprising to you? Or is this just, what I thought was going to happen in 2024 and it’s happening in 2020?</p><p> 那让你惊讶的事情激增了吗？还是仅此而已，我认为这将在2024年发生，而在2020年发生？</p><p> It’s been cool to see some of the genres and stuff that have really popped to the front in gaming. When I think about things like  Among Us and  Fall Guys and stuff, really finding an audience —  Animal Crossing, which has always been big. You get people like  Gary Whitta doing his talk show inside of  Animal Crossing and it almost seems normal in this time, that that would be happening.</p><p> 看到一些真正流行于游戏领域的流派和东西真是太酷了。当我想到诸如《我们中间》和《秋季伙计们》之类的东西时，真正找到了观众-Animal Crossing，这一直很重要。您会看到加里·惠塔（Gary Whitta）这样的人在《动物穿越》中进行脱口秀节目，这一次似乎很正常，这种情况正在发生。</p><p> Gaming in certain times gets really hyperfocused on realism and grit and it’s nice to see that during these times, you’ve got a breadth of things that are really finding large audiences and large viewers. Not that I’d say that’s a surprise, but nice to see.</p><p> 在某些时候，游戏真的非常注重真实感和勇气，很高兴看到在这段时间里，您有很多东西可以真正吸引大批观众和大批观众。并不是说我很惊讶，但是很高兴见到。</p><p> The other thing I would just say — and it’s something that I think is special about the games space — is that everybody can be a creator. Whether you’re someone on YouTube, or somebody building a social following on TikTok or on Twitter or whatever, or you’re someone building games, we’ve really democratized people’s ability to create their own content and get that to millions of customers fairly easily. The consoles all support that now, obviously Steam has supported that for a long time. You’ve got these social platforms that are out there letting people build the audience.</p><p> 我想说的另一件事-我认为这对游戏领域来说很特别-每个人都可以成为创作者。无论您是YouTube上的某个人，还是在TikTok或Twitter上建立社交关注的人，还是正在开发游戏的人，我们都在使人们创造自己的内容并将其公平地吸引到数百万客户的能力民主化容易。控制台现在都支持该功能，很明显，Steam已经支持了很长时间。您已经有了这些社交平台，可以让人们建立受众群体。</p><p> Also you’re seeing the rise of creators, and creators can be of different types. And that’s something that I think really provides longevity to what gaming is about as well, that you have so many people that are both consumers of gaming content and frankly now creators of gaming content.</p><p>另外，您会看到创作者的兴起，而创作者可以是不同的类型。我认为这确实可以为游戏提供长寿，您有这么多人既是游戏内容的消费者，又是坦率地说现在是游戏内容的创造者。</p><p> I want to get into that for sure, but on the zoom-out level, you’ve been at Microsoft for a long time. You’ve seen three different CEOs; there have been three very different styles of how to run that organization. There have probably been even more versions of Microsoft itself under Gates, Ballmer, Nadella. What have you pulled into your decision making style?</p><p> 我想肯定会涉及到这一点，但是在缩小级别上，您已经在Microsoft工作了很长时间。您见过三个不同的CEO；运营该组织的方式有三种截然不同的风格。在盖茨，鲍尔默和纳德拉的领导下，微软本身可能已经有更多版本。您对决策风格有什么看法？</p><p>  When I started, it was obviously all Bill G. Bill had such a presence in the company, both from a technical standpoint and a leadership standpoint. And I learned the value in people believing in the direction that an organization is going in, and having a leader in Bill at the time that was just so maniacally consistent in the things that he would focus on and push us.</p><p>  从技术角度和领导角度来看，当我刚开始工作时，显然所有Bill G. Bill都在公司中有这样的存在。我了解了人们的信念，他们相信组织的发展方向，并在当时拥有比尔的领导者，这在他要关注和推动我们的事情上是如此的一致。</p><p> I was a developer at the time. Sometimes the wrath of Bill, when my code was being used, checked in, or whatever, wasn’t always the easiest. He was very consistent in the things that he cared about. Even today, I review my gaming business with Bill probably two, three times a year and he’s still remarkably consistent in the things that he will push on. I think that consistency for a large team as the company grows is very valuable. The teams can predict how you’re going to respond or react or the things that you’re going to focus on as opposed to being moody or random. I found real value in that from Bill.</p><p> 我当时是一名开发人员。有时，当我的代码被使用，检入等操作时，Bill的愤怒并不总是最容易的。他在关心的事情上非常一致。即使在今天，我也可能每年会与Bill一起审查我的游戏业务两次，三遍，而他在推动自己的工作上仍然非常一致。我认为，随着公司的成长，对于大型团队而言，保持一致性非常重要。这些团队可以预测您将如何应对或做出反应，或者您将专注于哪些事情，而不是情绪低落或随意。我从比尔那里发现了真正的价值。</p><p> Steve [Ballmer] was just so focused on customers and selling. I thought for me, as a developer, it was a great way to learn. Under Steve, they sent me overseas. I worked in the UK for a while. It was the company’s effort to expand the perspective of some of the leaders, to get out of Redmond. What is it like to work for Microsoft when you’re not in our zip code and in the same time zone? That was all really the push that Steve had at the time of, let’s get very close to our customer and our selling, what we do in selling our products, how our customers perceive our products.</p><p> Steve [Ballmer]只是专注于客户和销售。我认为，作为开发人员，这是一种学习的好方法。在史蒂夫（Steve）的领导下，他们把我送到了国外。我在英国工作了一段时间。该公司努力扩大一些领导者的视野，以摆脱雷德蒙德的困境。如果您不在我们的邮政编码中，并且不在同一时区，那么对Microsoft来说这是什么样的工作？这确实是史蒂夫（Steve）当时的推动力，我们与客户和我们的销售非常接近，我们在销售产品时做了什么，我们的客户如何看待我们的产品。</p><p> Not just how we built something or even why we built it, but what did they, our customers, feel about what we built. Then moving on to Satya [Nadella], he’s just such an empathetic leader, somebody who’s connected to feelings and motivations. Like when he says, we’re here to empower every person and organization on the planet to achieve more, which is the mission statement of the company, he truly believes that. It’s amazing to see him talk about that in our leadership meetings like, “Okay, how is this going to touch 7 billion people on the planet?”</p><p> 不仅是我们建造东西的方式甚至是为什么建造它，而且客户（他们的客户）对我们建造的东西有什么感觉。然后转到Satya [Nadella]，他就是一位善解人意的领导者，他与情感和动机息息相关。就像他说的那样，我们在这里是要赋予地球上的每个人和组织更大的权力，这是公司的使命宣言，他对此深信不疑。看到他在我们的领导层会议上谈论这件事真是太神奇了，“好吧，这将如何触及地球上的70亿人？”</p><p> When you’re a company with the market cap that we have and the capacity that we have, that’s the scale we should be working at. Satya just raises us to that every moment. You see us standing up for climate change, you see us stand up for representation in our senior ranks and making public statements that, frankly, we don’t exactly know how we’re going to achieve. There’s no math today that says how we get to all of our carbon-neutral and carbon-negative goals, but being bold to stand up and be accounted for in the public eye, I think, is just an incredibly, incredibly a great learning opportunity for me and I value it.</p><p> 当您是一家拥有我们市值和能力的公司时，这就是我们应该努力的规模。萨蒂亚（Satya）时刻将我们带到那。您会看到我们支持气候变化，您会看到我们支持我们的高级职位并发表公开声明，坦率地说，我们并不完全知道我们将如何实现。今天没有什么数学可以说明我们如何实现我们的所有碳中和和碳负目标，但是我认为，勇敢地站起来并在公众眼中占一席之地，这只是一个令人难以置信，非常令人难以置信的学习机会对我来说，我很珍惜。</p><p> Thinking about those decision-making styles and frameworks and what you picked up, walk me through a decision leading up to the launch of this new Xbox, where you pulled from that, where that decision could have gone a different way. Do you put on your Ballmer hat and be like, we have to be focused on sales here. It’s time. Or is it, Sony is launching a console too, I’m going to put on my Gates hat. We’re going to have to crush the competition.</p><p>考虑到那些决策风格和框架以及您所选择的内容，引导我完成一项决定，以启动新Xbox的发布，从中退出，这个决定可能会有所不同。您戴上鲍尔默（Balmer）帽子吗？我们必须专注于这里的销售。是时候了。还是，索尼也正在启动游戏机，我要戴上盖茨的帽子。我们将不得不压垮竞争。</p><p>  I think he’s said that about himself. I feel comfortable with that one.</p><p>  我想他是这么说自己的。我对此感到满意。</p><p> Just thinking real-time, the decision to ship two consoles at the same time is probably one that’s worth pushing on. Because we’ve never done that before with the differences that we have between  Series S and Series X. I can’t think of other console launches that have had that delta in the products that have come out at day one. That was really a decision that, clearly, you could have made a different decision. Clearly, you could have shipped only one of those two SKUs at launch, [and it] would have made some of the supply chain and other things easier. Naming, and other things.</p><p> 仅考虑实时性，决定同时交付两个游戏机可能是值得继续努力的决定。因为我们之前从未做过S系列和X系列之间的区别。我想不到其他的游戏机发布会在第一天发布的产品中就有这个差异。显然，这确实是一个决定，您可以做出其他决定。显然，您可以在发布时仅交付这两个SKU中的一个，并且可以简化某些供应链和其他事情。命名等。</p><p> We started from a point of view [that] gaming should be growing, going back to our first point as an industry. Microsoft should be growing as part of that industry. I want to grow faster than the industry is growing, but I want to be part of a growing industry.</p><p> 我们从游戏应该发展的角度出发，回到了我们作为行业的第一点。微软应该成为该行业的一部分。我想以比行业增长更快的速度增长，但我想成为行业增长的一部分。</p><p> It was really this inclusion: how do we include more people in the launch euphoria and hype and everything that happens, and make it as accessible to [as many] more people as possible. Going to that [question of] how do you really build things that can get to true scale and influence everybody and impact everybody on the planet?</p><p> 真正的包容性是：我们如何让更多的人参与到发狂和炒作以及所发生的一切中来，并使[更多]更多的人可以访问它。转到[问题]，您如何真正构建可以达到真正规模并影响每个人并影响地球上每个人的东西？</p><p> There’s more with xCloud and Game Pass that we can talk about. The decision to do hardware SKUs was really centered on that. $499 in the US for the Series X — that’s a lot of money during a time of economic uncertainty and everything else. Now we didn’t know when we made those plans that we’d be sitting here, [but] even regardless of COVID, $499 is a lot of money. Can we build an accessible console that will deliver a great next-gen experience, clearly different, but a next-gen experience at a more accessible price point?</p><p> 我们可以讨论xCloud和Game Pass的更多功能。进行硬件SKU的决定实际上就是以此为中心。 X系列在美国的售价为499美元，这在经济不确定和其他所有情况下都是一笔不小的数目。现在我们不知道我们何时制定要坐在这里的计划，但是，即使与COVID无关，499美元的价格还是很多。我们是否可以构建一个可访问的控制台，该控制台将提供出色的下一代体验，而体验却明显不同，而下一代体验的价格却更高一些？</p><p> It really centered on that. How many people can we impact with everything that we do? That decision wasn’t easy, and was questioned a number of times internally. We feel really good about where we are, now that we’ve launched and we see the result, but that was a good tough decision.</p><p> 它真的集中在此。我们所做的一切能影响多少人？这个决定并不容易，并且在内部受到了多次质疑。现在，我们已经启动并看到了结果，我们对自己的位置感到非常满意，但这是一个艰难的决定。</p><p>   The way I would frame it, the best argument against doing it was Sony. We didn’t think that they were going to do it. I’ve said it before, I have a ton of respect for what Sony does. It’s not to say what they’re doing is wrong. [But] if it’s, we’re going to go compete with one hardware competitor and we just want to make it as easy as possible to compare our one product to their one product, that was the thought process that would have you push to say, no, just do one thing.</p><p>按照我的构想，反对这样做的最好理由是索尼。我们认为他们不会这样做。我之前已经说过，我非常尊重Sony的所作所为。这并不是说他们在做什么是错误的。 [但是]如果是这样，我们将与一个硬件竞争对手竞争，我们只是想尽可能地轻松地将我们的一种产品与另一种产品进行比较，这就是您想说的思维过程。 ，不，只做一件事。</p><p> When we think about where gaming is going, you go into maybe the Ballmer framing of it. You’ve got a business that’s growing and you want to grow as fast as you can. You want to grow in a healthy way. You’re either going to grow by making more from the customers that you have now, or finding new customers.</p><p> 当我们考虑游戏的发展方向时，您可能会想到鲍尔默的看法。您的业​​务正在增长，并且希望尽快增长。您想以健康的方式成长。您可以通过从现有客户那里获得更多收益来发展自己，或者寻找新客户。</p><p> I’d say in the console space over the last four or five years, most of the growth that the industry has realized has been growth per user, not growing the number of console users that are out there. It’s actually been a fairly fixed number over the last decade.</p><p> 我想说在过去的四到五年中，在控制台领域中，该行业实现的大部分增长都是每用户的增长，而不是那里的控制台用户数量的增长。在过去十年中，这实际上是一个相当固定的数字。</p><p> Which for us, [people] that love console gaming like we do, should be a sign of, hey, we don’t want to be about raising the price on retail products because you have a fixed number of customers and you just want to figure out “how do I get 10 more bucks from them?” We want to think about how we bring more people into the gaming funnel, have more people experience this art form that we love. The pushback against [doing one console] was always, but we want to grow, we want to find new customers.</p><p> 对我们来说，像我们一样喜欢游戏机游戏的人应该表明，嘿，我们不想提高零售产品的价格，因为您有固定数量的客户，而您只想弄清楚“我如何再从他们那里得到10美元？”我们想考虑如何将更多的人带入游戏渠道，让更多的人体验我们喜欢的这种艺术形式。一直反对[使用一个控制台]，但是我们想要增长，我们想要找到新客户。</p><p> Because it can’t just be a fight over the same customers that we’ve all seen every year — your average age of your [customer] goes up by one year every year, because it’s the exact same demographic that’s just moving with you. All of those things were important when we thought about the decision on [Series] S, and like I said, about xCloud and Game Pass. It’s, can we create a platform that’s more inviting to more people, including the hardware that we build? Even how we sell it with things like Xbox All Access, allowing people to buy the hardware on a monthly basis as opposed to one fixed fee. It’s all about how we bring more people in.</p><p> 因为这不仅仅是一场我们每年都见过的相同客户的争夺战，所以[客户]的平均年龄每年都会增加一年，因为与您同在的人口是完全相同的。当我们考虑关于[Series] S的决定时，所有这些事情都很重要，就像我说过的那样，关于xCloud和Game Pass。就是说，我们可以创建一个平台来吸引更多人，包括我们构建的硬件吗？甚至我们如何通过Xbox All Access之类的东西来出售它，使人们每月都可以购买硬件，而无需支付固定费用。这一切都与我们如何吸引更多人有关。</p><p> You just said a lot of names of a lot of products. There’s a lot of X’s and series and games in Mad Libs order. Is it playing out? Do people understand what the   difference between the Series S and the Series X  and Game Pass Ultimate and xCloud is?</p><p> 您刚刚说了很多产品的名字。 Mad Libs顺序中有很多X，系列和游戏。在玩吗？人们是否了解S系列和X系列以及Game Pass Ultimate和xCloud有什么区别？</p><p> On the hardware side, it is. I think sometimes inside of the industry, we want to be poking at ourselves. We can look at Series S and Series X, even the enunciation of S and X isn’t the easiest to differentiate. For most consumers, they walk in and one’s $500 and one’s $300. That’s the difference. Not to make everything about the iPhone, but if you asked me to explain the iPhone lineup, I can’t really do it, but when I walk in the store, it’s pretty clear. One’s big, one’s not, one’s $1,000, one’s $800, whatever.</p><p> 在硬件方面，确实如此。我认为有时候在行业内，我们想自嘲。我们可以看一下S系列和X系列，即使S和X的发音也不是最容易区分的。对于大多数消费者来说，他们走进去的是一个500美元和一个300美元。就是这样。并不是说有关iPhone的所有内容，但是如果您要我解释一下iPhone的阵容，我真的做不到，但是当我走进商店时，这很清楚。大一个，一个不大，一个1,000美元，一个800美元，等等。</p><p> They differentiate based on normal people’s vocabulary of how much does it cost and what does it do. From that perspective, we’re very happy with the early results on both consoles. A lot of new people to Xbox are coming in through Series S, which is what we would have expected. It’s lower-price. There’s Game Pass there. They will get a bunch of games. X is our power play. It’s the thing. It’s the most powerful console. If you want the highest fidelity, the highest experience, we want it there.</p><p>他们根据普通人的词汇来区分其成本和功能。从这个角度来看，我们对两个游戏机的早期结果感到非常满意。 Xbox系列吸引了许多Xbox新手，这正是我们所期望的。价格较低。那里有游戏通行证。他们会得到很多游戏。 X是我们的力量。就是这样它是功能最强大的控制台。如果您想要最高的保真度，最高的体验，我们希望在那里。</p><p> On Game Pass, it’s a good question. I went back and forth, and I still sometimes ... I really want it to all just be about Xbox. I want people to get into this feeling of, I can be a member of Xbox regardless of whether I own the console. I’m still a member of the community. I might play on PC, I might play streaming on my phone, I might own a console, but I’m always a member of Xbox. The Xbox Game Pass was an attempt to make sure it tied back to, yeah, I’m just a member of Xbox. Even the Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X was to bring it all back to, yeah, I’m just Xbox. Like “Where do you play? I play on Xbox.”</p><p> 在Game Pass上，这是一个很好的问题。我来回走动，有时我仍然……我真的希望一切都只是关于Xbox。我希望人们能体会到这种感觉，无论我是否拥有控制台，我都可以成为Xbox的一员。我仍然是社区的一员。我可能会在PC上玩游戏，可能会在手机上播放流媒体节目，可能拥有控制台，但我始终是Xbox的一员。 Xbox Game Pass是为了确保与它绑定在一起，是的，我只是Xbox的一员。甚至Xbox Series S，Xbox Series X都可以带回去，是的，我就是Xbox。就像“您在哪里玩？我在Xbox上玩。”</p><p> That doesn’t necessarily mean one piece of hardware. It could mean many different things, but I agree. It’s a journey for us in going from one console that has one name and one price point to something that’s a little more expansive.</p><p> 那不一定意味着一件硬件。这可能意味着许多不同的事情，但我同意。对于我们来说，这是一个从具有一个名称和一个价格点的控制台过渡到更广阔的平台的旅程。</p><p> Do you know that Microsoft people always say things are a journey and Google people always say things are early days?</p><p> 您是否知道Microsoft员工总是说事情是旅途，而Google员工总是说事情是早期？</p><p>  It’s a very clear tell of like, we’re going to figure it out, just give us a minute. Every company has its own vocabulary.</p><p>  可以很清楚地告诉我们，请稍等一下。每个公司都有自己的词汇表。</p><p> I do want to talk about the notion of gaming shifting away from the hardware. You launched some hardware. You’re going to ship a lot [of hardware]. When do you make the decision to say, the development of the console is done, we’re moving on to figuring out how to manufacture a million of them and put them in stores and ship them?</p><p> 我确实想谈一谈游戏从硬件转移的概念。您启动了一些硬件。您将要运送很多[硬件]。您何时决定说控制台的开发已经完成，我们将继续研究如何制造一百万个并将其放入商店并发货吗？</p><p> It feels like it all happened yesterday, but that clearly isn’t the case.</p><p> 感觉这一切都是昨天发生的，但事实并非如此。</p><p> No, no, no. We started manufacturing late summer. We were a little bit later than the competition, because we were waiting for some specific AMD technology in our chip. We were a little bit behind where they were, where Sony was, in terms of building units. We started in late summer. When you do that, then you have to ship them to all the right retailers and distributors. There’s a time lag, even when you start and even when they’re coming off the assembly line, [until they’re] sitting at retail shelves.</p><p>不不不。我们在夏末开始生产。我们比竞争对手要晚一点，因为我们正在等待芯片中使用某些特定的AMD技术。就建筑单元而言，我们落后于他们所在的位置，索尼所在的位置。我们从夏末开始。当您这样做时，则必须将它们运送到所有合适的零售商和分销商。即使您开始上班，甚至当他们下线时，也要有一段时间，[直到他们]坐在零售货架上。</p><p> We’re building at full capacity for now, a few months. And we continue to. Units continue to hit the shelves. Demand is just incredibly high right now. The biggest disappointment for me in this launch — but I’m also happy with it — is people love the product. The demand is high, such that when you’re going to see product hit the shelf, it goes very quickly. If you want one, I sound like a salesman now, but I’d recommend picking one up when you see it.</p><p> 目前，我们正在几个月内达到最大产能。而且我们继续。部队继续上架。现在的需求非常高。在这次发布会上，我最大的失望-但我也对此感到满意-是人们喜欢这款产品。需求很高，因此当您要看到产品上架时，它会非常快速地发货。如果您想要一个，我现在听起来像个推销员，但我建议您在看到时挑选一个。</p><p> Because we’re going to be in this situation, probably into the spring, maybe not as tight as it is now, but demand is just really high, and we’re building. We start the supply chain back in the summer. We’re building, we’re building. There’s just physics in how many lines at the fab you can put in the assembly lines. You can build as many as you can build, and that’s what we’ve been doing. There are decisions around mix, like how many of the S and the X do you build. You have to make decisions on that.</p><p> 因为我们将处于这种情况，可能要到春季，也许不像现在这样紧，但是需求真的很高，我们正在建立。我们在夏天开始供应链。我们正在建造，我们正在建造。在工厂中可以在装配线中放入多少条生产线只是一种物理学。您可以构建尽可能多的构建，这就是我们一直在做的。有关混合的决定，例如您要构建多少S和X。您必须对此做出决定。</p><p>  No. We knew that... “no” is probably overstating our level of insight. Which I’d say, we’re at the starting line. Was that the Google line?</p><p>  不。我们知道...“不”可能高估了我们的洞察力。我要说的是，我们在起跑线上。那是Google产品线吗？</p><p>   We figured that our first holiday, and probably our second holiday, you would see more of the higher end SKU, the Series X sold. We built more Series Xs than we did Series Ss. I think when we go into spring and summer, we’ll probably moderate that a bit. Over the long run, in most cases, price wins out. If you just go back and look at previous generations and when console generations hit the real sweet spot of sales, which is one of the reasons we like having that, that’s the Series S at its price point.</p><p>   我们认为，我们的第一个假期，也可能是第二个假期，您会看到更多的高端SKU（X系列）售出了。我们生产的X系列比S系列更多。我认为当我们进入春季和夏季时，我们可能会对此有所缓解。从长远来看，在大多数情况下，价格会胜出。如果您回头看看前几代产品，而当几代游戏机达到真正的销售优势时，这就是我们喜欢这么做的原因之一，那就是S系列的价格。</p><p> Then when we go back into next holiday, which we’re already thinking about with supply chain and build, we’re already in that framing, trying to look at what we think our ratio should be between the two. The chips are very different in size — this is a little bit in the weeds — we can actually build more of the Series S [chips] in the same [chip] die space as we can the Series X. Right now, demand for the Series X is higher, which is what we expected.</p><p> 然后，当我们回到下一个假期时（我们已经在考虑与供应链和构建相关的假期），我们已经处于框架之中，试图查看我们认为我们的比率应该介于两者之间。芯片的尺寸非常不同-这有点杂草-实际上我们可以像X系列一样在相同的[芯片]模腔中制造更多的S系列[芯片]。 X系列更高，这是我们的预期。</p><p> It seems like there’s still hiccups with the retailers. I would love to just tell Walmart or Best Buy, “I want one. Here’s some money, just send [it] when you get it.”   That’s not the way the preorders have gone .   It’s just hard to buy either one . It’s hard to buy the PS5 too. It’s weird, because we’re fully in the age of e-commerce. Do you ever think about just doing more of it yourself?</p><p> 似乎零售商仍然在打ic。我只想告诉沃尔玛或百思买，“我想要一个。这是一些钱，请在收到时就发送。”那不是预订的方式。很难买到任何一个。 PS5也很难买到。很奇怪，因为我们完全处于电子商务时代。您是否曾经想过自己做更多呢？</p><p> Well, I think our retail relationships are important. We do think about solving or at least helping with the issue that you talk abou</p><p>好吧，我认为我们的零售关系很重要。我们确实考虑解决或至少在您所说的问题上提供帮助</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/发布/">#发布</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/android/">#android</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ios/">#ios</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/趋势/">#趋势</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
