and a &#34;parody&#34;\n Adelaide woman Tanya Watkins, a self-described &#34;captain&#34; of the church and\u00a0adherent of its creed of &#34;Pastafarianism&#34;, has made repeated attempts to secure the offbeat movement official status as\u00a0an incorporated association.\n After the latest attempt was knocked back by the Corporate Affairs Commission, Ms Watkins\u00a0sought a review of that decision, and the matter was subsequently referred to the South Australian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (SACAT).\n The tribunal heard evidence from the commission and from Ms Watkins, who contended that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster was formed for a &#34;religious, educational, charitable or benevolent purpose&#34;, thereby meeting the criteria of South Australia&#39;s\u00a0Associations Incorporation Act.\n Ms Watkins told the tribunal the church placed emphasis on helping others, and\u00a0had engaged in acts of charity\u00a0such as an event at Flinders University\u00a0to &#34;feed the hungry&#34;.\n In a ruling handed down earlier this year, and recently published online, SACAT Senior Member Kathleen McEvoy rejected the arguments\u00a0for incorporation.\n &#34;Ms Watkins explained to the tribunal that she was seeking incorporation for the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster Australia in order that the association would be recognised as a not for profit organisation under the Act, and be a legal entity in its own right,&#34; Ms McEvoy stated.\n In the ruling, Ms McEvoy noted that while various &#34;Pastafarian texts&#34; are set out in traditional religious forms, they &#34;contain some surprising articulations&#34;, such as references to the books of the Bible as the &#34;Old Testicle&#34; and &#34;New Testicle&#34;.\n &#34;In particular there are numerous expressions which reference the texts of established religions, mimicking those texts in form and language, but in a clearly parodic form,&#34; Ms McEvoy wrote.\n &#34;I do not accept the applicant&#39;s\u00a0explanation of the use of these expressions (and numerous other similar expressions, many expressed in racist and sexist terms, referencing texts or practices of other religions) as examples of humour, and for the purpose of generating curiosity.&#34;\n  &#34;It is my view that the Pastafarian texts can only be read as parody or satire , namely,  an imitation of work made for comic effect. In my view, its purpose is to satirise or mock established religions, and it does so without discrimination,&#34; she wrote.\n  Ms McEvoy upheld the\u00a0Corporate Affairs Commission&#39;s decision that there was no evidence the church engaged in &#34;systematic teaching and learning processes, nor of any structured, consistent, and broad-based charitable activities&#34;.\n &#34;I am satisfied that the proposed incorporated association merely presents as having a religious purpose, but is a sham religion or a parody of religion,&#34; she wrote.\n &#34;It was not formed for a religious purpose. On this basis, to conclude it is eligible for incorporation as a body with a religious purpose could clearly not be a preferable decision.&#34;\n Ms Watkins told the ABC she found SACAT&#39;s decision &#34;quite disappointing&#34;, and said incorporation would have brought considerable benefits.\n &#34;If you&#39;ve got an association, then you should get it incorporated because then you&#39;ve got government oversight, you can run a bank account and all those sorts of things so we could be transparent and above board,&#34; she said.\n Ms Watkins rejected claims that the church was a &#34;sham&#34; and a &#34;hoax&#34;, which she said came &#34;from a misunderstanding&#34;.\n She said the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\u00a0would continue to operate as an\u00a0unincorporated body.\n &#34;You&#39;ll find that there is a core group of people who really believe in Pastafarianism and that it can change people&#39;s lives for the better,&#34;

", "note_en": "Today&#39;s selection -- from  How to Invent Everything by Ryan North. If you should get transported back to pre-history, here\u2019s how to tan an animal skin:\n &#34;Tanning was originally invented in 7000 BCE. Without tanning, animal skins quickly rot, and even dried ones become hard, inflexible, and brittle. Tanning transforms these skins into leather: a substance so resistant to rot that leather shoes from 3500 BCE have survived into the modern era. It&#39;s something you&#39;ll definitely want to do, but you should keep in mind that preparing animal skins for tanning involves not only skin fermentation but also soaking them in urine and massaging them in poop slurries, so maybe set up your tanneries downwind.\n &#34;Immediately after slaughtering the animals, lay the skins flat and cover the fleshy side in salt or sand, which will dry them out and delay decomposi\u00adtion. In a few days the hides will become hard and almost crispy, and they can then be transported to your tanning area. Once there, you&#39;ll soak the hides: this cleans off dirt and gore and softens them up again. Scour the skins to remove any remaining flesh, then soak them in urine -- this loosens the hair, which can then be scraped off. You&#39;ll make the poop slurry we advertised earlier by mixing poo and water, and then soak your skins in that: enzymes in the poop will cause the skins to ferment, softening them and making them more flexible. You can help this process by standing in your poop slurry and kneading the skins with your feet -- just keep telling yourself you&#39;re crushing grapes -- but be sure to wash up with soap and water afterward, or better yet use nonhuman power (like a waterwheel) to knead the skins for you.\n &#34;After all this, two things will have happened: your animal skins will be soft, flexible, and ready for tanning, and nobody will want to get anywhere near you.\n &#34;To tan these skins, you&#39;ll need to collect some appropriately named &#39;tannins,&#39; which come from trees containing the equally appropriately named &#39;tannic acid.&#39; The bark from oak, chestnut, hemlock, and mangrove trees is high in tannin, as is the wood of cedar trees, redwood trees, and more. Tannins are brown, so if you&#39;re using wood instead of bark, look for red- or brown-colored wood, and keep in mind that hardwoods generally contain more tannin than softwoods. To extract tannins, shred your wood or bark and boil it in water for several hours. If you&#39;ve produced it already, adding baking soda to your water will make it more basic, which will draw out the tannins more effectively. You can repeat this process several times with the same bark to produce more dilute tannic solutions.\n &#34;After all this, the tanning process is actually the easiest part: just stretch the animal skins out and immerse them in your tannic solutions of gradually increasing concentrations for a few weeks. During this process, the stretched-out skins trade their moisture for tannins, altering the hide&#39;s protein structure to make it more flexible, more resistant to rotting, and water resistant. And that&#39;s it: you&#39;ve produced leather! Leather&#39;s useful not just for cool jackets; it&#39;s also for shoes, boots (you can make both entirely out of leather), harnesses, boats, can\u00adteens (leather can hold water without leaking, and it won&#39;t break when you drop it like pottery does), whips (fun fact: a whip-crack is actually the sound of a small sonic boom when the tip of the whip exceeds the speed of sound, so technically you&#39;re already inventing supersonic technology), and protective armor.\n &#34;If you prepare your skin but don&#39;t tan it, you&#39;ll produce rawhide, which soft\u00adens when wet but which has the useful property of hardening and contracting when dry. You can exploit that for binding: to attach a blade to a stick and make an ax, just wrap a strip of wet rawhide securely around both and let it dry. Besides making a delicious treat for your dogs (which we can only assume you&#39;ve already started breeding...), rawhide is useful in making drum skins, lampshades, and primitive horseshoes, and has\u00a0 even been used for casts. If you&#39;re doing that, though, be sure to leave some room for it to contract: wrapping limbs in too-tight rawhide has been used for torture.

Instead they accidentally sent  $893 million--the entire balance of the loan, which was not due until 2023.\n When they realized their mistake, they tried to get the money back. Some of the lenders refused, leaving Citigroup out of roughly $500 million. The case went to trial, and  this week U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan ruled against Citigroup.\n How could an error like this possibly happen? Terrible, terrible UI design, as it turns out. First off we need to understand the mechanisms of the repayment arrangement, which is executed through a piece of financial software called Flexcube. As Judge Furman summarized:\n  On Flexcube, the easiest (or perhaps only) way to execute the transaction\u2014to pay the Angelo Gordon Lenders their share of the principal and interim interest owed as of August 11, 2020, and then to reconstitute the 2016 Term Loan with the remaining Lenders\u2014was to enter it in the system as if paying off the loan in its entirety, thereby triggering accrued interest payments to all Lenders, but to direct the principal portion of the payment to a &#34;wash account&#34;\u2014&#34;an internal Citibank account... to help ensure that money does not leave the bank.&#34;\n Ars Technica got ahold of a screenshot used in the case, which shows where the screw-up occurred:\n The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India. He was presented with a Flexcube screen that looked like this:\n   The subcontractor thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, the subcontractor actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; The subcontractor didn&#39;t do that.\n Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was the subcontractor, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware. All three believed that setting the &#34;principal&#34; field to an internal wash account number would prevent payment of the principal. As he approved the transaction, the Delaware supervisor wrote: &#34;looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash.&#34;\n  It looked &#34;good&#34; to the senior supervisor because there are no design provisions to make it look bad. You would think, where an error of this magnitude was possible, the software designers would group certain buttons together, provide warning prompts, change colors from green to red, or a combination of these things. Instead the program appears to have been designed by an engineer in the &#39;90s.\n The upshot for you UI designers out there: Banks will certainly be looking for better software in the future, and willing to pay top dollar for it. There&#39;s a real opportunity here.\n      They&#39;ll actually just continue paying as little as humanly possible for disposable offshore contractors because that&#39;s what American banks do.\n  What else should we sub out? ooh, Let&#39;s subcontract the management of our heart beating to a company in India while we&#39;re at it. And yes, what a horrible software UI, however, most industrial software interfaces look like1993 and run on terrifyingly open systems and on 10 plus-year-old Operating Systems.", "posttime":

", "note_en": "NEW YORK (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc will lift merchant costs for its branded payment products while cutting those for behind-the-scenes processing of some Visa and Mastercard transactions, a bold move in an increasingly competitive digital payments sector.\n  The strategic shift reflects PayPal\u2019s growing power in online transactions, which surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. As consumers and businesses flocked to the company, a market leader, during lockdown, its active accounts mounted to 377 million, more than twice as many as in 2015.\n The company said the move reflected the value of its proprietary services, with consumers nearly three times as likely to complete a purchase when PayPal products are available at checkout, while users of the new buy-now-pay-later option spend an average of 15% more.\n \u201cWe are changing prices to help our customers understand even more clearly where we provide value,\u201d Dan Leberman, PayPal\u2019s senior vice president for small and medium business and partners, said in an interview.\n    PayPal will charge sellers 3.49% plus 49 cents to process transactions made through its proprietary products, including its button on merchant websites and its digital wallet, according to material the company shared with Reuters.\n The higher rate applies to products like PayPal Checkout, Pay with Venmo, PayPal Credit and new buy-now-pay-later offering Pay in 4.\n PayPal has 392 million active accounts, including 31 million merchants globally, and also owns Venmo, Braintree and iZettle.\n It will be hard for merchants to know how much extra value they are getting from PayPal features in exchange for the higher rates, said Ben Dwyer, the founder of cardfellow.com who analyzes processing deals offered to merchants.\n \u201cPayPal wants to be a comprehensive payment solution, but it is tough to get there by selling on value over price.\u201d\n  Sellers will pay 2.59% plus 49 cents for PayPal to process, unseen by consumers, online payments made with Visa and Mastercard debit and credit cards from other companies.\n In the past, PayPal charged sellers 2.9% plus 30 cents for payments on most online transactions, regardless of its role.\n Lowering basic transaction processing rates helps PayPal compete with rivals including Stripe and Authorize.net. PayPal expects to acquire customers because of the discounts, Leberman said.\n \u201cWe think it\u2019s a bold price to come out with,\u201d he said.\n As large merchants tend to negotiate unique deals, rate hikes will largely affect small-to-medium sized businesses, some of which have lost confidence this year due to a nationwide labor shortage and inflation worries.\n  The changes largely reflect services PayPal has developed since splitting from eBay Inc in 2015.\n Although most of its transactions are online, PayPal will also reduce prices for in-person transactions through its network, which should help it compete with Square Inc.\n For most of those purchases over $10, PayPal will charge 1.90% plus 10 cents. For cheaper buys, the rate will usually be 2.40% plus 5 cents.\n PayPal\u2019s business boomed during the pandemic as more homebound consumers spent online. It processed $285 billion in payments in the first quarter, up 49% from the year-earlier period.\n \u201cIt\u2019s more than just pricing,\u201d said Aaron Press, an analyst at research company IDC. \u201cThey are making sure the market understands that they should be thinking of PayPal as a comprehensive payments strategy and not just one form of payment.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-19 11:13:57", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u4ea4\u6613,\u4ea7\u54c1,increase,paypal", "title": "PayPal\u5c06\u4f7f\u7f8e\u56fd\u5356\u65b9\u7684\u6210\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u52303.49\uff05\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ea4\u6613\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fd0\u8f93\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e0a\u6da80.49\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ece2.9\uff05\u52a0\u4e0a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ea4\u66130.30\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "PayPal will increase US sellers' costs to 3.49% plus $0.49 per transaction on its payment products starting Aug. 2, up from 2.9% plus $0.30 on most transactions", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paypal-rates-idUSKCN2DU1V4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u4ea4\u6613", "\u4ea7\u54c1", "increase", "paypal"]}]
