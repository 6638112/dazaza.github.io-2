", "note_en": "The recent ransomware attacks on Colonial Pipeline and the meat processing giant JBS, both attributed to Russian cybercrime gangs, as well as the SolarWinds espionage campaign that intelligence agencies linked to Moscow, thrust cybersecurity into the spotlight on Capitol Hill and prompted renewed scrutiny of the challenges facing the federal government, including its limited understanding of attacks on private companies.\n Washington is slowly responding to the crisis. In mid-May,  Biden signed an executive order intended to close federal security gaps and increase oversight of the contractors that often serve as backdoors into agency networks. Two weeks later,  the TSA issued a security directive requiring pipeline operators to report cyberattacks.  A bipartisan group of senators is now planning legislation to require a wide range of businesses to report breaches.\n Inglis\u2019 new White House office was one of several policy reforms recommended by the congressional chartered Cyberspace Solarium Commission and incorporated into the fiscal 2021 defense policy bill. Lawmakers envisioned the office as analogous to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in terms of elevating the importance of cyber issues within the White House.\n But Congress did not define Inglis\u2019 exact portfolio or authorities, and it remains unclear how he will work with Anne Neuberger, Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. During the presidential transition,  Biden aides bristled at Congress\u2019 creation of a new Senate-confirmed White House position and argued unsuccessfully that cyber coordination should remain the domain of the National Security Council.\n But many on the Hill wanted more continuity and stability in the White House\u2019s approach to cyber issues. The Obama administration had created a cyber coordinator position inside the NSC, but the Trump administration had eliminated that role, calling it unnecessary. That move generated a fierce backlash and led to the Solarium Commission developing the contours of the national cyber director office.\n Inglis, who served on the Solarium Commission, became an early frontrunner for the position. An Air Force veteran who spent nearly 30 years at the NSA, including serving as its deputy director from 2006 to 2014, Inglis developed strong relationships with key lawmakers and earned bipartisan respect on Capitol Hill.\n \u201cHe has a quiet but persuasive leadership style,\u201d Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), a Solarium Commission co-chair, said during Inglis\u2019 confirmation hearing. \u201cAll of us have been in meetings where there\u2019s one person, when they begin to speak, you lean over and say, \u2018Now, what are they going to say? Because this is going to be important.\u2019 That\u2019s Chris Inglis.\u201d\n Inglis\u2019 supporters have described him as well-prepared to face his biggest challenges. While he will not control the military operations of U.S. Cyber Command or the spying activities of the NSA from his White House post, he is deeply familiar with how both organizations work, having helped oversee the launch of Cyber Command, which is run by the same official who heads the NSA.\n And while Inglis\u2019 military background created some controversy when his name first surfaced as a candidate for cyber director \u2014 a role that will now be his first civilian government assignment \u2014 his six and a half years as a partner at the private equity firm Paladin Capital Group offered him a front-row seat to the growing cyber threats facing U.S. businesses. That experience could serve him well as he seeks to streamline how the federal government helps the private sector combat hackers.\n With his mandate largely undefined, Inglis will have a unique opportunity to shape the role of the cyber director.

Of these, one of the most impressive was  Elasmotherium sibiricum.\n  Weighing up to 3.5 tonnes, it lived on the Eurasian grasslands ranging from southwestern Russia and Ukraine to Kazakhstan and Siberia.\n Eventually the species went extinct - but exactly when that happened has been in doubt.\n For those studying the fauna of the last Ice Age, one of the most significant events of the period was the megafaunal extinction. It saw the disappearance of many large, iconic species such as the woolly mammoth, the Irish elk and the sabre-toothed cat.\n Prof Adrian Lister, Merit Researcher at the Museum, says, &#39;This megafaunal extinction event didn&#39;t really get going until about 40,000 years ago. So  Elasmotherium with its apparent extinction date of 100,000 years ago has not been considered as part of that same event.&#39;\n Over the last few years, however, there have been some hints that this extinction date for  E. sibiricum might be wrong.\n &#39;We dated a few specimens - such as the beautiful complete skull we have at the Museum - and to our surprise they came in at less than 40,000 years old,&#39; explains Adrian.\n  On its own this did not mean much, but by teaming up with researchers from the Netherlands and Russia, many more fossils were sampled. The researchers, who originally had not a single radiocarbon-dated  Elasmotherium fossil, ended up with 23 dated specimens.\n &#39;They very strongly all confirmed that this species survived until at least 39,000 years ago, and maybe as late as 35,000 years ago,&#39; says Adrian. The results have been published in  Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution.\n  Elasmotherium sibiricum was a true Ice Age giant, weighing up to twice as much as a modern rhino.\n Unusually, despite its massive size and prominent shoulder hump, it is thought that the Siberian unicorn was actually adapted to running at speed.\n &#39;The rhino&#39;s anatomy suggested that it lived in pretty open, grassy plains, grazing almost entirely on grass,&#39; explains Adrian. &#39;Its unusual teeth look very strongly adapted for that kind of grazing as well.&#39;\n By studying the stable isotope ratios in the rhino&#39;s teeth, which involves looking at the levels of different carbon and nitrogen isotopes and then comparing them to different plants, the researchers were able determine what the animals were eating. The results confirm that the Siberian unicorn was most likely grazing on tough, dry grasses.\n  &#39;Modern rhinos tend to be rather solitary and spread out in their habitat,&#39; says Adrian. &#39;Combined with  Elasmotherium&#39;s restricted geographical range, it might have been quite a rare animal.&#39;\n  This natural scarcity may have been one of the factors that tipped the Siberian unicorn into extinction some 39,000 years ago, around the same time that  Neanderthals went extinct and some time before cave bears and spotted hyenas were last seen in Europe.\n This means that the animals would have been sharing Eurasia with both modern humans and Neanderthals, but as Adrian explains, it is unlikely that they were hunted into extinction.\n &#39;There is no evidence at all that people had anything to do with it. You can&#39;t rule it out, but we don&#39;t have any archaeological association of this animal with people in any way at any sites known so far,&#39; he says.\n Instead it is much more probable that their extinction was the result of the dramatic fluctuations in climate that were occurring during this time period, coupled with the specialised grazing lifestyle and low population numbers.\n &#39;The environment where the animal was living seems to have changed quite considerably around the same time it went extinct,&#39; explains Adrian, &#39;so it is quite plausible that if it were a rare animal to start with then it would have been at a relatively high risk of extinction.&#39;\n  Finally, Adrian&#39;s colleagues in Australia were able to extract DNA from some of the fossils, the first time any DNA has ever been recovered from  E. sibiricum.\n This has helped to settle a debate about where the Siberian unicorn, along with all other members of the  Elastrotherium genus, fit on the rhino evolutionary tree.\n It turns out that the ancient group split from the modern group of rhinos roughly 43 million years ago. This means that the Siberian unicorn was the last species of a highly distinctive and ancient linage when it went extinct on the Eurasian plains only a few tens of thousands of years ago.",

control laws \u2014 and prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws.\n  Gov. Mike Parson signed  the bill, known as HB 85 or the Second Amendment Preservation Act,  into law Saturday at a gun store and shooting range called Frontier Justice.\n  The law declares federal laws and regulations &#34;that infringe on the people&#39;s right to keep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Second Amendment ... must be invalid in this state.&#34;\n  Parson, a Republican,  said in a press release that the legislation &#34;draws a line in the sand and demonstrates our commitment to reject any attempt by the federal government to circumvent the fundamental right Missourians have to keep and bear arms to protect themselves and their property.&#34;\n      &#34;They can pass a law that says that there are 46 planets, they can pass a law that says that there are 16 days in the week. It doesn&#39;t make it so,&#34; says  Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law and an expert on federal courts and constitutional law. &#34;It has no effect legally because the Constitution specifically says you can&#39;t do that.&#34;\n    &#34;If I am a resident of Missouri, I am no less subject to federal gun laws today than I was yesterday,&#34; Vladeck tells NPR.\n    The U.S. Constitution&#39;s  Supremacy Clause essentially says federal law is supreme over state law. And  the preemption doctrine means that &#34;valid federal law will always displace a state law, even a state constitutional provision that is inconsistent with that federal law,&#34; Vladeck says.\n  He notes that after the Affordable Care Act was enacted, some states passed laws that said the ACA wouldn&#39;t apply in those states. But that hasn&#39;t stopped the ACA from being the law of the land in every state.\n  So, what sort of federal gun laws are there? There are limits on what kinds of guns you can sell across state lines, and limits on what kind of guns and accessories can be sold in the first place. There are federal background check requirements. One provision  bans the possession of firearms by individuals convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. And there are laws governing the process and substance of gun sales, Vladeck says.\n  The new law doesn&#39;t change the liability of people in Missouri or exempt them from federal laws. So if you&#39;re a Missouri gun shop owner, you&#39;re still required to uphold federal background check requirements and other federal laws, even if the governor suggests otherwise.\n    Vladeck views Missouri&#39;s new law as symbolic public relations stunt. But he says it&#39;s symbolism that can be harmful: &#34;You run the risk that the state officials are actually sending a message to their constituents that is just incorrect, and that is exposing them to legal liability that they may not otherwise realize.&#34;\n  &#34;A Missouri gun store that thinks all of a sudden it can stop complying with federal law is going to receive a pretty unpleasant visit from federal authorities,&#34; Vladeck says.\n      While states can&#39;t invalidate federal law, they  can decide the extent to which they assist federal law enforcement.\n  &#34;Under the 10th Amendment, states do have the right to withhold the use of their resources to enforce federal laws,&#34; says  Allison Anderman, senior counsel at Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n  &#34;We&#39;re just simply saying we&#39;re not going to lift a finger to enforce their rules,&#34; Missouri state Sen. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said of the bill last month,  according to  The Kansas City (Mo.) Star.\n  In addition to claiming to invalidate federal gun laws, Missouri&#39;s new law prohibits state and local cooperation with enforcement of those laws. Agencies whose officers knowingly enforce federal gun laws could be hit with fines of $50,000 for each violating officer.\n  State and local officers are not usually tasked with going out and enforcing federal law, Vladeck says \u2013 usually it happens in an ancillary fashion: &#34;If they&#39;re conducting a search of a home because of probable cause of a state crime, they might also find evidence of a federal crime that they&#39;ll refer to federal authorities.&#34;\n  Whether local law enforcement in Missouri will do that when it comes to guns is now in question.\n  The Department of Justice sent a letter on Wednesday night to Parson and Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, warning that the state&#39;s law could damage the working relationship between local and federal authorities, The Associated Press  reported. Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton asked Parson and Schmitt to clarify the law and how it would work by Friday.\n  A spokesperson for the Justice Department confirmed the accuracy of the AP&#39;s report. NPR has not viewed the letter.\n  NPR asked the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives whether the statute would have an impact on its enforcement in the state, but an ATF spokesperson said the agency does not comment on local or state firearms law.\n    Missouri has one of the country&#39;s  highest rates of gun deaths per capita, and  weak gun control laws.\n  The law could have a chilling effect on law enforcement officers&#39; actions when it comes to guns, even if its provisions are unconstitutional and confusing, Anderman says.\n  &#34;There is a tremendous amount of ambiguity in this bill as to what would constitute a violation, and that may inhibit law enforcement from taking action that is needed to protect the community,&#34; she tells NPR.\n  Say an officer encounters someone who has a felony conviction and is in possession of a firearm?\n  &#34;They may not refer that case to federal law enforcement out of fear that they would be liable for a $50,000 fine. And that in turn can result in lack of prosecution of a law that is intended to keep guns out of the hands of people who have committed society&#39;s most serious crimes,&#34; Anderman says.\n  The state is not alone in considering this kind of legislation. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson  said in April he would sign a similar bill approved by the Legislature there.\n  Other states are considering legislation to nullify federal gun laws. But Missouri&#39;s law, Anderman says, will have real-life consequences \u2014 whether or not any law enforcement officers are actually prosecuted and fined.\n  &#34;How many officers have failed to take some action that they might have otherwise taken because of this law? We will likely never know the answer,&#34; she says, &#34;but it&#39;s the deterrent effect that is so concerning.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:07:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

Authority is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica, in a building that looks a bit like a prison and a bit like a Holiday Inn. The I.S.A., which has been described as \u201cchronically overlooked\u201d and is so obscure that even many Jamaicans don\u2019t know it exists, has jurisdiction over roughly half the globe.\n Under international law, countries control the waters within two hundred miles of their shores. Beyond that, the oceans and all they contain are considered \u201cthe common heritage of mankind.\u201d This realm, which encompasses nearly a hundred million square miles of seafloor, is referred to in I.S.A.-speak simply as the Area.\n  Scattered across the Area are great riches. Mostly, these take the shape of lumps that resemble blackened potatoes. The lumps, known formally as polymetallic nodules, consist of layers of ore that have built up around bits of marine debris, such as ancient shark teeth. The process by which the metals accumulate is not entirely understood; however, it\u2019s thought to be exceedingly slow. A single spud-size nugget might take some three million years to form. It has been estimated that, collectively, the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt, three times as much nickel, and four times as much of the rare-earth metal yttrium as there is on land. They contain six thousand times as much tellurium, a metal that\u2019s even rarer than the rare earths.\n The first attempts to harvest this submerged wealth were undertaken nearly fifty years ago. In the summer of 1974, a drillship purportedly belonging to Howard Hughes\u2014the Hughes Glomar Explorer\u2014anchored north of Midway Atoll, ostensibly to bring up nodules from the depths. In fact, the ship was operated by the C.I.A., which was trying to raise a sunken Soviet submarine. But then, in a curious twist, a real company called Ocean Minerals leased the Glomar to collect nodules from the seabed west of Baja California. The president of the company likened the exercise to \u201cstanding on the top of the Empire State Building, trying to pick up small stones on the sidewalk using a long straw, at night.\u201d\n After the Glomar expeditions, interest in seabed mining waned. It\u2019s now waxing again. As one recent report put it, \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is the scene of a new wild west.\u201d Thirty companies have received permits from the I.S.A. to explore the Area. Most are looking to slurp up the nodules; others are hoping to excavate stretches of the ocean floor that are rich in cobalt and copper. Permits to begin commercial mining could be issued within a few years.\n Proponents of deep-sea mining argue that the sooner it starts the better. Manufacturing wind turbines, electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries for energy storage requires resources, often scarce ones. (Tellurium is a key component in thin-film solar panels.) \u201cThe reality is that the clean-energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet,\u201d Gerard Barron, the chairman of the\u00a0Metals Company, one of the businesses that holds permits from the I.S.A., observed a few months ago. Seafloor nodules, he said, \u201coffer a way to dramatically reduce\u201d the environmental impact of extracting these tons.\n  But seabed mining poses environmental hazards of its own. The more scientists learn about the depths, the more extraordinary the discoveries. The ocean floor is populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme. There is, for example, a ghostly pale deep-sea octopus that lays its eggs only on the stalks of nodule-dwelling sponges. Remove the nodules in order to melt them down and it will, presumably, take millions of years for new ones to form.\n Edith Widder is a marine biologist, a MacArthur Fellow, and the author of \u201c Below the Edge of Darkness: A Memoir of Exploring Light and Life in the Deep Sea\u201d (Random House). Widder is an expert on bioluminescence, a topic that she became interested in after nearly going blind. In 1970, when she was a freshman in college, she had to have surgery for a broken back. The surgery went fine, but afterward she started hemorrhaging. Her heart stopped beating, and she was resuscitated. This happened again, and then a third time. Blood leaked into both of her eyes, blocking her retinas. \u201cMy visual world was swirling darkness with occasional glimpses of meaningless light,\u201d she recalls. Eventually, she regained her vision, but she no longer took sight for granted.\n \u201cWe believe we see the world as it is,\u201d she writes. \u201cWe don\u2019t. We see the world as we need to see it to make our existence possible.\u201d\n The same goes for fish. Only the\u00a0top layers of the oceans are illuminated. The \u201csunlight zone\u201d extends down about seven hundred feet, the \u201ctwilight zone\u201d down another twenty-six hundred feet. Below that\u2014in the \u201cmidnight zone,\u201d\u00a0the \u201cabyssal zone,\u201d and the \u201chadal zone\u201d\u2014there\u2019s only blackness, and the light created by life itself. In this vast darkness, so many species have mastered the art of bioluminescence that Widder estimates they constitute a \u201cmajority of the creatures on the planet.\u201d The first time she descended into the deep in an armored diving suit called a  , she was overwhelmed by the display. \u201cThis was a light extravaganza unlike anything I could have imagined,\u201d she writes. \u201cAfterwards, when asked to describe what I had seen, I blurted, \u2018It\u2019s like the Fourth of July down there!\u2019\u00a0\u201d\n  Bioluminescent creatures produce light via chemical reaction. They synthesize luciferins, compounds that, in the presence of certain enzymes, known as luciferases, oxidize and give off photons. The trick is useful enough that\u00a0bioluminescence has evolved independently some fifty times. Eyes, too, have evolved independently about fifty times, in creatures as diverse as flies, flatworms, and frogs. But, Widder points out, \u201cthere is one remarkable distinction.\u201d All animals\u2019 eyes employ the same basic strategy to convert light to sensation, using proteins called opsins. In the case of\u00a0bioluminescence, different groups of organisms produce very different luciferins, meaning that each has invented its own way to shine.\n The most obvious reason to flash a light in the dark is to find food. Some animals, like the stoplight loosejaw, a fish with photon-emitting organs under each eye, use bioluminescence to seek out prey. Others, like the humpback blackdevil, hope to attract victims with their displays; the blackdevil sports a shiny lure that dangles off its forehead like a crystal from a chandelier.\n Bioluminescence also serves less straightforward functions. It can be used to entice mates and to startle enemies. The giant red mysid, a hamster-size crustacean, spews streams of blue sparkles from nozzles near its mouth; these, it\u2019s believed, distract would-be attackers. Some animals smear their pursuers with bioluminescent slime\u2014the marks make them targets for other predators\u2014and some use bioluminescence as camouflage. This last strategy is known as counterillumination, and it\u2019s used in the twilight zone, where many creatures have upward-looking eyes that scan for the silhouettes of prey. The prey can adjust their glow to blend in with the light filtering down from above.\n Since it\u2019s so hard for humans to get to  the deep sea\u2014and, once there, to record what they\u2019re seeing\u2014Widder has spent much of her career trying to figure out ways to study bioluminescence remotely. She\u2019s developed special deep-sea cameras that rely on red light, which marine creatures mostly can\u2019t detect. Much of \u201cBelow the Edge of Darkness\u201d is occupied with the travails of getting these cameras placed, a project that involves journeys so nauseating that Widder describes cycling through the five stages of seasickness. In the fourth, she explains, \u201cyou\u2019re afraid you\u2019re going to die,\u201d and in the last \u201cyou\u2019re\u00a0afraid you\u2019re not.\u201d\n  The experience that she really wants to convey, though, is not queasiness but wonder. The creatures of the deep have been putting on the world\u2019s greatest\u00a0light show for tens of millions of years. Widder thinks that if people could witness this spectacle\u2014or even just be made aware of it\u2014they\u2019d pay a lot more attention to life at the bottom of the seas and the many hazards that threaten it. These include but are not limited to global\u00a0warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, agricultural runoff, oil spills, invasive species, bottom trawling, plastic waste, and seabed mining.\n  \u201cWe seem to be in a Catch-22 scenario where we haven\u2019t explored the deep ocean because we don\u2019t appreciate what a remarkable, mysterious, and wondrous place it is, and we don\u2019t know what an astonishing place it is because we haven\u2019t explored it,\u201d she argues. Meanwhile, she writes, \u201cwe are managing to destroy the ocean before we even know what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n All marine photosynthesis takes place in the sunlight zone. Beneath that, food is in such short supply that the occasional dead whale that falls to the ocean floor represents a major source of nutrients. Nevertheless, even in the farthest recesses of the oceans, life finds a way.\n The Mariana snailfish, as its name suggests, occupies the Mariana Trench\u2014the ocean\u2019s deepest depression\u2014in the western Pacific. It\u2019s a few inches long\u00a0and looks like a large, pale-pink tadpole. The Mariana snailfish has been found more than twenty-six thousand feet below sea level, where the pressure is eight hundred times greater than at the surface. To survive under such conditions, the snailfish has come up with various ingenious adaptations: its skull is not completely closed, its bones are unusually rubbery, and it produces special chemicals to prevent its proteins from denaturing under stress. The creature can barely see and instead relies on fluid-filled chambers along its jaws, which detect the movements of small crustaceans known as amphipods. Amphipods, for their part, have been collected from the very bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost thirty-six thousand feet down, where the pressure is so great that the animals\u2019 shells, in theory at least, should dissolve. A team of Japanese scientists recently reported that one deep-dwelling amphipod,  Hirondellea gigas, protects its shell by coating it in an aluminum-based gel, produced from metal that it extracts from seafloor mud.\n  Some of the seas\u2019 most extraordinary animals live around hydrothermal vents\u2014the oceanic equivalents of hot springs. Through cracks in the seafloor, water comes in contact with the earth\u2019s magma; the process leaves it superheated and loaded with dissolved minerals. (At some vents, the water reaches a temperature of more than seven hundred degrees.) As the water rises and cools, the minerals precipitate out to form crenellated, castlelike structures. Hydrothermal vents had been theorized about for many years but remained unseen until 1977, when a team of geologists and geochemists travelling on a research vessel called the Knorr located one about two hundred and fifty miles northeast of the Gal\u00e1pagos. A pair of scientists went down to take a look at it in a submersible named Alvin.\n \u201cIsn\u2019t the deep ocean supposed to be like a desert?\u201d one of them asked over Alvin\u2019s phone link.\n   As Helen Scales, a British marine biologist, explains in her new book, \u201c The Brilliant Abyss: Exploring the Majestic Hidden Life of the Deep Ocean, and the Looming Threat That Imperils It\u201d (Grove Atlantic), \u201cthese animals\u201d turned out to be fundamentally different from other creatures. At the bottom of the vents\u2019 food chains are microbes that have come up with their own novel survival strategy. Instead of using photosynthesis, which harnesses the energy of photons, they rely on chemosynthesis, which uses the energy stored in chemical bonds. Since the late nineteen-seventies, Scales reports, researchers have catalogued hundreds of strange species living around vents; they include creatures so puzzling that it\u2019s hard to find a limb for them on the tree of life.\n Yeti crabs, first observed in 2005 on a vent system along the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, south of Easter Island, look like hairy white lobsters. Their \u201chairs\u201d are actually extensions of their shells, and along them live colonies of chemosynthetic bacteria, which the crabs scrape up and consume. Yeti crabs were found to be so evolutionarily distinctive that taxonomists had to create not just a new genus but a whole new family for them.\n Xenoturbella profunda is a creature that looks like a discarded tube sock. First collected from a vent system in the Gulf of California in 2015, it has no intestines or central nervous system, and scientists aren\u2019t even sure what phylum it belongs to.  Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly referred to as the scaly-foot snail, is a mollusk that\u2019s been found at vents in the Indian Ocean, at a depth of ten thousand feet. It\u2019s the only animal known to build its shell with iron, and around its foot it sports a fringe of iron plates that looks a bit like a flamenco skirt. The snail carries around chemosynthesizing microbes in a special pouch in its throat. In 2019,  Chrysomallon squamiferum became the first vent-dwelling creature to be included on the Red List of Threatened Species, maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The rationale for the listing is that the species has been found at only three sites, and two of these are being explored for mining. Its living space, the I.U.C.N. has observed, is thus apt to be \u201cseverely reduced or destroyed.\u201d\n Scales, like Widder, worries that the bottom of the ocean will be wrecked before many of the most marvellous creatures living there are even identified. \u201cThe frontier story has always been one of destruction and loss,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is na\u00efve to assume that the process would play out any differently in the deep.\u201d Indeed, she argues, the depths are particularly ill-suited to disturbance because, owing to a scarcity of food, creatures tend to grow and reproduce extremely slowly. \u201cVital habitat is created by corals and sponges that live for millennia,\u201d she writes.\n If deep-sea mining proceeds, it\u2019s likely that one of the first countries to pursue it will be Nauru, a tiny nation that, as it happens, was itself almost destroyed by mining.\n About the size of Block Island, Nauru sits in the South Pacific, about sixteen hundred miles northeast of Papua New Guinea. For thousands of years, the island\u2019s largest visitors were birds, which used it, in the words of one journalist, as a \u201cglorified rest stop.\u201d Polynesians and Micronesians arrived on the island sometime around 1000 B.C. They seem to have lived harmoniously\u2014even idyllically\u2014until gun-toting Europeans showed up, in the early nineteenth century. At the start of the twentieth century, a New Zealander named Albert Ellis realized that the ancient bird droppings that coated the island were a rich source of phosphate, an important fertilizer. During the next six decades, more than thirty-five million tons of phosphate were dug out of Nauru and shipped off to farms in Europe and Australia. The process stripped much of the island bare, leaving nothing but jagged pillars of limestone sticking out of the ground. A  National Geographic photographer who visited Nauru mid-destruction wrote, \u201cA worked-out phosphate field is a dismal, ghastly tract.\u201d\n  In 1968, Nauru became its own country. The phosphate business was still booming, and, on paper, the island\u2019s ten thousand residents became some of the richest people in the world. The new nation used its sovereign wealth to invest in, among other things, cruise ships, airplanes, overseas office buildings, and a London musical based on the life of Leonardo da Vinci. The musical flopped, as did most of the other ventures. Nauruans \u201chave a long history of being taken to the cleaners by crooks\u201d is how Helen Hughes, an Australian economist, put it. In 2001, in return for various fees and payments, Nauru\u2019s government allowed Australia to set up a detention center for refugees on the island. The center soon became infamous for its grim conditions.\n  Today, with the phosphate mostly mined out and the refugees mostly resettled, Nauru is betting on nodules. To engage in deep-sea exploration and mining, a company must be sponsored by a country that\u2019s party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. (The U.S. is one of the few nations that has not ratified the Law of the Sea treaty, because of conservative opposition in the Senate.) Nauru has teamed up with the Metals Company, which is based in Canada, to explore a region of the Pacific known as the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, west of Mexico. \u201cWe are proud that Pacific nations have been leaders in the deep-sea minerals industry,\u201d a statement co-authored by Nauru\u2019s representative to the International Seabed Authority recently declared. The deal, it\u2019s estimated, could eventually bring the country more than a hundred million dollars a year. Alternatively, the arrangement could prove even more disastrous than the da Vinci musical. At one point, Nauru officials expressed concern to the I.S.A. that, if a sponsoring nation were held liable for damages arising from a mining operation, it could \u201cface losing more than it actually has.\u201d\n The I.S.A., for its part, has been assigned the task not just of issuing the permits for seabed mining but also of drafting the regulations to govern the practice. These regulations have yet to be finalized, so it\u2019s unclear how stringent they will be. (The final rules are supposed to be in place before commercial mining commences, though the Metals Company has threatened to try to start without them.) Many marine scientists argue that because deep-sea ecosystems are so fragile\u2014and operations that are miles below the surface so difficult to monitor\u2014the only safe way to proceed is not to. Scales makes this point, but acknowledges that the I.S.A. is unlikely to be swayed. She quotes Daniel Jones, a researcher at the British National Oceanography Centre, who says, \u201cEven if we found unicorns living on the seafloor, I don\u2019t think that would necessarily stop mining.\u201d Meanwhile, assuming that mining does go forward, it\u2019s been suggested that faux nodules could be manufactured and dropped by ship into the deep ocean, to replace those being refashioned into batteries. The perfect vessel for this task would have been the Glomar; unfortunately, a few years ago it was sold for scrap.\u00a0\u2666\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 11:06:46", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4ee3\u4ef7,sea,\u6d77\u6d0b", "title": "\u6df1\u6d77\u5145\u6ee1\u4e86\u5b9d\u85cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4ee5\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4e3a\u6b62 ", "title_en": "The Deep Sea Is Filled with Treasure, but It Comes at a Price", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/21/the-deep-sea-is-filled-with-treasure-but-it-comes-at-a-price", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4ee3\u4ef7", "sea", "\u6d77\u6d0b"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "19f86dc46c81190c889c0518b49a1388.jpg", "infoid": 1066636, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u897f\u96c5\u56fe\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u53f6\u5b50\u5df2\u5173\u95ed\u65b0\u8d44\u91d12300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u800cGeekwire\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\u786e\u8ba4\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u5728\u5927\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u770b\u5230\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9500\u552e\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u8f93\u6db2\u5c31\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n \u542f\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u8d2d\u4e70\u548c\u9500\u552e\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\u53f6\u5b50\u4e5f\u7528\u4f5c\u6559\u80b2\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u67091.2\u4ebf\u4eba\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\n \u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u53f8\u7684160\u4eba\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u88c1\u5458\u3002\n   2020\u5e741\u6708\uff0c\u53f6\u5b50\u524a\u51cf\u4e8618\uff05\u7684\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u621654\u4e2a\u804c\u4f4d\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dCeo-Ceo\u8482\u6885\u5229\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u201c\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5927\u9ebb\u90e8\u95e8\u7684\u5e02\u573a\u73b0\u5b9e\u201d\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u6708\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u524a\u51cf\u4e8691\u540d\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6293\u4f4f\u4e86\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\n \u53f6\u5b50\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Yoko Miyashita\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u524d\u76d6\u8482\u56fe\u7247Exec\uff0c\u66fe\u57282019\u5e74\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5f8b\u5e08\u3002\n \u83b1\u65af\u5229\u662f\u4e00\u540d\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u4e0d\u5230\u4e24\u5e74\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900aexec\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53eb\u505a\u751f\u6839\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u975e\u8425\u5229\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\n   \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5927\u9ebb\u96f6\u552e\u5546\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u6bcf\u6708\u8ba2\u9605\u8d39\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5e02\u5e76\u8bbf\u95ee\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4ece\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u8d5a\u94b1\u3002 \n\u6839\u636e\u5927\u9ebb\u56fd\u5bb6\u7a0e\u6536\u548c\u6536\u5165\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u884c\u4e1a\u57282020\u5e74\u9500\u552e\u989d\u589e\u52a0\u4e8671\uff05\u3002\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u53bb\u5e74\u82b1\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u7ea6183\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u53f6\u8302\u76db\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5927\u9ebb\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u8d8b\u52bf\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u9ebb\u5e02\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u91d1\u6765\u71c3\u6599\u8425\u9500\u5728\u4e1c\u6d77\u5cb8\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u6700\u8fd1\u5df2\u7ecf\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u4e86\u5927\u9ebb\u3002\n \u5a31\u4e50\u5927\u9ebb\u4e3a16\u4e2a\u5dde\u548c\u54e5\u4f26\u6bd4\u4e9a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6210\u5e74\u4eba\u5408\u6cd5\u3002 Medical Marijuana\u5728\u989d\u5916\u768420\u6b21\u989d\u5916\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\u636eInsider\u79f0\uff0c\u4eca\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u7684\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5dde\u5408\u6cd5\u5316\u9505\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f17\u5409\u5c3c\u4e9a\u5dde\u548c\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5dde\u7684\u65b0\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u5747\u53d1\u6325\u7740\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7acb\u6cd5\u3002\n  \u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u56de\u5e94\u6f6e\u6d41 -

The fresh cash infusion comes as the cannabis market sees an increase in sales as more states legalize pot and dispensaries were declared essential businesses during the pandemic.\n The startup plans to expand its online marketplace that lets customers and retailers buy and sell cannabis. Leafly also serves as  an educational resource. The platform has 120 million annual visitors.\n The funding will be used to add to the company\u2019s 160-person workforce and follows a series of layoffs over the past few years.\n   In January 2020, Leafly   cut 18%  of its staff, or 54 positions, which then-CEO  Tim Leslie attributed to \u201cmarket realities of the technology and cannabis sectors.\u201d It   cut 91 more employees two months later , citing the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n Leafly is currently under the leadership of CEO  Yoko Miyashita, a former Getty Images exec who was previously the company\u2019s   general counsel after joining in 2019 .\n Leslie, a former Amazon exec who was Leafly\u2019s CEO for less than two years, is now a founder of a farming nonprofit called Living Roots.\n   The company\u2019s  revenue primarily comes from a monthly subscription fee paid by cannabis retailers to be listed on the platform and to access e-commerce tools. It also makes money from advertising.\n The cannabis industry saw a 71% increase in sales in 2020, according to   Leafly\u2019s report  based on marijuana state tax and revenue records. Americans spent about $18.3 billion on cannabis products last year.\n Leafly said marijuana legalization trends are accelerating the cannabis market. The company will use the new funding to fuel marketing on the east coast, where several states have legalized marijuana recently.\n Recreational marijuana is legal for adults in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Medical marijuana is legal in an additional 20 more. Some of these changes were made this year, with New York legalizing pot on March 31, and both Virginia and New Mexico passing similar legislation, which will take effect this summer, according to   Insider .\n  Other companies are responding to the trend \u2014 tech-giant Amazon just announced it would   stop screening certain job applicants for drug use , and it   backed federal legislation  that would legalize and decriminalize pot.\n Investors are also getting on the cannabis boom.  Dutchie , an Oregon-based cannabis e-commerce platform,   announced $200 million in new funding  in March. The company was valued at $1.7 billion.\n  Leafly has raised $38 million in total funding. The recent round was led primarily by existing investors, but Leafly didn\u2019t disclose specific firms or individuals.\n  That means seed stage investing \u2014 an average of 30% of their initial investments are in seed stage companies.\n What goes into the process of securing seed funding?
