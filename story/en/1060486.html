That is more than double  the rate among people who got inoculated in the first several weeks of the nationwide vaccine campaign.</p><p> 根据疾病控制和预防中心的最新数据，超过五百万人，或者近8％的人参加了辉瑞或现代疫苗的人，错过了第二剂。这在全国疫苗运动的前几周内接种的人的速度超过了两倍。</p><p> Even as the country wrestles with the problem of millions of people who are wary about getting vaccinated at all, local health authorities are confronting an emerging challenge of ensuring that those who do get inoculated are doing so fully.</p><p> 即使是乡村摔跤，也有很大态度的人们对受疫苗接种接种疫苗，当地卫生当局正在面临新出现的挑战，确保接种的人完全这样做。</p><p> The reasons vary for why people are missing their second shots. In interviews, some said they feared the side effects, which can include flulike symptoms. Others said they felt that they were sufficiently protected with a single shot.</p><p> 原因因人们缺少第二次镜头而有所不同。在采访中，有人说他们担心副作用，这可能包括氟倍症状。其他人说他们觉得他们被一次射击充分保护。</p><p> Those attitudes were expected, but another hurdle has been surprisingly prevalent. A number of vaccine providers have canceled second-dose appointments because they ran out of supply or didn’t have the right brand in stock.</p><p> 预计这些态度，而另一个障碍令人惊讶地普遍存在。许多疫苗提供者已取消二次剂量预约，因为它们耗尽供应或没有正确的品牌库存。</p><p> Walgreens, one of the biggest vaccine providers, sent some people who got a first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine to get their second doses at pharmacies that only had the other vaccine on hand.</p><p> Walgreens是最大的疫苗提供者之一，派遣了一些有人在第一次拍摄辉瑞或现代疫苗的人中，以便在只有其他疫苗的药房中获得第二剂。</p><p> Several Walgreens customers said in interviews that they scrambled, in some cases with help from pharmacy staff, to find somewhere to get the correct second dose. Others, presumably, simply gave up.</p><p> 几位Walgreens客户在采访中表示，在一些案例中，在药房工作人员的帮助下，找到某处以获得正确的第二剂量。据推测，其他人只是放弃了。 </p><p>  From the outset, public health experts worried that it would be difficult to get everyone to return for a second shot three or four weeks after the first dose. It is no surprise that, as vaccines are rolled out more broadly, the numbers of those skipping their second dose have gone up.</p><p>从一开始就，公共卫生专家担心，难以让每个人在第一次剂量后三四周返回第二次射击。这并不奇怪，因为疫苗更广泛地推出，跳过第二剂的人数已经上升了。</p><p> But the trend is nonetheless troubling some state officials, who are rushing to keep the numbers of only partly vaccinated people from swelling.</p><p> 但趋势令人难以置信的是一些州官员，他正在努力保持仅仅部分接种疫苗的人群。</p><p>  In Arkansas and Illinois, health officials have directed teams to call, text or send letters to people to remind them to get their second shots. In Pennsylvania, officials are trying to ensure that college students can get their second shots after they leave campus for the summer. South Carolina has allocated several thousand doses specifically for people who are overdue for their second shot.</p><p>  在阿肯色州和伊利诺伊州，卫生官员已经指示了团队来电，文本或向人们发送信件，以提醒他们获得第二次射击。在宾夕法尼亚州，官员正试图确保大学生在夏天离开校园后可以获得第二次镜头。南卡罗来纳州专门为第二次拍摄逾期的人分配了数千剂。</p><p>  Mounting evidence collected in trials and from real-world immunization campaigns points to the peril of people skipping their second doses. Compared with the two-dose regimen, a single shot triggers a weaker immune response and may leave recipients more susceptible to dangerous virus variants. And even though a single dose provides partial protection against Covid, it’s not clear how long that protection will last.</p><p>  在审判中收集的安装证据以及真实世界免疫活动指向跳过第二剂的人的危险。与双剂量方案相比，单一射击触发了较弱的免疫反应，并且可能使受体更容易受到危险病毒变异的影响。尽管单剂量为Covid提供部分保护，但它不清楚保护将持续多久。</p><p> “I’m very worried, because you need that second dose,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel.</p><p> “我非常担心，因为你需要第二剂，”宾夕法尼亚大学教授和食品和药物管理局疫苗咨询小组的成员，Paul Discit博士说。</p><p> The stakes are high because there is only one vaccine authorized in the United States that is given as a single shot. The use of that vaccine, made by Johnson &amp; Johnson, was paused this month after it was linked to a very rare but serious side effect involving blood clotting. Federal health officials on Friday  recommended restarting use of the vaccine, but the combination of the safety scare and  ongoing production problems is likely to make that vaccine a viable option for fewer people.</p><p> 赌注很高，因为美国只有一个疫苗，作为单一射击给出。使用该疫苗，由约翰逊＆amp制作;约翰逊在本月暂停它与涉及血液凝固的非常罕见但严重的副作用。联邦卫生官员周五推荐重新开始使用疫苗，但安全恐慌和持续的生产问题的结合可能使疫苗成为较少人的可行选择。</p><p> The C.D.C.’s count of missed second doses is through April 9. It covers only people who got a first Moderna dose by March 7 or a first Pfizer dose by March 14.</p><p> C.D.C.错过的第二剂量的计数是至4月9日的。它只涵盖3月7日至3月14日至3月14日之前获得第一个现代剂量的人。 </p><p> While millions of people have missed their second shots, the overall rates of follow-through, with some 92 percent getting fully vaccinated, are strong by historical standards.  Roughly three-quarters of adults come back for their second dose of the vaccine that protects against shingles.</p><p>虽然数百万人错过了他们的第二次镜头，但随着历史标准的大约92％的疫苗，大约92％的情况下，历史标准的整体率是强大的。大约四分之三的成年人回到了他们的第二剂的疫苗，以防止瓦片。</p><p> In some cases, problems with shipments or scheduling may be playing a role in people missing their second doses. Some vaccine providers have had to cancel appointments because they did not receive expected vaccine deliveries. People have also reported having their second-dose appointments canceled or showing up only to find out that there were no doses available of the brand they needed.</p><p> 在某些情况下，出货量或调度问题可能会在缺少其第二剂的人中发挥作用。一些疫苗提供者必须取消预约，因为他们没有收到预期的疫苗交付。人们还报告了他们的第二剂约会取消或出现，只是找出他们所需要的品牌没有可用的剂量。</p><p>  Some people can be flexible about being rebooked. But that’s harder for people who lack access to reliable transportation or who have jobs with strictly scheduled hours, said Elena Cyrus, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Central Florida.</p><p>  有些人可以灵活地重新预订。但是，佛罗里达大学大学的传染病流行病学家Elena Cyrus表示，缺乏可靠运输或拥有严格安排的工作的人的人更难以置信。</p><p> Walgreens booked some customers for their second appointments at places that didn’t have the same vaccine that they had received for their initial doses. The company said it fixed the problem in late March.</p><p> Walgreens在没有与其初始剂量接收的地方的地方预约一些客户的第二次顾客。该公司表示，它在3月下旬解决了问题。</p><p>  Susan Ruel, 67, was scheduled to get her two vaccine doses at different Walgreens stores in Manhattan. She said she got her first Pfizer dose without incident in February, but when she arrived for her second appointment, she was told that the store only had Moderna doses in stock.</p><p>  67岁的苏珊·伦特·鲁尔计划在曼哈顿的不同Walgreens商店获得她的两种疫苗剂量。她说她在2月份没有事件的情况下留下了她的第一个辉瑞剂剂量，但是当她抵达她的第二次任命时，她被告知商店只有现代剂量有库存。</p><p> A Walgreens pharmacist told Ms. Ruel that there was another Walgreens pharmacy less than two miles away with Pfizer doses in stock. While Ms. Ruel was waiting for the subway to take her there, she got a phone call: That Walgreens store had run out of Pfizer doses, too.</p><p> 一位Walgreens药剂师告诉Ruel女士，在船上有两英里的距离有两英里的Walgreens药房。虽然Ruel女士在等待地铁带她，但她接到电话：Walgreens商店也用完了辉瑞剂量。</p><p> Ms. Ruel managed to get the Pfizer dose at yet another Walgreens the next day. But she said many people in her situation probably wouldn’t have tried so hard. “All you need is hassles like this,” she said.</p><p> Ruel女士设法在第二天进入另一个Walgreens的PFizer剂量。但她说，她的情况下有很多人可能不会试过这么难。 “你所需要的只是像这样的麻烦，”她说。 </p><p> In the Chicago area, for example, pharmacists at two Walgreens locations said the problem was causing headaches. They said that Walgreens’ appointment system was sending each pharmacy anywhere from 10 to 20 customers a week who need a second Pfizer shot, even though both pharmacies stock only the Moderna vaccine.</p><p>例如，在芝加哥地区，两个Walgreens地区的药剂师表示，该问题导致头痛。他们说，Walgreens的预约系统每周在10到20名客户中送到每一个辉煌射击的一周，即使两种药店都只有现代疫苗。</p><p> It is not clear how widespread the Walgreens dose-matching problem has been or how many people have missed their second doses because of it.</p><p> 目前尚不清楚Walgreens剂量匹配问题的普遍普遍存在，或者有多少人因其错过了他们的第二剂量。</p><p> Jim Cohn, a spokesman for Walgreens, said that the problem affected “a small percentage” of people who had booked their appointments online and that the company contacted them to reschedule “in alignment with our vaccine availability.” He said that nearly 95 percent of people who got their first shot at Walgreens have also received their second shots from the company.</p><p> Walgreens发言人Jim Cohn表示，这个问题影响了在线预订其约会的人“一小部分”，并公司与他们联系到重新安排“，与我们的疫苗可用性一致。”他说，近95％的人在Walgreens获得了第一次拍摄的人也收到了公司的第二次射击。</p><p> Walgreens has also  come under fire for, until recently, scheduling second doses of the Pfizer vaccine four weeks after the first shot, rather than the three-week gap recommended by the C.D.C. Pharmacists have been besieged by customers complaining, including about their inability to book vaccine appointments online.</p><p> Walgreens也遭到火灾，直到最近，在第一次拍摄后四周调度辉瑞疫苗的第二剂，而不是C.D.C推荐的三周间隙。药剂师们被抱怨所围困，包括他们无法在线预订疫苗约会。</p><p> In other cases, though, access to vaccines is not the sole barrier; people’s attitudes contribute, too.</p><p> 然而，在其他情况下，访问疫苗不是唯一的屏障;人们的态度也有助于。</p><p> Basith Syed, a 24-year-old consultant in Chicago, nabbed a leftover Moderna vaccine at a Walgreens in mid-February. But when the time came for his second shot, he was busy at work and preparing for his wedding. After the first shot, he had spent two days feeling drained. He didn’t want to risk a repeat, and he felt confident that a single dose would protect him.</p><p> Basith Syed是一家在芝加哥的一名24岁的顾问，于二月中旬在Walgreens举行了一名剩余的现代疫苗。但是，当时他的第二次射门时，他忙于工作并为他的婚礼做准备。在第一次拍摄之后，他花了两天的感觉。他不想冒着重复危险，他感到相信单一剂量会保护他。</p><p> “I didn’t really feel the urgency to get that second dose,” Mr. Syed said.</p><p> “我并没有真正觉得那个第二剂量的紧迫性，”Syed先生说。 </p><p> By early April, his schedule had calmed down a little, and he went looking for a second Moderna shot. But by then, the Walgreens where he had gotten his first shot was only offering Pfizer shots. He couldn’t find slots at other Walgreens stores. Mr. Syed is no longer actively looking for a second shot, though he still hopes to eventually get one.</p><p>到4月初，他的时间表已经平静下来，他去寻找第二个现代射击。但是，到那时，他已经遇到了他的第一次射击的沃尔格里斯只是提供辉瑞镜头。他找不到其他Walgreens商店的老虎机。 Syed先生不再积极寻找第二次拍摄，尽管他仍希望最终得到一个。</p><p>  The  C.D.C. says there is limited data on the vaccine’s effectiveness when shots are separated by more than six weeks, although some countries, including Britain and Canada, are giving shots with a gap of up to three or four months.</p><p>  C.D.C.说疫苗的有效性有限，当镜头分开超过六周时，虽然包括英国和加拿大，包括英国和加拿大，差距长达三四个月。</p><p> Mr. Syed’s experience is part of a broader shift in Illinois. When vaccines were mostly being given to health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities and people over 65, almost everyone was getting their second shots. In recent weeks, though, the number dipped below 90 percent, though it has since rebounded slightly, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.</p><p> Syed先生的经验是伊利诺伊州更广泛转变的一部分。当疫苗主要被送到医疗保健工作者时，长期护理设施和65人的人的居民几乎每个人都会得到第二次射击。然而，最近几周，据伊利诺伊州公共卫生部门略微反弹以来，该数量低于90％。</p><p> In Arkansas, about 84,000 people have missed their second shots, representing 11 percent of those eligible for those shots, said Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state epidemiologist. Workers recently began calling people who are due or overdue for their second shots.</p><p> 在阿肯色州，大约84,000人错过了他们的第二次射击，代表了11％的人，其中据国家流行病学家詹妮弗Dillaha博士表示，曾符合这些镜头的人数。工人最近开始呼吁那些截止或逾期的人。</p><p> College students pose a particular challenge. Many recently became eligible to be vaccinated and are getting their first shots, but they will have left campus by the time they are due for their second doses.</p><p> 大学生构成了一个特殊的挑战。许多最近有资格接种疫苗并获得第一次拍摄，但他们将在他们的第二剂时留下左派校园。</p><p> In Pennsylvania, health officials have instructed vaccine providers to give second doses to college students even if they did not receive their first doses from that location.</p><p> 在宾夕法尼亚州，卫生官员已经指示疫苗提供者即使他们没有从该位置收到他们的第一个剂量，也要给大学生给大学生。</p><p> Some vaccine providers have put on special clinics for people who need a second dose. In South Carolina, the health system Tidelands Health started a program specifically for people who received their first Pfizer doses more than 23 days earlier but hadn’t been able to find a second shot. The state health department sent the health system 2,340 doses for the effort.</p><p> 一些疫苗提供者已经为需要第二剂量的人投入特殊诊所。在南卡罗来纳州，卫生系统德国潮汐健康专门为预先收到他们的第一个辉瑞的人提前服用的人，但尚未找到第二次拍摄。国家卫生部门派遣了卫生系统2,340剂量的努力。 </p><p> Demand has been strong, and Tidelands only has a few hundred doses left. The majority of takers have been people who “were having difficulty navigating all the various scheduling systems and providers,” said Gayle Resetar, the health system’s chief operating officer.</p><p>需求已经很强，德国只剩下几百剂。卫生系统首席运营官Gayle Resetar说，大多数接受者都是“难以驾驭所有各种调度系统和提供商的人”。</p><p> In many cases, vaccine providers had canceled second-dose appointments because of bad winter weather. “It was up to the individual to reschedule themselves on a web portal or web platform, and that just became difficult for people,” Ms. Resetar said.</p><p> 在许多情况下，由于冬季天气不好，疫苗提供者已取消二次剂量约会。 “这取决于个人在网站门户网站或网络平台上重新安排自己，这对人们来说很难，”Resetar女士说。</p><p> There are rare cases in which people are supposed to forgo the second shot, such as if they had an allergic reaction after their first shot.</p><p> 有罕见的病例，其中人应该放弃第二次疫苗，例如如果他们在首次拍摄后发生过敏反应。</p><p>  Zvi Ish-Shalom, a religious studies professor from Boulder, Colo., had planned to get fully vaccinated. Then, an hour after his first shot of the Moderna vaccine, he developed a headache that hasn’t gone away more than a month later.</p><p>  ZVI Ish-Shalom，博尔德，科罗尔博尔德的宗教研究教授，已计划完全接种疫苗。然后，在他第一次拍摄现代疫苗之后一小时，他开发出一个以上没有超过一个月的头痛。</p><p> There is no way to know for sure whether the vaccine triggered the headache. But after weighing what he saw as the risks and benefits of a second dose, Dr. Ish-Shalom reached a decision about how to proceed.</p><p> 没有办法确定疫苗是否触发头痛。但在称重后他认为是第二剂量的风险和益处，伊斯海洛姆博士达成了如何进行的决定。</p><p> “At this point in time, I feel very clear and very comfortable, given all the various elements of this equation, to forgo the second shot,” he said.</p><p> “在这一点时，我感到非常清晰，非常舒适，鉴于这个方程的所有各种元素，才能放弃第二次拍摄，”他说。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/covid-vaccines-second-doses.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/business/covid-vaccines-second-doses.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/skipping/">#skipping</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/疫苗/">#疫苗</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
