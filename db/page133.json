This is due in large part to their past success in distributed IT development, remote IT operations, and remote maintenance. IT companies have required their staff to essentially do at home what they had been doing in the office years before. Moreover, to meet the constraints of working from home, the demand for IT services has increased across many other market sectors, including retail, entertainment, education, and healthcare, leading to a more profitable IT market.\n    While this news is largely positive for IT companies, the pandemic is also taking its toll on the upstream supply of IT labor, and software developers in particular. These effects could constrain hiring and innovation over the next two to three years. Due in part to travel embargos, limited access to educational loans, and delays in student visa processing, U.S. colleges and universities are observing significant declines in graduate-level enrollments in computer and information science this year. These declines are translating into one-year enrollment deferrals, meaning a temporary, but significant reduction in expected 2021 graduation rates.\n Two years ago, in 2019, U.S. colleges and universities awarded more than 136,000 bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information science (CIS).  6 Among which, 35,200 of these degrees were awarded to nonresident aliens, among whom 27,200 or 77% earned either a master&#39;s or doctoral degree, placing these graduates in a higher skilled technology category. Recently, the American Council on Education (ACE) reported a 43% decline in pandemic-era enrollments for international students based on recent surveys.  5 This decline will reduce CIS post-graduates by 11,700 students in 2021, and would disproportionately affect higher-skilled graduates with more than two years of industry experience. While this story is still playing out, we should already anticipate a tighter IT labor market, particularly among higher-skilled technology jobs.\n    Prior to the pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated that approximately 1,469,200 full-time software developers were working in the U.S. in 2019, earning an average salary of $107,510. Over the next 10 years, BLS estimates the U.S. labor market will add 316,000 software developer jobs, which is a phenomenal 22% growth rate, or an average of about 31,000 new jobs each year. By comparison, lesser-skilled computer programmer jobs would decline by 9% to fewer than 193,800 jobs by 2029, showing a continued shift in the U.S. labor market toward higher-skilled IT jobs that include the engineering practices of software design, software construction and maintenance. The 43% decline in new CIS graduates reported by the ACE would reduce BLS estimated job growth by 38% in 2021 by leaving thousands of jobs unfilled.\n In our review of published 2018 data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), 61% of the top 200 companies that hire graduates under Optional Practical Training (OPT) conduct business in management consulting, and information technology, including retail, finance, and healthcare;  9 see the sidebar  here. This includes popular consulting companies, such as Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and KPMG, as well as popular technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We estimate that in 2018 there were 46,700 new workers authorized under STEM OPT who were potentially working in IT-related fields. If true, then a decline of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021 could reduce the available OPT-authorized IT workforce by as much as 25%.\n    When labor-supply shortages arise in IT, the impact can negatively affect both productivity and innovation. In a survey of electronic and mechanical engineering and IT firms in Northern Ireland, Bennett and McGuinness found that skill shortages in hard-to-fill and unfilled vacancies reduce firm-level performance.  1 Hard-to-fill vacancies include those requiring more experience and qualifications, such as IT positions that require at least two years of experience, which are reported to be 40% more difficult to fill than entry-level positions. Unfilled vacancies are measured by the raw number of open positions within the last 12 months, which is independent of how recruiters interpret &#34;difficult to hire.&#34; In general, Bennett and McGuinness found that hard-to-fill vacancies reduced productivity levels by 65%, while unfilled vacancies reduced productivity levels by 75%. This productivity loss is amplified when the company has a large proportion of new graduates and inexperienced workers, or when the company has significant investments in R&amp;D, which otherwise drives up productivity when labor shortages are minimal. Substantiating the impact of labor shortages on innovation, Horbach and Rammer analyzed three years of the German Innovation Survey and found that unfilled positions in high skill areas correlates with increased canceling of innovation projects.  4\n Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies. What makes a company attractive to a prospective employee is driven in part by the skills that a prospective hire feels they can develop on the new job. Based on an analysis of employment data from over 50,000 workers, Tambe et al. found that IT employees accept a &#34;compensating differential,&#34; such as trading pay for other job attributes, when they can work with novel and emerging IT systems and develop their skills on the job.  7 Furthermore, their analysis shows employees value working on interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes, such as pay and other benefits. They also note that recent graduates who arrived with newer skills in a high-demand job market would have more job options, and thus be more competitive hires.\n    Instead of waiting for positions to become hard-to-fill and unfilled\u2014leading to more lost productivity and reduced innovation\u2014companies can take two strategic steps to attract and retain high-skilled employees: establish a dual career path for managerial and technical staff, and invest in employee education and training.\n In 1988, Ginzburg and Baroudi identified the need to define a non-managerial technical career ladder to complement the traditional management track for promotions.  3 Over the last seven years, we observed that over 50% of graduates of the Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have entered senior positions. These graduates enter either a managerial track, such as Project and Program Manager or Staff Software Engineer, or they enter a technical track, such as Senior Software Engineer and Software Development Engineer II and above. The technical track encourages career growth without shifting one&#39;s responsibilities to primarily cover management activities. In April 2020, we looked at career paths of alumni who graduated from 2015\u20132017 recording 44 alumni who ascended the technical ladder within their companies, and 10 who ascended by changing employers. Companies that allow employees to move between tracks afford employees more flexibility to pursue skill development within the company versus looking outward for open positions elsewhere. For example, we observed CMU MSE alumni working for a few years as technical leaders, building critical service infrastructure, who later chose to develop their personnel and project management skills by moving to a management track. We also see the converse, though less often: after having managed a team for some time, an alumnus/alumna chooses to re-enter a product or project team as a technical leader in a non-management role. In our discussions with alumni, these shifts were not viewed as career compromises, but as skill development opportunities.\n  Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies.\n  Another way to attract and retain employees, and to support internal career advancement, is to engage employees in on-the-job education by providing online learning benefits in addition to pay. One consequence of the pandemic has been large moves by colleges and universities toward online learning. Coursework in artificial intelligence and machine learning, DevOps, and software architecture are now online and taught by the world&#39;s experts in these topics. Online learning opportunities come in different sizes, from one-to three-course certificates to part-time degree programs that students complete over two to three years. In many cases, employees dedicate 10\u201312 hours a week to online courses, while applying this advanced knowledge to their workplace projects. To build such benefits, companies should consider several issues, including: how to allow for flexible schedules that accommodate online classes; how much to compensate employees for course tuition, recognizing these newly learned skills will transfer to their workplace performance; and whether a certificate or a degree program is the right incentive for recruitment and retention. Certificates may be attractive to senior employees, whereas a graduate degree could entice recent hires looking for more experience and seek additional formal education aimed at advancing their careers internally.\n By emphasizing career paths that foster skill development, companies can move to keep employees more engaged with new opportunities that demonstrate their intellect and entrepreneurship. Moreover, providing corporate support for online software engineering education can re-energize a culture of innovation. Together, these investments can help companies reduce their exposure to the effects of this pandemic, while the upstream supply of IT labor replenishes to meet growing demand.\n    It is evident a labor shortage is expected to arrive soon and that it will disproportionately affect highly skilled workers. With an estimated reduction of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021  5 and the BLS estimated 22% growth in software developer jobs,  8 there could be thousands of positions left unfilled or hard-to-fill. The added difficulty of hiring skilled employees from a smaller labor supply has the potential to cost companies through lost productivity and reduced innovation. The remaining question is how will companies creatively hire and retain high-skilled employees amidst all the coming turmoil? Companies can get ahead of the shortfall with two strategic steps: establishing a dual career path that allows employees to grow, and investing in employee education and training.\n  1.

", "note_en": "On May 1, 1903, an African-American man named Will West entered the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth. Like any other new prisoner, West was subjected to the standard admission procedure: prison clerks took photographs, a physical description, and eleven anthropometric measurements.\n Using West\u2019s measurements and description, identification clerks matched him to the record of William West, who had a previous conviction for murder. Not surprisingly, in the clerks\u2019 view, West denied that he was this man.\n The discovery of Will West\u2019s past conviction must have seemed routine to the Leavenworth clerks: once again, the world-famous Bertillon system of identification had prevented a criminal from escaping his past. Once again, science had exposed a criminal\u2019s lies and evasions.\n This incident suddenly deviated from the usual, however, when the clerks discovered to their amazement that this same William West was already incarcerated at Leavenworth!\n According to authors Harris Hawthorne Wilder and Bert Wentworth (1918):  \u201cFrom the Bertillon measurements thus obtained, [the record keeper] went to the file, and returned with the card the measurements called for, properly filled out\u2026and bearing the name, \u201cWilliam West.\u201d This card was shown to the prisoner, who grinned in amazement, and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my picture, but I don\u2019t know where you got it, for I know I have never been here before.\u201d The record clerk turned the card over, and read the particulars there given, including the statements that this man was already a prisoner at the same institution, having been committed to a life sentence on September 9, 1901, for the crime of murder.\n  The second West was summoned, and he looked startlingly like the first one. Subsequently, the fingerprints of Will West and William West were compared. The patterns bore no resemblance.\n The fallibility of three systems of personal identification (photographs, Bertillon measurements, and names) was demonstrated by this one case. The value of fingerprints as means of identification was established.\n The warden, R. W. McClaughry, according to the legend, declared, \u201cThis is the death of Bertillonage!\u201d and discontinued anthropometry as Leavenworth \u201cthe very next day.\u201d\n After the Will West-William West case, most police departments began using photographs, Bertillon measurements, and fingerprints on their mugshot files. Eventually, the Bertillon system was discarded.\n The William and Will West story is somewhat sensationalized and omits prison record information, uncovered by later researchers, indicating that William and Will West both corresponded with the same family members and thus were probably related. Prison records also cite that Leavenworth inmate George Bean reported that he knew William and Will West in their home territory before prison and that they were twin brothers.\n Their exact relationship is still unknown. What is factual is that the two West men were not unusual; many people have similar anthropometric measurements. It is generally accepted that identical twins will have the same or almost the same anthropometric measurements, yet easily differentiated fingerprints. The superiority of fingerprints over anthropometry is thus clear.\n  Regardless of how crucial the incident was to the adoption of fingerprinting, the men\u2019s prison records\u2014including their almost identical mug shots, matching Bertillon measurements, and mismatched fingerprints\u2014survive to authenticate an amazing coincidence.\n Will West, the newer of the two Leavenworth inmates, served his manslaughter sentence and left no trail after his release, thus disappearing from history. William West, the lifer, spent time in solitary confinement for fighting and creating disturbances during his early years behind bars. He was released on parole in 1919, but not before making a dash for freedom.\n By 1916 West was a model prisoner and a \u201ctrusty,\u201d an inmate entrusted to guard and discipline other prisoners on work details. One afternoon he \u201csuccumbed to the temptation,\u201d as he put it, and walked away. He hopped a freight train and made it as far as Topeka before he was arrested the next day and returned to Leavenworth.\n The police officers who picked him up did not need fingerprints to confirm he was an escapee. A prison-issued circular bearing his mug shots and a written description had already reached Topeka. Ironically, they were enough to nab a man who had helped to modernize the identification of criminals.\n Nowadays, fingerprinting remains critical for identification in the criminal justice system, useful for identifying records and maintaining criminal history.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 05:13:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

\n...... ", "note_en": "When we think of everything released in the year since GitLab 13.0, we could not be more proud of our community and our team. This month, we celebrate our release of GitLab 14.0 by first taking a step back.\n Together, we\u2019ve made so much progress over the last year that we want to talk about everything it took to get to  GitLab 14.\n We use semantic versioning so a point release, like 14.0, represents everything new in this month. GitLab 14 is the culmination of the past year. Even more than that, GitLab 14 represents the future of GitLab, and the future of DevOps.\n With GitLab 14, teams of all sizes are moving from maintaining DIY DevOps toolchains to adopting modern DevOps. GitLab 14 is a complete DevOps platform with security embedded in its DNA, visibility and insights enabled by its single data store, and a seamless experience and extensible system, so end users and enterprises alike reap the benefits of speed and efficiency.\n We\u2019re so excited that we\u2019ve written a post where you can  read more about GitLab 14 and our vision for modern DevOps, and how it enables any team to build and deliver software with velocity, visibility, and trust.\n As ever, we are also excited about what\u2019s new this month in 14.0. Read on for our regular highlights from dozens of significant new features and improvements. Along with these exciting new features, there are a few  breaking changes in 14.0. To preview what&#39;s coming in next month\u2019s release, check out our  Upcoming Releases page, which includes our 14.1 release kickoff video.\n  Mathieu has contributed significantly to the Package stage with his work on both the Debian and Helm package registries. These direction features have been fully contributed by Mathieu thus far.\n The effort to implement  Debian packages has been ongoing since September of 2020. Approximately 38 MRs merged so far, and now we are nearing the end of the  iterative plan that Mathieu put together and maintained. As a result of Mathieu\u2019s efforts, we are just a few merge requests away from feature completion and release.\n Mathieu also planned the  Helm Charts Package Manager effort and has been working on that over the past three months. In this work, Mathieu has embraced the GitLab values of iteration and collaboration, working closely with the entire Package team and beyond on these and many other features.\n   Epic Boards align teams and organizations by communicating the status of epics continuously. Previous versions of GitLab required you to view and sort epics in a list to view the overall status. Keeping epics up to date meant making most changes through an epic\u2019s detail page. Epic Boards enable you to visualize and refine all of your epics in one place, using a customizable, drag-and-drop interface that is easy for any teammate to understand and collaborate.\n Epic Boards are also a game-changer for managing and visualizing ideal epic workflows, such as authoring workflow states (Draft, Writing, Done), DevOps workflow states (such as Planned, In Development, and In Production), or any other mutually exclusive states you might model with scoped labels. Visualizing workflows with an Epic Board empowers you to increase predictability and efficiency.\n  Terraform modules play a central role in building standard infrastructure components throughout an organization. Up to GitLab 13.12, GitLab users had to use either a third-party Terraform module registry, local modules, or Git-based modules. While these options work well, they do not help with the distribution of the modules and they lack proper versioning support, which introduces risks for module users. GitLab 14.0 extends our  Infrastructure-as-Code offerings with a Terraform module registry. Now, you can use the Terraform module registry built into GitLab to discover Terraform modules with semantic versioning support for upgrades and maintenance. Moreover, you can publish modules easily using GitLab CI/CD.\n While following Terraform\u2019s best practices, we recommend developing each Terraform module in a dedicated GitLab project. To simplify the transition to the registry, users can host and publish multiple modules from a single GitLab repository. You can learn more about publishing and consuming a new module  in our documentation.\n  GitLab 14.0 introduces an all-new, streamlined top navigation menu to help you get where you\u2019re going faster and with fewer clicks. This new, consolidated menu offers the combined functionality of the previous Projects, Groups, and More menus. It gives you access to your projects, groups, and instance-level features with a single click. Additionally, all-new responsive views improve the navigation experience on smaller screens.\n  As a developer, you often spend a majority of your time working in your local development environment. When you\u2019re assigned a merge request for review, this requires you to leave your editor and perform that review inside of GitLab. While performing your review inside GitLab, you might also need to use your local editor to gain more context on the proposed changes.\n GitLab Workflow version  3.21.0 for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) now supports the complete merge request review process, including threads. Select the GitLab icon in VS Code to open the  sidebar to display  Merge requests I\u2019m reviewing. Select a merge request overview to view the complete details and discussions of the merge request.\n The sidebar also contains a list of all the changed files in the merge request. Selecting files opens a diff comparison for you to review the changes in VS Code. While viewing the diff, you can read feedback left on the files, and create new comments by selecting a line number and creating your comment. All comments and feedback you provide in VS Code are available in the GitLab web interface, making it easy for you to perform your reviews in VS Code, and other users to participate in GitLab.\n We\u2019re really excited about bringing the complete merge request review process to you inside of VS Code. Let us know what you think by  opening an issue for GitLab Workflow.\n  GitLab is big. And it\u2019s getting bigger. As we\u2019ve introduced new features and categories, navigating the densely-packed left sidebar has become less intuitive.\n In GitLab 14.0 we\u2019ve redesigned and restructured the left sidebar for improved usability, consistency, and discoverability. We\u2019ve moved some links to features around, split up features in the  Operations menu into three distinct menus, improved visual contrast, and optimized spacing so all the menu items can fit comfortably on a smaller screen. These changes are intended to better match your mental model of the DevOps lifecycle, and provide a more predictable and consistent experience while navigating within your projects and groups.\n  Editing wiki content could be so much easier! Many GitLab wikis use Markdown formatting, and for some users, Markdown is a barrier to efficient collaboration. In this release, you now have access to a rich, modern Markdown editing experience in your wiki, so you can edit with confidence.\n Instant feedback and visual editing tools help make wiki editing more intuitive, and remove barriers to collaboration. GitLab saves the changes as Markdown when you\u2019re done, so users who want to edit the Markdown directly can do so. You can even type Markdown into the new editor and it will automatically format the text as you type.\n GitLab 14.0 introduces the  Content Editor into the Wiki with support for most of the basic Markdown content types like headers, bold and italic text, lists, code blocks, and links.  Full support for the entire  GitLab Flavored Markdown specification will arrive in upcoming releases. We also plan to make the Content Editor available in other areas of GitLab in the future. We welcome input on this early MVC in  this feedback issue.\n  In GitLab 13.12 and earlier, all DAST vulnerabilities found in a scan were listed individually for each URL the vulnerability was found on. This could create many vulnerabilities when the fix was a single file or configuration change. For example: an issue with a server header sent with every HTTP response would be reported on every page on the site, rather than reported as a single issue with multiple occurrences.\n To reduce the overhead of managing vulnerabilities, GitLab combines identical vulnerabilities found on multiple pages into a single reported vulnerability in the DAST report. The vulnerability details include a list of all the URLs where the vulnerability was found, rather than individual vulnerabilities being created in the vulnerability list and dashboard for each page.\n This new reporting functionality will not retroactively combine vulnerabilities found in previous scans. It only applies to scans performed in GitLab 14.0 and later.\n  In this release, we are moving away from the CI/CD template-based approach for cluster management. Cluster management is the ability to manage Kubernetes clusters to improve application availability running on a cluster. The old method hides too much of the logic, restricts customizations and extensions of your apps. With the new approach, you can easily create a cluster management project from a project template and fully control your applications. A project created using the new template contains the code needed for cluster management jobs, including  built-in support for several applications. You can easily extend the project to other applications and own them completely.\n Additionally, new applications will be installed using Helm v3. If you have former GitLab Managed Applications installed using Helm v2, check the  Helm migration guide and the  GitLab Managed Apps migration guide. The CI/CD job output will also guide you through these migrations.\n In GitLab 14.0, the cluster management project supports only certificate-based cluster integrations. We plan to add support for the GitLab Kubernetes Agent in the next release.\n  The pipeline editor in GitLab is your one-stop shop when interacting with CI/CD pipelines. Previously, when writing your first pipeline with the editor, you were presented with a blank configuration. While perfectly useful for experienced pipeline authors, it was a bit of a leap for those just starting out.\n In this release, if a project does not have a pipeline configured, the editor preloads a template showing an example 3-stage pipeline. You can save and run this pipeline right away to see it in action in your project. On top of that, it also has comments that help you understand the syntax, and tips and hints to help you start customizing the template to match your needs. It is now much easier to get your first green pipeline!\n  Container scanning in GitLab now uses the Trivy engine by default. This change provides customers with more timely vulnerability intelligence updates, more accurate results, and support for a larger number of operating systems. Users who run container scanning with default settings are switched seamlessly and automatically to the new engine in GitLab 14.0. Users who customize the variables in their container scanning job should review our  migration guide and make any necessary updates.\n  As part of our efforts to natively support  DORA4 metrics in GitLab, the lead time for merge requests chart is now available at the Group level. This release extends on the work completed in  GitLab 13.11; you can now use a chart that shows how long it takes merge requests to be deployed to a production environment (not just in individual projects, but aggregated across a group). This allows you to get a full picture of throughput across multiple projects.\n The stages in project-level value stream analytics are now shown in a horizontal layout. This helps visualize the flow of work through the stages of a value stream. It also matches the navigation experience in group-level value stream analytics.\n The DevOps Adoption table provides insight into how GitLab has been adopted across your organization with a comparison by group and subgroup. Previously, you could add no more than 200 groups to the table. We understand that larger organizations can have thousands of GitLab groups. You can now use a searchable dropdown to add any subgroup to the table.\n In addition, subgroups removed from the DevOps Adoption table in one group  no longer automatically get removed from the tables of other groups. As a result of the data migration that was done for this fix, you might need to manually re-add some subgroups to your tables the first time that you revisit them.\n Expired SSH keys  added to GitLabare now disabled by default. This helps to make your GitLab instance more secure. Previously, expired SSH keys added to GitLab were enabled by default, and could be used unless explicitly disabled by an administrator.\n This change affects expired SSH keys used on GitLab.com. If your keys are expired or will expire soon, you need to update the key and any services using them. Our  documentation on SSH keys has helpful steps on how to create a new SSH key.\n Self-managed administrators can still  allow the use of expired keys, similar to how theycan  allow use of expired personal access tokens.\n Code Owners are an important piece of the code review process in GitLab. When code owners are clearly identified, contributors can see who should review contributions to a file or repository. The Code Owners feature can also be used to establish a merge request approval process. Now, you can track which teams across your organization are using the Code Owners feature in their development workflow.\n If you would like to drive adoption of Code Owners, sort the DevOps Adoption table by the Code Owners column to find teams that haven\u2019t yet adopted the feature so you can easily identify which teams need help getting started. Alternatively, find teams that have successfully configured Code Owners and get tips and feedback. The DevOps Adoption table is available at  the group level and  the instance level.\n Our  Slack notification service can notify you when a user edits a wiki page. The Slack message gives you helpful context about the edit, including the project, page name, and the commit message. Sometimes, however, the commit message doesn\u2019t give enough context, and you need more information about how the content changed.\n Now you can click  Compare changes in the Slack message to immediately view the diff, saving you time and reducing confusion from ambiguous or incomplete commit messages.\n We\u2019re also releasing GitLab Runner 14.0 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.\n If you want to reuse scripts and configuration between deployment jobs using the  environment: keyword, it can be difficult to exclude certain behaviors based on the type of action the deployment job performs. For example, an  environment: action of  stop might be a job that is stopping a  review_app, and you don\u2019t want your deployment scripts to run.\n Now, the value of  environment: action: is available as the  CI_ENVIRONMENT_ACTION predefined CI/CD variable, making it easier than ever to configure one script that can work for all deployment jobs.\n You can use your project\u2019s Package Registry to publish and install PyPI packages. When you install a PyPI package, you must specify which project the package resides in. This works well if you have a small number of projects. If you have multiple projects nested within a group, you might quickly find yourself adding dozens or even hundreds of different sources.\n For large organizations with many teams, it\u2019s common for a team to publish packages to their project\u2019s Package Registry alongside the source code and pipelines. However, they must also be able to easily install dependencies from other projects within their organization. You can now install packages from your group, so you don\u2019t have to remember which package lives in which project. To do this, use the simple API to specify a package:  GET groups/:id/packages/pypi/files/:sha256/:file_identifier.\n You can also write the output to a file, or return the package descriptor as an HTML file.  Read the docs for more info and let us know how it goes. We hope that this helps to make your team and organization more efficient.\n Automated security scanning is an important part of any secure development process. There are a wide variety of tools and technologies covering the entire SDLC from source code scanning to post-deployment application and infrastructure scanning. While the ultimate goal of any of these tools is to discover both known and potential vulnerabilities, the information coming from any given scanner can vary widely. Efforts to standardize scanning output data do exist but they tend to focus only on one category of scanning technology or even a specific set of tools. This presents a big challenge to security teams who need to aggregate a wide array of scanner findings. Without a consistent way to normalize disparate findings, viewing the unique details for each scanner\u2019s output can be a very apples-and-oranges experience. And if the tool outputs aren\u2019t aggregated, then results are often reviewed in the source tool, leaving the true picture of vulnerability risk fragmented and sitting outside of the rest of the DevOps toolchain.\n The new generalized details structure in our security report schemas can bridge this gap. You can already integrate a wide variety of security scanners into GitLab with minimal effort. Now you can go even further with rich formatting options for finding details. Our new structure makes it easy to map most tool\u2019s existing outputs into our JSON report formats while adding consistent presentation logic automatically. Flexibility without sacrificing the ability to provide rich vulnerability finding data is a primary purpose behind the new structure. Details are provided in an open structure using pre-defined data types. The pre-defined types handle both data validation as well as standardized UI presentation inside GitLab. For instance, we provide types such as Integer, URL, Table, and even GFM ( GitLab Flavored Markdown). This allows granular control over how finding details are presented while keeping the overall experience inside GitLab consistent.\n Previously, to access the user lists, you had to navigate to a separate tab under the Feature Flags page. This design obscured the relationship between feature flags and user lists since user lists are a sub-feature of feature flags.In this release, user lists are now under a subpage of Feature Flags, which improves the workflow and makes their relationship more clear.\n The Incident Service Level Agreement (SLA) Timer, introduced in GitLab 13.5, shows the time remaining until an SLA violation for an incident.However, the user had to refresh the page to update the timer. Starting in GitLab 14.0, the timer updates dynamically every 15 minutes without the need for a page refresh.\n GitLab\u2019s database load balancer enables the distribution of read-only queries across multiple database servers. For GitLab instances with thousands of users, using the load balancer can reduce the load on the primary database and increase responsiveness, thus resulting in faster page load inside GitLab.\n In this release, we moved the load balancer from Premium to Free to allow more users to benefit from this feature.\n Patroni is a solution forPostgreSQL high availability, which also allows theconfiguration of a highly-available PostgreSQL standby cluster on a Geosecondary. This configuration is important when a secondary is used aspart of a disaster recovery strategy, because it allows systemsadministrators to mirror the number of database nodes on the primary andsecondary site. This means that after a failover, no additional database nod\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 05:13:15", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

", "note_en": "A week after Ukrainian police  arrested criminals affiliated with the notorious Cl0p ransomware gang, Cl0p has published a fresh batch of what\u2019s purported to be confidential data stolen in a hack of a previously unknown victim. Ars won\u2019t be identifying the possibly victimized company until there is confirmation that the data and the hack are genuine.\n  If genuine, the dump shows that Cl0p remains intact and able to carry out its nefarious actions despite the arrests. That suggests that the suspects don\u2019t include the core leaders but rather affiliates or others who play a lesser role in the operations. The data purports to be employee records, including verification of employment for loan applications and documents pertaining to workers whose wages have been garnished. I was unable to confirm that the information is genuine and that it was, in fact, taken during a hack on the company, although web searches showed that names listed in the documents matched names of people who work for the company.\n Company representatives didn\u2019t respond to a phone call seeking comment. Cl0p members didn\u2019t respond to emails sent to addresses listed on the group\u2019s site on the dark web.\n   For almost a decade, ransomware has grown from a costly inconvenience into an existential threat that can  shut down hospitals and disrupt  gasoline and  meat supplies. Under pressure from the Biden administration, the US Justice Department is  prioritizing federal ransomware cases. Biden also raised concerns with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the proliferation of ransomware attacks from Russian-speaking groups, such as Cl0p. Last week\u2019s apprehension by Ukrainian police of six people affiliated with Cl0p was seen as a coup in some circles because it marked the first time a national law enforcement group has carried out mass arrests involving a ransomware group. But as Wired reporter Lily Hay Newman  observed, the crackdown is unlikely to ease the ransomware epidemic until Russia itself follows suit.\n    The new leak confirms the limits of current ransomware response. Much of the flimsiness stems from the decentralization of the ransomware economy, which rests on two crucial but independent entities. The first is the group that maintains the ransomware itself and often some of the Internet infrastructure it runs on.\n The second entity is the team of hackers that leases the ransomware and shares any revenue generated with the ransomware maintainers. Often, one group has little or no knowledge of the other, so the shutdown of one has no effect on the other.\n  Compounding the difficulty law enforcement faces, many of the groups reside in Russia or other Eastern European countries that have no extradition treaties with the US.\n Cl0p was first spotted in early 2019. Recent targets have included oil company Shell, international law firm Jones Day, US bank Flagstar, and several US universities including Stanford and the University of California. Often, affiliated hacker exploit vulnerabilities in the Accellion File Transfer Appliance. Cl0p has also been observed operating broad malicious email campaigns to  identify potential corporate victims. In many cases, the campaigns use data stolen from existing victims to better trick customers, partners, or vendors into thinking that a malicious email is benign.\n The ability of Cl0p to post leaked documents following last week\u2019s arrests suggests that the suspects weren\u2019t core members and instead were either affiliates or, as Intel 471  told security reporter Brian Krebs, \u201climited to the cash-out and money laundering side of CLOP\u2019s business only.\u201d And that means the fight against this group and the Internet scourge it\u2019s a part of will continue for the foreseeable future.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 04:36:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8f6f\u4ef6,cl0p,arrests,\u8d4e\u91d1", "title": "\u902e\u6355\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u661f\u671f\uff0cCL0P\u8d4e\u91d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ec4\u8f6c\u50a8\u65b0\u7684\u76d7\u7a83\u6570\u636e ", "title_en": "A week after arrests, Cl0p ransomware group dumps new tranche of stolen data", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/a-week-after-arrests-cl0p-ransomware-group-dumps-new-tranche-of-stolen-data/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8f6f\u4ef6", "cl0p", "arrests", "\u8d4e\u91d1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ef30b61c87b786cb269f68211e00baa4.png", "infoid": 1067552, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6781\u7aef\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u53d8\u9769\u6027\u79d1\u6280\u521b\u4e1a\u7ade\u8d5b\u548c\u660e\u5929\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u7684\u8bba\u575b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u80fd\u591f\u91ca\u653e\u5176\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u53bb\u5e74\uff0c\u7ade\u4e89\u5438\u5f15\u4e8687\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c52\u540d\u51b3\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u5728\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u4ee5\u6765\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc716700\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u3002\n \u4eca\u5e74\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc73700\u4e2a\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u5728XTC\u7ade\u4e89\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u768492\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5e94\u7528\uff1aAgtech\uff0cFood\uff06amp;\u6c34\uff0c\u6e05\u6d01\u6280\u672f\uff06amp; Energy\uff0cEdtech\uff0c\u652f\u6301Tech\uff0cFintech\uff0cHealthtech\u548cMobility\uff06amp;\u667a\u80fd\u57ce\u5e02\u3002\u67e5\u770b\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ade\u4e89\u6c60\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u768480\u540d\u5168\u7403\u51b3\u8d5b\u9009\u624b\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u83b7\u5956\u8005\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u5956\u9879\u83b7\u5956\u8005\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u51b3\u8d5b\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\n  \u52a0\u51657/2 2 2\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u79d1\u6280\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u597d\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u7684\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u578b\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4f7f\u4e16\u754c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e0e\u516c\u53f8\uff0cVCS\uff0c\uff06amp\u7684\u7f51\u7edc;\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u514d\u8d39\u83b7\u5f97\u514d\u8d39\u95e8\u7968\uff01\n   \u4ec0\u4e48\u662f\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u7684\u79d1\u6280\u521b\u65b0\u8f6c\u53d8\u4ea7\u4e1a\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f7b\u5e95\u7684\u4e16\u754c\uff1f\u5982\u4f55\u624d\u80fd\u505a\u751f\u610f\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\uff0c\u6148\u5584\u4e8b\u4e1a\u548c\u521b\u4e1a\u793e\u533a\u5171\u540c\u521b\u9020\u7f8e\u597d\u7684\u660e\u5929\uff1f\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e1a\u9000\u4f0d\u519b\u4eba\u548c\u601d\u60f3\u9886\u5bfc\u4eba\u542c\u5230\u6280\u672f\u5982\u4f55\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5851\u9020\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u6709\u6700\u5927\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u6492\u8c0e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8eXTC\u548c\u8054\u5408\u56fd\u7684\u98df\u54c1\u548c\u519c\u4e1a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u5174\u594b\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u3002\n  \u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u661f\u7403\u672a\u6765\u548c\u6211\u4eec\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u5c06\u662f\u4ee4\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u4e30\u539a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6211\u4eec\u4e16\u754c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u548c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u542c\u5230VCS\u548c\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u8003\u8651Greentech\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u5c06\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\n  \u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u539f\u56e0 -
