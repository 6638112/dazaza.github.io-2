It was August 13, 2020, and Kelley-Chung had been recording Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the city for a couple of months. At this one, in the Adams Morgan neighborhood, he saw an officer push somebody to the ground—and as he rushed over to film it, he says, he was shoved by an officer himself. Quickly he was trapped, or “kettled,” with a small crowd of people.</p><p>当时他发现自己在抗议期间拍摄华盛顿特区的警察时，Kian Kelley-Chung在去年夏天的纪录片和艺术集体的徽标戴着黑色T恤。它是2020年8月13日，Kelley-Chung一直在城市录制黑色生命物质演示了几个月。在这个，在亚当斯摩根街区，他看到一名军官推动了某人 - 他说，他说，他被一名官员自己推动了自己。很快他被困，或“水壶”，带着一小群人。</p><p>  Kelley-Chung says that’s when an officer carrying zip ties said he had to arrest someone, before looking directly at him, grabbing him, and pulling him out of the kettle. Kelley-Chung—whose photos had  been published in the Washington Post—was carrying multiple pieces of video equipment, along with his cell phone.</p><p>  Kelley Chung说，当一名携带拉链绑带时表示他不得不逮捕某人，然后直接看他，抓住他，并将他拉出水壶。 Kelley-Chung  - 他们的照片在华盛顿邮政上发表，携带多件视频设备，以及他的手机。</p><p>  “I yelled out, ‘They are arresting a journalist!’” he says. Others in the crowd echoed his call, but he was shuttled to multiple precincts and spent hours in a small cell with a maskless person. He was released the next day with no charges,  as were most of the 40 other people who were arrested at the same protest, but the police kept his equipment and phone.</p><p>  “我喊道，”他们正在逮捕一名记者！“”他说。人群中的其他人回复了他的电话，但他被关闭到多个区域，并在一个小型牢房里花了一个没有掩盖的人。他第二天被释放，没有收费，这是其他40人在同一抗议活动中被捕的其他人，但警方保留了他的设备和电话。</p><p>  That equipment might still be in police custody, he says, if he hadn’t secured legal assistance. After 10 weeks, with the help of the National Press Photographers Association and First Look Media’s Press Freedom Defense Fund, lawyers finally got Kelley-Chung’s equipment back. Once that was achieved, they sued the police for civil rights violations, with a  complaint that accused the District, the Metropolitan Police, and its acting chief, as well as multiple officers and local officials, of violating his privacy and his rights under the First and Fourth Amendments. They  settled the lawsuit in April: Kelley-Chung was awarded a “substantial” sum.</p><p>  他说，如果他没有获得法律援助，那么设备可能仍然处于警察监护权。 10周后，在国家新闻摄影师协会的帮助下，首先看媒体的新闻自由国防基金，律师终于得到了Kelley-Chung的设备。一旦实现了一旦实现，他们就违反了民权侵犯了警察，并提出了指控该区，大都市警察及其代理主管，以及多名官员和地方官员的投诉，以违反他的隐私及其权利和第四修正案。他们于4月份解决了诉讼：Kelley-Chung被授予了“大量”的总和。</p><p>  Filming the police has become a popular tool of accountability that is simultaneously essential and dangerous. Because of a video filmed by a bystander, we know that Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd, a Black man in his 40s, by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. Without the video that 17-year-old Darnella Frazier took, it’s very possible Chauvin would not have been convicted: when police first described Floyd’s death in a press statement, they  claimed that it had occurred “after [a] medical incident during police interaction.”</p><p>  拍摄警方已成为一个热门的问责制，同时至关重要和危险。由于旁观者拍摄的视频，我们知道明尼阿波利斯警察Derek Chauvin谋杀了乔治·弗洛伊德，这是他40多岁的黑人，跪在脖子上近九分钟。如果没有视频17岁的达尼拉·弗雷泽所采取的，这是一个非常可能的盲文不会被定罪：当警方首先描述了弗洛伊德在新闻发表中的死亡时，他们声称它已经发生了“在警察互动期间的[a]医疗事件后发生了。“</p><p>  People film the police because they know that officers hurt or kill people and lie about it; because it is generally within their First Amendment rights to do so; and because recording an encounter with the cops might make them feel a little bit safer. Police departments cannot simply be taken at their word, and independent video of possible misconduct or violence can sometimes be the only thing with the power to make a false police narrative give way to the truth.</p><p>  人们拍摄警察，因为他们知道官员伤害或杀死人并撒谎;因为它通常在他们的第一次修正权利中;因为录制与警察的遇到可能让他们感到有点更安全。警察部门不能简单地掌握他们的话语，并且可能的不当行为或暴力的独立视频有时可能是唯一一个让虚假警察叙事的权力的事情让位于真理。</p><p>  But as Kelley-Chung found, police officers aren’t simply letting this happen. Even though filming the police is generally legal if it doesn’t interfere with their activities, and even though officers are increasingly carrying cameras themselves, they have developed a range of tactics to prevent their actions from being documented.</p><p>  但正如Kelley-Chung所发现的那样，警察不仅仅是让这种情况发生。尽管拍摄警方通常是合法的，如果它不会干扰他们的活动，甚至虽然官员越来越多地携带相机，但它们已经制定了一系列策略，以防止他们的行动被记录。 </p><p>  And if you want to know how they do it, you can ask a cop watcher.</p><p>如果你想知道他们是怎么做到的，你可以问警察观察者。</p><p>    Hamid Khan, an organizer with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition,  is one of a cohort of people who film the police in Los Angeles. Cop watchers do exactly what the term suggests: observe and document police doing their jobs. A couple of organizations train people in LA to safely film police and other city officials at work, whether it’s to record how protests are monitored or to capture wrongdoing.</p><p>    Hamid Khan是一个止挡LAPD联盟的组织者，是洛杉矶举行警察的人群之一。荷图观察者确实究竟是什么意思：观察和文件警察在做工作。几个组织在劳斯中培养人们在工作中安全电影警察和其他城市官员，无论是如何记录抗议如何监测或捕捉不法行为。</p><p>  That training, Khan says, also includes strategies for handling the tactics that police will use to stop themselves from being filmed. These include “bodying up,” or physically blocking a camera with their bodies, and “threatening, intimidating, harassing the people who are using video cameras.”</p><p>  汗表示，该培训还包括处理警察将用于阻止自己被拍摄的策略的策略。这些包括“身体，”或用身体物理地阻挡相机，“威胁，恐吓，骚扰正在使用摄像机的人”。</p><p>  As long as police are being recorded in public, carrying out their duties, “we believe, and many federal courts have said, that the right to film the police is protected by the First Amendment,” says Emerson Sykes, a staff attorney with the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. That includes multiple decisions from US circuit courts, but not the Supreme Court, which has yet to weigh in. Recently, the 10th Circuit Court split from this consensus,  issuing a decision in late March that declined to affirm the First Amendment right to record police.</p><p>  只要警方正在公开上记录，履行职责“我们相信，许多联邦法院都说，那些员工律师的职员·斯托克斯说ACLU的演讲，隐私和技术项目。这包括来自美国电路法院的多项决定，但不是最高法院，尚未称重。最近，第十次巡回法院拆除了这一共识，在3月下旬发出了决定，拒绝肯定第一次修改警察的修正案。</p><p>  Many states, including California, do stipulate that filming the police can be illegal  when an officer determines that a bystander with a camera is interfering with an investigation. And while the right to take pictures and record video of police officers working in public is pretty uncontroversially established, audio recordings—including those made as part of a video—can be a trickier subject.</p><p>  许多州，包括加利福尼亚州，确实缩短拍摄警察可能是非法的，当一名官员决定一个旁观者与摄像机干扰调查时。虽然拍照的权利和在公众工作的警察录制视频是非常肆无忌惮的建立的，但包括作为视频的一部分制作的录音可以是一个棘手的主题。</p><p>  The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s  guide to recording police notes that in places with one-party-consent wiretap laws—38 US states and the District of Columbia—you can freely record audio. In the 12 states with two-party-consent laws, a plainly visible recording device “puts the officer on notice and thus their consent might be implied,” but police might argue differently.</p><p>  电子前沿基金会录制警方指南指南指南在与一方同意的窃听法律 -  38美国和哥伦比亚特区 - 您可以自由录制音频。在12个缔约国同意法律中，一个明显可见的录音装置“将官员放在通知中，因此可能暗示他们的同意，”但警方可能会争辩。</p><p>    There are lots of reasons why a police officer might not want to be on camera. Some are more understandable than others, says Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In a sensitive encounter, like a domestic violence call, an officer or victim might not want identities revealed by a bystander sharing film on social media. Undercover officers, he says, are also resistant to being filmed and having their identities become public record.</p><p>    警察可能不想在相机上有很多原因。 John Jay刑事司法学院公共政策助理教授Adam Scott Wandt表示，有些人比其他人更加理解。在敏感的遭遇中，像家庭暴力呼叫一样，一名军官或受害者可能不希望在社交媒体上的旁观者共享电影中透露的身份。他说，卧底官员也抵制被拍摄并拥有他们的身份成为公共纪录。 </p><p>  These might be legitimate concerns, but cop watchers say they are also arguments that they’ve seen police officers use in illegitimate situations.</p><p>这些可能是合法的担忧，但警察观察者表示，他们也是他们认为警察在非法情况下使用的论点。</p><p>  Wandt, who was an officer in New York’s Long Beach for four years before cell phones with cameras were as common, says he has experienced this now that he’s a professor and photographer. “I have been asked on one occasion by a police officer not to photograph him,” he says. “He wasn’t doing anything. He was standing on the subway. And the police officer said to me, ‘Never take pictures of the police.’ Obviously the law is not on his side.”</p><p>  Wandt是纽约长滩的一名官员，四年前有4年的相机与相机的手机一样常见，他现在经历过这件事，他是一位教授和摄影师。 “一名警察在一次拍摄他时，我一直被问到，”他说。 “他没有做任何事情。他站在地铁上。警察对我说，“永远不要拍照警察。”显然，法律不在他身边。“</p><p>    Multiple cop watchers say they’ve repeatedly seen police officers cite interference in completely unwarranted situations, often as an implicit threat. They are, says Khan, “almost in a sense, trying to create conditions ... where they can show that, you know, people are interfering with their work, which is not true.”</p><p>    多个警察观察者表示，他们反复看到警察引用完全无名的情况的干扰，往往是一种隐含的威胁。汗说，“几乎在某种意义上，试图创造条件......他们可以表明，你知道，人们干涉他们的工作，这不是真的。”</p><p>  “I’ve been threatened with it,” says Jed Parriott of LA Street Watch, which advocates for the rights of people experiencing homelessness. He’s also had police officers tell him that the unhoused people he’s filming don’t want him there and that his work is exploiting them, when he knows for a fact that his presence at this specific moment is welcome and wanted.</p><p>  “我已经受到了威胁，”拉街观察杰德帕里罗斯说，倡导人们经历无家可归者的权利。他也有警察告诉他，他拍摄的无与伦比的人不希望他在那里，他的工作正在利用他们，当他知道他在这个特定时刻的存在是欢迎和想要的。</p><p>  Street Watch spends time in encampments in the city, documenting the way police and city officials treat their inhabitants and watching for “sweeps,” which are essentially mass evictions. The organization was supporting the encampment at  Echo Park Lake until the city closed the park for repairs and kicked out every one of the couple of hundred people who lived there. In Echo Park, Parriott was filming while park rangers argued with, and then tackled, a young Black resident.</p><p>  街头观察在城市的营地中花了时间，记录警察和城市官员对待他们的居民并观察“扫描”，这是基本上的批量驱逐。该组织正在支持Echo Park Lake的营地，直到城市关闭了公园进行维修，并踢出了那些住在那里的几百人中的每几个人中的每一个。在Echo Park，Parriott在拍摄时拍摄，而Park Rangers辩称，然后解决了一个年轻的黑人居民。</p><p>  “I was really, really worried,” he says. “A very tense moment. But as this was going on, the rangers pinned him to the ground and I was right there, five feet away, filming everything. People screaming all around me, yelling. A sanitation worker put his hand in front of my camera.” Then, he says, an LAPD officer blocked his view with his body. “You just adjust and move,” Parriott says.</p><p>  “我真的很担心，”他说。 “一个非常紧张的时刻。但是，正如这正在发生的那样，游侠把他钉在地上，我就在那里，五英尺远，拍摄一切。人们在我身边尖叫着，大喊。卫生工作者把手放在我的相机前面。“然后，他说，一个LAPD官员用他的身体阻止了他的观点。 “你只是调整和移动，”Parriott说。</p><p>  LAPD officers are trained to handle bystander recordings as a First Amendment right, says Lieutenant Raul Jovel, a spokesperson for the department, and that training is reiterated on a regular basis. When officers go against that training, Jovel says, the department’s response varies from a reminder of the public’s right to film them to a personnel investigation and disciplinary action.</p><p>  LAPD官员培训以处理旁观者录音作为第一个修正案，该部门的发言人劳尔·杰维尔（Dialute）表示，该培训是定期重申的。 Jovel说，当官员反对那种培训时，该部门的回应因提醒公众对人员调查和纪律处分的提醒而异。 </p><p>   Officers can be particularly resistant to allowing someone with the right to film to continue to do so, he says, when they believe the person with a camera is also yelling at the police. “Sometimes as an officer, you’re like, ‘Wait a minute. I have the right to speak for myself,” Jovel says. “What we have to remind officers is,: ‘I hate to tell you this, but you are a public servant, and this is part of the job.’”</p><p>他说，当他们相信镜头相信，允许有权允许电影有权继续这样做的人来说，允许有人抵制。 “有时作为一名官员，你就像，”等一下。 Jovel说，我有权为自己说话。 “我们要提醒人员是什么：”我讨厌告诉你这个，但你是公务员，这是工作的一部分。“</p><p>  The  Los Angeles Park Ranger’s manual includes a section on recordings made by members of the public, where it recognizes this act as a right, advising that rangers “will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with such lawful recordings.”</p><p>  洛杉矶公园Ranger的手册包括一节关于公众成员制造的录音部分，在那里承认这项行为是正确的，建议游侠“不会禁止或故意干扰如此合法的录音”。</p><p>  Sykes notes another situation that can be tough for those recording the police to navigate: when an officer seeks to view a photo or asks you to delete it, with the implicit or explicit suggestion that you’ll go free if you comply. It is, Sykes says, unlawful for an officer to do this. A warrant is generally required to view your photos or take them as evidence. “Even if they have a warrant from a judge, and even if you’re arrested, they still don’t have the right to delete the photos,” he adds.</p><p>  赛克斯注意到录制警察导航的人可能是艰难的一种情况：当一名官员寻求查看照片或要求您删除它时，如果您遵守，您将免费无意义或明确的建议。它是，赛克斯说，对一名官员来说是非法的。一般需要一个令需要查看照片或将其作为证据。 “即使他们有一个法官的权证，即使你被捕，他们仍然没有权利删除照片，”他补充道。</p><p>  Not everyone who might capture police misconduct will have been trained in advance. Parriott and other activists regularly distribute flyers to inform people of their right to film the police, because police will tell people they don’t have that right when in fact they do.</p><p>  不是每个可能捕获警察不当行为的人都会提前培训。 Parriott和其他活动家定期分发传单，以告知人们对警方电影的权利，因为警方会告诉人们在事实上，他们没有那样的权利。</p><p>    But even if it’s legal, it’s not always safe. In August of last year,  a father who stepped out of his own car to film across the street from where his son was being arrested was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed. Kelley-Chung, the documentarian, says he first experienced the sense of danger a couple of years ago when he and a friend were pulled over for a minor reason on their way back to college. He recalls that the officer pulled his friend out of the car, angry that they had not fully opened the window. He wanted to film the rest of the encounter but was confronted by another officer when he reached into his pocket to retrieve his phone.</p><p>    但即使它是合法的，它并不总是安全的。去年八月，一名父亲从他的儿子被捕的街道上踩到街对面的父亲是辣椒喷涂和手铐。纪录片涌涌钟表示，当他和一位朋友在回到大学的路上被拉结束时，他首先经历了几年前的危险感。他回顾说，军官把他的朋友拉出车里，生气，因为他们没有完全打开窗户。当他伸入口袋里来回手机时，他想拍摄剩下的遭遇但是被另一名官员面对。</p><p>  Regardless of what an individual officer intends, Wandt says, many “just don’t want things on camera in case things go sideways,” and they especially don’t want to be in a viral video if that happens, That prospect is likely driving a lot of officers to try to interfere illegitimately with bystander recordings. In some cases, they are preemptively trying to cover for a colleague who is prone to violence.  “There are police officers who consider themselves warriors, who will use an extreme amount of force when force is required,” Wandt says. “Those officers obviously don’t want their face or actions caught on camera.”</p><p>  无论个人官员是否打算，Wandt说，许多“只是不希望在侧面的情况下的镜头上的东西”，如果发生这种情况，他们特别不想在病毒视频中，那么前景可能会驾驶很多人都要尝试与旁观者录音界限间隔。在某些情况下，他们抢先地试图掩盖倾向于暴力的同事。 “有警察认为自己是战士，当需要武力时，他们将使用极度的力量，”Wandt说。 “这些官员显然不希望他们的脸或行动捕获相机。”</p><p>  Staying safer while recording police activity requires different tactics depending on the situation. Bystanders witnessing police violence in a public space should keep a distance, Kelley-Chung advises—that way you can’t be accused of being a participant. If you get pulled over? Get a passenger to start filming right away, before the officer approaches your window (reaching into your pocket for your phone can also be extremely dangerous, particularly for people of color). If it’s legal in your area, a dash cam might be an alternative, Wandt suggests.</p><p>  录制警察活动时保持更安全，根据情况需要不同的策略。在公共空间中目睹警察暴力的旁观者应该保持远程，钟涌建议 - 这种方式你不能被指控成为参与者。如果你被拉了？在军官接近窗户之前，让乘客开始拍摄（为您的手机到达您的电话，也可能非常危险，特别是对于颜色的人）。 Wandt建议，如果您所在地区的合法，Dash Cam可能是另一种选择。 </p><p>  As much as a cell-phone camera offers protection, Wandt says, it’s also important to keep in mind that “once somebody takes out a camera and starts filming an arrest, it absolutely changes the nature of the situation for everybody, from the victim to the suspect to the police officer.”</p><p>Wandt说，尽可能多的手机相机提供保护，请记住，“曾经有人拿出相机并开始拍摄逮捕，这也很重要，这绝对改变了每个人的情况，从受害者到受害者嫌疑人向警察。“</p><p>  “There’s the law, there’s the Constitution, and then there’s what you do when you’re face to face with the police,” says Sykes, the ACLU attorney. Figuring out exactly how much to push back against a police officer who is giving an unlawful order is “tough,” he says, especially in certain circumstances—for example, at a protest.</p><p>  “有法律，有宪法，然后在与警方面对面的时候，你会做什么，”赛克斯·斯科斯·斯科斯·院长。他准确地弄清了一名给予非法秩序的警察是“艰难的”，他说，特别是在某些情况下 - 例如，在抗议。</p><p>  “There is a special flavor of risk when you’re protesting the police and the police are armed and standing feet away from you,” Sykes says.</p><p>  “当你抗议警察时，有一种特殊的风险风险，警察武装和扶手远离你，”赛克斯说。</p><p>  On-the-ground experience is really the only way to read whether a situation at a protest is safe. But one thing Kelley-Chung has observed is that the presence of a camera filming an officer can protect others from misconduct.</p><p>  地面经验真的是阅读抗议情况是否安全的唯一途径。但是Kelley-Chung观察到的是，拍摄官员的相机的存在可以保护他人免受不端行为。</p><p>  “When you see people in a verbal dispute with police, get as close as possible,” he says. “That camera can be more protection than a tactical vest.”</p><p>  “当你看到人们用警察口头争议时，尽可能接近，”他说。 “该相机可以比战术背心更多的保护。”</p><p>  In any situation, everyone we spoke to had the same caveats: Do not interfere in police operations. Comply when police tell you that you need to move, but you do not have to stop filming from a new location, even if they claim you must, as long as you are recording an officer in a public space carrying out their duties.</p><p>  在任何情况下，我们所说的每个人都有相同的警告：不要干涉警察行动。当警方告诉你你需要移动时遵守，但你不必停止从一个新的位置拍摄时，即使他们声称你必须录制一名官员在履行职责的公共场所。</p><p>  Cop watchers generally advise others to collect identifying information on police at the scene, and to note the time and location. You could ask for a badge number; Parriott says most officers actually just carry business cards.</p><p>  警察观察者通常建议他人在现场的警察中收集识别信息，并注意到时间和地点。你可以要求徽章数量; Parriott表示，大多数官员实际上只是携带名片。 </p><p>    No single video is going to change how police act, and  experts argue that even large numbers of videos cannot change the culture of many police departments. On the contrary, police have found ways to use video, especially body camera footage, to reinforce and control their own narrative in cases of possible violence or misconduct.</p><p>没有单一视频会改变警察法，专家们认为，即使大量的视频也无法改变许多警察部门的文化。相反，警方已经找到了使用视频，尤其是身体相机镜头的方法，在可能的暴力或不当行为的情况下加强和控制自己的叙述。</p><p>  People like to think that video is simply a neutral tool for capturing information, says Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor of communications at Syracuse University—but it’s not, and how it’s released, and in what context, needs additional vetting.</p><p>  人们喜欢认为视频只是捕获信息的中立工具，锡拉库茨大学助理教授詹妮弗Grygiel说 - 但它没有，它是如何发布的，并且在哪些背景下需要额外的审查。</p><p>  “They get to set the narrative when it’s released, which controls the initial public sentiment around it and opinion. They also push it out on their social media, and their accounts are just like everybody else’s in that they grow their audience. So then they get people following them there because they’re the first to publish information,” Grygiel says. Their own research deals with how police departments use social media to bypass fact-checking by journalists: it started after they noticed how police were pushing out mugshots on local Facebook pages. “People were going in there, like an old public square, and harassing people who had been arrested,” Grygiel says.</p><p>  “当它发布时，他们会设置叙述，它控制着它的初始公众情绪和意见。他们还在他们的社交媒体上推出，他们的账户就像其他人一样，他们成长了他们的观众。所以，他们让人们跟随他们，因为他们是第一个发布信息的人，“格里戈尔说。他们自己的研究涉及警察部门如何使用社交媒体来绕过记者留言：它在注意到警察如何在当地的Facebook页面上推出Mugshots。 “人们正在那里，就像一场老公共广场，骚扰被捕的人，”格里格尔说。</p><p>  As police become better at producing their own media, finding an audience outside of journalism, and making the most of accountability measures like body cameras, Grygiel argues, independent documentation of police officers working in public can serve as a counter to that messaging. Sometimes, as was in the case with the Floyd murder, that documentation happens spontaneously, and often amid great distress, when clear instances of police violence or misconduct are unfolding in real time.</p><p>  由于警方在制作自己的媒体时，在新闻中寻找一个观众，并使大多数责任措施如身体相机，Grygiel认为，在公共场合工作的警察独立文件可以作为对该消息的反击。有时，正如弗洛伊德谋杀案一样，那些文件发生自发，而且往往在很大的痛苦中，当明确的警察暴力或不当行为实时展开时。</p><p>  But the capacity for police and police-affiliated organizations to spread misinformation was obvious during the protests in the summer of 2020, when  police departments repeatedly promoted inaccurate information. Some of that misinformation went viral, aided by sympathetic media coverage and the right-wing internet, hell-bent on reinforcing the belief that anti-racism protests are merely a conduit for a violent war on cops.</p><p>  但在2020年夏天的抗议活动期间，当警察局反复推动不准确的信息时，警察和警察附属组织在抗议活动中发布错误信息的能力是显而易见的。其中一些错误信息是病毒，通过同情媒体覆盖范围和右翼互联网，加强信仰，即反种族主义抗议仅仅是关于警察剧烈战争的渠道。</p><p>  Police unions promoted an alarming claim that Shake Shack employees had “intentionally poisoned” a group of police officers in Manhattan. The story had been dispelled by the next morning: NYPD investigators said the foul-tasting substance in the three officers’ milkshakes wasn’t “bleach,” as the unions speculated, and it wasn’t added to the drinks on purpose. Although the Police Benevolent Association and the Detectives’ Endowment Association both eventually deleted their tweets making the accusation, they had tens of thousands of retweets, and triggered a wave of credulous coverage in conservative and mainstream press. Media write-ups about the tweets got tens of thousands of shares on Facebook and continued to circulate even after the story was debunked.</p><p>  警察工会促进了一个令人震惊的声称，摇动棚员工“故意毒害”一群在曼哈顿的警察。第二天天上午，这个故事已经消失：NYPD调查人员表示，三名官员的奶昔的臭味物质并不“漂白”，因为工会推测，并没有根据饮料添加到饮料中。虽然警察仁慈协会和侦探禀赋协会最终删除了他们的推文，但他们有成千上万的转推，并引发了保守和主流新闻中的一系列轻信覆盖。关于Tweets的媒体写作在Facebook上获得了成千上万的股票，即使在故事被揭穿后也继续分发。</p><p>  And this was just one example. Last summer, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea  reposted a video of police removing bins of bricks from a South Brooklyn sidewalk, claiming they were the work of “organized looters” offering protesters materials to use for violence, despite  little evidence that this was actually true. The NYPD also circulated an alert to officers with images of coffee cups filled with concrete, which closely resemble concrete samples  used on construction sites. In Columbus, Ohio, the police tweeted out a photo of a colorful bus that they said was  supplying dangerous equipment to “rioters,” fueling already rampant national rumors of “antifa buses” descending on cities. In fact, the bus belonged to a group of circus performers,  who said the equipment police cited as riot supplies included juggling clubs and kitchen utensils.</p><p>  这只是一个例子。去年夏天，NYPD专员Dermot Shea重新转发了一辆警察从南布鲁克林人行道上移除砖块的视频，声称他们是“有组织的抢夺者”的工作，提供抗议者材料用于暴力，尽管这实际上是真实的。 NYPD还向官员传播了一个警报，其中咖啡杯的图像充满了混凝土，这与建筑工地使用的混凝土样品非常类似于混凝土样品。在俄亥俄州的哥伦布，警方推出了一张五颜六色的公交车照片，他们说他们正在向“暴徒”提供危险的设备，因为已经猖獗的国家传闻的“防火公共汽车”的城市下降。事实上，公共汽车属于一群马戏团表演者，他表示，被引用作为骚乱用品的设备包括杂耍俱乐部和厨房用具。 </p><p>  In short, police still lie despite being watched more closely than ever. There are hundreds of videos of police misconduct at the summer protests alone, some from the body cams introduced in reforms meant to hold them more accountable. But Kelley-Chung thinks there’s only so much difference any one video can make.</p><p>简而言之，仍然仍然看起来比以往更紧密地看待。夏季抗议的警察不当行为中有数百个视频，其中一些来自改革引入的身体凸轮意味着使他们更加负责。但Kelley-Chung认为只有这么多的差异，任何一个视频都可以制作。</p><p>  “I’ve seen people filming officers with their cameras out in the moment and then get tackled by police,” he says. “They know they’re on camera … and yet they still continue to abuse.”</p><p>  “我看到人们在此时用相机拍摄了官员，然后被警察解决了，”他说。 “他们知道他们在相机......但他们仍然继续虐待。”</p><p>  And even after he reached his settlement with the DC police, there’s an aspect of that day he can’t stop thinking about. Kelley-Chung is Black, and his filming partner, Andrew Jasiura, is white. They were both dressed in the same T-shirt, carrying the same sort of camera equipment. Officers saw Jasiura too: “They pulled him out so they could talk to him,” says Kelley-Chung.</p><p>  即使在他与DC警方达成了他的解决方案之后，那天也有一个方面，他无法停止思考。 Kelley-Chung是Black，他的拍摄合作伙伴，Andrew Jasiura是白色的。他们都穿着同一个T恤，携带同样的相机设备。官员也看到了jasiura：“他们把他拉出来，所以他们可以和他谈谈，”Kelley-Chung说。</p><p>  That’s when Jasiura told police that his partner was a journalist too. They continued to arrest him anyway.</p><p>  那是贾西拉告诉警方，他的伴侣也是一名记者。他们继续逮捕他。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/30/1024325/police-video-filming-prevention-tactics/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/30/1024325/police-video-filming-prevention-tactics/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/police/">#police</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/警察/">#警察</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
