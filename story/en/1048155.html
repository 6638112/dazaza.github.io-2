An object up to ten times the mass of Earth is pulling others towards it. Is it a planet, or something else?</p><p>在我们太阳系的外缘发生了奇怪的事情。高达地球质量十倍的物体正在将其他物体拉向地球。是行星还是其他？</p><p> The 19th-Century travel writer and businessman – fabulously wealthy, perennially moustachioed, and often found in crisp three-piece suits – had read a book on Mars, and on this basis, decided to become an astronomer. Over the coming decades, he made a number of wild claims.</p><p> 这位19世纪的旅行作家和商人-富有，常年呆板，经常在三件套简洁的西服中找到他们-已经读过一本关于火星的书，并在此基础上决定成为一名天文学家。在接下来的几十年中，他提出了许多疯狂的主张。</p><p> First up, he was convinced of the existence of Martians, and thought he had found them (he hadn&#39;t). Others had documented strange lines traversing the planet, and Lowell suggested that these were canals, built as the last attempt of a dying civilisation to tap water from the polar ice caps. He used his fortune to build an entire observatory, just to get a better look. It  turned out they were an optical illusion, created by the mountains and craters on Mars when viewed through low quality telescopes.</p><p> 首先，他深信火星人的存在，并以为自己找到了火星人（他还没有）。其他人记录了穿越地球的奇异线，洛厄尔认为这是运河，是濒死文明从极地冰盖取水的最后尝试。他用自己的财产建造了整个天文台，只是为了使外观更好。原来，这是一种错觉，是由低质量望远镜观察时由火星上的山脉和陨石坑造成的。</p><p> Lowell also believed that the planet Venus had spokes – seen in his notes as spidery lines emanating from its centre (it doesn&#39;t). Though his assistants tried to find them, it seemed that only he could see this unexpected detail. It&#39;s now assumed that they were  shadows cast from the irises in his own eyes, as he looked through his telescope.</p><p> 洛厄尔还相信金星在说话-从他的笔记中可以看出是从其中心发出的蜘蛛状线（没有）。尽管他的助手们试图找到他们，但似乎只有他能看到这个意想不到的细节。现在，当他通过望远镜看时，这就是他眼中虹膜所投射的阴影。</p><p> But most of all, Lowell was determined to find the ninth planet in our solar system – a hypothetical &#34;planet X&#34;, which at the time was thought to be responsible for the rogue orbits of the furthest-known planets from the Sun, the cool-blue ice giants Uranus and Neptune. Though he never set eyes on this phantom behemoth, the quest consumed the last decade of his life – and after several nervous breakdowns, he died at the age of 61.</p><p> 但最重要的是，洛厄尔决心在我们的太阳系中找到第九颗行星-假想的“行星X”，当时被认为是造成距地球最遥远的行星的无赖轨道的原因。太阳，蓝色的冷冰巨星天王星和海王星。尽管他从没看过这个幻影般的庞然大物，但他的追求却消耗了他生命的最后十年-在经历了几次神经衰弱之后，他去世了，享年61岁。</p><p> Little did he know, the search would still be going – with a few tweaks – in 2021.</p><p> 他几乎不知道，只要稍作调整，搜索在2021年仍将继续。</p><p>  Undeterred by his own mortality, Lowell left a million dollars to the cause of finding planet X in his will. So, after a brief interlude involving a legal battle with his widow, Constance Lowell, his observatory kept looking.</p><p>  洛厄尔并没有因此而丧生，他将一百万美元捐给了在自己的遗愿中寻找X行星的事业。因此，经过短暂的插曲，与寡妇康斯坦斯·洛厄尔（Constance Lowell）进行了法律斗争，他的天文台一直在寻找。 </p><p> Just 14 years later, on 18 February 1930, a young astronomer was looking at two photos of star-studded skies, when he noticed a speck amongst them. It was a tiny world. He had found Pluto – for a while considered the elusive planet X.</p><p>仅仅14年之后，即1930年2月18日，一位年轻的天文学家正看着两颗星云密布的天空，当时他注意到其中有斑点。那是一个很小的世界。他发现了冥王星–有一度被认为是难以捉摸的X行星。</p><p>  Alas, it was not to be. Soon scientists realised that this could not be what Lowell was looking for – it was not nearly large enough to pull Neptune and Uranus away from their rightful positions. Pluto was just an accidental interloper, which happened to be in the area.</p><p>  las，不是。不久，科学家意识到这不是洛厄尔所寻找的东西-它的大小还不足以将海王星和天王星拉离其应有的位置。冥王星只是一个偶然的闯入者，恰好在该地区。</p><p> The final blow to planet X came in 1989, when the Voyager 2 spacecraft swept by Neptune and revealed that it&#39;s fractionally lighter than anyone had originally thought. With this in mind, eventually a Nasa scientist calculated that the orbits of the outer planets  had made sense all along. Lowell had instigated a search that had had never been needed.</p><p> 对X行星的最后一击发生在1989年，当时旅行者2号飞船被海王星横扫，并发现它比任何人最初想象的都要轻一些。考虑到这一点，最终美国国家航空航天局的一位科学家计算出外行星的轨道一直以来都是有意义的。洛厄尔（Lowell）发起了一项从未需要的搜索。</p><p> But just as the concept of a hidden planet was killed off, the groundwork was laid for its resurrection.</p><p> 但是，就像一个隐藏星球的概念被杀死一样，它的复活也奠定了基础。</p><p>   The Voyager mission led to another major discovery – the existence of the Kuiper Belt. This cosmic donut of frozen objects, extending just beyond the orbit of Neptune, is one of the largest features in the solar system. It&#39;s so vast, it&#39;s thought to contain hundreds of thousands of objects  larger than 100km (62 miles) across, as well as up to a trillion comets.</p><p>   航海家号的任务带来了另一个重大发现-柯伊伯带的存在。冷冻物体的宇宙甜甜圈延伸到海王星的轨道之外，是太阳系最大的特征之一。它是如此之大，以为其中包含成千上万个大于100公里（62英里）的物体以及多达一万亿颗彗星。</p><p> Soon scientists realised that Pluto was unlikely to be the only large object in the outer reaches of the solar system – and began to question whether it was actually a planet at all. Then they found &#34;Sedna&#34; (around 40% of the size of Pluto), &#34;Quaoar&#34; (around half the size of Pluto), and &#34;Eris&#34; (almost the same size as Pluto). It became clear that astronomers needed a new definition.</p><p> 不久，科学家意识到冥王星不可能是太阳系外围的唯一大物体，并开始质疑它是否真的是行星。然后他们发现了＆＃34; Sedna＆＃34; （约为冥王星大小的40％），＆＃34; Quaoar＆＃34; （约为冥王星的一半）和＆＃34; Eris＆＃34; （几乎与冥王星相同）。显然，天文学家需要一个新的定义。</p><p>  In 2006, the International Astronomical Union voted to demote Pluto&#39;s status to a &#34;dwarf planet&#34;, along with the newcomers. Mike Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology – Caltech – who led the team that identified Eris, is self-styled as the &#34;man who killed Pluto&#34; to this day. The ninth planet was no more.</p><p>  2006年，国际天文学联合会投票通过，将冥王星的身份与新来者一道降级为“矮行星”。加州理工学院（Caltech）加州理工学院行星天文学教授麦克·布朗（Mike Brown）自称是杀死冥王星的“男人”。到今天。第九颗行星不复存在。 </p><p>  At the same time, the discovery of these objects uncovered a major new lead in the search for a hidden planet.</p><p>同时，这些物体的发现揭示了寻找隐藏星球的重大新线索。</p><p> It turns out that Sedna is not moving in the way everyone expected – tracing elliptical rings around the Sun, from within the Kuiper Belt. Instead, this dwarf planet takes a bizarre and unexpected path, swinging from just 76 Earth-Sun distances (roughly 11 billion k/7 billion miles) from the centre of our solar system to more than 900 (roughly 135 billion km/84 billion miles). Its orbit is so meandering, it takes 11,000 years to complete – the last time Sedna was at its current position, humans had only just invented farming.</p><p> 事实证明，塞德纳（Sedna）并没有像大家所期望的那样运动-从柯伊伯带（Kuiper Belt）内追踪太阳周围的椭圆环。取而代之的是，这颗矮行星走出了一条奇异而出乎意料的路，从我们太阳系中心的76个地球-太阳距离（约110亿千卡/ 70亿英里）摆动到900多个（约1,350亿公里/ 840亿英里） ）。它的轨道如此曲折，需要11,000年才能完成–塞德纳（Sedna）上一次担任现任职务时，人类才刚刚发明了农业。</p><p>  Enter a hypothetical new addition to our solar system – but not as it was thought of before. In 2016, the same Mike Brown who had slain Pluto, together with his colleague Konstantin Batygin – also a professor of planetary science at Caltech – co-authored a  paper proposing a massive planet, between five and 10 times the size of Earth.</p><p>  为我们的太阳系输入一个假想的新成员-但不是以前想象的那样。 2016年，被杀害冥王星的麦克·布朗与他的同事康斯坦丁·巴蒂金（Konstantin Batygin）（也是加州理工学院的行星科学教授）共同撰写了一篇论文，提出了一颗大行星，其大小是地球的五到十倍。</p><p> Their idea came from the observation that Sedna was not the only object out of place. It was  joined by six others, and all of them are being pulled in the same direction. There are also other clues, such as the fact that each is tilted on its axis in exactly the same direction. The pair calculated that the probability of all six objects being pulled in the exact same direction, with the same tilt by chance was just 0.007%.</p><p> 他们的想法来自于观察到塞德纳不是唯一不合时宜的对象。其他六个人加入了会议，所有人都朝着同一个方向被拉。还有其他线索，例如每个线索在其轴上沿完全相同的方向倾斜的事实。该对计算得出，所有六个物体在完全相同的方向上被拉动且具有相同的倾斜度的概率仅为0.007％。</p><p> &#34;We thought &#39;this is quite interesting – how can this be?&#39;&#34; says Batygin. &#34;It was quite remarkable because such a clustering, if left alone for a sufficiently long period of time, would disperse, just due to interaction with the gravity of the planets.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我们认为这很有趣-怎么可能？＆＃39;巴廷金说。 ＆＃34;之所以引人注目，是因为如果仅仅长时间与行星的引力相互作用，这种星团就会散开。</p><p> Instead, they proposed that Planet Nine had left its ghostly imprint in the outer reaches of our solar system, distorting the orbits of the objects around it with its gravitational pull. Several years on, and the number of objects that fit the eccentric orbital pattern and tilt has continued to increase, &#34;We now have around 19 overall,&#34; says Batygin.</p><p> 相反，他们提出，第九行星在我们的太阳系的外围留下了幽灵般的烙印，通过它的引力扭曲了它周围物体的轨道。几年后，适合偏心轨道模式和倾斜度的物体数量不断增加，我们现在总共有大约19个物体，巴廷金说。</p><p> Though no one has yet seen the hypothetical planet, it&#39;s possible to infer a surprising amount about it. As with the other objects beyond the Kuiper Belt, the orbit of the new Planet Nine would be so distorted that its farthest reach is expected to be twice as far away as its nearest – around  600 times the distance from the Sun to Earth (90 billion km/56 billion miles), vs 300 (45 billion km/28 billion miles). Scientists have also hazarded a guess at its aesthetic – icy, with a solid core,  like Uranus or Neptune.</p><p> 尽管还没有人看到这个假想的星球，但有可能推断出令人惊讶的数量。就像柯伊伯带以外的其他天体一样，新的第九行星的轨道也将如此扭曲，以至于其最远距离的距离预计是其最远距离的两倍-大约是太阳到地球距离的600倍（900亿） km / 560亿英里）与300（450亿公里/ 280亿英里）相比。科学家们也对它的美感进行了猜测–冰冷，具有坚固的核心，如天王星或海王星。 </p><p> Then there&#39;s the slippery question of where Planet Nine might have come from in the first place. So far, there are three main ideas. One is that it formed where it currently hides, which Batygin dismisses as relatively unlikely because this would require the early solar system to have stretched out as far as its distant refuge.</p><p>然后是一个棘手的问题，首先是第九行星可能来自哪里。到目前为止，主要有三个想法。其中之一是它形成于目前隐藏的地方，Batygin认为这种可能性相对较小，因为这将需要早期的太阳系伸展到远处的避难所。</p><p> There&#39;s also the intriguing suggestion that the ninth planet is actually an alien imposter, an object that was  stolen from another star long ago when the Sun was still in the stellar cluster in which it was born. &#34;The problem with such a story is that you&#39;re just as likely to then lose the planet upon the next encounter,&#34; says Batygin. &#34;So, statistically, that model runs into trouble.&#34;</p><p> 还有一个引人入胜的建议，即第九颗行星实际上是外星人的冒名顶替者，这是很久以前太阳仍在其诞生的恒星团中从另一颗恒星被盗的物体。 ＆＃34;这样的故事的问题在于，您下次再相遇时就很可能失去星球，＆＃34;巴廷金说。 ＆＃34;因此，从统计学上讲，该模型遇到了麻烦。</p><p>  Then there&#39;s Batygin&#39;s personal favourite, which he admits is also &#34;not a complete slam dunk&#34;. In this scenario, the planet formed much closer to the Sun, at a time when the solar system was in its early stages and the planets were just beginning to coagulate out of the surrounding gas and dust. &#34;It kind of hung around the giant planet formation region, before being scattered out by Jupiter or Saturn, and subsequently had its orbit modified by passing stars,&#34; he says.</p><p>  然后，他承认巴蒂金个人最喜欢的东西也不是完全的灌篮。在这种情况下，当太阳系处于早期阶段并且行星刚刚开始从周围的气体和尘埃中凝结时，行星形成的位置更靠近太阳。 ＆＃34;悬挂在巨大的行星形成区域周围，然后被木星或土星驱散，随后通过恒星改变其轨道，他说。</p><p>  Of course, all this begs an obvious question – if Planet Nine is really there, why has no one seen it?</p><p>  当然，所有这些都引出了一个显而易见的问题–如果“九号星球”确实存在，为什么没人见过？</p><p> &#34;I didn&#39;t have a particularly strong appreciation for just how difficult would be to find Planet Nine until I started looking together with Mike using telescopes,&#34; says Batygin. &#34;The reason it&#39;s such a tough search is because most astronomical surveys are not looking for a single thing.&#34;</p><p> 直到我开始与麦克一起使用望远镜一起寻找时，我才对找到第九号行星有多么困难没有特别的感激之情。巴廷金说。之所以进行如此艰难的搜索，是因为大多数天文学调查都不是在寻找任何东西。</p><p> For example, astronomers would normally be looking for a class of objects, such as a particular kind of planet. Even if they&#39;re rare, if you survey a wide enough expanse of space, you&#39;re likely to find something. But hunting down a specific object such as Planet Nine is a whole different exercise. &#34;There&#39;s only one tiny portion of the sky that has it,&#34; says Batygin, who explains that another factor is the slightly more prosaic challenge of booking time slots to use the right kind of telescope.</p><p> 例如，天文学家通常会寻找一类物体，例如特定种类的行星。即使它们很少见，但如果您调查了足够广阔的空间，您很可能会找到一些东西。但是寻找一个特定的物体，例如第九行星，是完全不同的练习。天空只有一小部分拥有它，巴蒂金说，他解释说，另一个因素是预订时隙以使用正确类型的望远镜要稍微平淡一些。</p><p> &#34;Really, at the moment the only game in town for finding Planet Nine is the Subaru Telescope,&#34; says Batygin. This 8.2m behemoth – located at the summit of a dormant volcano, Maunakea, in Hawaii – is capable of capturing even the weak light of distant celestial objects. This is ideal, because the shadowy planet would be so far away, it&#39;s unlikely to be reflecting much light from the Sun.</p><p> 确实，目前镇上唯一可以找到第九号星球的游戏是斯巴鲁望远镜，＆＃34;巴廷金说。这座8.2m的庞然大物位于休眠的火山山顶上，位于夏威夷的毛努阿卡山，甚至可以捕捉遥远天体的微弱光线。这是理想的，因为阴影行星太远了，它不太可能反射来自太阳的大量光。 </p><p> &#34;We have only one machine that we can use, and we get maybe three nights on it a year,&#34; says Batygin, who was fresh from a three-night run on the telescope the previous week. &#34;The good news is that the Vera Rubin telescope is coming online within the next couple of years, and they are going to probably find it.&#34; This next-generation telescope, currently under construction in Chile, will be scanning the sky systematically – photographing the entire available view – every few nights, to survey its contents.</p><p>＆＃34;我们只能使用一台机器，一年可能要花上三个晚上，＆＃34;巴蒂金（Batygin）说，他是前一周在望远镜上进行了三晚奔跑的新鲜人。 ＆＃34;好消息是，维拉·鲁宾（Vera Rubin）望远镜将在未来几年内投入使用，他们很可能会找到它。这款目前正在智利建造的下一代望远镜将每隔几个晚上进行系统扫描天空-拍摄整个可用视野，以调查其内容。</p><p>  However, there is one almost outrageously peculiar scenario in which the planet will never be found this way – it might not be a planet after all, but a black hole.</p><p>  但是，有一种几乎令人难以置信的奇特的场景，在这种情况下永远不会这样找到行星-毕竟它可能不是行星，而是黑洞。</p><p>  &#34;All of the evidence for there being an object is gravitational,&#34; says James Unwin, professor of physics at the University of Illinois, Chicago, who first suggested the idea, along with Jakub Scholtz, a postdoctoral researcher from the University of Turin. While we&#39;re most familiar with the idea that planets exert a powerful gravitational pull, &#34;there are other things that can generate it, which are more exotic&#34;, says Unwin.</p><p>  ＆＃34;关于存在物体的所有证据都是万有引力，＆＃34;芝加哥伊利诺伊大学物理学教授詹姆士·温温（James Unwin）说，他首先提出了这个想法，他是都灵大学的博士后研究员雅库布·舒尔茨（Jakub Scholtz）。 Unwin表示，虽然我们最熟悉行星会施加强大的引力的想法，但还有其他一些因素可以产生这种引力。</p><p> Some plausible replacements for planet nine include a small ball of ultra-concentrated dark matter, or a primordial black hole. As black holes are among the most dense objects in the Universe, Unwin explains that it&#39;s entirely possible the latter could be warping the orbits of distant objects in the outer solar system.</p><p> 九号行星的一些合理替代品包括一个超浓缩暗物质小球或一个原始黑洞。由于黑洞是宇宙中最稠密的天体之一，安温解释说，后者完全有可能扭曲外太阳系中遥远天体的轨道。</p><p> The black holes we’re most familiar with tend to include “stellar” black holes, which have a mass that’s at least three times that of our own Sun, and “supermassive” black holes, which are millions or billions of times our Sun’s mass, While the former are born out of dying stars collapsing in on themselves, the latter are more mysterious – possibly beginning as colossal stars which implode, then gradually accumulate more and more mass by devouring everything in their surroundings, including other black holes.</p><p> 我们最熟悉的黑洞往往包括“恒星”黑洞，其质量至少是我们自身太阳质量的三倍；以及“超大质量”黑洞，其质量是太阳质量的数百万或数十亿倍，虽然前者是由垂死的恒星自身坍缩而生，但后者则更神秘-可能始于巨大的恒星爆炸，然后吞噬周围的一切物质，包括其他黑洞，逐渐积累越来越多的质量。</p><p> Primordial black holes are different. They have never been observed, but are thought to originate in the hot energy-and-matter haze that formed in the first second of the Big Bang. In this uneven environment, some parts of the Universe may have become so dense, they were compressed into tiny pockets with the mass of planets.</p><p> 原始的黑洞是不同的。它们从未被观察到，但被认为起源于大爆炸第一秒钟形成的热能和物质雾霾。在这种不平坦的环境中，宇宙的某些部分可能变得如此密集，它们被压缩成带有行星质量的微小口袋。</p><p> Unwin points out that there is zero probability of the black hole being formed from a star, since they keep their potent gravitational pull – it’s just concentrated. Even the smallest stellar blackholes have masses three times that of our Sun, so it would be like having at least three extra Suns pulling at the planets in our solar system. In short, we would definitely have noticed.</p><p> Unwin指出，由于恒星保持着强大的引力，所以恒星形成黑洞的可能性为零，这是集中的。即使是最小的恒星黑洞，其质量也是太阳的三倍，因此就好像至少有三个额外的太阳拉动了我们太阳系中的行星一样。简而言之，我们一定会注意到的。 </p><p> However, Unwin and Scholtz say it could be a primordial black hole, since these are thought to be substantially smaller. &#34;Because these things are born during the early stages of the Universe, the dense regions they formed from could have been particularly small,&#34; says Scholtz. &#34;As a result, the mass contained in this black hole that eventually is formed out of it can be much, much less than a star – they even can be just a couple of pounds, like a chunk of rock.&#34; This is more in line with the predicted mass of Planet Nine, which is thought to be equivalent to up to ten Earths.</p><p>但是，温温和舒尔茨说，这可能是原始的黑洞，因为它们被认为要小得多。 ＆＃34;因为这些事物是在宇宙的早期诞生的，所以它们形成的密集区域可能特别小，＆＃34;斯科茨说。 ＆＃34;结果，这个黑洞中最终形成的质量可能比恒星小得多，远小于恒星-它们甚至可能只有几磅，就像一块岩石一样。 34;这更符合第九行星的预测质量，该行星被认为相当于十个地球。</p><p>  What would it look like? Should we be worried? And could this be even more exciting than discovering a planet?</p><p>  它会是什么样子？我们应该担心吗？难道这比发现行星还要令人兴奋吗？</p><p> First, even primordial black holes are dense enough that no light can escape. They are the truest form of black. This means that this one would not show up on any kind of telescope that currently exists. If you were to look straight at it, the only clue to its presence would be a blank void – a tiny gap in the blanket of stars in the night sky.</p><p> 首先，即使原始的黑洞也足够密集，以至于没有光可以逃脱。它们是黑色的最真实形式。这意味着该望远镜不会出现在当前存在的任何一种望远镜上。如果您直视它，那么它存在的唯一线索将是一个空白的空隙-夜空中的星星覆盖层中的微小缝隙。</p><p> Which brings us to the real snag. While the mass of this black hole would be the same as that of the proposed Planet Nine – up to 10 times Earth&#39;s – it would be condensed into a volume roughly the size of an orange. To find it would require some ingenuity.</p><p> 这使我们真正陷入困境。尽管该黑洞的质量与拟议的第九号行星相同，最多可达地球的10倍，但它会凝结成大致相当于橙色的体积。要找到它，需要一些独创性。</p><p> So far, suggestions include looking for the gamma rays that are emitted by objects as they fall into black holes, or releasing a constellation of hundreds of tiny spacecraft, which might – if we&#39;re lucky – pass close enough so that they&#39;d be pulled towards it ever-so-fractionally, and accelerate by a detectable amount.</p><p> 到目前为止，建议包括寻找物体落入黑洞时所发射的伽马射线，或者释放成百上千个微型航天器的星座，如果幸运的话，它们可能足够靠近以至于它们能够通过39; d如此微小地被拉向它，并以可检测的量加速。</p><p> Since the mysterious gravitational pull is emanating from the farthest reaches of our solar system, the probes would have to be  sent via an Earthbound laser array, which could propel them to 20% of the speed of light. If they travelled any slower, they might take hundreds of years to arrive – an experiment that would, naturally, stretch well beyond a human lifetime.</p><p> 由于神秘的引力是从我们太阳系的最远处发出的，因此必须通过地球激光阵列发送探针，这样才能将探针推进到光速的20％。如果他们走得更慢，他们可能需要数百年的时间才能到达-这个实验自然会超出人类的一生。</p><p> As it happens, these futuristic spacecraft are already being developed for another ambitious mission, the  Breakthrough Starshot project, which aims to send them to the Alpha Centauri star system, 4.37 light-years away.</p><p> 碰巧的是，这些具有未来感的航天器已经为另一项雄心勃勃的任务而研发，即突破星散项目（Breakthrough Starshot project），该项目旨在将它们送入距离我们4.37光年的Alpha Centauri星系。 </p><p> If we were to discover a lurking black hole, rather than a frigid planet, Unwin says there would be no need to panic. &#34;There&#39;s a supermassive black hole in the centre of our galaxy,&#34; he says. &#34;But we don&#39;t worry about our solar system falling into it, because we&#39;re in a stable orbit around it.&#34; So, while a primitive black hole will suck up anything within its path, this would not include the Earth, which – like the other inner planets – doesn&#39;t ever come close.</p><p>如果我们发现一个潜伏的黑洞，而不是一个冰冷的星球，温温说，就不必惊慌了。在我们银河系的中心有一个超大质量的黑洞，他说。 ＆＃34;但是我们不必担心太阳系会掉入其中，因为我们处于围绕它的稳定轨道上。因此，尽管原始的黑洞会吸走其路径上的任何东西，但其中不包括地球，就像其他内部行星一样，地球永远不会靠近。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s not like a vacuum cleaner,&#34; says Unwin. He explains that from the perspective of anyone on Earth, having an undiscovered black hole in the solar system is not that different to having a concealed planet there.</p><p> 它不像是吸尘器， Unwin说。他解释说，从地球上任何人的角度来看，在太阳系中有一个未被发现的黑洞与在那儿有一个隐藏的行星没有什么不同。</p><p> But while stellar and primordial black holes are essentially the same, the latter have never been found or studied – and difference in scale is expected to lead to some bizarre phenomena. “I would say that the things that happen with small black holes are more interesting than what happens with large black holes,&#34; says Scholtz.</p><p> 但是，尽管恒星黑洞和原始黑洞基本相同，但从未发现或研究过后者，而且规模上的差异有望导致某些奇怪的现象。 “我会说，黑洞较小的情况比大黑洞有趣的事情，＆＃34;斯科茨说。</p><p>  One example is the aptly-named process of “spaghettification”, which is often illustrated by the fable of an astronaut who ventured too near a black hole’s event horizon – the point beyond which no light can escape – and fell in headfirst. Though her head and feet were just metres from each other, the difference in the gravitational forces acting on them would be so great, she would be stretched like spaghetti.</p><p>  一个恰当地命名为“意大利面条化”的过程就是一个例子，一个宇航员的寓言经常说明这一点，他在黑洞的事件视线附近冒险，在黑洞的事件视线无法越过这一点，他就倒在了头上。尽管她的头和脚彼此相距仅几米，但是作用在它们上的重力差异却是如此之大，她会像意大利面条一样伸展。</p><p> Intriguingly, the effect should be even more dramatic, the smaller the black hole is. Sholtz explains that it’s all about relative distances – if you’re two metres tall, and you’re falling through an event horizon that’s one metre from a primordial black hole’s centre, the discrepancy between the location of your head and feet is larger, compared to the size of the black hole. This means you’ll be stretched far more than if you fell into a stellar one that’s a million miles across.</p><p> 有趣的是，黑洞越小，效果应越显着。 Sholtz解释说，这全都是相对距离–如果您身高2米，并且跌倒了距原始黑洞中心1米的事件视界，那么您的头和脚的位置之间的差异就会更大到黑洞的大小。这意味着，与陷入一百万英里远的恒星中相比，您所承受的拉伸远不止于此。</p><p> &#34;And so, peculiarly enough, they&#39;re more interesting,&#34; says Scholtz. Spaghettification has already been seen via a telescope, when a star got too close to a stellar black hole 215 million light years from Earth, and was  ripped apart (no astronauts were harmed). But if there is a primordial black hole in our own solar system, it would provide astrophysicists with the opportunity to study this behaviour – and many others – up close.</p><p> ＆＃34;因此，奇怪的是，它们更加有趣，＆＃34;斯科茨说。当一颗恒星离地球距离地球有2.15亿光年时，它离恒星黑洞太近并且被撕裂时（没有伤害到宇航员），已经通过望远镜看到了意大利面化。但是，如果我们自己的太阳系中有一个原始的黑洞，它将为天体物理学家提供机会来近距离研究这种行为以及其他许多行为。</p><p> So what does Batygin make of the possibility that the long-sought ninth planet could actually be a black hole instead? &#34;It&#39;s a creative idea, and we cannot constrain what its composition is even in the least bit,&#34; he says. &#34;I think maybe it&#39;s just my own bias, being a planetary science professor, but planets are a little bit more common…&#34;</p><p> 那么，Batygin如何看待长期以来寻求的第九颗行星实际上可能是黑洞呢？这是一个创新的想法，即使在最短的时间内，我们也不能限制其组成。他说。我想也许这只是我自己的偏见，作为一名行星科学教授，但行星要普遍得多…… </p><p> While Unwin and Scholtz are rooting for a primeval black hole to experiment with, Batygin is just as keen for a giant planet – citing the fact that the most common type throughout the galaxy are those which have around the same mass as Planet Nine.</p><p>尽管Unwin和Scholtz希望尝试使用原始的黑洞，但Batygin却热衷于一个巨大的行星，理由是整个银河系中最常见的类型是质量与第九行星大致相同的行星。</p><p> &#34;Meanwhile most exoplanets that orbit Sun-like stars, are in this weird range of being bigger than the Earth and considerably smaller than Neptune and Uranus,&#34; he says. If scientists do find the missing planet, it will be the closest they can get to a window into those elsewhere in the galaxy.</p><p> 同时，大多数绕太阳系恒星运行的系外行星处于这个怪异的范围内，它比地球大，比海王星和天王星小得多，＆＃34;他说。如果科学家确实找到了失踪的行星，那么它将是他们最接近银河系其他地方的窗口的窗口。</p><p> Only time will tell if the latest quest will be more successful than Lowell&#39;s. But Batygin is confident that their missions are totally different. &#34;All of the proposals are quite distinct in both the data they seem they seek to explain, as well as the mechanisms they use to explain it,&#34; he says.</p><p> 只有时间能证明最新的任务是否会比Lowell的成功。但是Batygin相信他们的任务是完全不同的。 ＆＃34;所有提案在他们似乎试图解释的数据以及他们用来解释它的机制上都非常不同。他说。</p><p> Either way, the search for the legendary ninth planet has already helped to transform our understanding of the solar system. Who knows what else we&#39;ll find before the hunt comes to an end.</p><p> 无论哪种方式，寻找传说中的第九颗行星已经帮助改变了我们对太阳系的理解。谁知道在狩猎结束之前还能找到什么。</p><p>   Join one million Future fans by liking us on    Facebook , or follow us on    Twitter  or    Instagram .</p><p>   通过在Facebook上赞我们来加入一百万未来粉丝，或者在Twitter或Instagram上关注我们。</p><p> If you liked this story,    sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter , called &#34;The Essential List&#34;.
