She is taking revenge on her father, a general who once forced his daughter to drown herself in the Blue Hole. &#34;I know every corner down there, and I haven&#39;t seen anything,&#34; says Omar. &#34;No monster and no mermaid.&#34;</p><p>达哈卜的当地人告诉了一个死去的女孩的灵魂如何让潜水员带到她身上。她正在报复她的父亲，一般是曾经迫使他的女儿淹死在蓝洞中的一般。 ＆＃34;我知道那里的每个角落，我都没有看到任何东西，＆＃34;奥马尔说。 ＆＃34;没有怪物，没有美人鱼。＆＃34;</p><p>  Omar, 47, born in a village near the border with Libya, is a Bedouin from the Aulad Ali tribe. He has a slim build, gray side-whiskers and friendly eyes. He wears the white jellabiya, a shirt-like robe, along with a turban, sandals and Ray-Ban aviator glasses. Omar owns two mobile phones and an iPad.</p><p>  奥马尔，47名，出生在与利比亚边境附近的一个村庄，是Aulad Ali部落的贝都因子。他拥有苗条的纤细，灰色的晶须和友好的眼睛。他穿着白色的Jellabiya，一种类似衬衫的长袍，以及头巾，凉鞋和射线飞行员眼镜。 OMAR拥有两个手机和iPad。</p><p> He came to Dahab in 1989, looking for a job. In 1992, Omar learned to dive, and he began working as an instructor three years later. Since then, he has undertaken all the missions in the Blue Hole, he says. A &#34;mission&#34; is what Omar calls bringing a dead body to the surface.</p><p> 他于1989年来到Dahab，找工作。 1992年，奥马尔学会了潜水，三年后他开始担任教练。他说，从那时起，他已经在蓝洞中进行了所有的任务。 A＆＃34; Mission＆＃34;是omar调用将尸体带到表面上。</p><p> He says that he doesn&#39;t wait long to recover a body, usually two or three days, but no more than seven. &#34;The parents want a burial.&#34; Besides, he adds, the body looks terrible when it remains in the water for too long. Because of the crabs, he says. When that happens, it&#39;s better to leave it down below.</p><p> 他说他没有等待长时间恢复身体，通常是两三天，但不超过七天。 ＆＃34;父母想要一个埋葬。＆＃34;此外，他补充道，当它仍然在水中持续太久时，身体看起来很糟糕。因为螃蟹，他说。发生这种情况时，它会更好地留下它。</p><p> Omar squeezes into his neoprene suit ahead of a dive into the hole, but only for fun today. &#34;It isn&#39;t difficult to dive in the Blue Hole. On the contrary,&#34; he says, &#34;but that&#39;s what makes it risky.&#34; Many divers underestimate the hole, he says, which quickly turns it into a trap.</p><p> 奥马尔挤进了他的氯丁橡胶西装，前进了洞穴进入洞，但今天只是为了好玩。 ＆＃34;它是难以潜入的蓝洞。相反，＆＃34;他说，＆＃34;但是，这是什么让它有风险。＆＃34;他说，许多潜水员低估了洞，这迅速将其转化为陷阱。</p><p> The Blue Hole is easy to reach. It doesn&#39;t take a boat to get there, and you don&#39;t even have to swim out to it. You just hop in. It&#39;s about 10 meters from a beach chair to the Blue Hole. The water is warm, there is no current and visibility is good.</p><p> 蓝孔易于到达。它不会乘船到达那里，你甚至不得不游出来。你只是跳进去。它距离沙滩椅约10米到蓝洞。水是温暖的，没有电流和可见性好。</p><p> When Omar slides down into the water, he floats like an astronaut in space, remaining almost motionless. The light and the colors gradually disappear, first red and later orange and yellow. In the end there is nothing but blue, hence the name.</p><p> 当OMAR滑入水中时，他像空间的宇航员一样漂浮，仍然一动不动。光线和颜色逐渐消失，第一个红色和后来的橙色和黄色。最后没有蓝色，因此名称。 </p><p> The light returns at a depth of about 45 meters. It&#39;s the most beautiful in the morning, when the sun rises over Saudi Arabia and shines directly through the tunnel into the Blue Hole. It&#39;s a mystical sight, one that also attracts divers who shouldn&#39;t be down there.</p><p>光线返回约45米的深度。它＆＃39是早上最美丽的，当太阳在沙特阿拉伯升起时，直接通过隧道闪耀到蓝洞。它＆＃39;是一个神秘的景象，一个也吸引了潜水员，他们应该在那里下来。</p><p>    Dahab was once a fishing village. Today, waiters stand in front of restaurants on the boardwalk, trying to lure vacationers inside. Water pipes gather dust in the junk shops, and hotels and bars sit alongside safari agencies and diving bases. No one knows exactly how many there are. Some 52 are registered, and then there are the diving schools that operate without licenses.</p><p>    达哈卜曾经是一个渔村。今天，服务员站在木板走道上的餐馆前，试图诱发里面的度假者。水管收集垃圾厅的灰尘，酒店和酒吧坐在一起野生动物园和潜水基地。没有人知道有多少。有些52注册，然后有没有许可证的潜水学校。</p><p> Because of the tough competition, prices are low; diving is a discount business in Dahab. A beginners&#39; course costs €200 ($244), and a guided dive at the local reef goes for €25. Divers who book a package of five dives get a sixth for free.</p><p> 由于竞争艰难，价格低;潜水是达哈卜的折扣业务。初学者＆＃39;课程费用200欧元（244美元），当地珊瑚礁的导游潜水额为25欧元。潜水员预订五个潜水的套餐免费获得第六个。</p><p> Omar opened the first center for technical diving in Dahab. The experts among the recreational divers use special gas mixtures, the composition of which is dependent on the depth of their intended dive. It&#39;s easy to dive through the tunnel in the Blue Hole with Trimix or Heliox, but not with compressed air.</p><p> 奥马尔在达哈卜开设了第一届技术潜水中心。娱乐潜水员中的专家使用特殊的气体混合物，其组合物取决于其预期潜水的深度。它＆＃39;易于潜水在蓝孔中的隧道，用磨刀或亥取，但没有压缩空气。</p><p> The critical limit for diving with compressed air is 56 meters. The exit from the tunnel is one meter lower at its upper edge.</p><p> 压缩空气潜水的临界限额为56米。隧道的出口在其上边缘下降一米。</p><p> To avoid accidents, the Egyptian diving association stipulates that divers cannot dive below 40 meters in the Red Sea with compressed air. In Dahab, however, divers can buy depth. It&#39;s easy to find a guide who is willing to surreptitiously take a diver into the tunnel for €100, without asking unnecessary questions.</p><p> 为了避免事故，埃及潜水协会规定潜水员不能在红海中潜入40米以下，带有压缩空气。然而，在达哈卜中，潜水员可以购买深度。它易于找到一个愿意偷偷地潜水员进入隧道100欧元的指南，而不询问不必要的问题。</p><p> All it takes is three attempts. The man with the blonde ponytail doesn&#39;t want to see the diving certification card or the dive log book in which each dive is documented. He only cares about one thing: &#34;When do we start?&#34;</p><p> 所有需要的是三次尝试。与金发碧眼点尾的男人＆＃39; t希望看到潜水认证卡或每个潜水的潜水日志书。他只关心一件事：＆＃34;我们什么时候开始？＆＃34; </p><p> The man is Russian. The Russians, both guides and ordinary divers, have a bad reputation in Dahab. They are considered careless. &#34;Russian roulette,&#34; says Omar.</p><p>那个男人是俄罗斯人。俄罗斯人，既有指南和普通潜水员，在达哈卜都有糟糕的声誉。他们被认为是粗心的。 ＆＃34;俄罗斯轮盘赌，＆＃34;奥马尔说。</p><p>  The rule of thumb among divers is that every 10 meters corresponds to a martini, and first-time drinkers quickly get tipsy. At as little as 30 meters, an inexperienced diver can become confused as a result of what&#39;s called nitrogen narcosis. When the rising pressure causes too much nitrogen to become dissolved in the bloodstream, divers lose their judgment. There are divers who have been inside the tunnel with compressed air in their tanks, and who swear that they heard a Bach organ concerto. Others report memory lapses or that they felt as if they were stoned.</p><p>  潜水员之间的经验法则是每10米对应于马提尼酒，第一次饮酒者迅速获得醉意。在短短30米处，由于含氮麻醉剂的结果，不经验的潜水员可能会混淆。当上升压力导致太多的氮气溶解在血液中时，潜水员会失去判断。有潜水员在隧道里面有压缩空气在坦克中，并且谁发誓他们听到了一个巴赫器官协奏曲。其他人报告记忆失误或者他们感觉好像被扔石头。</p><p> Just as a drinker develops a tolerance against alcohol at the beginning of his addiction, a diver can also become accustomed to high nitrogen concentrations. But even oxygen eventually becomes harmful underwater, where it is transformed into a toxin that causes dizziness, nausea, cramping and, eventually, unconsciousness.</p><p> 正如饮酒者在他的成瘾开始在饮酒者对酒精的宽容，潜水员也可以习惯于高氮浓度。但甚至氧气最终在水下变得有害，在那里它被转化为毒素，导致头晕，恶心，痉挛，最终，无意识。</p><p> Omar switches on the computer in his diving school because he wants to show us a YouTube video. &#34;Yuri Lipski. He went diving without his buddy. That alone is crazy. Yuri took along a video camera. I brought it up with the body. I thought the camera was broken, but it still worked. Yuri was filming the whole time. He filmed his own death.&#34;</p><p> 奥马尔在潜水学院开启计算机，因为他想向我们展示YouTube视频。 ＆＃34; yuri lipski。没有他的伙伴，他去潜水。单独疯了。 Yuri沿着摄像机拍摄。我用身体带来了它。我以为镜头坏了，但它仍然有效。尤里拍了一段时间。他拍摄了自己的死亡。＆＃34;</p><p> The video lasts seven minutes and 16 seconds. Lipski is diving with compressed air -- 12 liters. He seems to have everything under control at first, but then he starts dropping and dropping. His dive computer, visible in the picture, shows 81.7 meters, then 85.3 meters and, finally, 91.6 meters, when he hits the bottom. Lipski tries to inflate his buoyancy compensator to make himself more buoyant, but it doesn&#39;t work. He begins to flounder and kicks up sand. Then the image freezes. Omar turns off the computer.</p><p> 视频持续七分钟和16秒。 Lipski用压缩空气 -  12升潜水。他似乎首先拥有一切控制，但他开始下降和掉落。他潜水的电脑，在图片中可见，显示81.7米，然后85.3米，最后，91.6米，当他击中底部。 Lipski试图膨胀他的浮力补偿器，让自己更加蓬松，但它没有工作。他开始比目鱼并踢沙子。然后是图像冻结。奥马尔关闭了电脑。</p><p> &#34;Yuri was lying with his face on the ground when I found him,&#34; he says, and then he begins to list what went wrong. &#34;First,&#34; he says, sticking out his thumb to count, &#34;Yuri was too heavy. Twelve kilograms of lead on his belt, plus the bottle, the camera and the batteries. He holds up his index finger. &#34;Second, his vest burst open. It was already full when he tried to pump air into it. &#34;Third,&#34; he says, extending his middle finger, &#34;oxygen poisoning. That&#39;s why he was twitching. That was it.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我找到他时，尤里在地上躺在地上，＆＃34;他说，然后他开始列出出了什么问题。 ＆＃34;首先，＆＃34;他说，伸出拇指数目，＆＃34;尤里太重了。他的皮带上的十二千克铅，加上瓶子，相机和电池。他抱着他的食指。 ＆＃34;第二，他的背心爆裂开放。当他试图泵入它时已经满了。 ＆＃34;第三，＆＃34;他说，延伸他的中指，＆＃34;氧中毒。那个＆＃39;为什么他正在抽搐。那是它。＆＃34;</p><p>  Yet divers using compressed air aren&#39;t the only ones who lose their lives in the Blue Hole. Technical divers, the ones who are trained to go down as far as 100 meters or more, also make fatal mistakes.</p><p>  然而，使用压缩空气的潜水员＆＃39;唯一一个在蓝洞里失去生命的人。技术潜水员，训练越来越多100米或以上的人也会产生致命的错误。 </p><p> Omar says that technical diving requires discipline, but that there are always tourists in Dahab who party until three in the morning and then go diving in the Blue Hole at 9 a.m. The crazy ones who are determined to get that number into their diving computers -- &#34;the magical 100,&#34; with which they hope to impress women at the clubs -- are enough to drive him to despair, he says.</p><p>奥马尔说，技术潜水需要纪律，但达哈巴总是有达哈巴的游客，直到早上三个派对，然后在上午9点潜水，然后疯狂的人决心将该号码纳入他们的潜水计算机 - ＆＃34;神奇的100，＆＃34;他说，他们希望他们希望在俱乐部留下深刻的印象妇女 - 他说，这足以让他绝望。</p><p> On Nov. 7, 2011, Moscow native Igor Shalo dove down to a depth of 150 meters. According to his log book, he had made 400 dives. He didn&#39;t survive dive number 401.</p><p> 2011年11月7日，莫斯科本土伊戈尔Shalo鸽子潜入150米的深度。根据他的日志书，他已经做了400次潜水。他没有生存潜水号401。</p><p> He encountered a Swedish diver on his way down, at 90 meters along the outer wall of the Blue Hole. The Swedish diver says that Shalo&#39;s movements were shaky, but that he had signaled that he was okay by making a circle with his thumb and index finger.</p><p> 他在沿着蓝洞的外墙沿着90米处遇到瑞典潜水员。瑞典潜水员说，Shalo＆＃39;运动是摇摇晃晃的，但他发出了发出的发出信号，通过用拇指和食指制作一个圆圈。</p><p> Shalo had little experience with decompression dives. He had been at 40, 50, 66, 85 and 106 meters. During a decompression dive, it&#39;s important to stop several times while returning to the surface. Divers have to remain at certain depths for certain amounts of time, waiting as their bodies become accustomed to the decreasing pressure, so that they&#39;ll be in good shape once they complete their ascent. Igor Shalo, though, was as good as dead when he returned to the surface.</p><p> Shalo几乎没有减压潜水的经验。他已在40,50,66,85和106米处。在减压潜水期间，它＆＃39;在返回表面时停止几次很重要。潜水员必须留在某种程度的某些时间深处，等待他们的身体习惯于降低压力，使它们齐全的形状良好。但是，当他返回地面时，伊戈尔索洛和死亡一样好。</p><p> He didn&#39;t drop vertically to the depth he was aiming for, instead hitting ground at 120 meters -- his first mistake. Then he dove farther down to 150 meters, staying just above the seafloor -- his second mistake, because it cost him strength, time and air. During his ascent, he went into respiratory distress at 130 meters. Shalo panicked and ascended without stopping, shooting to the surface like a balloon. An eyewitness reports hearing Shalo cry for help.</p><p> 他垂直地垂直落下了他瞄准的深度，而是在120米处击打地面 - 他的第一个错误。然后他鸽子远到150米，留在海底之上 - 他的第二个错误，因为它花了他的力量，时间和空气。在他的上升期间，他在130米处进入呼吸窘迫。 Shalo恐慌和上升而不停止，像气球一样射击表面。目击者报告称Shalo哭泣寻求帮助。</p><p>  The ascent should never be faster than 10 meters per minute. A diver expels nitrogen as the pressure decreases. If he ascends too quickly, the gas forms bubbles in the blood that cause pain in the elbows, knees and shoulders. The bubbles can also clog blood vessels and tissue in the brain, heart, lungs and the spinal cord. The last 10 meters are especially tricky, because the pressure decreases by half, from two to one bar.</p><p>  上升永远不应该比每分钟10米更快。当压力降低时，潜水员将氮气排出。如果他升高太快，气体在血液中形成泡沫，导致肘部，膝盖和肩部疼痛。气泡还可以在大脑，心脏，肺和脊髓中堵塞血管和组织。最后10米特别棘手，因为压力从两到一条杆下降一半。</p><p> &#34;Shalo must have been bubbling like a Pepsi-Cola,&#34; says Heikal Tawab, the physician-in-chief at the Hyperbaric Medical Center in Dahab. Divers who ascend too quickly have to be brought there immediately, to its compression chamber. It looks like a submarine and can be used to treat six patients at the same time. Tawab simulates the pressure at a depth of up to 60 meters, and then he gradually reduces the pressure as the patients sit inside, breathing oxygen to suffocate the bubbles.</p><p> ＆＃34; Shalo必须像百事可乐一样冒泡，＆＃34; Heikal Tawab说，达哈卜高压医疗中心的医生职务。潜水员必须立即将其提升到它的压缩室。它看起来像潜水艇，可用于同时治疗六名患者。 Tawab模拟深度高达60米的压力，然后他逐渐降低压力，因为患者坐在内部，呼吸氧气窒息气泡。 </p><p> Tawab is constantly prepared for an emergency, and he never switches off his phone. He saves lives, but sometimes even he can do nothing. In one case, a man had been sitting in the chamber for six hours. Tawab had already brought him to three meters, and he would only have needed another 10 minutes. &#34;Suddenly it went very quickly. I didn&#39;t stand a chance.&#34;</p><p>Tawab不断为紧急情况做好准备，他从未关闭手机。他拯救了生命，但有时候，即使他什么也没事。在一个案例中，一个男人一直坐在腔室里六个小时。 Tawab已经把他带到了三米，他只需要另外10分钟。 ＆＃34;突然间迅速走了。我没有站起来。＆＃34;</p><p> He is a person who can be furious without even raising his voice. What irritates him the most, he says, is that they often bring him divers who have been dead for half an hour. That&#39;s how long it takes by car from the Blue Hole to the compression chamber.</p><p> 甚至没有养他的声音，他是一个可能会愤怒的人。他说，是什么让他感到恼火，是他们经常带他半小时死亡的潜水员。这是＆＃39;这是汽车从蓝孔到压缩室所需的时间。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s a gravel road. It&#39;s about time we built a real road,&#34; says Tawab. &#34;And why is there no ambulance at the Blue Hole? Medical care at the site is ridiculous.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;它＆＃39; s砾石道。它＆＃39;关于时间我们建造了一条真正的道路，＆＃34; Tawab说。 ＆＃34;为什么蓝洞没有救护车？现场医疗保健是荒谬的。＆＃34;</p><p> Tawab is also a diver, but he has never been in the Blue Hole. &#34;There&#39;s no need,&#34; he says, pointing out that it&#39;s only a matter of time before Tarek Omar will have to pull out another body.</p><p> Tawab也是潜水员，但他从未在蓝洞里。 ＆＃34;没有必要，＆＃34;他说，指出它＆＃39;在tarek奥马尔之前只有一个时间问题，必须拔出另一个身体。</p><p>  Omar lives on a small street away from the hustle and bustle of Dahab. In front of his terrace is a rusty bench press he uses to stay in shape. Omar points to a certificate, written in five languages, with which Alexander Lipski thanked him for &#34;the dangerous mission to recover the body of my son.&#34;</p><p>  奥马尔住在一个小街道上，远离喧嚣的达哈卜。在他的露台面前，他用来留在塑造的生锈的卧推。奥马尔指向一份证书，用五种语言编写，亚历山大Lipski感谢他＆＃34;恢复我儿子身体的危险任务。＆＃34;</p><p> He brings up the bodies because he wants to help, says Omar. &#34;It isn&#39;t about money for me. I don&#39;t ask for anything. I just charge the cost of the gas.&#34; When asked how he finds bodies in the Blue Hole, he responds: &#34;If I were to hide something in your garden, you would also find it pretty quickly.&#34;</p><p> 奥马尔说，他会带来尸体，因为他想帮助。 ＆＃34;它是关于我的钱。我不要求任何东西。我只是收取天然气的成本。＆＃34;当被问及他如何在蓝洞找到尸体时，他回应：＆＃34;如果我要在花园里藏东西，你也会很快发现它。＆＃34;</p><p> First, Omar says, he finds out what kind of equipment the dead diver was using. How thick was the neoprene suit? How much lead was he wearing on his belt? He has to know such details to get an idea of how the body sank. A dead person doesn&#39;t fall to the bottom like a rock. He asks the dive buddy where he saw his partner last, and at what depth. Then he and his team notify the tourists, telling them that they are about to recover a body, and that they can stay if they want to, but that they should stay away from anything that comes to the surface.</p><p> 首先，奥马尔说，他发现死潜水员正在使用什么样的设备。氯丁橡胶西装有多厚？他在腰带上穿多少铅？他必须了解这些细节，以了解身体如何沉没。一个死的人并不像岩石一样落到底部。他问了潜水伙伴，他最后看到了他的伴侣，并在什么深处。然后他和他的团队通知游客，告诉他们他们即将恢复一个身体，如果他们想要，他们可以留下来，但他们应该远离表面的任何东西。 </p><p> Then Omar jumps into the water, and as soon as he reaches the spot where the diver must have died, he allows his body to drift, as if he too were dead.</p><p>然后奥马尔跳进水中，一旦他到达潜水员必须死的地方，他允许他的身体漂移，好像他也死了。</p><p> Most bodies lie at depths of between 100 and 120 meters. When Omar finds a dead body, he grabs it in his arms or ties it to his own body. He has five minutes to complete the operation. Then he ascends.</p><p> 大多数身体躺在100到120米之间。当奥马尔发现一个尸体时，他抓住了他的手臂或将它与自己的身体联系起来。他有五分钟完成操作。然后他提升。</p><p> Omar says that constantly looking at the body doesn&#39;t bother him. He says that he has seen &#34;Night of the Dead,&#34; a horror film, and that it was worse. At 40 meters, once he can see the surface, he sends up the body with an air bag.</p><p> 奥马尔说，经常看身体并不困扰着他。他说他见过＆＃34;死者的夜晚，＆＃34;恐怖的电影，而且更糟糕的是。在40米，一旦他能看到表面，他就会用气囊发出身体。</p><p> Because it takes Omar so long to decompress, he remains underwater for up to three hours during one of his missions. By the time he returns to land, the body has already been removed.</p><p> 因为减少了奥马尔，但他在他的任务之一后仍然需要长达三个小时。当他回到土地时，身体已经被删除了。</p><p> It&#39;s about 7 p.m., and the wind has died down at the Blue Hole, where the cafés are now empty. Omar climbs up a cliff. The lights of a city in Saudi Arabia flicker in the distance, and the first stars are shining. From above, the Blue Hole now has a hypnotic appeal, a smudge in the turquoise reef that attracts divers like a magnet.</p><p> 它大约7分钟，风已经在蓝洞中死亡，咖啡馆现在是空的。奥马尔爬上一个悬崖。沙特阿拉伯的一个城市的灯光在远处闪烁，第一颗星星闪耀着。从上面来看，蓝洞现在有一个催眠吸引力，在绿松石礁中的污迹吸引了像磁铁一样的潜水员。</p><p> There are still bones on the floor of the Blue Hole, and the family members want them to stay there. But can Omar imagine finding his final resting place in the Blue Hole, remaining in the depths forever, like the diver in the film &#34;The Big Blue?&#34;</p><p> 蓝洞的地板上仍然有骨头，而家庭成员希望他们留在那里。但奥马尔可以想象在蓝洞中找到他的最终休息的地方，永远在深处，就像电影中的潜水员＆＃34;大蓝？＆＃34;</p><p> He looks down at the hole. He says nothing for a moment.
