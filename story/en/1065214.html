Fellow Northern California startup Joby Aviation and Germany’s Volocopter believe they’ll win safety approval for their electric air taxis in 2023, allowing them to launch limited rooftop-to-rooftop passenger service within initial cities, and Vermont’s Beta Technologies is making rapid progress as well, striking deals to begin delivering a cargo version of its aircraft to UPS and a passenger version to Blade Urban Air Mobility in 2024.</p><p>谷歌联合创始人Larry Page的十一年度银行资本展开了一个开发电动汽车的首次努力，竞争对手似乎正在加快他公司Kitty Hawk在比赛中提升您的日常通勤进入天空。北加州北加州启动Joby Aviation和德国的volocopter认为他们将在2023年赢得其电气出租车的安全批准，使他们能够在最初的城市发射有限的屋顶到屋顶乘客服务，以及佛蒙特州的Beta Technologies也在进行快速进展，罢工交易开始在2024年开始向UPS和乘客展示的乘客牌交货和乘客版本。</p><p>   But there may be no first mover advantage in the uncharted skies of urban air mobility and CEO Sebastian Thrun has an ambitious plan to leapfrog the pack that he revealed to  Forbes that hinges on convincing safety regulators to allow it to fly passengers without a pilot onboard—something that most other air taxi developers hope to do eventually but which they think is a tall order in the near term.  Page and Thrun, a former Stanford roboticist who founded Google’s self-driving car program, have committed to a strategy in which Kitty Hawk will build a larger version of Heaviside, the prototype electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft it’s been working on since 2017, that will seat two passengers, up from one at present, and that will operate autonomously for the most part while being overseen by a pilot on the ground who will handle multiple aircraft at a time. The remote pilot will communicate with air traffic controllers and deal with situations that Heaviside’s artificial intelligence brains can’t.</p><p>   但是，在城市空中行动不明的天空中，CEO Sebastian Thrun可能没有第一个动力优势，并且抓住了雄心勃勃的计划，让他揭示他揭示讨论安全监管机构，让它在没有飞行员的情况下飞行乘客大多数其他空中出租车开发人员希望最终要做的事情，但他们认为在近期的秩序很大。前斯坦福机器人创立的前斯坦福机器人队致力于一项策略，其中凯蒂鹰将建立更大版本的沉重产品，原型电动垂直起飞和着陆（EVTOL）飞机自上来2017年，将在目前占有两名乘客，这将在大多数情况下自主运作，同时由地面上的飞行员监督，他一次将处理多个飞机。远程飞行员将与空中交通管制员沟通，并处理沉重的人工智能大脑无法实现的情况。</p><p> Thrun, a bald, smooth-talking German who’s a prominent evangelist for how Silicon Valley tech can improve the world, says Kitty Hawk expects to win safety approval for its new air taxi within three years from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. “It’s a riskier path than going for a piloted aircraft but we believe the payout is 100X of what any piloted aircraft could be in terms of its business opportunity,” he says.</p><p> Kitty Hawk表示，一位漂亮的福音德国，硅谷Tech如何改善世界的突出福音师，为硅谷科技有关如何改善全球。从美国联邦航空管理局的三年内赢得了新的空中出租车的安全批准。他说：“这是一个冒险的道路，而不是寻求一架飞机的飞机，但我们认为支付是任何驾驶飞机可能在商业机会方面的100倍，”他说。</p><p> Thrun will do this without Damon Vander Lind, the engineer who conceived of and built the initial versions of Heaviside, a small, elegant airplane capable of taking off and landing like a helicopter that the company says has achieved efficiency and range in unmanned test flights that may be better than any other eVTOL yet. Vander Lind was sacked in May after months of tussling with Thrun and Page over the path forward, Thrun confirmed. Sources say Vander Lind thought their strategy too risky. His departure also follows accusations that he was unreceptive to the ideas of his employees and hostile to some who disagreed with him, contributing to a toxic work culture. Vander Lind declined to comment to  Forbes.</p><p> 在没有达蒙维德Lind的情况下，这位工程师将在没有达蒙维德林的情况下，这是一个能够起飞和降落的初始版本的初始版本的工程师，这是公司所说的效率和范围在无人的测试飞行中可能比任何其他EVTOL都要好。在五月的争吵之后被解雇了波浪林，在向前走向前进的道路上，大风确认。消息人士们表示，vander lind认为他们的战略过于危险。他的出发也遵循指责，他对他员工的想法和敌对对他不同意的人的想法进行了解开，有助于有毒的工作文化。 vander lind拒绝评论福布斯。</p><p> “Letting Damon go was one of the toughest decisions I’ve made in the last 10 years,” Thrun says. “He’s a world-class engineer.”</p><p> “让Damon Go是我过去10年中最艰难的决定之一，”Thrun说。 “他是世界一流的工程师。”</p><p> Filling some of the void will be a new chief operating officer: Chris Anderson, the former editor of  Wired magazine and co-founder of 3D Robotics, which mounted an  unsuccessful attempt to challenge DJI in the consumer drone market. Kitty Hawk is acquiring the company, which, after mass layoffs and pivoting to producing commercial drone software, has returned to building a drone, this time for U.S. government use, that it’s in the process of getting  FAA safety certification for, experience that Thrun says will be valuable for Kitty Hawk.</p><p> 填补一些空白将是一名新的首席运营官：克里斯安德森，克里斯安德森，前任有线杂志和3D机器人联合创始人的编辑，该公司在消费者无人机市场中挑战了挑战DJI的不成功。 Kitty Hawk正在获取该公司，在群众裁员和生产商业无人机软件后，已返回建造无人机，这次为美国政府使用，这是在获得FAA安全认证的过程中，经验培养的经验对猫头鹰鹰有价值。</p><p>   Vander Lind’s exit and the strategic shift comes as the company has grappled with internal problems. Two female engineers quit in April complaining of sexism and poor treatment. Three engineers on the Heaviside program also quit over the past nine months, because, according to ex-employees who spoke with Forbes on the condition of anonymity, they believed they had been retaliated against by Vander Lind due to his suspicions that they were the authors of an anonymous safety report that was filed in late 2019. A fourth was fired.</p><p>   Vander Lind的出口和战略转变为众多问题而努力。两位女工在4月份辞职，抱怨性别歧视和糟糕的治疗。沉重九个月的三个工程师也在过去的九个月内戒烟，因为，根据与福布斯在匿名的条件下谈到的前雇员的说法，他们认为他们因他是作者而被冒险的vander lind进行了报复2019年底提交的匿名安全报告。第四次被解雇。 </p><p> The report, which was shared with  Forbes, charged that Vander Lind was failing to close the loop on perfecting systems on the second-generation Heaviside prototype, including not adequately defining crash requirements and other safety specs, while trying to move forward to designing the next version of the aircraft amid rapid timelines, and that he reacted poorly to engineers who pushed him on these issues.</p><p>与福布斯共享的报告负责将vander lind造成的，在第二代沉重原型上的完善系统上未能关闭循环，包括不充分定义崩溃要求和其他安全规范，同时试图向前移动到设计下一步在快速的时间里，飞机的版本，他对将他推向这些问题的工程师做出了不好的反应。</p><p> In a follow-up letter to management alleging retaliation, the author of the report wrote, “Damon has created a culture where disagreeing with him is harshly punished, and everyone knows this.”</p><p> 报告的提交人写道，在向管理的后续信中致电报复，“达蒙创造了一种不同意他的文化，不同意他受到严厉的惩罚，每个人都知道这一点。”</p><p> Thrun says a review was conducted by an external lawyer. He declined to discuss the findings, citing employee confidentiality, but said, “Had I believed there was retaliation I would have reacted much more strongly than I did.”</p><p> Thrun表示，审查由外部律师进行。他拒绝讨论调查结果，引用员工保密，但是说：“我相信有报复，我会比我更强大的反应。”</p><p> One of the female engineers who quit in April sent a letter to human resources that was shared with  Forbes in which she alleged that she was not afforded the same level of respect as male colleagues and her ideas were routinely ignored. In an internal discussion of the letter that was also shared with  Forbes, a female member of the company’s diversity and inclusion committee wrote, “I’ve experienced much more poor behavior in this organization than I have in my ten-plus years of professional life. … Departure of female colleagues due to unacceptable treatment is a repeating pattern in this company.”</p><p> 4月退出的女性工程师之一向人力资源发了一封信，这些资源与福布斯共享，因为她所称她没有与男性同事和她的想法常规忽视相同的尊重。在与福布斯分享的信函的内部讨论中，该公司多样性和包容委员会的女性成员写道：“我在这个组织的行为比我的十大职业生涯中的十年内经历了更差的行为。 ......由于不可接受的治疗，女同事们出发是这家公司的重复模式。“</p><p> Thrun said an external investigation had failed to turn up any instances of discrimination based on gender, race or other status, but that the company had brought in an advisory firm to help with inclusion and company culture.</p><p> Thrun表示，外部调查未能根据性别，种族或其他地位出现任何歧视实例，但该公司带来了一家咨询公司，以帮助包含并公司文化。</p><p>  He said that Covid may have exaggerated problems with communication in the company. “We had a situation where people felt they were unfairly treated, they felt retaliated against. It’s my job as CEO to make sure this doesn’t happen, so at the end of the day it’s my fault and my responsibility.”</p><p>  他说，Covid可能会夸大了公司的沟通问题。 “我们有一种人们觉得他们被不公平地对待的情况，他们感受到了反对。这是我的首席执行官的工作，以确保不会发生这种情况，所以在一天结束时，这是我的错和我的责任。“</p><p> The turmoil comes amid criticism from some that it was exacerbated by the remoteness of Thrun, who’s also the cofounder and executive chairman of the online learning company Udacity, and who, according to former employees on the Flyer and Heaviside programs, hasn’t been seen on a daily basis around the offices over the years.</p><p> 在批评中，这一动荡来自批评，这是由历史的偏远，谁也是在线学习公司UDACITY的联合国和执行主席，据前雇员尚未见过多年来每天围绕办事处。 </p><p>  Thrun told  Forbes he had taken a hands-off approach by design—but not anymore. “The way I’ve run the company in the past is a bit like an incubator where we have relatively independent teams creating independent aircraft,” he says. “But given the events of the past months where I got heavily involved in strategy and management, I’m spending every waking moment on the company.”</p><p>Thrun告诉福布斯，他已经通过设计进行了脱离的方法 - 但不再是。 “我过去的运营方式的方式有点像孵化器，我们有一个相对独立的团队创建独立飞机，”他说。 “但鉴于过去几个月的事件，我大量参与战略和管理，我正在花在公司的每一个醒来的时刻。”</p><p> In 2018 it looked like Kitty Hawk was leading the way to a revolution in how we get around. It had unveiled a two-seat, battery-powered and robot-controlled eVTOL called Cora that it was test-flying in New Zealand, where it hoped to establish an air taxi service as early as this year, and it was promising to soon begin selling a one-seat aerial go-kart called Flyer intended to be flown for fun over water.</p><p> 2018年看起来像Kitty Hawk在我们周围到达的革命是一场革命。它推出了一个双座，电池供电和机器人控制的EVTOL，称为科拉，它在新西兰测试飞行，希望早在今年建立空中出租车服务，并且很快就开始了销售一个称为传单的单座天线Go-Kart打算在水中飞行。</p><p>  A year later, it spun off Cora into a joint venture controlled by Boeing dubbed Wisk. Last year Kitty Hawk shut down the Flyer program following safety and development problems  that  Forbes reported on, stating that it had failed to identify a viable market for the aircraft.</p><p>  一年后，它将科拉旋转到由波音被称为WISK控制的合资企业中。去年Kitty Hawk在福布斯报告的安全性和开发问题后关闭了传单计划，说明它未能识别飞机的可行性市场。</p><p>  Thrun says with Vander Lind’s exit, he will oversee development of the next version of Heaviside, which will be the production-conforming prototype that it will seek to certify, aided by Anderson. Despite being significantly larger – it will expand in weight from roughly 900 pounds to 2,200 pounds, with 440 pounds budgeted for two passengers plus luggage – Thrun says they expect the aircraft to have the same range of roughly 100 miles plus safety reserves and a speed of 180 mph. Other eVTOL developers have promised similar range or more, but no one else to date has claimed to have flown as far.</p><p>  Thrun Junder Lind的出口说，他将负责监督下一个版本的沉重产品，这将是它将寻求认证，并由安德森援助的生产符合性的原型。尽管存在明显大 - 它将重量扩大到大约900磅至2,200磅，两名乘客和行李箱预算为440磅 -  Thrun表示，他们希望飞机具有相同的约100英里和安全储备和速度180英里/小时。其他EVTOL开发人员已承诺相似的范围或更多，但迄今没有其他人则声称已经陷入困境。</p><p> Kitty Hawk says the current version of Heaviside is 100 times quieter in cruise than a helicopter, something that will be crucial for it to win acceptance for the construction of the many vertiports inside cities that will be needed for the air taxi network Thrun envisions to achieve his goal of switching half of trips in major cities out of cars and into more energy efficient air vehicles by 2050.</p><p> Kitty Hawk表示，当前版本的巨额巡航巡航比直升机更安静，这对其赢得途中的追踪至关重要的东西，这将赢得空中出租车网络的城市内部所需的许多垂直的建设，这是至关重要的他的目标是在2050年到2050年，在汽车中的主要城市中的一半旅行和更节能的航空器。</p><p> “We’ll hopefully easily be 10 times as safe given how unsafe cars are, and hopefully we’ll be five times as green,” says Thrun.</p><p> “鉴于汽车的既不安全，我们希望很容易待安全10倍，希望我们将五次为绿色，”Thrun说。</p><p> The current version of Heaviside appears to have impressive energy efficiency indeed: in a paper that has yet to be published, Carnegie Mellon engineering professor Venkat Viswanathan and his graduate student Shashank Sripad estimate that the aircraft is more efficient than an electric car with one occupant at ranges greater than 20 miles, and significantly better than the aircraft Joby and Beta are test-flying, as well as proposed designs from Germany’s Lilium and the Bay Area startup Archer Aviation, based on current battery technology.</p><p> 当前版本的全部版本似乎具有令人印象深刻的能源效率：在尚未出版的论文中，卡内基梅隆工程教授Venkat Viswanathan和他的研究生Shashank Sripad估计，飞机比一名乘客更有效地效率。范围大于20英里，而且比飞机Joby和Beta更好地是测试飞行，以及德国百合的建议设计，基于电流电池技术，德国百合和湾区启动弓箭手航空。 </p><p>  If Kitty Hawk succeeds in convincing regulators to allow its planned aircraft to operate without pilots in the cockpit, it could have a substantial cost advantage over competitors. Piloted urban air taxis could have double the costs of autonomous ones, McKinsey consultants Uri Pelli and Robin Riedel estimated in a  paper last year.</p><p>如果Kitty Hawk成功令人信服的监管机构，让计划飞机在没有驾驶舱中的飞行员的情况下运行，它可能会在竞争对手方面具有很大的成本优势。试点城市空中出租车可能有自主顾问Uri Pelli和Robin Riedel在去年估计的一倍。</p><p> Thrun believes that with one remote pilot overseeing five aircraft in the air, Kitty Hawk’s operating cost per mile would drop below $1, making it cheaper than an Uber or Lyft ride is today.</p><p> Thrun认为，在空中监督五架飞机的远程飞行员，Kitty Hawk每英里的运营成本将低于1美元，使其比优步或Lyft骑在今天。</p><p> And then there’s the question of finding and training all the pilots air taxi fleet operators will need to scale up amid expectations that retirements and airline growth are set to create a severe shortage.</p><p> 然后，寻找和培训的问题所有飞行员航空公司舰队运营商将需要在预期退休和航空公司增长以造成严重短缺情况下扩大。</p><p> To move 10% of the population of the Bay Area by eVTOL would require roughly 50,000 aircraft, Thrun estimates, of which half have to be in the air at any one time.</p><p> 为了移动10％的湾地区的埃博尔人口将需要大约50,000架飞机，估计，其中一半必须在任何时候都在空中。</p><p> “The only way to make it meaningful for the world or for any city is to go to scale, and the only way to go to scale is to avoid human pilots,” says Thrun.</p><p> “使世界或任何城市对其有意义的唯一方法就是进行规模，唯一的途径是避免人类飞行员，”波伦斯说。</p><p> That depends on developing autonomous systems capable of replacing pilots — and on safety regulators allowing them. With all the radical new technology being packed into eVTOL prototypes, from highly flammable battery systems to electric motors and tilting rotors, most of their developers think that’s enough complexity to ask regulators to deal with without making them robots, too. Some aerospace experts have warned for years that the FAA lacks enough software experts;  the agency may be hard-pressed to effectively evaluate the safety of the complicated artificial intelligence systems that will be needed for autonomous flight.</p><p> 这取决于开发能够更换飞行员的自治系统 - 以及允许它们的安全调节器。通过所有激进的新技术，从高度易燃的电池系统填充到EVTOL原型，从高度易燃的电池系统到电动机和倾斜转子，他们的大多数开发人员认为，这已经足够的复杂性，要​​求监管机构在不制定机器人的情况下应对调节器。一些航空航天专家已经警告过多年来，FAA缺乏足够的软件专家;可能会难以迫使原子能机构能够有效评估自主飞行所需的复杂人工智能系统的安全性。</p><p>  Developing that software is a challenge that’s squarely in the wheelhouse of Thrun, who made his name by leading the Stanford team that developed a robot car that won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge before Google lured him away to set up its driverless car program, now known as Waymo. He then founded the company’s X moonshot division.</p><p>  开发这种软件是一个挑战，这是一个正方形的驾驶，通过领导斯坦福球队制定了他的名字，通过领导谷歌在谷歌诱导他离开时赢得了2005年的Darpa大挑战，现在已知作为Waymo。然后他创立了公司的X Moonshot Division。 </p><p> Autonomy in the mostly empty skies is generally seen as posing fewer challenges than on the road, and Thrun says Kitty Hawk is developing autonomous controls for its aircraft that will soon be fully capable of taking it safely from one point to another “on a good day.” Remote piloting technology capable of allowing a human to take over on the bad ones has been proven out by the U.S. military with drones, Thrun notes — but using it with passenger aircraft is a step beyond, and the FAA as of yet has only granted a handful of limited waivers for remote pilots to conduct unmanned drone flights in the U.S. beyond the operator’s visual line of sight.</p><p>大多数空天空中的自主权通常被视为摆在较少的挑战，而不是在路上，并且Thrun表示，Kitty Hawk正在为其飞机开发自主控制，这将很快能够完全能够在美好的一天将其安全地从一个点安全地取得安全。 。“美国军队与无人机的遥控技术能够允许人类接触坏人的技术，但与乘客飞机使用它是一个超越的步骤，而截至唯一才授予少数有限的偏远飞行员豁免，在美国的视线之外，在美国的无人驾驶无人机航班中进行无人驾驶无人机航班。</p><p> To keep its aircraft from running into other ones, Kitty Hawk is aiming to tap into the national ground radar network used by air traffic controllers and only fly in areas with good coverage. It’s planning to test that out in Ohio in partnership with NASA; it’s also working with the Air Force’s Agility Prime program in the state to test and develop Heaviside’s remote flying capabilities for potential military use, recently conducting a  simulated medical evacuation of a wounded soldier.</p><p> 为了使其飞机跑进其他人，Kitty Hawk旨在利用空中交通管制员使用的国家地面雷达网络，只能在具有良好覆盖范围内飞行。它计划在俄亥俄州与美国国家航空航天局合作;它还与空军的敏捷性主要计划在国内进行测试，并为潜在的军用使用进行测试和开发较重的飞行能力，最近进行了模拟士兵的模拟医疗疏散。</p><p> Kitty Hawk’s plans to commercialize Heaviside as a two-passenger vehicle put it on the small side compared to many other winged air taxi aspirants that are developing aircraft with anywhere from five to seven seats, but that may not be a disadvantage. The average number of occupants in passenger vehicles in the U.S. is 1.67, according to the Federal Highway Administration’s National Household Survey. While pooling together more passengers in larger vehicles should theoretically allow for lower costs per passenger, filling up the seats could require more waiting time on the vertiport pad, which could fritter away some of the time benefit of flying over driving that’s needed to convince commuters to take to the air, points out McKinsey’s Riedel.</p><p> Kitty Hawk计划将沉重化的计划作为双人用途车辆将其放在小方面，而许多其他翅膀的空中出租车有伴随着从五到七个席位的任何地方开发的飞机，但这可能不是一个劣势。根据联邦公路管理局的国家家庭调查，美国乘用车的平均乘客数量为1.67。在汇集更多乘客的乘客时，理论上应该允许每次乘客的成本较低，填补座位可能需要更多的等待时间在Vertiport Pad上，这可能会使飞行驾驶所需的一些时间好处，这是需要说服通勤者走到空中，指出麦肯锡的riedel。</p><p> Being first to market – which Kitty Hawk is unlikely to be — isn’t going to be much of an advantage, Riedel thinks, given how long it will likely take for operators to scale up and for cities and regulators to be comfortable allowing them to expand service.</p><p> 首先是市场 - 凯蒂鹰不太可能 - 鉴于运营商扩大和为城市和监管机构舒服的舒适需要多长时间展开服务。</p><p> The eVTOL makers with enough funding will adapt their aircraft designs as they get a better sense of what the market may be, so Riedel says he’s paying more attention to the strength of management teams and their ability to execute as an indicator of who might be winners. “Whether they have the right vehicle or not, whether they have the tech figured out is less important to me than if you have good leaders that can draw on experience in the industry, and draw on other leaders that will help them support them build a team.”</p><p> 具有足够资金的EVTOL制造商将适应他们的飞机设计，因为它们得到了更好的市场可能是什么，所以RIEDEL表示，他更加关注管理团队的实力以及他们作为谁的指标的能力，作为谁可能是谁的指标。 “无论他们是否拥有正确的车辆，他们是否有技术人才讨论对我来说不太重要，而不是如果您有能够借鉴行业经验的好领导者，并在其他领导者上绘制将帮助他们支持他们的领导者团队。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/06/11/larry-page-kitty-hawk-air-taxi-sebastian-thrun/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2021/06/11/larry-page-kitty-hawk-air-taxi-sebastian-thrun/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/机器人/">#机器人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hawk/">#hawk</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/飞机/">#飞机</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
