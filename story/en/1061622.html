Each of those four trials had promising results, but each was also too small individually to show any meaningful impact on the hard outcomes we really care about, like death. When I meta-analyzed them together however, the results suddenly appeared very impressive. Here’s what that meta-analysis looked like:</p><p>在1月份后，我写了一篇关于伊维菌素的四项随机对照试验的文章，作为Covid-19的治疗，当时将其结果释放到公众。这四项试验中的每一个都有希望的结果，但每个人都对我们真正关心的艰难结果表现出任何有意义的影响，就像死亡一样。当我将它们分析在一起时，结果突然出现令人印象深刻。以下是Meta-Analysis看起来像的：</p><p>  It showed a massive 78% reduction in mortality in patients treated with covid-19. Mortality is the hardest of hard end points, which means it’s the hardest for researchers to manipulate and therefore the least open to bias. Either someone’s dead, or they’re alive. End of story.</p><p>  它显示使用Covid-19处理的患者的大量78％的死亡率降低。死亡率是最难的硬端点，这意味着研究人员最难操纵，因此最不开放的偏见。要么有人死了，或者他们活着。故事结局。</p><p> You would have thought that this strong overall signal of benefit in the midst of a pandemic would have mobilized the powers that be to arrange multiple large randomized trials to confirm these results as quickly as possible, and that the major medical journals would be falling over each other to be the first to publish these studies.</p><p> 你会认为这种大流行中的这种强大的福利信号将动员能够安排多个大型随机试验的权力，以尽快确认这些结果，并且主要的医疗期刊将落在每个方面其他是第一个发布这些研究的人。</p><p>  Rather the opposite, in fact.  South Africa has even gone so far as to ban doctors from using ivermectin on covid-19 patients. And as far as I can tell, most of the discussion about ivermectin in mainstream media (and in the medical press) has centred not around its relative merits, but more around how its proponents are clearly deluded tin foil hat wearing crazies who are using social media to manipulate the masses.</p><p>  而是相反，实际上。南非甚至已经消失，禁止医生在Covid-19患者上使用伊维菌素。据我所知，关于伊维菌素在主流媒体（和医学出版社中的大部分讨论都没有以其相对优点为中心，但更多关于它的支持者如何清楚地阐明戴着人们社交的锡箔帽子戴锡箔帽子媒体操纵群众。</p><p> In spite of this, trial results have continued to appear. That means we should now be able to conclude with even greater certainty whether or not ivermectin is effective against covid-19. Since there are so many of these trials popping up now, I’ve decided to limit the discussion here only to the ones I’ve been able to find that had at least 150 participants, and that compared ivermectin to placebo (although I’ll add even the smaller trials I’ve found in to the updated meta-analysis at the end).</p><p> 尽管如此，试验结果继续出现。这意味着我们现在应该能够在伊维菌素对Covid-19有效时得以更大的确定性得出结论。由于现在有这么多的试验现在突然出现，我决定仅限于我能够找到至少150名参与者的讨论，并且将伊维菌素与安慰剂相比（虽然我会甚至添加了我发现的较小试验到最后的更新的META分析）。</p><p> As before, it appears that rich western countries have very little interest in studying ivermectin as a treatment for covid. The three new trials that had at least 150 participants and compared ivermectin with placebo were conducted in Colombia, Iran, and Argentina. We’ll go through each in turn.</p><p> 如前所述，似乎富裕的西方国家对研究伊维菌蛋白作为对Covid的治疗非常感兴趣。在哥伦比亚，伊朗和阿根廷进行了至少150名参与者和安慰剂与安慰剂比较了伊维菌素的三项新试验。我们依次经历各自。</p><p> The Colombian trial ( Lopez-Medina et al.) was published in JAMA (the Journal of the American Medical Association) in March. There is one thing that is rather odd with this study, and that is that the study authors were receiving payments from Sanofi-Pasteur, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, Janssen, Merck, and Gilead while conducting the study. Gilead makes remdesivir. Merck is developing two expensive new drugs to treat covid-19. Janssen, Glaxo-Smith-Kline, and Sanofi-Pasteur are all developers of covid vaccines. In other words, the authors of the study were receiving funding from companies that own drugs that are direct competitors to ivermectin. One might call this a conflict of interest, and wonder whether the goal of the study was to show a lack of benefit. It’s definitely a little bit suspicious.</p><p> 哥伦比亚审判（Lopez-Medina等）于3月份发表在Jama（美国医学会期刊）。这项研究有一件事与这项研究相当奇怪，这就是研究作者正在接收来自Sanofi-Pasteur，Glaxo-Smith-Kline，Janssen，Merck和Gilead的付款，同时进行该研究。 Gilead使Remdesivir。默克正在开发两种昂贵的新药来治疗Covid-19。 Janssen，Glaxo-Smith-Kline和Sanofi-Pasteur都是Covid疫苗的所有开发人员。换句话说，该研究的作者正在从拥有直接竞争对手到伊维菌素的药物的公司获得资金。一个人可能会称之为利益冲突，并怀疑该研究的目标是缺乏福利。这绝对有点可疑。 </p><p> Anyway, let’s get to what the researchers actually did. This was a double-blind randomized controlled trial that recruited patients with mildly symptomatic covid-19 who had experienced symptom onset less than 7 days earlier. Potential participants were identified through a statewide database of people with positive PCR-tests. By “mildly symptomatic” the researchers meant people who had at least one symptom but who did not require high-flow oxygen at the time of recruitment in to the trial.</p><p>无论如何，让我们来到研究人员真正做的事情。这是一项双盲随机对照试验，征聘患有轻度症状的Covid-19患者，该患者在早些时候经历过症状发病的症状发病。通过具有阳性PCR测试的人的全州人数据库确定潜在的参与者。通过“轻微的症状”，研究人员意味着至少有一种症状的人，而且在招聘中没有需要高流量的氧气。</p><p> Participants in the treatment group received 300 ug/kg body weight of ivermectin every day for five days, while participants in the placebo group received an identical placebo. 300 ug/kg works out to 21 mg for an average 70 kg adult, which is quite high, especially when you consider that the dose was given daily for five days. For an average person, this would work out to a total dose of 105 mg. The other ivermectin trials have mostly given around 12 mg per day for one or two days, for a total dose of 12 to 24 mg (which has been considered enough because ivermectin has a long half-life in the body). Why this study gave such a high dose is unclear. However, it shouldn’t be a problem. Ivermectin is a very safe drug, and  studies have been done where people have been given ten times the recommended dose without any noticeable increase in adverse events.</p><p> 治疗组的参与者每天接受300 ug / kg体重的伊维菌素，持续五天，而安慰剂组的参与者则获得相同的安慰剂。 300 ug / kg平均为21毫克，平均为70公斤的成人，特别高，特别是当您认为每天给予剂量五天时。对于普通人来说，这将达到105毫克的总剂量。其他伊维菌素试验主要给予每天约12毫克或两天，总剂量为12至24毫克（已被认为是足够的，因为Ivermectin在身体中具有漫长的半衰期）。为什么这项研究给予这种高剂量尚不清楚。但是，它不应该是一个问题。 Ivermectin是一种非常安全的药物，已经进行了研究，其中人们已经给予了推荐剂量的十倍，没有任何明显的不良事件增加。</p><p> The stated goal of the study was to see if ivermectin resulted in more rapid symptom resolution than placebo. So participants were contacted by telephone every three days after inclusion in the study, up to day 21, and asked about what symptoms they were experiencing.</p><p> 该研究的规定目的是看伊维菌素是否导致症状分辨率比安慰剂更快。因此，在该研究中包含每三天的电话联系，达到第21天，并询问他们正在遇到什么症状。</p><p> 398 patients were included in the study. The median age of the participants was 37 years, and they were overall very healthy. 79% had no known co-morbidities. This is a shame. It means that this study is yet another one of those many studies that will not be able to show a meaningful effect on hard end points like hospitalization and death. It is a bit strange that studies keep being done on young healthy people who are at virtually zero risk from covid-19, rather than on the multi-morbid elderly, who are the ones we actually need an effective treatment for.</p><p> 该研究中包含398名患者。参与者的中位年龄为37岁，他们整体健康。 79％没有已知的共同生命。这是一个耻辱。这意味着这项研究却是许多研究中的另一个研究，这将无法对住院和死亡的硬端点表现出有意义的影响。这有点奇怪，研究继续完成年轻健康的人，他们从Covid-19几乎危险，而不是在多态病态的老年人身上，他们实际需要有效治疗。</p><p>  In the group treated with ivermectin, the average time from inclusion in the study to becoming completely symptom free was 10 days. In the placebo group that number was 12 days. So, the ivermectin treated patients recovered on average two days faster. However, the difference was not statistically significant, so the result could easily be due to chance. At 21 days after inclusion in the study, 82% had recovered fully in the ivermectin group, as compared to 79% in the placebo group. Again, the small difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>  在本组对伊维菌素治疗的组中，将研究中的平均时间从研究中纳入完全症状为10天。在安慰剂组中，这个数字为12天。因此，伊维菌素治疗的患者平均恢复两天。然而，差异没有统计学意义，因此结果很容易是由于机会。在纳入研究后21天，在伊维菌素组中完全恢复了82％，与安慰剂组的79％相比。同样，小差异没有统计学意义。</p><p> In terms of the hard end points that matter more, there were zero deaths in the ivermectin group and there was one death in the placebo group. 2% of participants in the ivermectin group required “escalation of care” (hospitalization if they were outside the hospital at the start of the study, or oxygen therapy if they were in hospital at the start of the study) as compared with 5% in the placebo group. None of these differences was statistically significant. But that doesn’t mean they weren’t real. Like I wrote earlier, the fact that this was a study of healthy young people meant that, even if a meaningful difference does exist in risk of dying of covid, or of ending up in hospital, this study was never going to find it.</p><p> 就硬端点而言，重要的是，Ivermectin组中存在零死亡，安慰剂组中有一个死亡。伊维菌素群体的2％的参与者需要“升级护理”（如果在研究开始时在医院外，或者如果在研究开始时在医院的氧气疗法），而且与5％相比安慰剂组。这些差异都没有统计学意义。但这并不意味着他们并不真实。就像我早些时候写过的那样，这是对健康年轻人的研究意味着，即使有意义的差异存在于Covid的染色风险，或者在医院结束时，这项研究永远不会找到它。</p><p>  Ivermectin does not meaningfully shorten duration of symptoms in healthy young people. That’s about all we can say from this study. Considering the conflicts of interest of the authors, my guess is that this was the goal of the study all along: Gather together a number of young healthy people that is too small for there to be any chance of a statistically significant benefit, and then get the result you want. The media will sell the result as “study shows ivermectin doesn’t work” (which they dutifully did).</p><p>  Ivermectin没有有意义地缩短健康的年轻人身上的症状持续时间。这是关于我们可以从这项研究中所说的一切。考虑到提交人的利益冲突，我的猜测是这一切都是这项研究的目标：聚集一些太小的年轻健康人，这对于那里有任何统计上大益处的机会，然后得到你想要的结果。媒体将销售结果，因为“研究表明伊维菌素不起作用”（他们尽职尽责地）。 </p><p> It is interesting that there were signals of benefit for all the parameters the researchers looked at (resolution of symptoms, escalation of care, death), but that the relatively small number and good health status of the participants meant that there was little chance of any of the results reaching statistical significance.</p><p>有趣的是，研究人员所看到的所有参数有益于所有参数的信号（解决症状，护理升级，死亡），但参与者的相对较小的数量和良好的健康状况意味着没有任何机会结果达到统计学意义。</p><p> Let’s move on to the next study, which is currently available as a pre-print on Research Square ( Niaee et al.). It was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and carried out at five different hospitals in Iran. It was funded by an Iranian university.</p><p> 让我们继续前进到下一项研究，目前在研究方面的预先打印（Niaee等人）。它是随机的，双盲和安慰剂控制的，并在伊朗的五家不同医院进行。它由伊朗大学资助。</p><p> In order to be included in the trial, participants had to be over the age of 18 and admitted to hospital because of a covid-19 infection (which was defined as symptoms suggestive of covid plus either a CT scan typical of covid infection or a positive PCR test).</p><p> 为了被列入审判，参与者必须超过18岁，因为Covid-19感染（被定义为Covid的症状加上Covid感染的CT扫描或阳性的症状），进入医院PCR测试）。</p><p> 150 participants were randomized to either placebo (30 people) or varying doses of ivermectin (120 people). The fact that they chose to make the placebo group so small is a problem, because it makes it very hard to detect any differences even if they do exist, by making the statistical certainty of the results in the placebo group very low.</p><p> 150名参与者被随机随机分配到安慰剂（30人）或不同剂量的伊维菌素（120人）。事实上，他们选择使安慰剂集团如此小的是一个问题，因为即使在安慰剂组中的结果的统计确定性，它也很难检测到任何差异。</p><p> The participants were on average 56 years old and the average oxygen saturation before initiation of treatment was 89% (normal is more than 95%), so this was a pretty sick group. Unfortunately no information is provided on how far along people were in the disease course when they started receiving ivermectin. It stands to reason that the drug is more likely to work if given ten days after symptom onset than when given twenty days after symptom onset, since death usually happens around day 21. If you, for example, wanted to design a trial to fail, you could start treating people at a time point when there is no time for the drug you’re testing to have a chance work, so it would have been nice to know at what time point treatment started in this trial.</p><p> 参与者平均每年56岁，治疗开始前的平均氧饱和度为89％（正常超过95％），因此这是一个非常病的小组。遗憾的是，在他们开始接受Ivermectin时，没有任何信息是沿着人们在疾病课程中的差别。它认为，如果症状发作后十天后，药物比症状发作后的二十天后，药物更有可能工作，因为死亡通常在第21天左右发生。如果您想要设计审判失败，那么当你没有时间进行测试时，你可以在一个时间点开始治疗人们，所以在这个试验中开始的时间点治疗是很高兴知道的。</p><p>  20% of the participants in the placebo group died (6 out of 30 people). 3% of the participants in the various ivermectin groups died (4 out of 120 people). That is an 85% reduction in the relative risk of death, which is huge.</p><p>  安慰剂集团的20％的参与者死亡（30人中有6人）。各种Ivermectin团体的3％的参与者死亡（120人中有4人）。这是死亡的相对风险的85％，这是巨大的。</p><p> So, in spite of the fact that the placebo group was so small, it was still possible to see a big difference in mortality. Admittedly, this is a pre-print (i.e. it hasn’t been peer-reviewed yet), and the absolute numbers of deaths are small, so there is some scope for random chance to have created these results (maybe people in the placebo group were just very unlucky!). However, the study appears to have followed all the steps expected for a high quality trial. It was carried out at multiple different hospitals, it used randomization and a control group that received a placebo, and it was double-blinded. And death is a very hard end point that is not particularly open to bias. So unless the researchers have falsified their data, then this study constitutes reasonably good evidence that ivermectin is highly effective when given to patients hospitalized with covid-19. That’s great, because it would mean that the drug can be given quite late in the disease course and still show benefit.</p><p> 因此，尽管安慰剂组如此之小，但仍有可能看到死亡率的巨大差异。不可否认，这是一个预先打印（即它尚未对同行评审），绝对数量的死亡人数很小，因此随机机会有一些范围创造了这些结果（也许是安慰剂集团的人们只是不幸！）。但是，研究似乎已经遵循了高质量试验所期望的所有步骤。它是在多个不同的医院进行的，它使用了随机化和接受安慰剂的对照组，并被双重蒙蔽。死亡是一个非常坚硬的终点，对偏见并不特别开放。因此，除非研究人员伪造了他们的数据，否则本研究构成了合理的良好证据，即伊维菌蛋白在与Covid-19住院的患者给予的患者时具有高效。这很棒，因为它意味着该药物可以在疾病课程中持续很晚，仍然表现出受益。 </p><p> Let’s move on to the third trial ( Chahla et al.), which is currently available as a pre-print on MedRxiv. It was carried out in Argentina, and funded by the Argentinean government. Like the first trial we discussed, this was a study of people with mild disease. It literally boggles my mind that so many researchers choose to study people with mild disease instead of studying those with more severe disease. Especially when you consider that these studies are all so small. A study of people with mild disease needs to be very large to find a statistically significant effect, since most people with covid do well regardless. The risk of false negative results is thus enormous. If you’re going to do a small-ish study, and you want to have a reasonable chance of producing results that reach statistical significance, it would make much more sense to do it on sick hospitalized patients.</p><p>让我们继续前进到第三次试验（Chahla等人），目前可以作为Medrxiv的预先打印。它是在阿根廷进行的，由阿根廷政府资助。就像我们讨论过的第一次试验一样，这是对轻度疾病的人的研究。它真实地令我兴奋的是，许多研究人员选择研究轻度疾病的人，而不是学习那些更严重的疾病。特别是当您认为这些研究都这么小。对轻度疾病的人的研究需要很大，以找到一个统计上显着的效果，因为大多数人都有很多伴侣。因此，假阴性结果的风险是巨大的。如果你要做一个小型的学习，你希望有一个合理的机会生产达到统计学意义的结果，就会在病人住院患者那里做得更有意义。</p><p> The study was randomized, but it wasn’t blinded, and there was no placebo. In other words, the intervention group received ivermectin (24 mg per day), while the control group didn’t receive anything. This is a bad bad thing. It means that any non-hard outcomes produced by the study are really quite worthless, since there is so much scope for the placebo effect and other confounding factors to mess up the results. For hard outcomes, in particular death, it should be less of a problem (although we wouldn’t expect any deaths in such a small study of mostly healthy people with mild disease anyway).</p><p> 该研究随机化，但它没有蒙蔽，没有安慰剂。换句话说，干预组接受了伊维菌素（每天24毫克），而对照组没有收到任何东西。这是一件坏事。这意味着该研究产生的任何非难结果都非常毫无价值，因为安慰剂效应和其他混淆因素有如此多的措施来弄乱结果。对于艰难的结果，特别是死亡，它应该少了一个问题（尽管我们不会期望任何死亡在对大多数健康病患者的那些小型疾病中的那些小型研究中）。</p><p> The study included people over the age of 18 with symptoms suggestive of covid-19 and a positive PCR test. The average age of the participants was 40 years, and most had no underlying health issues. A total of 172 people were recruited in to the study.</p><p> 该研究包括18岁以上的人，症状暗示Covid-19和阳性PCR试验。参与者的平均年龄为40年，大多数人都没有潜在的健康问题。这项研究共招募了172人。</p><p> The researchers chose to look at how quickly people became free of symptoms as their primary endpoint. This is enormously problematic, since the study, as already mentioned, wasn’t blinded and there was no placebo. Any difference between the groups could easily be explained by the placebo effect and by biases towards treatment benefit among the researchers.</p><p> 研究人员选择了解人们自由症状的速度如何作为他们的主要终点。这是极大的问题，因为已经提到的研究没有蒙上蒙蔽，没有安慰剂。群体之间的任何差异都可以通过安慰剂效应和对研究人员之间的治疗益处的偏见来解释。</p><p> Anyway, the study found that 49% in the treatment group were free of symptoms at five to nine days after the beginning of treatment, compared with 81% in the control group. However, the lack of blinding means that this result is worthless. The methodology is just too flawed.</p><p> 无论如何，该研究发现，治疗组49％在治疗开始后的5至9天内没有症状，与对照组的81％相比。然而，缺乏致盲意味着这种结果是毫无价值的。方法论太缺陷了。</p><p> No data is provided on the number of people who died in each group. Since it isn’t reported, I think it’s safe to assume that there were no deaths in either group. Nor is any data provided on the number of hospitalizations in each group.</p><p> 在每组中死亡的人数没有任何数据。由于尚未报告，我认为假设任何一个群体都没有死亡是安全的。也不是每组住院人数的任何数据。</p><p>   Let’s move on and update our meta-analysis. The reason we need to do a meta-analysis here is that none of the trials of ivermectin is large enough on its own to provide a definitive answer as to whether it is a useful treatment for covid-19 or not. For those who haven’t heard of meta-analyses before, basically what you do is just take the results from all different studies in existence that fulfill your pre-selected criteria, and then put them together, so as a to create a single large “meta”-study. This allows you to produce results that have a much higher level of statistical significance. It is particularly useful in a situation where all the individual trials you have to work with are statistically underpowered (have too few participants), as is the case here.</p><p>   让我们继续前进并更新我们的META分析。这里需要进行META分析的原因是，Ivermectin的试验都没有足够的足够大，以便为Covid-19是一个有用的治疗，提供明确的答案。对于那些没有听说过Meta-Analys的人，基本上你所做的就是符合所有不同研究的结果，以满足您的预先选择的标准，然后将它们放在一起，以便作为一个创建一个大型“meta”-study。这允许您产生具有更高水平统计显着性的结果。它在与您必须使用的所有个人审判的情况下特别有用，在统计上受到统计资金（有太多的参与者），就像这里一样。 </p><p> In this new meta-analysis, I’ve included every double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial I could find of ivermectin as a treatment for covid. Using only double-blind placebo-controlled trials means that only the highest quality studies are included in this meta-analysis, which minimizes the risk of biases messing up the results as far as possible. In order to be included, a study also had to provide mortality data, since the goal of the meta-analysis is to see if there is any difference in mortality.</p><p>在这一新的荟萃分析中，我已经包括每次双盲随机安慰剂对照试验，我可以发现Ivermectin作为对Covid的治疗方法。仅使用双盲安慰剂对照试验意味着该荟萃分析中只有最高质量的研究，这最大限度地减少了尽可能最大限度地弄乱结果的偏差。为了包括在内，研究还必须提供死亡率数据，因为Meta分析的目标是看看死亡率是否有任何差异。</p><p> I was able to identify seven trials that fulfilled these criteria, with a total of 1,327 participants. Here’s what the meta-analysis shows:</p><p> 我能够识别七项试验，满足这些标准，共有1,327名参与者。以下是Meta分析显示的内容：</p><p>  What we see is a 62% reduction in the relative risk of dying among covid patients treated with ivermectin. That would mean that ivermectin prevents roughly three out of five covid deaths. The reduction is statistically significant (p-value 0,004). In other words, the weight of evidence supporting ivermectin continues to pile up. It is now far stronger than the evidence that led to widespred use of remdesivir earlier in the pandemic, and the effect is much larger and more important (remdesivir was only ever shown to marginally decrease length of hospital stay, it was never shown to have any effect on risk of dying).</p><p>  在伊维菌素治疗的Covid患者中死亡的相对风险降低了62％的62％。这将意味着伊维菌素预防五个covid死亡中的大约三个。减少是统计学意义的（p值0,004）。换句话说，支持伊维菌素的证据的重量继续堆积。现在比在大流行早期越来越多地使用雷德塞维尔的证据更强大，效果要大得多，更重要（Remdesivir只表现出勉强减少住院时间，从未显示过任何东西对染色风险的影响。</p><p> I understand why pharmaceutical companies don’t like ivermectin. It’s a cheap generic drug. Even Merck, the company that invented ivermectin, is doing it’s best to destroy the drug’s reputation at the moment. This can only be explained by the fact that Merck is currently developing two expensive new covid drugs, and doesn’t want an off-patent drug, which it can no longer make any profit from, competing with them.</p><p> 我理解为什么制药公司不喜欢Ivermectin。这是一款廉价的仿制药。即使是默克，那些发明Ivermectin的公司也正在尽最大努力在此刻摧毁药物的声誉。这只能通过默克目前正在开发两种昂贵的新科迪药物的事实来解释，并且不希望投入专利药物，它不能再与他们竞争中的任何利润。</p><p> The only reason I can think to understand why the broader medical establishment, however, is still so anti-ivermectin is that these studies have all been done outside the rich west. Apparently doctors and scientists outside North America and Western Europe can’t be trusted, unless they’re saying things that are in line with our pre-conceived notions.</p><p> 然而，我唯一可以理解为什么更广泛的医疗机构仍然如此抗伊维因素是这些研究都在富裕的西方完成。显然，北美和西欧以外的医生和科学家不能值得信任，除非他们说与我们预先构建的概念一致的东西。</p><p> Researchers at McMaster university are currently organizing a large trial of ivermectin as a treatment for covid-19, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. That trial is expected to enroll over 3,000 people, so it should be definitive. It’s going to be very interesting to see what it shows when the results finally get published.</p><p> 麦克马斯特大学的研究人员目前正在组织伊维菌素的大型试验，作为Covid-19的待遇，由票据和Melinda Gates基金会资助。预计该试验将注册超过3,000人，因此应该是最终的。当结果最终发布时，它会非常有趣。</p><p> I am rolling out a ton of new content over the coming months.
