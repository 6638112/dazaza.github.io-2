But you’re a frugal time traveler, so you elect to travel third class (only £8!).</p><p>假设您在1912年去过英国伦敦，并购买了RMS泰坦尼克号的首航票。但是您是节俭的时光旅行者，因此您选择旅行三等舱（仅8英镑！）。</p><p> That would place you on F deck, six levels below the lifeboats, and mere tens of feet from the starboard hull, which a 1.5 million ton iceberg punctures open at 11:40 pm on April 14, 1912.</p><p> 这将使您处于F甲板上，位于救生艇以下六层，距右舷船体仅数十英尺，150万吨的冰山在1912年4月14日晚上11:40穿破。</p><p> Eighty-four years later, a scientific expedition to the bottom of the Northern Atlantic ocean recovered a chronometer from the bridge of  Titanic. It stopped the moment it hit the water, at 2:11 am.</p><p> 84年后，对北大西洋海底的一次科学考察从泰坦尼克号桥上恢复了天文钟。当它撞到水面时，它在凌晨2:11停止了。</p><p>   That seems like it would be enough time, but out of  Titanic’s 702 steerage passengers, only 178 survived. That’s for a few reasons. The first is simple logistics.  Titanic had lifeboats for only half of its passengers, and in steerage you&#39;re not only bunked the farthest from them, but the escape route is a labyrinth of unmarked and heretofore off-limits tunnels and ladders. And even if you do somehow find the way, crew members haphazardly block steerage passengers from ascending to the upper-class decks. Even with the best preparation, your odds of acquiring a seat are low. And if you fail, a long arctic swim awaits. But do not be alarmed. The maze, discrimination, chaos, and cold can be overcome if you make a few bold and counterintuitive choices.</p><p>   这似乎是足够的时间，但是泰坦尼克号的702名领航乘客中只有178人幸存。有几个原因。首先是简单的物流。泰坦尼克号的救生艇仅能容纳一半的乘客，而且在操纵时，您不仅要离他们最远，而且逃生路线是迷宫般的迷宫，至今尚未通行。即使您以某种方式找到了出路，机组人员也会随意阻止引导乘客登上上层甲板。即使准备得最好，您获得座位的几率也很低。如果失败了，那么漫长的北极游泳将在等待中。但是不要惊慌。如果做出一些大胆而违反直觉的选择，就可以克服迷宫，歧视，混乱和寒冷。</p><p>  The first days of your voyage will go by unremarkably. To pass the time, you should venture to the back poop deck for games and fresh air, enjoy a card game in the third-class saloon or, if you happen to see a crew member, perhaps suggest the boat slow down. Because as it is,  Titanic is navigating icebergs off the coast of Newfoundland at far too great a speed. And on the night of April 14, 1912, just as you’re settling into your bunk in the forward section of F deck,  Titanic sideswipes one at 22 knots.</p><p>  您航行的头几天会变得平淡无奇。为了打发时间，您应该冒险去后船甲板玩游戏，呼吸新鲜空气，在三等轿车中玩纸牌游戏，或者，如果您碰巧遇到船员，建议您慢船。因为实际上，泰坦尼克号正以极快的速度在纽芬兰沿海航行着冰山。在1912年4月14日晚上，就在您进入F甲板前部的铺位时，泰坦尼克号以22节的速度向一侧擦拭。</p><p> You’ll be one of the closest passengers to the impact, but even so the jolt will feel relatively benign. Perhaps even anticlimactic. One fireman bunked even closer to the collision than you claimed to have slept through the incident entirely. “Dead to the wide [world],” he later told investigators. Other, lighter sleepers describe the sound as a “big vibration,” “a large cable being run out,” “a grinding crash,” “crunching and jarring,” or like “a basket of coals dumped on an iron plate.”</p><p> 您将是最接近撞击的乘客之一，但即使如此，颠簸也将带来相对温和的感觉。也许甚至是滑稽的。一名消防员比您声称完全睡过事故的地方更靠近撞车道。他后来对调查人员说：“死于整个世界。”其他一些较轻的枕木将声音描述为“巨大的振动”，“一根大的电缆被用完”，“磨碎的撞击”，“嘎吱作响”，或者像“一篮子煤被扔在铁板上”。</p><p>  Because the lurch is so mild, few of the passengers will initially suspect a serious problem. Of course, there is a serious problem. You’re six decks below the lifeboats, and seven tons of water are rushing into the lower holds every second. You need to act.</p><p>  因为倾斜是如此温和，所以很少有乘客最初会怀疑是严重的问题。当然，这是一个严重的问题。您位于救生艇下方的六个甲板上，每秒有七吨水涌入下层货舱。您需要采取行动。 </p><p> Your first instinct will be to immediately sprint out of your bunk. Don’t.</p><p>您的第一个本能将是立即冲出铺位。别。</p><p> Instead, change into your finest clothing. Put on a tux, a dress, or at the very least brush your hair.</p><p> 相反，换上你最好的衣服。穿上晚礼服，礼服，或者至少刷一下头发。</p><p> The lifeboats are on the first-class deck. They are an invitation-only party that you need to crash. It will help if you look the part.</p><p> 救生艇在头等舱甲板上。他们是仅限受邀方，您需要崩溃。如果您看零件，它将有所帮助。</p><p> After you’ve changed, put on your life jacket (called a &#34;life belt&#34; here on  Titanic). It should be stored above your bunk. You’re likely to need it. Getting dressed will take a few extra minutes, but don’t worry.  Titanic is sinking, but it’s doing so slowly.</p><p> 更换后，穿上救生衣（在此处称为“泰坦尼克号”上的“安全带”）。它应存储在您的铺位上方。您可能会需要它。穿衣服需要多花几分钟，但请放心。泰坦尼克号正在沉没，但进展缓慢。</p><p> The great ship takes nearly three hours to finally go below, and it’s almost graceful in its descent. It never capsizes nor even takes on a serious list. It sinks so slowly you could make an  interminable movie out of its demise. As a result, you not only have extra time to prepare yourself in your bunk, but when you make it to the decks, instead of the sheer chaos that accompanies most founderings, you’ll find a sociological cocktail of gallantry, cowardice, courage, chivalry, sacrifice, prayer, panic, and even music. The time  Titanic takes to founder allows you to escape from even its lowest holds, but it also produces a dramatic story of human drama that partially explains the wreck’s infamy. Shipwrecks don’t always occur this way, especially at the turn of the century, which partially explains why  Titanic lacked sufficient lifeboats. Ship designers and passengers at the time didn’t expect to survive a shipwreck long enough to use one anyway. They viewed lifeboats as token nods to safety, like seat cushions-as-floatation devices.</p><p> 这艘伟大的船要花近三个小时才能最终驶入下方，下降时几乎是优美的。它永远不会倾覆，甚至不会出现严重的问题。它下沉的速度如此之慢，您可以制作出一部永无止境的电影。结果，您不仅有更多的时间准备自己的铺位，而且在甲板上坐下来时，会发现社会学上充满了勇气，怯ward，勇气，骑士精神，牺牲，祈祷，恐慌，甚至音乐。泰坦尼克号花在创办人身上的时间甚至可以让您摆脱最低限度的打击，但同时也产生了一部戏剧性的人类戏剧故事，部分解释了沉船的侮辱。沉船事故并非总是以这种方式发生，尤其是在世纪之交时，这在一定程度上解释了为什么泰坦尼克号缺乏足够的救生艇。当时的船舶设计人员和乘客没想到会在沉船事故中幸存足够长的时间以至于无法使用它。他们将救生艇视为安全的象征，就像坐垫浮动装置一样。</p><p>  When I asked ship designer and naval architect Jan-Erik Wahl why  Titanic sank in this unfathomably sturdy way, he told me it has everything to do with the exact nature of the damage and the design of the hull.</p><p>  当我问船舶设计师和海军建筑师扬·埃里克·瓦尔（Jan-Erik Wahl）为什么泰坦尼克号以这种坚不可摧的沉没方式沉没时，他告诉我，这与损坏的确切性质和船体设计有关。</p><p>  As you’re tightening your tie or adjusting your finest gown, water is rushing in through a series of small slits sliced into the forward starboard hull.</p><p>  当您系紧领带或调整最上等的礼服时，水会从切成小块的小缝隙中涌入，这些小缝隙被切入前右舷船体。 </p><p> The extent of the damage is relatively minor. The size of the holes, added up, only amounts to the surface area of a small closet door. Unfortunately, the locations of the holes could hardly have been worse.</p><p>损害程度相对较小。孔的大小加起来，仅等于小壁橱门的表面积。不幸的是，孔的位置几乎不会更糟。</p><p> Like many ships today,  Titanic had a series of waterproof walls—called bulkheads or partitions—running across its width. These bulkheads are designed to compartmentalize any flooding so that a single gash doesn’t flood the entire ship, but though these waterproof sections are sometimes called compartments, that’s a bit of a misnomer because these sections don’t have ceilings. Instead,  Titanic’s bulkheads extend approximately 50 feet above the water line and then stop. (The bulkheads have watertight doors that the captain of  Titanic sealed immediately after impact, but nobody is trapped. There are escape ladders to climb above the bulkheads.)</p><p> 像今天的许多船只一样，泰坦尼克号也有一系列防水墙（称为舱壁或隔板），其宽度贯穿整个墙。这些舱壁旨在将任何洪水区分开，以使单个瓦斯不会淹没整艘船，但是尽管这些防水部分有时被称为舱室，但这有点用词不当，因为这些部分没有天花板。取而代之的是，泰坦尼克号的舱壁从水线上方延伸了约50英尺，然后停了下来。 （舱壁有水密门，泰坦尼克号的船长在撞击后立即将其密封，但没有人被困。有逃生梯子爬到舱壁上方。）</p><p>  Because a boat will flood until the water inside the hull levels with the water outside of it,  Titanic could float as long as the weight of the inflowing water did not drop the bow more than 50 feet.  Titanic’s architects designed the boat such that four of the forward sections could flood and the boat would still float high enough to keep the top of its bulkheads above the waterline. 1</p><p>  由于船将淹没直到船体内部的水与船体外部的水齐平，因此泰坦尼克号可能会漂浮，只要流入的水的重量不会使船首掉落超过50英尺。泰坦尼克号的建筑师设计了这样的船，使得四个前部可能会淹没，并且船仍会漂浮得足够高，以使舱壁的顶部保持在水线之上。 1个</p><p> 1A ship’s stability in flooded conditions was such an extraordinarily complex calculation prior to computer modeling that it was like forecasting the weather using pen and paper. Wahl told me that when he did it longhand for a ship he designed, the arithmetic alone took him some six months.</p><p> 1A船在淹没条件下的稳定性在进行计算机建模之前是非常复杂的计算，就像用笔和纸来预测天气一样。瓦尔告诉我，当他为自己设计的船做长时工作时，仅算术一项就花了他六个月的时间。</p><p> Unfortunately, the iceberg sliced holes into five of them.  Titanic took on 16,000 tons of water, the bow dropped more than 50 feet, and seawater flooded over the top of the bulkheads.</p><p> 不幸的是，冰山把其中的五个切成薄片。泰坦尼克号吸收了16,000吨水，船首掉落了50多英尺，海水淹没了舱壁的顶部。</p><p> Had the bulkheads been 20 feet taller, or if  Titanic had rammed the iceberg head on and thus contained the damage to the forward sections, the boat would have likely “come to harbor,” according to testimony of its assistant designer Edward Wilding. The moment it punctured five compartments, as the investigating commissioner later said, “the epitaph of the ship had been written.” 2</p><p> 根据其助理设计师爱德华·怀尔德（Edward Wilding）的证词，如果舱壁高20英尺，或者如果泰坦尼克号撞上了冰山，从而遏制了前段的损坏，那么这艘船很可能会“窝藏”。正如调查专员后来所说的那样，当它刺穿五个车厢时，“船上的墓志已经写好了。” 2</p><p> 2 That might not be  entirely correct. At least, not if a time traveler like you who knows exactly what happened were there. We now know the bulkheads  nearly stayed above the waterline, which means if you can prevent approximately 20 percent of the forward compartments from flooding, you may be able to save the ship. Don’t bother trying to plug the holes. Even with the help of the entire crew, that would not have worked, according to Wilding. Instead, your best chance would be to fill up the flooding sections with enough bulky, lightweight material to displace the heavier volume of water. One rather risky suggestion, proposed in the National Geographic documentary  Titanic: The Final Word With James Cameron: Gather  all 3,500 life jackets on the ship and stuff them into boiler room 6 in under 40 minutes. You just might save the ship.</p><p> 2这可能并不完全正确。至少，如果像您这样的时光旅行者确切地知道发生了什么，那不是。现在我们知道舱壁几乎停留在水线上方，这意味着如果您可以防止大约20％的前舱淹没，则可以救助该船。不用费劲去塞孔。根据Wilding的说法，即使在全体船员的帮助下，这也行不通。取而代之的是，您最好的机会是用足够大的轻质材料填充洪水区域，以代替大量的水。在《国家地理》纪录片《泰坦尼克号：詹姆斯·卡梅隆的最终决定》中提出了一个相当冒险的建议：收集船上所有3500件救生衣，并在40分钟内将它们塞进6号锅炉房。您可能会救船。 </p><p> Titanic’s bulkheads may have been too short to save the ship, but they do explain why you have so much time to escape. Because the water level inside and outside the ship nearly equalized, the flooding inflow slowed to a trickle for almost 20 minutes before water crested the bulkheads and began rushing in anew. Even more critically, the bulkheads were largely responsible for keeping the ship upright. If water had been allowed to move throughout the entire hold, it would have piled onto the ship’s listing side like water in a tilted drinking glass. Naval architects refer to this as the &#34;free surface effect,&#34; and if a ship’s hold doesn’t restrict flooded water—or if the water had been trapped on one side—the 50,000-ton ship would have turned turtle within 15 minutes, according to Wilding. If that were the case, no lifeboats would have launched, and you would have been trapped in a watery grave deep below deck.</p><p>泰坦尼克号的舱壁可能太短，无法挽救飞船，但它们确实说明了为什么您有这么多时间逃脱。由于船内和船外的水位几乎相等，因此洪水涌入le流将近20分钟，之后水顶住舱壁并开始重新涌入。更重要的是，舱壁在很大程度上负责保持船舶直立。如果允许水在整个船舱中移动，它会像倾斜的水杯中的水一样堆积在船的航行侧。海军建筑师将此称为“自由表面效应”。根据Wilding的说法，如果船的船舱不限制洪水泛滥，或者如果水被困在一侧，那么这艘5万吨级的船将在15分钟内变成乌龟。如果真是这样，那么就不会有救生艇下水，而您将被困在甲板深处的水坑中。</p><p> Of course,  Titanic’s slow and steady drop revealed the many other inequities and paltry safety precautions that occurred.</p><p> 当然，泰坦尼克号的缓慢而平稳的下降揭示了发生的许多其他不平等和微不足道的安全预防措施。</p><p>  Not only had there been no lifeboat drills, the crew provided steerage passengers almost no direction at all. Few had any notion of how to rise up to the otherwise-forbidden decks. So instead of heading upward, most of the third-class passengers headed toward the back poop deck.</p><p>  不仅没有救生艇演习，而且机组人员几乎完全没有为引导乘客提供方向。很少有人知道如何上升到原本禁止的甲板上。因此，大多数三等舱乘客都没有朝上，而是朝后船尾甲板行驶。</p><p> Do not do this. Instead, you need to go straight up using the unannounced, unsigned evacuation routes. There are two.</p><p> 不要这样做。相反，您需要直接使用未通知的未签名疏散路线。那里有两个。</p><p> To find the first, climb the tight stairwell to the main working alleyway on the port side—called Scotland Road—and use the escape stairs located behind the elevators (see map below). These doors are normally locked, but according to testimony by  Titanic’s head baker, Charles Joughlin, someone opened them “very early” in the evening. Sometime between 12:15 and 12:30, he estimates. But even if it’s the latter, that still leaves you 10 minutes to make the first lifeboat.</p><p> 要找到第一个，请爬紧的楼梯间，到左舷的主要工作小巷，即苏格兰路，然后使用位于电梯后面的逃生梯（请参见下面的地图）。这些门通常是上锁的，但是据泰坦尼克号的首席面包师查尔斯·乔夫林（Charles Joughlin）的证词，有人在傍晚“很早”将其打开。他估计在12:15到12:30之间的某个时间。但是，即使是后者，您仍然有10分钟的时间来制造第一艘救生艇。</p><p>  Alternatively, if for some reason you find these doors still locked, go to the forward steerage deck and use the escape ladders to climb up the successive levels. A few third-class survivors who used these report hearing a few crew members asking them not to. Apparently, they ignored them. You should too.</p><p>  或者，如果由于某种原因您发现这些门仍然锁着，请转到前转向甲板，并使用逃生梯爬上连续的关卡。使用这些报告的一些三等幸存者听到了一些机组人员的询问，要求他们不要这样做。显然，他们忽略了它们。你也应该</p><p>  Once you’re on the top level, you’ll find lifeboats on both the port and starboard sides readying to launch. Which side you use is important, and the best choice depends on your age and gender.  Titanic’s crew preferentially loaded women and children into lifeboats, but we can see from passenger manifests that the crew on the port side followed this policy more strictly. At one point an officer loading the port-side boats named Harold Lowe even fires a warning shot from his pistol and declares, “If any man jumps onto the boat I will shoot him like a dog.” Clearly, if you’re a woman or below the age of 13, head straight for this officer Lowe. Otherwise, go to starboard.</p><p>  到达最高层后，您会在左舷和右舷找到准备下水的救生艇。使用哪一侧很重要，最佳选择取决于您的年龄和性别。泰坦尼克号的船员优先将妇女和儿童装上救生艇，但是从乘客的证件中我们可以看出，左舷的船员更加严格地遵守了这项政策。有一次，一位装载着哈罗德·洛（Harold Lowe）港口船的军官甚至向他的手枪开了警告枪，并宣称：“如果有人跳上船，我会像狗一样向他开枪。”显然，如果您是女性或13岁以下的女性，请直奔Lowe军官。否则，请前往右舷。 </p><p> If you can catch a ride on one of these first boats—fantastic! You’re saved. But sadly, even if you arrive early and even if you’re dressed in your finest, the chances you are selected may be no better than a coin flip. And by 1:15 am, even those odds become generous. By then, the decks crowd considerably. But don’t panic. There is a plan B. If at 1:15 you’re still wanting for a ride, steel your nerves and head back down into the bowels of the sinking ship.</p><p>如果您可以乘坐这些第一艘船中的一艘，那就太好了！您已保存。但可悲的是，即使您提早到达，即使您穿着得体，也有可能被选为抛硬币的最佳选择。到了凌晨1:15，即使是那些赔率也变得很大。到那时，甲板上已经相当拥挤了。但是不要惊慌。有一个计划B。如果您在1:15仍想骑车，请紧张一下，向后沉入沉船的肠内。</p><p>  We know from eyewitness testimony that just after 1 am, while loading lifeboat 6 to half capacity (most of them had seats for 65 people), second officer Charles Lightroller orders boatswain Alfred Nichols and six other men to go below deck and open the gangway doors. These doors allow passengers to directly access the lower decks from the dock, and they would have provided an avenue for steerage passengers to escape into the lifeboats without climbing to the top deck. It was a good plan, but unfortunately officer Lightroller is the last person to see Nichols and his men alive, and no passengers ever escape using the gangway doors.</p><p>  从目击者的证词中我们知道，仅在凌晨1点，当将6艘救生艇装载到一半的能力（其中大多数可容纳65人）时，副驾驶Charles Lightroller命令船长阿尔弗雷德·尼科尔斯和其他六名男子进入甲板以下并打开舷梯门。这些门使乘客可以从码头直接进入下层甲板，并且本来可以为引导乘客提供进入救生艇而无需爬上顶层甲板的通道。这是一个很好的计划，但不幸的是，莱特罗勒军官是最后一个看到尼科尔斯和他的人还活着的人，而且没有乘客使用舷梯门逃生。</p><p> Nevertheless, there is some reason to believe you could. Submersibles have since spotted the gangway door on  Titanic’s forward port D deck doors wide open, allowing for the possibility that Nichols and his men managed to open the door before drowning. But because no passengers were informed or aware of this escape route, it went unused.</p><p> 尽管如此，仍有一些理由使您相信。自那以后，潜水器就在泰坦尼克号前D舱甲板上发现了舷梯门敞开，这使尼科尔斯和他的下属在溺水前设法打开了舱门。但是因为没有任何乘客被告知或不知道这条逃生路线，所以它没有使用。</p><p>  I would suggest that if you haven’t secured a seat by 1:15 am, you try it.</p><p>  我建议，如果您到凌晨1:15还没有确定座位，请尝试一下。</p><p>  If you arrive at deck D when Nichols does—presumably by 1:30—you might find an open door and a steady stream of half-filled lifeboats being lowered right by you. Thomas Jones, the crew member in charge of lifeboat 8, later testified that he would have rescued passengers at the gangway doors had he seen any. “If they had been down there, we could have taken them,” he told the commission.</p><p>  如果您在Nichols到达时到达D层甲板（大概是在1:30时），您可能会发现敞开的门和一排排半满的救生艇被您降下。负责救生艇8的机组人员托马斯·琼斯（Thomas Jones）后来作证说，如果他看见任何东西，他将在舷梯门救出乘客。他告诉委员会说：“如果他们在那儿，我们可能会带走他们。”</p><p> Of course, because no passengers escaped using these doors, this exit remains somewhat speculative. There’s a chance you’ll arrive and discover Nichols never made it or arrived too late. And if they’re not opened by 1:45—you should wait no longer. Head back up. D deck will soon dip below the waterline.</p><p> 当然，因为没有乘客使用这些门逃逸，所以这个出口仍然有些投机。您很可能会到达，发现尼科尔斯从未做到或来得太迟。而且，如果未在1:45之前将其打开，则您应该不再等待。回头D甲板很快将浸入水线以下。</p><p> By this time, hitching a ride on a lifeboat becomes unlikely. 3 Only a few remain, and the surge to get on them is so intense the crew members lock arms at one point to hold back the crowd. So you’re going to have to swim. But that isn’t the death sentence it might seem. Lifeboats plucked at least five swimmers from the water and more from two overturned lifeboats. With the proper preparation, you still have a chance.</p><p> 到这个时候，搭便车成为不可能。 3只剩下少数人了，要赶上他们的浪潮是如此之猛烈，机组人员将武器锁定在某一点上以阻挡人群。因此，您将不得不游泳。但这似乎不是死刑判决。救生艇从水中拉出至少五名游泳者，从两艘倾覆的救生艇中拉出更多。经过适当的准备，您仍然有机会。 </p><p> 3The ship carried four collapsable life rafts, too. C left at 1:40 with 44 out of 47 seats taken.D left at 2:05 with 25 out of 47 seats taken. The crew never launched boats A and B but they do float off Titanic as it sinks.</p><p>3这艘船也载有四个可折叠的救生筏。 C在1:40离开，占据47个座位中的44个席位; D在2:05离开，占据47个座位中的25个席位。机组人员从未发射过A和B船，但它们确实在泰坦尼克号沉没时漂浮下来。</p><p> When the  Titanic band plays its final song—perhaps either   Songe d’Automne or   Nearer, My God, to Thee (eye-witness testimony is mixed)—and the boat’s rear rises, that&#39;s your cue to head to the stern and hold onto the railing.  Titanic’s bow will soon dip deep into the water, gradually lifting the stern so high its propellers clear the waterline. Once the boat gains approximately 20 degrees of tilt, it cracks in half. The bow drops to the bottom of the ocean, and the stern rises again.</p><p> 当《泰坦尼克号》乐队演唱最后一首歌时-也许是Songe d'Automne或《我的上帝的近者》，向您展示（目击者的证词混杂）-并且船尾升起，这提示您前往船尾并抓住栏杆。泰坦尼克号的船首很快就会沉入水中，逐渐将船尾提起，使其螺旋桨高至清理水线。一旦船获得大约20度的倾斜度，它就会裂开一半。船首掉落到海底，船尾再次升起。</p><p> While this happens, you should be using your vantage to look for the nearest lifeboats. According to the testimony of survivor Jack Thayer, the boats are 400 to 500 yards away at this point. Pick the nearest one, shed the fancy clothes, tighten your life jacket and, if you have a warm hat, put it on.</p><p> 发生这种情况时，您应该利用自己的优势寻找最近的救生艇。根据幸存者杰克·泰耶（Jack Thayer）的证词，此时的船只距离酒店400至500码。选择最近的衣服，脱下漂亮的衣服，收紧救生衣，如果有保暖帽，戴上它。</p><p>  The water you’re about to enter is a few notches below freezing. At this temperature, it will take around 45 minutes for your body to drop below 80 degrees and for you to go into cardiac arrest. But in reality, you’ll have far less time to swim the 500 yards. After only 15 minutes your arms and legs will numb to the point of incapacitation. If you fail to make it to a lifeboat in time, you’ll bob about helplessly in your life jacket while you await cardiac arrest.</p><p>  您将要进入的水在冰点以下几级。在此温度下，您的身体降至80度以下并进入心脏骤停状态大约需要45分钟。但实际上，您游到500码处的时间要少得多。仅15分钟后，您的手臂和腿就会麻木，直至失去能力。如果您未能及时赶上救生艇，则在等待心脏骤停时，会无助地穿上救生衣。</p><p> Sign up for our  Longreads newsletter for the best features, ideas, and investigations from WIRED.</p><p> 订阅我们的Longreads电子报，了解WIRED的最佳功能，想法和调查。</p><p> Nevertheless, 500 yards in under 15 minutes is manageable. A decent swimmer could make it in a pool. But of course, cold-water swimming is a little different than swimming in a pool. In super-cold temperatures, your body’s ability to produce and retain heat plays a far more important role than pure speed, which is why the world’s best pool swimmers look like underwear models while the best cold-water swimmers look more like polar bears. If you’re the polar-bear body type, you stand a far greater chance of survival. But even if you look like an underwear model, do not despair. You just need to be a fast underwear model. According to a  study published in  Extreme Physiology &amp; Medicine, a cold-water swimmer can be big and fast, big and slow, or even skinny and fast. They just can’t be skinny and slow. That combination quickly leads to hypothermia and heart attacks. So if you’re in this latter category, look for two overturned lifeboats floating near the  Titanic that the crew had failed to launch. A few dozen passengers survive on these by lying and standing atop them. Otherwise, prepare to swim 500 yards in 15 minutes.</p><p> 然而，在15分钟内500码是可以控制的。体面的游泳者可以在游泳池里游泳。但是，当然，冷水游泳与在游泳池中游泳有些不同。在超冷温度下，您身体产生和保持热量的能力比纯速度要重要得多，这就是为什么世界上最好的泳池游泳者看起来像内衣模特，而最好的冷水游泳者看起来更像北极熊的原因。如果您是极地熊，那么您生存的机会就更大。但是，即使您看起来像内衣模特，也不要绝望。您只需要成为快速内衣模特。根据发表在《极限生理学》上的一项研究。在医学上，冷水游泳者可能既快又快，又慢又瘦，甚至快。他们只是不能瘦而缓慢。这种结合会迅速导致体温过低和心脏病发作。因此，如果您属于后一种类别，请寻找两名漂浮在泰坦尼克号附近的翻倒救生艇，而乘员未能下水。数十名乘客躺在他们的身上并站在那里，以此生存。否则，准备在15分钟内游泳500码。</p><p>  As the stern sinks into the ocean, you would think the suction would draw you into the depths—but survivors report no such thing. Joughlin claimed his hair was never even mussed. Still, you may experience what is called the cold-shock response. You’ll gasp uncontrollably and perhaps even hyperventilate. But keep your head above water, control your breathing, and the shock should pass.</p><p>  当船尾沉入海中时，您会以为吸力会把您吸引到深处，但幸存者没有举报。贾夫林声称他的头发从未被弄乱。尽管如此，您仍可能会遇到所谓的冷冲击响应。您会喘不过气来，甚至可能换气过度。但是将头保持在水上，控制呼吸，然后电击就会过去。 </p><p> Then start swimming. Don’t overexert yourself—you need to maintain this pace for 10 to 15 minutes. But work hard. The more heat you produce, the longer you’ll stay alive. Avoid other swimmers (they may try to climb on top of you), maintain your orientation, and call out for help when you near the boat. Your hands and feet will numb within five minutes, so you’ll need assistance getting in.</p><p>然后开始游泳。不要过度劳累-您需要保持10到15分钟的速度。但是要努力。产生的热量越多，寿命就越长。避开其他游泳者（他们可能会尝试爬上您的身体），保持您的方向，并在您靠近船时呼救。您的手脚会在五分钟内麻木，因此上车时需要帮助。</p><p> The boat should have plenty of space. Almost all the lifeboats are severely underfilled. But be careful as you climb out of the water. You may experience a dangerous decline in arterial blood pressure, particularly if you stand or exert yourself once aboard. At least one  Titanic swimmer died after being rescued. Warm yourself as best you can, and wait for the rescue ship  Carpathia that arrives at 4 am. Aboard the  Carpathia, you will finish your voyage to New York City uneventfully.</p><p> 船上应该有足够的空间。几乎所有的救生艇都严重注水。但是当您爬出水面时要小心。您可能会遇到危险的动脉血压下降，特别是如果您站着或站着大发脾气时。至少有一名泰坦尼克号游泳者在获救后死亡。尽自己最大的可能温暖，并等待凌晨4点到达的救援船喀尔巴阡。在喀尔巴阡上，您将顺利完成前往纽约市的旅程。</p><p> Once you arrive, pay a visit to the owner of the  Titanic, Mr. J. P. Morgan himself. He lives at 219 Madison Avenue. Ask for your £8 back.</p><p> 抵达后，去探望泰坦尼克号的所有人摩根大通先生。他住在麦迪逊大街219号。索回8英镑。</p><p>   📱 Torn between the latest phones?
