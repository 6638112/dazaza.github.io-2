It’s a story of reinvention. Domino’s had a 180-degree company overhaul and turned critics into superfans by being honest with themselves about their weaknesses. They took a huge, scary risk and completely scrapped and remade their core product: pizza.</p><p> 多米诺比萨饼的故事是英雄的旅程。这是一个重塑的故事。多米诺（Domino）对公司进行了180度的大修，并通过诚实地对待批评者的缺点将批评者转变为超级粉丝。他们冒着巨大的可怕风险，完全报废并重新制作了他们的核心产品：比萨。</p><p>  At the same time, the company has been perceptive about where their true value is for customers. They know customers love them because they’re convenient—and in recent years they’ve used technology to double down on the convenience and reliability that define the core of their brand.</p><p>  同时，该公司一直在感知其真正价值对客户的价值。他们知道客户之所以喜欢它们，是因为它们很方便-近年来，他们使用技术使定义其品牌核心的便捷性和可靠性提高了一倍。</p><p> This self-awareness, and the guts to act on it, has paid off. Now they’re punching far above their weight class. Domino’s stock has grown 90x from $2 to $180 since 2010. These growth rates dwarf those of Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple.</p><p> 这种自我意识以及采取行动的勇气已经得到回报。现在，他们的拳法远超他们的体重。自2010年以来，Domino的股价已从2美元增长到180美元，涨幅为90倍。</p><p> They’re also seeing a ton of engagement and feedback on social media from customers-turned-brand-advocates.</p><p> 他们还看到了来自客户转变为品牌的拥护者对社交媒体的大量参与和反馈。</p><p> Domino’s Pizza went from being an underperforming company in a very traditional industry with a bad core product to an inspiring, once-in-an-industry example of flawless brand awareness, product development, and marketing.</p><p> 多米诺的比萨饼从原来在传统行业中表现不佳的公司开始，其核心产品质量很差，而在业界一次鼓舞人心的例子中，其品牌知名度，产品开发和市场营销均无懈可击。</p><p> The kicker is that they pulled it off by thinking like a startup. Let’s take a closer look at how:</p><p> 更重要的是，他们像初创公司一样思考。让我们仔细看看如何： </p><p> Domino’s Pizza grew their company and brand in the early days and cemented their reputation for fast, cheap, convenient pizza delivery.</p><p>达美乐披萨在早期发展了自己的公司和品牌，并以快速，廉价，方便的披萨交付而巩固了声誉。</p><p> Domino’s listened to—and acted on—customer feedback and completely recreated their pizza recipe in response to criticism about the terrible taste.</p><p> 多米诺（Domino）倾听并采取了行动，以回应顾客对糟糕口味的批评，并完全重新制作了他们的比萨食谱。</p><p> Domino’s continued to reimagine ways to order pizza and is using all of the technology available to them to double down on convenience in ordering and delivery.</p><p> 多米诺（Domino）继续重新构想披萨的订购方式，并正在使用他们可用的所有技术来加倍订购和交付的便利性。</p><p> Go ahead and  order a pizza while you read on—it will be there soon.</p><p> 继续阅读，点一份披萨，很快就会到。</p><p>  Fifty years before Apple released its brand-defining iPhone, forty years before Salesforce brought software to the cloud, and thirty years before Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, two brothers started a pizza company that would become an innovator in business and technology and one of the most loved brands in America.</p><p>  在苹果发布其品牌定义的iPhone的50年之前，在Salesforce将软件引入云之前的40年，以及Tim Berners-Lee发明万维网的30年之前，两个兄弟创立了一家披萨公司，该公司将成为商业和技术领域的创新者也是美国最受欢迎的品牌之一。</p><p> The winding hero’s journey from growing franchise to public embarrassment to—finally—the stock-picker favorite began with some of the same best practices that we use in business today. Domino’s built a strong foundation for longevity because they understood their own core value and knew what their market wanted.</p><p> 从不断壮大的专营权到公众的尴尬，到最终成为股票选择者的最爱，英雄之旅始于我们今天在业务中使用的一些最佳实践。多米诺骨牌为长寿打下了坚实的基础，因为他们了解自己的核心价值，并且知道自己的市场想要什么。</p><p> Now, almost sixty years later, they’re still growing at a crazy pace. Their pace of innovation is putting other food brands, and even tech companies, to shame.</p><p> 现在，差不多六十年后，它们仍以惊人的速度增长。他们的创新步伐使其他食品品牌，甚至科技公司都蒙羞。 </p><p> And though their delivery guarantees, marketing campaigns, and even the pizza itself have gone through radical changes, most of their core principles are the same.</p><p>尽管他们的交货保证，营销活动乃至比萨饼本身都经历了根本的变化，但它们的大多数核心原则是相同的。</p><p> When Tom and Jim Monaghan took over an old pizza parlor in 1960 and started growing their own pizza business, they hit the top moves from the basic business playbook. Tom and Jim did a ton of research about the pizza industry and the competitors. They thought carefully about operations behind the scenes as they franchised and scaled. They entered into the market with one product, pizza, and began to expand out into a pizza ecosystem by adding new products like Cheesy Bread and Cinna Stix.</p><p> 1960年，汤姆（Tom）和吉姆·莫纳汉（Jim Monaghan）接管了一家老比萨店并开始发展自己的比萨业务时，他们从基本业务手册中走出了顶峰。汤姆和吉姆对披萨行业和竞争对手进行了大量研究。当他们进行特许经营和规模扩张时，他们仔细考虑了幕后的运作。他们以一种比萨饼产品进入市场，并通过添加诸如Cheesy Bread和Cinna Stix等新产品开始扩展到比萨饼生态系统。</p><p> But most importantly, they were very self-aware and would craft their brand and messaging around the things they knew were most important to their market. The founding team understood that Domino’s was not just a pizza company—it was also a pizza  delivery company. Convenience and reliability are always going to be important to people who are ordering pizza, and these are the core values that Domino’s recognized quickly and doubled down on in their early messaging and brand marketing.</p><p> 但最重要的是，他们非常自我意识，并且会根据他们所知道的对他们的市场最重要的事物来打造自己的品牌和信息。创始团队了解，多米诺骨牌不仅是一家比萨饼公司，而且还是一家比萨饼送货公司。对于订购披萨的人来说，便利性和可靠性始终至关重要，而这些正是Domino早在早期消息传递和品牌营销中迅速认可并加倍重视的核心价值。</p><p>  With these solid practices in place, the growth of the Domino’s Pizza empire was fast and furious. Here’s how these early years unfolded and how Domino’s spent its first 50 years establishing convenience as a brand.</p><p>  有了这些扎实的做法，多米诺比萨饼帝国的发展迅速而愤怒。以下是这些早期阶段的发展过程，以及Domino在最初50年间建立便利品牌的方式。</p><p> 1960: After working years of odd jobs and trying to save money for college, 23-year-old Tom Monaghan moved back to his hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan with his brother Jim. The two heard that a local pizza business, DomiNick’s, was up for sale. Tom took out a $900 loan from the Post Office credit union and  bought the shop in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Neither had a background in business or the pizza industry, but the brothers were excited to try their hand at running and expanding the local business. A few months after opening, Jim wanted out and traded his half of the business, leaving Tom as the only owner.</p><p> 1960年：23岁的汤姆·莫纳汉（Tom Monaghan）在从事了数年的零工工作并努力为大学存钱后，与哥哥吉姆（Jim）一起回到了密歇根州的安阿伯市。两人听说当地的一家比萨店DomiNick即将出售。汤姆从邮局信用合作社借了900美元，在密西根州伊普西兰蒂买了这家商店。他们既没有业务背景，也没有比萨饼行业，但是兄弟俩为尝试经营和扩展本地业务感到兴奋。开业几个月后，吉姆想出手并交易了一半的业务，而汤姆则是唯一的所有者。</p><p> In the very first few years, Tom made some smart business decisions that allowed the business to grow strong even while it was small. For example, he emphasized delivery quickly because the store itself didn’t have much seating. In another smart move, he cut back additional items he’d started adding to the menu, because he realized that focusing on pizza was operationally more manageable and turned better volume and revenue.  Profits grew from $99 a week to $750 a week.</p><p> 在最初的几年中，Tom做出了一些明智的业务决策，即使业务规模很小，也可以使业务发展壮大。例如，他强调快速交货是因为商店本身没有太多座位。另一个明智的举动是，他削减了开始添加到菜单中的其他项目，因为他意识到专注于比萨饼在操作上更易于管理，并且可以带来更好的销量和收入。利润从每周99美元增加到每周750美元。</p><p> 1965-1967: Tom Monaghan’s pizza business operated under the name DomiNick’s for several years. But the original owner wanted to maintain the rights to the name, so Monaghan chose “Domino’s Pizza” instead, put an ad for it in the Yellow Pages, and incorporated in 1965. Then he started franchising. This was pretty uncommon then, but Monaghan was determined to expand. The  terms for the franchise (where Domino’s would keep 2.5 percent as royalties from sales, 2 percent to cover advertising, and 1 percent for bookkeeping) were definitely tailored to motivate franchising and expansion rather than optimizing profits. Monaghan  said later in his autobiography,  “By today’s standards, the royalties were far too favorable to the franchisee. But it served our purpose then, and I was not concerned about covering all future contingencies.”</p><p> 1965-1967年：汤姆·莫纳汉（Tom Monaghan）的披萨生意以DomiNick的名义经营了好几年。但是最初的所有者想保留该名称的权利，因此莫纳汉（Monaghan）选择了“多米诺比萨饼”，并在黄页上刊登了广告，并于1965年注册成立。然后，他开始特许经营。那时这并不常见，但是Monaghan决心扩大规模。特许经营的条款（多米诺将保留销售特许权使用费的2.5％，广告收入的2％和簿记业务的1％）绝对是为了激励特许经营和扩张而不是优化利润而量身定制的。莫纳汉后来在自传中说：“按今天的标准，特许权使用费对加盟商来说太有利了。但这达到了我们的目的，我并不担心涵盖所有未来的意外情况。” </p><p> 1973: Fast delivery and great service had always been a priority for Monaghan. He spent the first ten years of his pizza business trying to streamline and improve delivery, cutting ingredients out of the pizza recipe for faster cook time and designing corrugated boxes that would keep pizza hot during delivery. But one of the biggest improvements on delivery time came from franchising. Now the company was franchising so quickly that they opened a College of Pizzarology to train people who wanted to open a franchised store. This was brilliant for the company’s growth because it ensured that branding and operations remained consistent.</p><p>1973年：快捷的交货和优质的服务一直是Monaghan的首要任务。他在披萨业务的头十年中一直在尝试简化和改善配送，从披萨食谱中减少食材以加快烹饪时间，并设计了可以使披萨在配送期间保持高温的瓦楞纸箱。但是，交货时间上最大的改进之一来自特许经营。现在，该公司的特许经营速度如此之快，以至于他们开设了披萨学院，以培训想要开设特许商店的人们。这对于公司的成长非常出色，因为它可以确保品牌和运营保持一致。</p><p> By spreading out to more areas, Domino’s Pizza could be more confident that a store would be close to a customer’s home.  This inspired Domino’s first delivery guarantee: “a half hour or a half dollar off.” This slogan gained a lot of press attention and helped customers start to associate the brand with fast and convenient delivery.</p><p> 通过扩展到更多区域，多米诺比萨饼店可以更自信地认为商店将靠近客户家。这激发了Domino的第一笔交付保证：“半小时或半美元的折扣。”这个口号引起了媒体的广泛关注，并帮助客户开始将品牌与快速便捷的交付联系起来。</p><p> 1978: Domino’s continued to drive growth beyond just franchising—in the late 1970s, they also led several mergers with other regional pizza companies. This allowed them to gain territory in more geographical areas very quickly. For example, they acquired Pizza Co, Inc. and gained 23 new stores in Kansas, Arizona, and Nebraska.</p><p> 1978年：多米诺骨牌（Domino）继续推动增长，而不仅仅是特许经营-在1970年代后期，他们还领导了与其他地区比萨饼公司的几次合并。这使他们能够很快地在更多地理区域中获得领土。例如，他们收购了Pizza Co，Inc.，并在堪萨斯州，亚利桑那州和内布拉斯加州开设了23家新店。</p><p> 1979: Domino’s continued the rapid acquisition and expansion and merged with Mueller’s Ohio Pizza Enterprises, Inc. and added 50 stores in Ohio and Texas. At this point they’d grown to 287 stores internationally and announced plans to expand internationally.  Because they were growing so quickly, they had to take some big operational measures to keep things like quality assurance, training, brand, and finances in check. For example, Monaghan hired Doug Dawson as a VP of marketing and corporate treasurer, and John McDevitt as a financial consultant. They helped him create new accounting methods and systems for loaning money to franchisees. To keep operations under control, Monaghan also divided the business nationwide into regions with regional managers.  Monaghan said the decision “gave us the long communication lines with tight controls at the working ends that we needed for rapid but well-orchestrated growth.”</p><p> 1979年：多米诺（Domino）继续快速地进行收购和扩张，并与穆勒（Mueller）的俄亥俄披萨企业有限公司合并，并在俄亥俄和德克萨斯州增加了50家商店。目前，他们在国际上已发展到287家商店，并宣布了在国际上扩张的计划。由于它们发展如此之快，因此他们必须采取一些重大的运营措施来控制质量保证，培训，品牌和财务状况。例如，莫纳汉（Monaghan）聘请道格·道森（Doug Dawson）担任营销副总裁兼公司财务主管，约翰·麦克德维特（John McDevitt）担任财务顾问。他们帮助他创建了新的会计方法和系统来向特许人借钱。为了控制运营，莫纳汉（Monaghan）还将全国范围的业务划分为区域经理。 Monaghan表示，这一决定“使我们能够在工作端进行长期的严格控制，这是我们快速但精心安排的增长所需要的。”</p><p> The same year, Domino’s also began their “30 minutes or it’s free” delivery guarantee. This was another huge move to cement their niche in the increasingly competitive pizza market. They wanted to win customers’ hearts and carve out a space in their brain with the guarantee of fast delivery. The marketing strategy was hugely effective for winning customers because the guarantee of speedy delivery  or free pizza was a win-win. On the other hand, it didn’t have as positive of an effect on the brand as they would have expected. Even though customers did come to associate Domino’s with fast delivery,  they also gained a reputation for recklessness and disregard for public safety because the policy encouraged delivery drivers to speed.</p><p> 同年，Domino也开始提供“ 30分钟或免费”的送货保证。这是在竞争日益激烈的比萨市场上巩固其利基地位的又一重大举措。他们希望赢得客户的心，并在保证快速交付的前提下在大脑中开拓出一块空间。营销策略对于赢得客户非常有效，因为保证快速交货或免费比萨饼是双赢的。另一方面，它对品牌的影响并不像他们预期的那样积极。即使客户确实希望将Domino与快速交付联系起来，但他们也因为鲁re和无视公共安全而赢得声誉，因为该政策鼓励交付驱动程序加快速度。</p><p> 1985: Advertising Age wrote that Domino’s was “among the fastest-growing money makers in the restaurant industry.” Just a few years earlier they’d opened their first non-U.S. store in Winnipeg, Canada, and began international expansion. To stay competitive, they needed to be growing this quickly—at this time, Domino’s faced competition from Pizza Hut, who had 4,000 units while Domino’s had 2,300. In response, they  raised their advertising spend 249% from the previous year. They introduced a  new advertising campaign to emphasize convenience and ease: “One Call Does It All.”  Just two years later, they’d grown total systemwide sales to $1.44 billion and had 3,605 units.</p><p> 1985年：《广告时代》写道，多米诺骨牌公司是“餐饮业中增长最快的赚钱者之一”。几年前，他们在加拿大温尼伯开设了第一家非美国商店，并开始国际扩张。为了保持竞争力，他们需要快速地成长-这时，多米诺面临着必胜客的竞争，必胜客拥有4,000个单位，而多米诺拥有2,300个。作为回应，他们将广告支出比上一年提高了249％。他们推出了一个新的广告活动，以强调方便性和简便性：“一个电话就能做到”。仅仅两年后，他们的系统总销售额就增长到了14.4亿美元，拥有3,605辆。</p><p>  1993:  After over 20 deaths involving Domino’s drivers, Domino’s ended their “30 minutes or it’s free” delivery guarantee. Monaghan’s  official statement on the end of the policy: “With our success in home delivery has come a negative public perception that we are not committed to safety.” Convenience and delivery remained central to the company’s brand, but the specific delivery guarantee was dropped.</p><p>  1993年：在Domino司机死亡20多例之后，Domino终止了“ 30分钟或免费”的送货保证。莫纳汉（Monaghan）在政策结束时的官方声明：“随着我们在送货上门的成功，公众对我们不致力于安全的看法是负面的。”便利和交付仍然是公司品牌的核心，但是特定的交付保证已被放弃。 </p><p> 1999: Monaghan retired as chairman and CEO David A. Brandon took over. Monaghan had created a strong foundation for the business, but Brandon was primed to continue expanding with an eye on the bottom line. He was known to ruthlessly shut down underperforming stores, but also aggressively added new franchises.  Within two years, Brandon had added  758 new stores. Domino’s also opened their 2,000th overseas location. Brandon was a marketing pro and under his leadership, Domino’s began to add new products after nearly 40 years of serving just one kind of pizza.</p><p>1999年：莫纳汉（Monaghan）退休，担任董事长兼首席执行官大卫·布兰登（David A. Brandon）接任。 Monaghan为该业务奠定了坚实的基础，但Brandon着眼于利润底线，希望继续扩展。众所周知，他无情地关闭了表现不佳的商店，但也积极增加了新的特许经营权。在两年内，布兰登增加了758家新店。多米诺也开设了他们在海外的第2,000个地点。布兰登（Brandon）是一名营销专家，在他的领导下，多米诺（Domino）在仅提供一种比萨饼服务近40年后便开始添加新产品。</p><p> 2001: As part of Brandon’s drive to expand and add additional revenue streams, Domino’s added two new products: Cheesy Bread and Cinna Stix. Competition in pizza delivery was still intense, and offering additional food items gave Domino another way to gain an edge. Customers definitely appreciated the additions. That year, systemwide sales grew 6.8 percent over the previous year, reaching $3.78 billion.</p><p> 2001年：作为Brandon扩展和增加其他收入来源的努力的一部分，Domino添加了两种新产品：Cheesy Bread和Cinna Stix。披萨送货上的竞争仍然很激烈，提供更多食品使多米诺获得了另一种优势。客户肯定会赞赏这些补充。那一年，系统范围内的销售额比上一年增长了6.8％，达到37.8亿美元。</p><p> 2003: Domino’s kept building out the menu and their pizza ecosystem with the Domino’s Dots dessert and Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The Philly Cheese Steak Pizza was a pointed effort to connect with another American comfort food.  The then-VP of Marketing, Ken Calwell, said, “It is the perfect all-American complement to the Domino’s Pizza menu.”</p><p> 2003年：多米诺（Domino）继续使用多米诺（Domino）的Dots甜点和费城奶酪牛排（Philly Cheese Steak Pizza）建立菜单和比萨生态系统。费城奶酪牛排比萨是与另一种美国舒适食品联系在一起的一项有针对性的工作。当时的营销副总裁Ken Calwell说：“这是Domino披萨菜单在美国的完美补充。”</p><p> 2004: At the beginning of 2004, Domino’s was $943.2 million in debt. They decided to hold an IPO after over 40 years as a private company and planned to use the money to help pay off some of the debt. It was odd timing for a legacy company in a competitive industry, and the trading prices reflected that—-their IPO raised  $337.4 million on 24.1 million shares, which was lower than the expected price range.  S&amp;P commented on the company’s “weak cash flow protection measures.” The saving grace, according to S&amp;P, was the company’s established brand and cost-efficient operating system.</p><p> 2004年：2004年初，多米诺的债务为9.432亿美元。他们决定在作为私人公司40多年后进行首次公开​​募股，并计划用这笔钱来偿还部分债务。对于一家竞争激烈的传统公司而言，这是一个奇怪的时机，其交易价格反映出-他们的IPO筹集了3.374亿美元的2410万股股票，低于预期的价格范围。标普对公司的“现金流量保护措施薄弱”发表了评论。根据标准普尔，节省的余地是该公司已建立的品牌和具有成本效益的操作系统。</p><p> 2007: By 2007, Domino’s was making around $2.2 billion in revenue in the United States alone, and $5.4 billion in revenue worldwide. But competition was stiff—Domino’s and Pizza Hut continued to butt heads as they competed for  greater market share around the world. To stay one step ahead, Domino’s introduced online ordering and, a few months later, mobile ordering. This was huge because Domino’s was the  first company in the pizza delivery industry to offer mobile ordering, which quite literally changed the way people thought about food ordering and delivery. People could do it from devices they were already using and didn’t even have to talk to another person to place the order.</p><p> 2007年：到2007年，仅在美国，多米诺骨牌公司的收入就约为22亿美元，全球范围内的收入为54亿美元。但是竞争十分激烈-多米诺骨牌和必胜客在争夺全球更大市场份额的过程中继续争锋相对。为了保持领先地位，Domino推出了在线订购，几个月后又推出了移动订购。这是巨大的，因为Domino是披萨外卖行业中第一家提供移动点餐的公司，从字面上改变了人们对食品点餐和外卖的思考方式。人们可以从已经使用的设备上进行操作，甚至不必与其他人交谈就可以下订单。</p><p> Now, online and mobile ordering is our default. But Domino’s was the first company in the industry to introduce the idea of ordering from your cell phone without having to make a call. And they quickly took it even further. They gamified the ordering process with new features like a virtual Pizza Builder that brought pizza toppings to life on users’ screens. They also added another layer of convenience with their  Pizza Tracker. Now, for the first time ever, users could follow the progress of their food from when they pressed the order button to when the food arrived at their door. This made the process of ordering food so much more transparent and convenient that companies like Seamless, Postmates, and since caught on and copied it.</p><p> 现在，在线和移动订购是我们的默认设置。但是Domino是业内第一家引入无需通过电话即可通过手机订购的想法的公司。他们很快将其进一步发展。他们通过虚拟披萨生成器等新功能将订购过程进行了游戏化，该虚拟披萨生成器使披萨馅料在用户的屏幕上栩栩如生。他们还通过他们的Pizza Tracker添加了另一层便利。现在，有史以来第一次，用户可以跟踪从按下订单按钮到食物到达门口为止的食物进度。这使得订购食品的过程变得更加透明和便捷，以至于Seamless，Postmates等公司都开始使用并复制它们。</p><p> As Domino’s entered the digital age, they quickly positioned themselves as a leader. But they were only able to do this because they’d built up such a strong foundation in their first 50 years. They had a strong operations system as the backbone of their organization and they kept a close eye on the bottom line to maintain good business fundamentals. They’d also established a strong brand of convenience and reliability with their delivery guarantees and marketing campaigns.</p><p> 随着Domino进入数字时代，他们迅速将自己定位为领导者。但是他们之所以只能这样做，是因为他们在最初的50年中建立了如此强大的基础。他们拥有强大的运营系统作为其组织的骨干力量，并且密切关注其底线以维持良好的业务基础。他们还通过交付保证和营销活动建立了便利性和可靠性的强大品牌。 </p><p> But in spite of their fast growth and leadership in their industry, Domino’s still had one huge thing holding them back: their pizza.</p><p>但是，尽管多米诺骨牌公司在行业中快速成长并处于领导地位，但他们仍然有一个巨大的阻碍因素：比萨饼。</p><p>   The most impressive part about Domino’s growth from 1960 to the early 2000s is that they became one of the biggest pizza delivery chains in the world with some of the worst pizza in the world.</p><p>   从1960年到2000年代初期，多米诺的增长最令人印象深刻的部分是，它们成为了世界上最大的披萨配送连锁店之一，并拥有世界上最差的披萨。</p><p> Domino’s had mastered delivering pizza quickly and conveniently, and even let you track the pizza all the way to your door. The only problem was that when it got there, people didn’t want to eat it. As a business, they were innovative and resourceful. But their core product was terrible—and everyone knew it.</p><p> 多米诺（Domino）掌握了快速便捷地发送披萨的方法，甚至可以让您一直跟踪披萨到家门口。唯一的问题是，当它到达那里时，人们不想吃它。作为一家企业，它们具有创新性和足智多谋。但是他们的核心产品非常糟糕-每个人都知道。</p><p>   Great marketing and convenience would only last so long. Domino’s would eventually crumble if people didn’t like their core product. As complaints got louder, this became more obvious.  Domino’s ran consumer tests and discovered that people actually liked pizza less if they knew it was Domino’s than if they thought it was a random unbranded pizza.</p><p>   伟大的营销和便利只会持续这么长时间。如果人们不喜欢他们的核心产品，多米诺骨牌最终将崩溃。随着抱怨越来越大，这一点变得更加明显。多米诺（Domino）进行了消费者测试，发现人们实际上更喜欢比萨饼，而不是认为比萨饼是随机的无烙印比萨饼。</p><p> “We had somehow created a situation where people liked our pizza less if they knew it was from us. So yeah, that was a problem.”  – Patrick Doyle, CEO 2009-Present</p><p> “我们以某种方式造成了一种情况，那就是人们如果不喜欢我们的比萨饼，他们就会越来越不喜欢它。是的，那是个问题。” –首席执行官Patrick Doyle，2009年至今</p><p> Then Domino’s made one of their best business moves in history. They decided to respond to the droves of bad feedback by completely reinventing their pizza recipe.</p><p> 然后，Domino成为了历史上最好的业务举措之一。他们决定通过彻底改写他们的比萨食谱来应对大量不良反馈。</p><p> It was hugely risky: a pizza company was admitting they had terrible pizza. Then they tried to improve it in the full glare of the public eye. Everyone at the company was nervous, but most thought it was a great idea. And without taking this risk and creating a product that people actually loved, they would have never pivoted into the innovative, tech-first superbrand they are today.</p><p> 这是巨大的风险：一家比萨公司承认他们吃了糟糕的比萨。然后，他们试图在公众的视线中改善它。公司的每个人都很紧张，但大多数人认为这是个好主意。如果不冒险冒险，也不创造出人们真正喜爱的产品，他们将永远不会成为当今创新，技术为先的超级品牌。 </p><p>  2008: Domino’s continued to innovate and become more convenient and transparent with new features like the Pizza Tracker and Pizza Builder. But they were focusing on the wrong things.  They improved everything except the thing that needed it most: the pizza.</p><p>2008年：Domino不断创新，并通过Pizza Tracker和Pizza Builder等新功能变得更加方便和透明。但是他们专注于错误的事情。他们改进了所有东西，除了最需要的东西：比萨。</p><p> This is a company that had built the whole brand around fast and reliable delivery, and Marketing 101 says you focus on your point of differentiation. We kept talking about delivery and 30 minutes or less, and it just stopped working. We realized that everyone in the world who wanted fast convenient pizza was already buying from us, and the people who wanted a great pie simply were not.”  –  Patrick Doyle</p><p> 这是一家以快速，可靠的交货为基础打造整个品牌的公司，Marketing 101表示您专注于差异化点。我们一直在谈论交货时间，并且在30分钟或更短时间内就停止工作了。我们意识到，世界上每个想要快速方便的披萨的人都已经在向我们购买商品，而想要美味派的人根本就没有。” –帕特里克·道尔</p><p> Shares were at a record low of $2.83 and customers took to social media to  comment that Domino’s food was the “worst excuse for pizza [they’d] ever had,” was “totally devoid of flavor,” and even that “the sauce [tasted] like ketchup.”</p><p> 股价创下了2.83美元的历史新低，客户在社交媒体上评论道，多米诺骨牌的食物是“他们有史以来比萨饼的最差借口”，“完全没有味道”，甚至“酱汁[尝起来像番茄酱。”</p><p> Many of the ingredients in Domino’s pizza recipe were frozen, canned, or pre-made in order to cut costs and preparation time. This was part of how they’d achieved their strong finances and unbeatable delivery times. But customer feedback and tanking share prices was a harsh reminder that the market wouldn’t support a crappy product.</p><p> 为了降低成本和缩短准备时间，多米诺（Domino）比萨食谱中的许多成分都被冷冻，罐装或预制。这是他们获得强大财务和无与伦比的交货时间的一部分。但是，客户的反馈和股价的下跌提醒人们，市场不会支持这种糟糕的产品。</p><p> 2009-2010: Domino’s used their terrible reviews as motivation to completely reinvent their pizza. The huge pivot coincided with Patrick Doyle joining as CEO in 2010. This was hugely important because he spearheaded the transformation and pushed to create pizza that customers would love. That required radical action. The top chefs at Domino’s began to overhaul the entire recipe by going back to the drawing board and redesigning different elements like the crust, the sauce, and the cheese. Chefs tested over ten types of crusts, fifteen types of sauces, and dozens of cheese. They mixed and matched different combinations to understand what flavors worked best together. In the end, they ended up with a completely new crust, sauce, and cheese recipes. The entire pizza was new.</p><p> 2009年至2010年：多米诺（Domino）用他们的糟糕评论来激发他们彻底改造比萨的动机。重大的转变恰逢Patrick Doyle于2010年加入首席执行官。这非常重要，因为他带头进行了转型并推动创建了客户喜欢的比萨饼。这需要采取根本行动。多米诺（Domino）的顶级厨师开始重新研究整个食谱，方法是回到绘图板上并重新设计外壳，酱汁和奶酪等不同元素。厨师测试了十多种类型的硬皮，十五种酱汁和数十种奶酪。他们混合并匹配了不同的组合，以了解哪种口味搭配效果最佳。最后，他们得到了全新的地壳，酱汁和奶酪食谱。整个披萨都是新的。</p><p> The executive team at Domino’s bit their nails the entire time.  They had a lot of fear and a lot of hope—just like a startup founder would have. It was a huge decision that would have downstream effects for the company for the rest of its existence. And as Patrick Doyle pointed out, the pain of losing is twice the happiness of winning, so people tend to be cautious. But in spite of these huge risks, they pulled the trigger because everyone on the team believed it was the right move.</p><p> 多米诺骨牌公司的执行团队始终刻骨铭心。他们充满了恐惧和希望，就像初创公司的创始人一样。这是一个巨大的决定，它将对公司的其余部分产生下游影响。正如帕特里克·道尔（Patrick Doyle）所指出的那样，失败的痛苦是获得胜利的幸福的两倍，因此人们倾向于保持谨慎。尽管存在这些巨大的风险，但他们还是抓住了扳机，因为团队中的每个人都认为这是正确的举动。</p><p> “Well, I can’t say there were not people who were concerned. Heck, I was concerned. It’s normal to have discomfort in making a big decision, but other than that, we had 1,000 percent alignment on doing this.”   – Russell J. Weiner, former CMO</p><p> “嗯，我不能说没有人担心。哎呀，我很担心。在做出重大决定时会感到不舒服是正常的，但除此之外，我们在达成此决定时有1,000％的共识。” – Russell J. Weiner，前首席营销官 </p><p> 2012: While Domino’s was reinventing their pizza recipe, they were working on another big product development. In 2012 they introduced an entirely new style of pizza to their menu: pan pizza. They’d worked on the recipe for three years. Each pizza had to be hand-stretched. The new pizza aligned with Domino’s reinvigorated focus on putting more care and effort into their pizza.</p><p>2012年：在多米诺（Domino）重新发明披萨食谱的同时，他们也在进行另一项大型产品开发。 2012年，他们在菜单中引入了一种全新的披萨：锅披萨。他们已经做了三年的食谱。每个比萨饼都必须手工拉伸。新的比萨与多米诺（Domino）重新焕发活力的重点在于在比萨中加倍加倍努力。</p><p> Domino’s offered a lot of topping options for their original pizza, but this was the first time they’d released a new style of pizza. It might have been prompted by pressure from Pizza Hut, who already offered pan pizza. This was a successful chess move by Domino’s. The new pan pizza became a favorite with many customers and gained its own following.</p><p> 多米诺提供了许多原始披萨的浇头选项，但这是他们第一次发布一种新的披萨。必胜客（Pizza Hut）的压力可能促使了这种情况，而必胜客已经提供了比萨饼。这是多米诺骨牌的一次成功棋步。新的比萨饼成为许多客户的最爱，并获得了自己的关注。</p><p> “Listen, I’m a New Yorker, I know pizza. But I will say that pan pizza showed up and I thought it was not awful. I actually sort of liked it. Now I have a craving for it. The bread dough is almost like a focaccia … it’s crispy and it’s oily and it’s pretty delicious.”  –  Jasmine Moy, Manhattan-based lawyer</p><p> “听着，我是纽约客，我知道披萨。但是我要说的是出现了比萨饼，我认为这并不可怕。我实际上有点喜欢它。现在我渴望它。面包面团几乎像意大利薄饼薄饼……酥脆，油腻且非常美味。” –曼哈顿律师Jasmine Moy</p><p> The numbers showed the success of their big product changes, too. In the  fourth quarter of 2012, Domino’s revenue was up 7.5% and net income was up 21.6% versus the prior-year period. The company had seen same-store sales growth domestically and internationally and reported better operating margins.</p><p> 数字也显示了他们大产品变更的成功。在2012年第四季度，Domino的收入比去年同期增长了7.5％，净利润增长了21.6％。该公司在国内和国际上看到了同店销售额的增长，并报告了更好的营业利润率。</p><p> Domino’s pizza reinvention was an undeniable success.
