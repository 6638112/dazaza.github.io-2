The conservatorship has given her father, Jamie Spears,  control over her estate, career and other aspects of her personal life.</p><p> Spears在听证会上关于自2008年以来剥夺了她独立歌手的异常法律安排的审理期间致辞.Carchatorship给了她的父亲，杰米长矛，控制她的遗产，职业和她个人生活的其他方面。</p><p>  “I want to end the  conservatorship without being evaluated,” Spears said in a lengthy speech, during which she condemned her father and the others who have controlled the arrangement.</p><p>  “我想在没有评估的情况下结束保护统一体，”矛在漫长的演讲中说，在此期间，她谴责她的父亲和那些控制安排的其他人。</p><p> “This conservatorship is doing me way more harm than good,” she said. “I deserve to have a life ... I’m great at what I do. All I want is to own my money … [and] share my story to the world. I want to be able to be heard.”</p><p> “这个保护统治者正在造成更大的伤害，”她说。 “我应该有生命......我很擅长我所做的事。我想要的只是拥有我的钱... [和]分享我的故事。我希望能够听到。“</p><p>  Spears said she has been forced to work against her will, and that the conservatorship has blocked her from getting married and having a baby. She said she wanted to get her birth control removed so she could try to have another child, but that she was not allowed to go to the doctor. She said her boyfriend is also prohibited from driving her in his car, and that she is blocked from seeing some friends.</p><p>  斯皮尔斯表示，她被迫反对她的旨意，并且保护者们阻止了她结婚并有一个婴儿。她说她想删除她的出生控制，以便她试图拥有另一个孩子，但她不被允许去看医生。她说她的男朋友也禁止在他的车里驾驶她，并且她被封锁了解一些朋友。</p><p>  She directly excoriated her father, saying, “He loved the control to hurt his own daughter 100,000%.” At one point, she said, she cried for an hour on the phone and said he “loved” it and enjoyed having control over someone as powerful as her.</p><p>  她直接纠正着她的父亲，说：“他喜欢控制自己的女儿100,000％。”她说，她说，她在电话里哭了一小时，并说他“喜欢”它，并享受控制某人和她一样强大的人。 </p><p> “I’ve lied and told the whole world I’m OK and I’m happy,” Spears said, adding that she wanted to sue her family. She compared her situation to “sex trafficking”, noting that she was forced to work while having no control over her finances and no independence: “The people who did that to me should not be able to walk away so easily.”</p><p>“我撒了撒谎，告诉整个世界，我很好，我很高兴，”矛说，补充说她想起诉她的家人。她将她的情况与“性贩运”的情况进行了比较，并指出她被迫工作，同时没有控制她的财政，没有独立：“那些对我来说的人不应该很容易地走开。”</p><p> Spears, who appeared by phone and spoke rapidly, said her management had threatened to sue her if she didn’t perform in 2018: “It was very threatening and scary ... I’m not here to be anyone’s slave.”</p><p> 由电话出现并迅速辐条出现的矛，表示她的管理层如果她在2018年没有表演，她的管理层威胁要起诉她：“这是非常威胁和可怕......我不是在这里成为任何人的奴隶。”</p><p> She said her management falsely accused her of not taking her medication at the time. She also said the conservatorship has recently forced her to attend therapy in Westlake, where she gets bombarded by the paparazzi, and she requested that she be allowed to do therapy in her home: “I deserve privacy … It’s not OK to force me to do anything I don’t want to.”</p><p> 她说她的管理错误地指责她当时没有服用她的药物。她还表示，保护统治最近强迫她参加Westlake的治疗，她被狗仔队轰炸，她要求她被允许在她的家中进行治疗：“我应该得到隐私......强迫我做不行我不想的任何东西。“</p><p> She said she was at one point forced to take lithium, which was very strong: “I felt drunk. I couldn’t even have a conversation with my mom or dad really about anything ... my whole family did nothing.” At the hearing, she requested that she be allowed to choose her own lawyer, and that she be permitted to speak out, noting that her parents give media interviews while she is barred from talking to press.</p><p> 她说她在一个人被迫服用锂电片，这非常强大：“我喝醉了。我甚至无法与我的妈妈或爸爸谈话，真的是什么......我的整个家庭都没有。“在听证会上，她要求她被允许选择自己的律师，并且她被允许发言，并指出她的父母在禁止谈话时给予媒体采访。</p><p> “I shouldn’t be in a conservatorship if I can work,” she said, adding: “The laws need to change … I don’t feel like I can live a full life.”</p><p> “如果我可以工作，我不应该在保护统统中，”她说，补充说：“法律需要改变......我不想过我的生活。”</p><p>  In a short statement at the end of the hearing, Vivian Thoreen, the attorney for Jamie Spears, said: “He is sorry to see his daughter suffering and in so much pain. Mr Spears loves his daughter and misses her very much.”</p><p>  在听证会结束的简短陈述中，贾米斯佩尔斯的律师·威兰·威兰说：“他很遗憾地看到他的女儿痛苦和如此多的痛苦。矛议员爱他的女儿，非常想念她。“</p><p> The judge, Brenda Penny, said the singer’s lawyer could file a formal petition to end the conservatorship.</p><p> 法官Brenda Penny表示，歌手的律师可以提出正式请愿书以结束保护统治者。 </p><p>  The singer’s appearance was highly anticipated; the 39-year-old star almost never participates in the court proceedings, but her lawyer this year  told the judge she wanted to speak out and requested a hearing “on an expedited basis”.</p><p>歌手的外表受到了高度预期;这位39岁的明星几乎从未参加过法院诉讼程序，但她今年的律师告诉法官，她想说，她想发言，并要求听取“加速基础”。</p><p> It also comes one day after the New York Times reported on  confidential documents revealing that Spears has for years strongly objected to the conservatorship and the many powers her father has had over her.</p><p> 在纽约时报报告的机密文件后，它也是一天的，揭示了矛多年来强烈反对保护者，她父亲已经过她的许多力量。</p><p> Outside the courtroom on Wednesday, fans had gathered hours before the hearing was due to start, wearing #FreeBritney flags and shirts and holding cardboard cutouts of the star.</p><p> 周三在法庭外，粉丝在听证会上收集了几个小时，因为开始，穿着#Freebritney旗帜和衬衫和拿着恒星的纸板切割。</p><p> “I want people to understand that this is unacceptable. This is not a gray area, he-said-she-said situation. In my view, a crime has been committed against Britney Spears,” said Tess Barker, the co-host of the popular Britney’s Gram podcast, who has consistently attended the singer’s hearings.</p><p> “我希望人们明白这是不可接受的。这不是一个灰色区域，他说 - 她说的情况。在我看来，犯罪是针对布兰妮的矛而致力于犯罪的，“蒂斯坦尼的克播客，努力始终出席了歌手的听证会。</p><p> Carlos Morales, 26, who showed up with a large Britney flag, added, “She’s been with me all my life. Her music is inspiration to me, and I’m here to support her and pay her back.”</p><p> Carlos Morales，26岁，谁出现了一个大型的布兰妮旗，补充说：“她一生都在和我一起。她的音乐是对我的启发，我在这里支持她并支付她的回报。“</p><p> Fellow celebrities also voiced their support for Spears following the hearing. “We love you Britney!!! Stay strong,” Mariah Carey  tweeted, while Brandy  said she was sending “love and support to Britney Spears and her fans”. The actor and activist  Rose McGowan; the Planned Parenthood president,  Alexis McGill Johnson; and the View co-host  Meghan McCain also spoke out on Twitter against Spears’ conservatorship.</p><p> 同事还表达了他们对听证会后的矛的支持。 “我们爱你布兰妮！保持坚强，“玛丽亚凯莉推文，而白兰地说她正在向布兰妮斯皮尔斯和她的粉丝发送”爱和支持“。演员和活动家玫瑰麦克湾;计划的父母成员总统亚历克西斯麦吉尔约翰逊;而认为联合主持人Meghan McCain还谈到了Twitter对抗矛的保护统治。</p><p> Justin Timberlake, her former boyfriend who has faced  widespread scrutiny for the way he treated the star,  tweeted, “We should all be supporting Britney at this time … No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.”</p><p> 贾斯汀··伯伯拉克，她的前男友面临着普遍的审查，他对他对待这颗明星的方式，推文，“我们都应该在这个时候支持布兰妮......没有女人应该受到关于她自己的决定。” </p><p> Conservatorship is a type of  court-appointed guardianship intended for people who can no longer make decisions for themselves, typically older and infirm people. But critics have argued that the process can be exploited and have pointed to Spears’s case as an example of such abuse.</p><p>Conservatorship是一种旨在为无法为自己做出决定的人的法庭指定监护人，通常是年长和体弱的人。但批评者认为，作为这种滥用的例子，可以利用这个过程并指出了矛的案例。</p><p>  Spears’s arrangement has faced intense scrutiny in the months since the release of  Framing Britney Spears, a New York Times-produced documentary that chronicled the fraught process that led the courts to place the singer under a conservatorship. The film cast a harsh light on the abusive paparazzi and media that aggressively covered Spears’s mental health challenges, and also depicted her father as being largely absent from her life until he took control of her estate amid the singer’s struggles.</p><p>  Spears的安排面临着框架布兰妮·矛的释放以来的几个月审视了纽约时报的纪录片，该纪录片结合了充足的过程，这些纪录片是在法庭上将歌手放置歌手。这部电影在辱骂的罂粟和媒体上施加着严厉的光线，剧烈地覆盖了矛的心理健康挑战，并且还描绘了她的父亲在很大程度上缺乏她的生命，直到他在歌手的斗争中控制了她的遗产。</p><p> A lawyer who claimed to have met with Spears in 2008 told the film-makers that she had said at the time she did not want her father as a conservator. The documentary further highlighted the apparent contradictions of her arrangement – that she could be performing sold-out shows and making millions, but also be considered incapable of making basic decisions about her health and finances.</p><p> 一个声称在2008年声称与矛相遇的律师告诉电影制作人，她当时她不希望她的父亲作为一个保护者。这些纪录片进一步强调了她的安排的明显矛盾 - 她可以表演售罄的节目和制造数百万，而且也被认为是无法对她的健康和财务做出基本决定。</p><p>  Spears’s lawyers, appointed by the court, filed for  Jamie to be removed as a conservator last year, alleging that the singer was “afraid of her father” and claiming she would not perform while he continued to exercise control of her estate. Jamie is a co-conservator of the estate alongside a corporate fiduciary, known as Bessemer Trust.</p><p>  由法院任命的矛律师们去年向杰米申请被删除作为一个保护员，声称歌手是“害怕她的父亲”，并声称她不会履行他的遗产。杰米是庄园的共同保护区，并落在公司信托，被称为贝塞尔信任。</p><p> Her father had previously acted as a personal conservator, giving him authority over her medical and mental health treatment, but a  professional licensed conservator has taken over that job.</p><p> 她的父亲以前曾担任个人保护师，为她提供了对她的医疗和心理健康治疗的权威，但专业的持牌保险柜已经接管了这份工作。</p><p>   The Times report on Tuesday revealed that Spears told a court investigator in 2016 that the conservatorship had “become an oppressive and controlling tool against her” and she had raised concerns that the arrangement gave her father authority over who she dated and befriended, how she designed her kitchen and how much money she was given as a weekly allowance. She also said she was forced to perform while sick with a 104F fever.</p><p>   周二的时代报告显示，矛在2016年讲法庭调查员，“保护统治者”成为一个压迫和控制工具“，她曾提出了这项安排给她父亲权威的担忧，她如何为她约会和与友好友好，如何设计她的厨房和她作为每周津贴多少钱。她还说她被迫在104倍发烧时患病。</p><p> #FreeBritney activists, who were featured in the documentary, have pushed for Jamie to be ousted and for the conservatorship to be entirely dissolved.</p><p> #Freebritney活动家，纪录片特色，已经推动了杰米被推动，并为保护统治完全解散。 </p><p> “I want her to be able to speak freely from her heart, and I’m praying that the judge actually listens,” said Junior Olivas, a #FreeBritney advocate, before the hearing. “The whole world is watching this case, and the time is now for Britney to really let them know what she wants.”</p><p>“我希望她能够从她的心中自由地讲话，我祈祷法官实际上听了”，“初级奥利瓦斯，一个#Freeblitney倡导者在听证会之前说。 “整个世界都在看这种情况，现在是布兰妮真的让他们知道她想要的东西。”</p><p> The 33-year-old longtime fan, who appeared in the documentary, has for years rallied outside the courtroom in support of the singer.</p><p> 这位33岁的长期粉丝出现在纪录片中，多年来一直在法庭外面搭载了歌手。</p><p>  “In the beginning, no one paid attention or laughed us off … but finally people are paying attention and actually understanding that something is wrong here.” The revelations this week added fuel to their cause, he said: “She was crying for help but nobody was listening.”</p><p>  “一开始，没有人注意或嘲笑我们......但最后人们正在关注并实际上理解这里有问题。”他说：“他说：”她在哭泣的帮助下，但没有人在倾听。“</p><p> Megan Radford, another #FreeBritney advocate, noted that male celebrities have not faced the same kind of scrutiny and loss of autonomy when they have suffered public breakdowns.</p><p> Megan Radford，另一个#Freebbritney Advocate，指出，当男性名人遭受公共崩溃时，男性名人并没有面临同样的审查和失去自主权。</p><p> “It’s dangerously stigmatizing to say someone who may or may not have mental health struggles needs to have their rights stripped away from them and reassigned to another human being,” she added. The Times report, she said, made clear that the “justice system has failed Britney … She has been totally robbed of 13 years of her life for no reason.”</p><p> “说可能或可能没有心理健康斗争的人需要将他们的权利从他们剥夺并重新分配给另一个人，”她补充说：“这令人危险地侮辱了他们的权利。她说，时代报告说明，明确说“司法系统失败了，布兰妮......她没有完全被抢了13年的生命。”</p><p> “I watched Britney grow up. I’ve been a fan since she was a teenager,” said Kim Van Doorn, 45, outside the courthouse on Wednesday. Van Doorn came with her wife to LA, traveling from Bakersfield, hours north of the courthouse. “I want whatever she wants for her future. But of course as a fan, I want her to continue to make music and come back as the bad Britney bitch that she is.”</p><p> “我看着布兰妮长大。我是一名少年以来，我一直是粉丝，“星期三在法院大楼外，45岁的Kim Van Doore说。 Van Doorn与她的妻子带到洛杉矶，从法院北部的贝克斯菲尔德旅行。 “我想要她想要的任何事情。但当然作为粉丝，我希望她继续制作音乐并回到她是糟糕的布兰妮婊子。“</p><p> Spears  appeared to endorse the #FreeBritney movement in a statement from her lawyer last year that said, “Britney welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans.” Her father had dismissed the campaign as a conspiracy theory.</p><p> 矛似乎赞同去年的律师的一份声明中的#freebritney运动说，“布兰妮欢迎并赞赏她许多粉丝的知情支持。”她的父亲将该竞选人员视为阴谋理论。 </p><p> A representative for Jamie’s lawyer declined to comment on the New York Times report on Tuesday. His attorney told reporters in February, “Jamie Spears has diligently and professionally carried out his duties as one of Britney’s conservators, and his love for his daughter and dedication to protecting her is clearly apparent to the court.”</p><p>杰米律师的代表拒绝对周二的纽约时报报告发表评论。 他的律师于2月份告诉记者，“杰米矛努力，专业地开展了他的职责，作为布兰妮的保护者之一，他对他的女儿和保护她的奉献精神的爱是明显的。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/22/britney-spears-conservatorship-testimony">https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/22/britney-spears-conservatorship-testimony</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/法院/">#法院</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/life/">#life</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/保护/">#保护</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
