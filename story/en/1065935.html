It’s not uncommon for job candidates to ask Amazon’s recruiters about an  infamous New York Times story from 2015 that reported corporate employees routinely cry at their desks. Amazon corporate managers have goals for “ unregretted attrition” — basically a percentage of their staff that should leave the company each year, either voluntarily or by being forced out.</p><p>亚马逊从来没有被称为一个简单的工作地点。求职者向亚马逊的招聘人员询问2015年婴儿纽约时报故事并不罕见，报告公司员工经常在办公桌上哭泣。亚马逊企业经理有“未经证实的消磨”的目标 - 基本上，他们的工作人员每年都应该离开公司，无论是自愿还是被迫出局。</p><p> Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has famously said the company’s goal is to be the “Earth’s most customer-centric company,” and for decades that singular focus seems to have come at the expense of nearly all else. But now a growing swath of its employees say this singular focus has helped perpetuate a race problem inside Amazon — and, crucially, that attempts to address it over the years have been stymied by the company’s HR department and its leader.</p><p> 亚马逊创始人Jeff Bezos表示，公司的目标是成为“地球最以客户为中心的公司”，而且几十年来，奇异的重点似乎已经牺牲了几乎所有其他人的费用。但现在，员工的越来越长的员工说，这种单一的重点有助于使亚马逊内部的比赛问题延续 - 并且至关重要的是，多年来，该公司的人力资源部门及其领导者延迟了解决它。</p><p> Pearl Thomas, a 64-year-old Black woman and human resources business partner, is one of these employees. She worked at Amazon for less than a year before she sued the company this May for alleged racial discrimination and retaliation. Her lawsuit is  one of five different suits filed in recent months from current and former Amazon employees that detail shocking allegations of racial discrimination.</p><p> 珍珠托马斯，一个64岁的黑人女子和人力资源商业伙伴，是这些员工之一。她在亚马逊工作了不到一年，在她起诉公司这可能是涉嫌种族歧视和报复。她的诉讼是最近几个月从当前和前亚马逊雇员那里提起的五个不同西装之一，细节令人震惊的种族歧视指控。</p><p> The plaintiffs, who are all women of color, claim they’ve experienced both explicit racism at work — like being called the n-word by a manager — and systemic racism that they say is reflected in the company’s alleged lower promotion rates and higher termination rates for underrepresented minorities. Thomas’s suit stands out because she works for the company’s HR department — which is supposed to not only hire and fire employees but also make sure they feel safe and satisfied at work.</p><p> 原告是所有颜色的女性，他们在工作中经历了明确的种族主义，就像被经理和系统的种族主义被称为N-Word，他们说他们所谓的据称较低的促销率和更高的终止不足的少数群体的利率。托马斯的西装脱颖而出，因为她为公司的人力资源部门工作 - 这应该不仅雇用和消防员工，而且还要确保他们在工作中感到安全和满意。</p><p> Thomas claims in the filing that after she reported her white male manager for calling her the n-word when he thought she had already disconnected from a video call, Amazon’s HR division investigated but ultimately dismissed her claim when it couldn’t find proof. She also alleges that shortly after she complained, the manager retaliated against her by placing her on a performance review plan. On another occasion, Thomas alleges that she and a Black coworker were told by another manager that they should watch their tone so they wouldn’t be perceived as “angry Black wom[e]n.”</p><p> 托马斯在提交文件中宣称，当她报告她的白人经理在他认为她已经从视频通话中断开连接时，亚马逊的人力资源部门调查但最终驳回了她无法找到证明时的索赔。她也抱怨她抱怨后不久，经理在绩效审查计划中向她报复。另一个场合，托马斯声称另一名经理告诉她和一位黑色的同事，他们应该看他们的基调，所以他们不会被视为“愤怒的黑色的女人[e] n。”</p><p> “Her position in the Company’s HR organization has given her a prime vantagepoint regarding both systemic discrimination and conscious animus towards Black employees at Amazon, along with the Company’s practices regarding diversity, employee complaints, and the use of performance management to retaliate against Black and other employees who raise concerns,” Thomas’s lawyers wrote in the legal complaint.</p><p> “她在公司的人力资源组织中的职位给了她在亚马逊的黑人雇员的全身歧视和意识敌意的主要风景点，以及公司的多样性，员工投诉以及使用绩效管理，以报复对抗黑色和其他人提出担忧的员工，“托马斯的律师在法律诉讼中写道。</p><p> Amazon told Recode last month that it was “conducting thorough investigations” in light of the lawsuits, but that it had “found no evidence to support the allegations.”</p><p> 上个月亚马逊告诉贷款，鉴于诉讼是“彻底调查”，但它“没有发现证据支持指控。” </p><p>  But many of Thomas’s colleagues across the company tell Recode they’ve had experiences similar to those mentioned in the suits. Over the past few months, Recode has interviewed more than 30 current and former Amazon employees who detailed allegations of racial bias and discrimination on the job — and many of them said the company’s HR department was part of the problem.</p><p>但是，许多托马斯的同事遍布整个公司告诉回收他们已经与西装中提到的那些类似的经历。在过去的几个月里，Recode已经采访了30多名当前和前亚马逊员工的亚马逊员工，这些员工详细指导了对工作的种族偏见和歧视 - 以及他们中的许多人表示，该公司的人力资源部门是该问题的一部分。</p><p> More than a dozen of those sources, all of whom have worked in diversity, equity, and inclusion roles inside Amazon, told Recode that they believe Amazon’s HR leader, Beth Galetti, who is white, was for years one of the main barriers to Amazon becoming an equitable workplace for employees of all races.</p><p> 超过十几个来源，所有这些来源都经过多样性，股权和包含在亚马逊内的角色，告诉回收他们认为是白人的亚马逊人力资源领导者，亚马逊的主要障碍是亚马逊的主要障碍之一成为所有种族员工的公平工作场所。</p><p> “Beth is actively a gatekeeper and a blocker in this work,” a former Amazon diversity employee told Recode.</p><p> “贝丝在这项工作中积极成为一个看门人和一个阻挡者，”一位前亚马逊多样性员工告诉回收。</p><p> Amazon spokesperson Jaci Anderson said it was unfair and biased to label Galetti as a barrier to diversity and inclusion success at the company. Anderson said that since last June, Galetti and her team have been leading discussions every two weeks with the company’s senior leadership team on new goals related to DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) work, as well as how to remove impediments to progress toward the goals.</p><p> 亚马逊发言人Jaci Anderson表示，它是不公平的，并偏向于将Galetti标记为多样性和纳入公司成功的障碍。安德森说，自去年6月以来，加尔蒂和她的团队每两周与公司的高级领导团队进行与DEI（多样性，公平和包容）工作相关的新目标，以及如何消除进展的障碍目标。</p><p> Still, diversity experts at Amazon told Recode that as long as Galetti oversees DEI work, they believe they won’t have the freedom, data, and tools they need to identify and solve issues related to racial inequity. Recode granted the sources for this story anonymity either because they feared retribution from Amazon or because company policy prohibits them, as current employees, from speaking to the press without permission.</p><p> 尽管如此，只要格莱蒂监督Dei工作，亚马逊的多样性专家告诉核选，他们认为他们不会有自由，数据和工具，他们需要识别和解决与种族不公平相关的问题。重新授予这个故事的来源，因为他们害怕亚马逊的报复或因为公司政策禁止他们作为现有员工，而不在未经许可到媒体。</p><p>  But sources also told Recode that they believe the root of the problem goes deeper than Galetti — that she represents the company’s ethos but isn’t its inventor. They said Amazon’s corporate culture has long encouraged cutthroat competition between coworkers and that it often prioritizes defending the tech giant’s reputation above almost all else — including diversity, racial equity, and inclusion work.</p><p>  但消息来源还告诉回收他们认为，问题的根源比加莱蒂更深 - 她代表公司的精神，但不是它的发明者。他们说，亚马逊的企业文化长期以来鼓励了同事之间的截止螺旋状竞争，并且它经常优先考虑捍卫技术巨头的声誉几乎所有其他 - 包括多样性，种族股权和包容性。</p><p> Case in point: After Recode published a report in February that revealed  racial disparities in Amazon performance review grades and allegations of other systemic racial issues, the company promised to investigate potential inequities and announced more ambitious diversity-focused hiring and representation goals. But Recode has learned that at the same time, there has been upheaval in Amazon’s core diversity, equity, and inclusion department and that Amazon temporarily placed an employment lawyer in charge of the team’s day-to-day work — one who had no DEI experience prior to joining the diversity team a few months earlier.</p><p> 案例指出：在核选2月份发布报告后，亚马逊绩效审查成绩和其他系统种族问题的指控揭示了种族差异，该公司承诺调查潜在的不公平，并宣布更加雄心勃勃的多样性集中招聘目标。但回收已经了解到，与此同时，亚马逊的核心多样性，公平和包容部门已经有动荡，亚马逊暂时向团队日常工作中的就业律师 - 一个没有Dei经验的人在早些时候加入多样性团队之前。 </p><p> All of this has left many of the people whose work is meant to make Amazon a more equitable place feeling like they can’t do their jobs. “There’s just a sense of distress across the board for [diversity] professionals at Amazon,” a current employee told Recode.</p><p>所有这些都留下了许多工作，他们的工作意味着让亚马逊成为一个更公平的地方，就像他们无法做到他们的工作。 “目前的员工告诉回收，亚马逊的董事会局面遇到了陷入困境的痛苦感。</p><p>  We work hard to make Amazon a company where employees and people of all backgrounds feel included, respected, and want to grow their careers. This starts with recruiting to ensure our teams are diverse, and is continued by the work of the hundreds of diversity, equity, and inclusion experts that make up DEI teams across Amazon. While these teams are singularly focused on building an inclusive work environment and ensuring equitable access for all, we know that true diversity, equity, and inclusion starts with every senior leader, hiring manager, and Amazon employee being part of the solution. This is why we require inclusion training for all employees and have shared our 2021 goals and progress globally, in addition to implementing mechanisms that help us gather real-time employee feedback so we can adjust as we go.</p><p>  我们努力使亚马逊成为一家员工和所有背景所感受的人，尊重，并希望增长他们的职业生涯。这开始招聘，以确保我们的团队是多元化的，并且由数百个多样性，公平和包含专家的工作继续，这些专家在亚马逊上占Dei团队。虽然这些团队在建立一个包容性工作环境并确保所有高级领导者，招聘经理和亚马逊员工成为解决方案的一部分，但这些团队都集中在建立一个包容性的工作环境并确保所有人的公平获取，但我们都知道真正的多样性，股权和包容性。这就是为什么我们需要对所有员工培训并在全球范围内分享我们的2021个进展，以及实施帮助我们收集实时员工反馈的机制，以便我们可以在我们走的时候进行调整。</p><p>  Galetti, the HR leader, is just one person. Sources told Recode that of course she is not the only one at fault for the race problem they believe exists at Amazon. But sources told Recode that they believe Galetti had for years failed at her job, particularly as a member of CEO Jeff Bezos’s core leadership team, to sufficiently promote and support diversity and inclusion work inside Amazon and to ensure it was an equitable workplace.</p><p>  HR Leader的Galetti只是一个人。消息人士告诉回收，当然，她不是他们认为存在于亚马逊的竞争问题的唯一一个故障的人。但消息人士们告诉回收他们认为加尔蒂在她的工作中失败了，特别是作为首席执行官杰夫贝斯核心领导团队的成员，以充分促进和支持亚马逊内部的多样性和包容性，并确保这是一个公平的工作场所。</p><p> “Blame rests with Beth,” an HR employee who has worked at Amazon for more than five years, told Recode. “She’s been the architect of the people-focused projects during these years of hyper growth. If it’s not her responsibility, whose is it?”</p><p> “责备与贝丝休息，”一位在亚马逊工作超过五年的人力资源员工告诉回收。 “在多年的超增长期间，她一直是以人为重点的项目的建筑师。如果这不是她的责任，那是谁？“</p><p> There have been some recent shifts. Four years into her HR leadership role, Galetti began leading discussions with other members of Jeff Bezos’s leadership team every two weeks to discuss and review aggressive new diversity goals and progress for the company. This new focus for Galetti and Amazon leaders came last summer, as Amazon, like many large corporations, began making new commitments focused on Black Americans in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. But until that catalyst, sources told Recode that they believe Galetti didn’t prioritize DEI work.</p><p> 最近有一些班次。四年来她的人力资源领先地位，加尔蒂每天两周开始与Jeff Bezos领导团队的其他成员进行讨论，讨论并审查积极的新的多样性目标和公司进度。去年夏天，加尔蒂和亚马逊领导人的新重点是亚马逊，就像许多大公司一样，开始使新的承诺在乔治·弗洛伊德谋杀的谋杀之际中重点关注黑人美国人。但在那种催化剂之前，消息人士们告诉回收他们认为加莱蒂没有优先考虑Dei工作。</p><p> A major issue with Galetti’s leadership, according to former diversity staffers, is that she seemed to downplay or resist the idea that some employees in underrepresented groups are at a natural disadvantage compared to their peers.</p><p> 据前多样性员工的说法，加尔蒂的领导人的一个主要问题是，她似乎贬低或抵制了不足的群体的一些员工与他们的同龄人相比的自然劣势。</p><p>   One source recounted a meeting between Galetti and members of Amazon’s diversity staff several years ago, during which Galetti was confronted with data showing that Black employees at Amazon hit a promotion ceiling at certain levels in the company’s corporate hierarchy. According to a person familiar with the exchange, Galetti replied: “These people should pull themselves up by their bootstraps like I did.” Galetti’s head of diversity work at the time, a Black executive with experience at a Fortune 100 company, attempted to explain that the Black employees didn’t have metaphorical “boots” — which the source took as an allusion to the systemic racism they face in society.</p><p>   几年前，一个来源叙述了加尔蒂和亚马逊多元化员工成员之间的会议，在此期间，格莱蒂面临着数据显示亚马逊的黑人员工在公司的企业层次结构中的一定程度上击中了促销天花板。根据熟悉交易所的人，加莱蒂回答说：“这些人应该像我这样的自发。”格拉蒂的多样性工作负责人当时是一家财富100家公司经验的黑人行政，试图解释，黑人员工没有隐喻的“靴子” - 这源头作为他们所面临的系统种族主义的暗示社会。 </p><p>   “The story of Beth is the story of [many] of the executives at Amazon,” a former diversity employee told Recode. “For the most part, they haven’t had to examine their privilege, so it’s counter to their worldview to think about how people may be coming in at very real disadvantages.”</p><p>“贝丝的故事是亚马逊的[许多]高管的故事，”一位以前的多样性员工告诉回收。 “在大多数情况下，他们没有不得不审查他们的特权，所以这是他们的世界观，以考虑人们如何在非常真实的缺点中进入。”</p><p> Another problem, sources say, is Galetti’s work experience. Amazon originally recruited Galetti, a logistics and technology executive, from FedEx in 2013 to take on an operations role at Amazon. But then Dave Clark, Amazon’s operations chief at the time, thought she would be a fit for a human resources leadership role despite her lack of HR experience, according to a new book,   Amazon Unbound, by the journalist Brad Stone, which documents the transformation of Amazon and its founder over the past decade.</p><p> 消息人士称，另一个问题是格莱蒂的工作经验。亚马逊最初招募了2013年FEDEX的物流和技术主管，在亚马逊的作战角色。但随后戴夫克拉克，亚马逊的运营队长当时，尽管她缺乏人力资源的领导作用，但亚马逊没有记者的亚马逊，由记者布拉德石头缺乏人力资源的经验，这是一个文件的在过去十年中的亚马逊及其创始人。</p><p> In 2016, Galetti ascended to the  top HR role at Amazon as senior vice president of human resources and became the only woman on Jeff Bezos’s senior leadership team. Sources say Galetti tends to focus on developing software products, such as  Amazon’s daily employee survey tool called Connections. Earlier this year, Amazon’s human resources division was renamed as People Experience and Technology (PXT).</p><p> 2016年，加莱蒂在亚马逊作为人力资源高级副总裁的高级人力资源作用，成为杰夫·贝佐斯高级领导团队的唯一妇女。消息人士称格莱蒂倾向于专注于开发软件产品，例如亚马逊的日常员工调查工具，称为连接。今年早些时候，亚马逊的人力资源部门被重新命名为人们的经验和技术（PXT）。</p><p> A longtime Amazon HR manager told Recode that software tools have “improved dramatically” under Galetti’s leadership. Anderson, the Amazon spokesperson, noted that the company has 1.3 million employees globally and that developing internal HR software products is crucial, including for effectively doing DEI work.</p><p> 长期的亚马逊人力资源经理告诉Recode，软件工具在Galetti的领导下“急剧改进”。 Anderson是亚马逊发言人，并指出，该公司拥有130万员工，发展内部人力资源软件产品至关重要，包括有效地执行DEI工作。</p><p> “Beth is a brilliant operations professional and engineer,” the longtime HR manager added, “but it’s not surprising that these issues would be coming up under her because these aren’t issues she prioritizes or has experience in.”</p><p> “贝丝是一家辉煌的作业专业和工程师，”长期的人力资源经理添加了“但是这些问题将在她下面的问题并不奇怪，因为这些问题并不是她优先考虑或有经验。”</p><p> The Amazon spokesperson said it’s not uncommon for the company to put leaders in charge of an area that they don’t have prior experience in. Other tech giants like Google and Facebook have similarly employed HR leaders who don’t come from a human resources background.</p><p> 亚马逊发言人表示，该公司将负责人的领导者提出了他们没有事先经验的领域并不罕见。谷歌和Facebook这样的其他科技巨头同样使用不来自人力资源背景的人力资源领导者。</p><p> The problem in this case, according to people who’ve worked in diversity roles at Amazon, is that Galetti and her deputies have gone on to hire several key DEI employees who similarly don’t have meaningful experience doing diversity work. Sources pointed out that the head of diversity efforts within Amazon Web Services was for years a white woman who had significant HR experience but no specific expertise in the field of diversity and inclusion. Multiple sources told Recode that they believe this leader didn’t understand the basics of diversity, equity, and inclusion work.</p><p> 根据这种情况，根据在亚马逊的多样性角色工作的人的说法，即加尔蒂和她的代表已经开始雇用几位同样没有有意义的经历多样性工作的关键员工。消息人士指出，亚马逊网络服务中的多样性努力负责人多年来一直是一个白人女性，他们在多元化和包容性领域没有具体的专业知识。多个来源告诉回收他们认为这一领导者不了解多样性，公平和包容性的基础知识。 </p><p> “Many executives at Amazon ... haven’t had to examine their privilege, so it’s counter to their worldview to think about how people may be coming in at very real disadvantages”</p><p>“亚马逊的许多高管......不得不审查他们的特权，所以这是他们的世界观，以考虑人们如何在非常真实的缺点中进入”</p><p> “One thing not called out is the number of white women who have senior leadership roles currently, and ... have held no D&amp;I roles before,” a former Amazon diversity employee said. “Sometimes, I know, [it’s] someone ... passionate about the work. [But] that’s never enough for Black women to just be passionate about something. We are in rooms with people who are in some ways gatekeeping the work that gets done. They don’t have real experience but are seated at the table as a peer.”</p><p> “一件事没有被召唤是目前拥有高级领导角色的白人女性的数量，......曾经举行过D＆amp;我以前的角色，”一位前亚马逊多样性员工说。 “有时，我知道，[它是]某人......热情地对工作。 [但]这对黑人女性来说，这是对某事的热情。我们在与某些方式中的人员在某种程度上看待完成所做的工作。他们没有真正的经验，但坐在桌子上作为同行。“</p><p> And when Amazon finally hired an experienced diversity director in 2017 who’d overseen diversity work for a Fortune 100 company, she lasted less than two years in the role. (She currently runs DEI work in an entirely different division at the company — a move that the company spokesperson said was voluntary.) Multiple people described Galetti’s relationship with this director, who is a Black woman, as toxic and, at times, unprofessional. Sources who witnessed interactions between the two said that Galetti often talked over her in meetings and avoided eye contact with her. In one instance, sources say, Galetti called for a redo of internal training videos starring the diversity chief, with the HR leader saying, “I don’t want us to sound too trite.”</p><p> 当亚马逊终于雇用了2017年的经验丰富的多样性董事，他为一家财富100家公司监督多样性工作，她持续不到两年的角色。 （她目前在公司的一个完全不同的部门中运行Dei工作 - 该公司发言人表示自愿的举措。）多个人描述了加尔蒂与这位董事的关系，是一个黑人女性，毒性，有时是一个不专业的。目睹两人之间相互作用的来源表示，加尔蒂经常在她的会议上谈论并避免与她的目光接触。在一个例子中，消息人士称，格莱蒂呼吁重做内部训练视频主演的多样性主管，随着人力资源负责人，“我不希望我们过于陈腐。”</p><p> Some diversity employees also say it’s telling that both this diversity head and her successor had “director” titles in Amazon’s management hierarchy, and not a higher-level “vice president” label. Amazon has around 400 vice presidents at the company, but none focused on diversity work.</p><p> 一些多样性员工还说，这表明这两个多样性头和她的继任者在亚马逊管理层次结构中有“导演”标题，而不是一个更高级别的“副总裁”标签。亚马逊拥有大约400个副总裁，但没有专注于多样性的工作。</p><p> “She has singular authority on her own to change that,” a former Amazon diversity employee said of Galetti. Amazon leaders have told staff, and a spokesperson told Recode, that they are now searching for a VP-level executive to run diversity work at the company.</p><p> “她自己拥有奇异的权威，改变这一点，”一位前亚马逊多样性员工对加莱蒂说。亚马逊领导人告诉员工，发言人告诉核选，他们现在正在寻找一家副驾驶级主管，在公司运行多样性工作。</p><p> Despite all this, it was a big moment in 2017 when a group of Amazon executives and diversity staff, including Galetti, met to craft and review a memo on diversity that would be the first of its kind ever presented to Bezos. Some staffers pushed for the memo to propose that Amazon could begin inviting warehouse employees, who are disproportionately Black and Latinx compared to corporate staff, to apply for a technical training program called the Amazon Technology Academy. The program was at the time only open to corporate employees. The idea was to offer warehouse workers a way to acquire skills they might need to make a jump to white-collar work, while helping improve racial diversity among the company’s corporate staff.</p><p> 尽管如此，它是2017年的一大片时刻，当时一群亚马逊高管和多样性工作人员，包括加莱蒂，遇到了工艺，并审查了一个备忘录，这将是曾经呈现给贝斯科斯的第一个。一些员工推动了备忘录，提出亚马逊可以开始邀请仓库雇员，而与企业员工相比，申请了黑色和拉丁裔的仓库员工，申请雅顿科技学院的技术培训计划。该计划当时只向公司员工开放。这个想法是为仓库工人提供一种获得他们可能需要跳转到白领工作的技能的方法，同时帮助提高公司的公司员工之间的种族多样性。</p><p>  “This isn’t McDonald’s,” the HR leader told the group, according to people familiar with the meeting discussion. “You don’t go from making fries to corporate.”</p><p>  “这不是麦当劳，”人力资源领导人告诉小组，据熟悉会议讨论。 “你不会从公司赚到薯条。” </p><p>  Through a spokesperson, Galetti denied making these remarks. The spokesperson added that Galetti is now the co-executive sponsor of the Amazon Technical Academy and a supporter of other company programs to “upskill” front-line employees, including one that has promised to spend $700 million to train 100,000 Amazon employees for new in-demand jobs by 2025. The Amazon Technical Academy began in 2017 but did not start accepting warehouse employees until its second cohort in 2019. The program recently graduated 77 employees, around 40 percent of whom previously held warehouse roles, according to the spokesperson.</p><p>通过发言人，加莱蒂否认了这些评论。发言人补充说，格莱蒂现在是亚马逊技术学院的共同行政赞助商，以及其他公司计划的支持者，以“Upskill”的前线员工，包括承诺花费7亿美元的人培训100,000名亚马逊员工进行新的员工-Demand乔布斯到2025年。亚马逊技术学院始于2017年，但直到2019年第二次队列未开始接受仓库员工。该计划据发言人较近毕业的77名员工，其中约有40％的员工占仓库角色。</p><p>  More recently, Galetti’s actions — more than her words — have angered employees focused on diversity work. In late 2020, around a dozen new people transferred internally to the global diversity team. But according to sources throughout Amazon, none of these employees had any previous experience in diversity work. They were employment lawyers and other staff focused on investigations and compliance.</p><p>  最近，格莱蒂的行为 - 超过她的话 - 愤怒的员工专注于多样性工作。 2020年代末，大约十几名新人内部转移到全球多样性团队。但根据亚马逊的来源，这些员工都没有以前的多样性工作经验。他们是就业律师和其他专注于调查和遵守的工作人员。</p><p> And when Amazon’s former head of the global diversity team, Elizabeth Nieto, left the company in early 2021, Galetti replaced her, at least on an interim basis, with a longtime vice president in charge of a large technical team focused on recruiting. But the actual day-to-day management of the diversity team shifted to one of the employment lawyers who had just a few months earlier joined the diversity organization — she had no other prior DEI experience. (Amazon has two structures for diversity work at the company. The majority of diversity employees work within different business divisions like Amazon Web Services or Amazon Studios, while a smaller group of employees work on a central global diversity team under human resources and Galetti that’s intended to work on company-wide initiatives versus division-specific ones.)</p><p> 当亚马逊前任全球多样性团队的前任伊丽莎白Nieto，在2021年初离开公司时，加莱蒂至少临时替代她，长期副总裁负责一个专注于招聘的大型技术团队。但是，多样性团队的实际日常管理转移到了几个月前几个月的雇佣律师之一加入了多样性组织 - 她没有其他先前的DEI经验。 （亚马逊在公司拥有两种多样性工作的结构。大多数多样性员工在亚马逊网络服务或亚马逊工作室等不同的业务部门工作，而一名较小的员工群体在人力资源和格莱蒂下的中央全球多样性团队工作致力于公司范围的举措与分区特定的举措。）</p><p> Sources told Recode that once the employment attorney took over the diversity team, she moved members of its research, analytics, and recruiting units to other divisions of the company. An internal memo announcing the restructuring said the departing employees would still be “closely tied” to the central diversity team, but the shake-up was nonetheless a shock to DEI employees across Amazon.</p><p> 消息人士告诉贷款一旦雇佣律师接管了多样性队伍，她就会将其研究，分析和招聘单位迁移到公司其他部门。宣布重组的内部备忘录表示，离境员工仍将“密切相关”到中央多样性团队，但随着亚马逊跨越Dei员工的震荡，突起仍然是震惊。</p><p> “You can’t say you’re committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion and then start dismantling the DEI team”</p><p> “你不能说你致力于多样性，公平和包容，然后开始拆除dei团队”</p><p> Then, just two days after Recode notified Amazon about the content of this story, the company announced yet another reshuffling: The employment lawyer who had been the day-to-day leader of the diversity team on an interim basis was now moving with her staff off the diversity team. The new employment lawyer is becoming Galetti’s pseudo-chief of staff, according to sources — a role known inside Amazon as a technical adviser or “shadow.” With this change, the group’s actual DEI experts would remain on the diversity team but begin reporting to a new temporary boss until a permanent vice president is hired to head up DEI work across Amazon.</p><p> 然后，再回复两天后的亚马逊关于这个故事的内容，该公司宣布了另一个重组：雇用律师一直是多样性团队的日常领导人，现在正在与她的员工一起搬家关闭多样性团队。根据消息来源的说法，新的就业律师正在成为Galetti的伪人员员工 - 亚马逊内部作为技术顾问或“阴影”。通过这种变化，本集团的实际DEI专家将留在多样性团队上，但开始向新的临时老板报告，直到聘请常设副总统朝阳朝亚马逊努力工作。</p><p> Even before this latest overhaul, around two dozen members of Amazon’s central diversity team had either left the team or been pushed out over the past two years, according to sources. Today, the team has fewer than 10 employees, sources say.</p><p> 据消息人士称，甚至在这次最新的大修之前，亚马逊的中央多样性团队的大约两次成员们已经离开了球队或过去两年后被推出。消息人士称，今天，该团队的员工少于10名员工。 </p><p> “You can’t say you’re committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion and then start dismantling the DEI team,” a person who has worked in a diversity role at Amazon told Recode.</p><p>“你不能说你致力于多样性，公平和包容，然后开始拆除Dei团队，”在亚马逊在亚马逊的多样性作用中致力于撰写的人。</p><p> This shake-up has stunned employees across the company — especially because of the timing. As they were rolling out these changes, Galetti and other Amazon leaders have been expressing how much the company cares about recruiting a more diverse set of employees and executives, while also improving the experience at Amazon for folks from underrepresented backgrounds once they get in the door.</p><p> 这次Shapl-Up在公司过度震惊的员工 - 特别是因为时机。因为他们推出这些变化，格莱蒂和其他亚马逊领导人一直表达了公司关心招募更多样化的员工和高管的人，同时还改善了亚马逊的经验，因为他们进入门口的人员来自不足的背景。 。</p><p> “We are committed to fostering a culture in which inclusion is the norm for all Amazonians,”  Galetti wrote in a company blog post on April 14. “I am grateful to the many employees who continue to share their experiences with me and other senior leaders. Tough feedback is always uncomfortable to hear, but their stories remind us that we have more work to do to achieve our goals. This is some of the most important work we have ever done, and we are committed to building a more inclusive and diverse Amazon for the long term.”</p><p> “我们致力于培养一种文化，其中包含所有亚马逊人的常态，”格莱蒂于4月14日在一家公司博客帖子中写道。“我很感谢那些继续与我和其他高级领导者分享经验的许多员工。艰难的反馈总是不舒服，但他们的故事提醒我们，我们有更多的工作来实现我们的目标。这是我们所做的一些最重要的工作，我们致力于长期构建更加包容和多样化的亚马逊。“</p><p> Galetti then listed 11 company-wide goals related to DEI work, including inspecting “any statistically significant demographic differences” in performance ratings given by managers and employee attrition, as well as the goal of retaining “employees at statistically similar rates across all demographics.” Several other goals were focused specifically on Black employees and Black executives, including doubling the number of Black executives at the director and vice president levels for the second year in a row.</p><p> 然后格莱蒂列出了与DEI工作相关的11个公司范围的目标，包括检查经理和员工疲劳的业绩评级的“任何统计上大量的人口统计差异”，以及在所有人口统计数据上以统计上类似的速率保留“员工”的目标。“其他几个目标专门专注于黑人员工和黑人高管，包括连续第二年的董事和副总裁水平的加倍黑人高管人数。</p><p> But some diversity employees pointed out how recently announced goals, like inspecting performance ratings and attrition rates for racial disparities, only came after Recode published its February investigation into racial issues at the company.</p><p> 但一些多样性员工指出最近宣布的目标，就像检查种族差异的性能评级和磨损率一样，才会签订2月份调查本公司的种族问题。</p><p> “No matter how many people suffer, they always ignore it unless it appears to hurt their brand or threaten leadership,” a current diversity employee told Recode.</p><p> “无论有多少人受苦，除非似乎伤害了他们的品牌或威胁领导，否则他们总是忽视它，”目前的多样性员工告诉回收。</p><p> It is true that Amazon has been making progress in increasing representation of employees of races that are typically underrepresented in the tech industry.
