Overcome any feelings of loss or failure by pivoting toward a new passion</p><p>适应能力和勇气一样是美德。通过转向新的激情来克服任何失落或失败的感觉</p><p> Emma Garber began dancing aged three. By the time she was a teenager – following years of dedicated, exhausting, sometimes painful training – it was her burning ambition to become a professional ballet dancer. ‘I think around age 14, I sat my parents down and I said:  This is what I want to do with my life. This is what makes me happy,’ she says.</p><p> 艾玛·加伯（Emma Garber）3岁开始跳舞。到她十几岁的时候-经过多年的专心，疲惫，有时是痛苦的训练-她成为一名专业芭蕾舞演员的野心很大。 ‘我想14岁左右，我就让父母坐下，然后我说：这就是我一生要做的事。这就是让我开心的原因，’她说。</p><p> All of us have dreams and hopes for our future. They are often career-focused, but not always. Some people dream of starting a family or living in another country, for instance. Our dreams form part of our identity, giving us purpose and direction. That is, until reality gets in the way, as so often happens: the change might come from within us, as our passion wanes, or the obstacles to realising the dream might become insurmountable (or a mixture of the two).</p><p> 我们所有人对我们的未来都有梦想和希望。他们通常以职业为重点，但并非总是如此。例如，有些人梦想着建立家庭或生活在另一个国家。我们的梦想是我们身份的一部分，为我们提供目标和方向。就是说，直到现实成为现实，这种情况经常发生：随着我们激情的消逝，变化可能来自我们内部，或者实现梦想的障碍可能变得无法克服（或两者兼而有之）。</p><p> Garber’s dream began to fade amid burnout and doubt during her freshman year at the University of Massachusetts. After a particularly terrible dance class, she recalls: ‘I was like,  I don’t think I want to do this for the rest of my life. I stood up, I walked out, I called my mom and I was like,  I don’t even know what I want to do with my life anymore.’</p><p> 加伯（Garber）在马萨诸塞州大学（University of Massachusetts）大学大一的那一年，由于倦怠和怀疑，梦想开始消失。在经历了一场特别糟糕的舞蹈课后，她回忆道：“我当时想，我不想一生都想这样做。我站起来，走了出去，给妈妈打了个电话，我当时的想法是，我什至不知道该如何应对自己的生活。’</p><p> You might be experiencing one of these unsettling fork-in-the-road moments yourself. Perhaps the dying breath of a fading dream is leaving you with intense feelings of regret and failure. You might fear how others will judge you. After all, in today’s culture, in many parts of the world, we’re taught from a young age that success is born from stubborn perseverance.</p><p> 您可能自己正在经历这些令人不安的分叉时刻之一。也许渐逝的梦的垂死呼吸使您充满了遗憾和失败的强烈感觉。您可能会担心别人会如何评价您。毕竟，在当今世界的文化中，在世界许多地方，我们从小就被教导说成功是源于顽固的毅力。</p><p> ‘To be gritty,’ writes the psychologist Angela Duckworth in her bestselling  book  Grit (2016), ‘is to fall down seven times, and rise eight.’ The gist of her advice has echoed through different eras. ‘Many of life’s failures are people who did not realise how close they were to success when they gave up,’ wrote the inventor Thomas Edison.</p><p> 心理学家安吉拉·达克沃思（Angela Duckworth）在她的畅销书《坚毅》（2016年）中写道：“要坚毅不屈，要跌倒七次，升八次。”她的建议的要旨已经回荡了不同时代。发明家托马斯·爱迪生（Thomas Edison）写道：“生活中的许多失败是那些没有意识到自己放弃成功会多么接近的人。”</p><p> Given this dominant narrative of the virtues of perseverance, and considering how our ambitions can become a core part of our sense of self, it’s understandable that you might be finding it difficult and unsettling to face the prospect of losing your dream. You can take comfort, though, in knowing that being adaptable and flexible in one’s ambitions is just as important as being gritty or determined. ‘By definition, if you cannot achieve what you want to achieve, you will fail repeatedly if you don’t stop,’ says Carsten Wrosch, a psychology professor at Concordia University in Montreal, who has been studying the construct of ‘goal adjustment capacity’ for more than 20 years.</p><p> 考虑到这种坚持不懈的美德的优势叙述，并考虑到我们的雄心如何成为自我意识的核心部分，可以理解的是，面对失去梦想的前景，您可能会感到困难和不安。不过，您可以放心，知道自己的野心能适应和灵活与坚毅或坚决一样重要。蒙特利尔康考迪亚大学心理学教授卡斯滕·沃什（Carsten Wrosch）说：“按照定义，如果您无法实现想要达到的目标，那么如果您不停下来，就会反复失败。” '已有20多年了。 </p><p> Goal adjustment capacity – which psychologists  see as a beneficial form of ‘self-regulation’ or ‘self-management’ – encapsulates two key components: the ability to disengage from fruitless goals and the ability to reengage in new, more productive goals. You could see it as knowing when and how to switch from one dream to another. It’s measured by agreement with questionnaire items such as ‘It’s easy for me to stop thinking about the goal and let it go’ and ‘I tell myself that I have a number of other new goals to draw upon.’</p><p>目标调整能力（心理学家认为是“自我调节”或“自我管理”的一种有益形式）包含两个关键组成部分：脱离毫无结果的目标的能力和重新参与更具生产力的目标的能力。您可以将其视为了解何时以及如何从一个梦想转换到另一个梦想。这是通过与“我很容易停止思考目标并放手去做”和“我告诉自己我还有许多其他新目标可利用”这样的问卷调查项目的协议来衡量的。</p><p> Wrosch says that people who lack this capacity are inclined to ‘bang their head against the wall’ when they’re confronted by an unobtainable goal, and, long-term, they’re more prone to stress and chronic illness. In contrast, those with greater adjustment capacity ‘have a much easier time’ – they decommit to the fruitless goal and find a different ambition to pursue. The virtues of being flexible and adaptable are also recognised by careers researchers, who  refer to ‘career adaptability’, aspects of which involve being curious about new opportunities and being confident in one’s ability to learn new skills. People who score highly in this trait are generally ‘happier. They perform better. They get promoted … Just a whole range of good things,’ says Rajiv Amarnani, a lecturer in the University of Western Australia Business School. That you’re contemplating giving up your dream suggests that you have a healthy willingness to adjust and adapt, which is to your advantage.</p><p> 弗罗什说，缺乏这种能力的人在面临无法实现的目标时倾向于“撞墙撞墙”，从长远来看，他们更容易承受压力和慢性病。相比之下，那些具有更大调整能力的人“拥有更轻松的时间” –他们致力于徒劳的目标，并追求另一种野心。职业研究人员也承认灵活和适应能力的优点，称其为“职业适应能力”，其中包括对新机会充满好奇并对学习新技能的能力充满信心。在此特质上得分高的人通常会更快乐。他们表现更好。他们得到了晋升……只是各种各样的好东西，”西澳大利亚大学商学院讲师Rajiv Amarnani说。您打算放弃自己的梦想，这表明您有适应和适应的健康意愿，这对您有利。</p><p> If you’re nonetheless finding it difficult to look beyond the immediate sense of loss or failure, know that there are routes ahead and that other opportunities will emerge. By having the wisdom and flexibility to know when to let go, or when to redirect your passion, you’ll be following in the footsteps of many who have achieved greatness. David Foster Wallace let go of his tennis-greatness dreams and became an acclaimed novelist and writer instead. Meanwhile, Roger Federer’s dreams of tennis greatness came true, but only at the expense of his dream of becoming a professional footballer. And Maryam Mirzakhani let go her childhood dream of becoming a novelist but went on to be awarded the Fields Medal for mathematics in 2014 – the first and only woman ever to receive the honour.</p><p> 但是，如果您发现难以超越眼前的失落或失败感，请知道前面还有路，还会有其他机会。通过拥有智慧和灵活性，知道什么时候该放手，什么时候该重新定向自己的激情，您将跟随许多成就卓越的人的脚步。大卫·福斯特·华莱士（David Foster Wallace）放下了网球梦想，取而代之的是成为著名的小说家和作家。同时，罗杰·费德勒（Roger Federer）的网球梦想实现了，但这只是以他成为一名职业足球运动员的梦想为代价。 Maryam Mirzakhani放弃了成为小说家的童年梦想，但在2014年被授予菲尔兹数学奖-这是有史以来第一位也是唯一一位获得这一荣誉的女性。</p><p> These are dramatic examples, but they show that the path to fulfilment isn’t always smooth or direct. Once you’ve come to terms with your loss, you’ll find other passions. New dreams await.</p><p> 这些是生动的例子，但它们表明实现目标的道路并不总是一帆风顺或直接的。一旦对损失感到满意，您就会发现其他激情。新的梦想在等待。</p><p> As you let your dream go, you might be agonising over whether you’re making a mistake. ‘There’s no good answer, there’s no formula’ for deciding whether to plough on or give up, says Wrosch. However, he recommends bearing in mind a phenomenon known as ‘goal shielding’ – when we’re highly focused on a particular dream or ambition, we tend to filter out inconvenient information that might imperil the project. ‘Motivational psychologists call it an “implemental mindset”,’ says Wrosch. ‘If you cross the Rubicon, you focus on what you want to achieve, and you don’t have that balance [in how you process the situation] any more.’ For that reason, he says most us are, if anything, probably more at risk of stubbornly pursuing a dream for too long than giving up too early.</p><p> 当您放飞自己的梦想时，您可能会为自己是否犯错感到痛苦。弗罗什说：“没有好的答案，没有公式”来决定是继续耕种还是放弃。但是，他建议牢记一种称为“目标屏蔽”的现象-当我们高度专注于特定的梦想或抱负时，我们往往会过滤掉可能危害项目的不便信息。沃罗斯说：“动机心理学家称其为“实施思维模式”。 “如果您跨过Rubicon，您将专注于想要实现的目标，而在[如何处理情况]上就失去了平衡。”出于这个原因，他说，大多数情况下，我们可能是与过早放弃相比，更多地拥有太久顽固追求梦想的风险。</p><p> The author and entrepreneur Seth Godin agrees with Wrosch – ‘there’s no calculus’ for deciding when to give up, he says. He too warns that most of us ‘lie to ourselves all the time about whether we have the resources to get through the dip’. ‘The dip’ is Godin’s term – taken from his 2007  book of the same name, and subtitled  A Little Book That Teaches You When to Quit (and When to Stick) – that he says refers to the ‘difficult space in between the joy of starting and the benefit of getting to the other side’.</p><p> 他说，作家兼企业家塞思·戈丁（Seth Godin）同意沃罗斯（Wrosch）的观点，“决定何时放弃”没有“微积分”。他也警告说，我们大多数人“一直在对自己撒谎，以了解我们是否有足够的资源度过难关”。 “浸”是戈丁的术语-取自他2007年同名的书，副标题为“教你何时退出（和何时坚持）的小书”-他说是指“欢乐之间的艰难空间”。开始以及到达另一端的好处”。</p><p> One way to think about this emotionally difficult moment is as a chance to be objective about your dream. Was pursuing it coming at great personal cost, in terms of your relationships and other goals in life? If so, that would suggest it was what psychologists call an ‘obsessive passion’ and you’re wise to give it up (as distinct from a ‘harmonious passion’ that fits well into the rest of your life).</p><p> 思考这个情绪困难时刻的一种方法是，可以客观地实现自己的梦想。就您的人际关系和生活中的其他目标而言，追求它是否付出了巨大的个人代价？如果是这样，那将表明这就是心理学家所说的“痴迷激情”，您应该明智地放弃它（与很适合您余生的“和谐激情”不同）。 </p><p> Also, try to think, if you can, more like a ‘healthy perfectionist’: recognise that letting go of your goals doesn’t cast some final verdict on you as a person, and acknowledge the influence of circumstances beyond your control. Remember too that success isn’t all or nothing – although you might not have fulfilled your dream in its entirety, you will likely have learned much along the way, and you now have the chance to redirect your energy and passion in new ways. This is also a good time to seek the counsel of close family and friends. They’ll be able to help you view your situation objectively and come to terms with your decision.</p><p>另外，如果可以的话，请尝试更像是“健康的完美主义者”：认识到放开目标并不会对您作为一个人产生最终的决定，并承认情况的影响是您无法控制的。还要记住，成功并非全部或没有-尽管您可能没有完全实现自己的梦想，但您可能会在此过程中学到很多东西，并且现在您有机会以新的方式改变自己的精力和激情。这也是寻求亲朋好友的忠告。他们将能够帮助您客观地查看您的情况并做出决定。</p><p>  When you decide to let go of a dream, it’s almost inevitable that it’s going to hurt, at least for a time, but there are ways to ease the discomfort and move on. ‘My approach to this is starting with the tragic realism of it, that it’s going to be hard, it’s going to hurt,’ says Amarnani, who likens the experience of giving up a dream to a romantic breakup. ‘To have an ambition is to have this vision of your future self, and to drop that is to drop a piece of you,’ he says.</p><p>  当您决定放弃梦想时，它几乎不可避免地会受到伤害，至少是暂时的，但是有一些方法可以缓解不适并继续前进。阿玛纳尼说：“我的做法是从悲剧的现实主义开始，这将是艰难的，它将受到伤害。”他将放弃梦想的经历比作浪漫的分手。他说：“有抱负是对未来自我的愿景，而放弃那就是失去一部分人。”</p><p> That parallel with relationships offers an effective clue for how to cope. In the context of romantic relationships, Amarnani says that it can be therapeutic to be realistic, rather than idealistic, about the person you’re breaking from, even to focus deliberately on their flaws. If we’re honest, many of our dreams are romanticised, and it’s worth remembering that what you’re giving up is not that fantasy version of the future. We think of doctors as healing people, says Amarnani, or that staff at the United Nations are building peace, but then their daily reality is often far more mundane – doctors are navigating the bureaucracy of their healthcare system; workers at the UN are pushing paperwork around.</p><p> 与人际关系的平行为如何应对提供了有效的线索。在浪漫关系的背景下，Amarnani表示，对于要分手的人，要现实而不是理想，甚至可以刻意关注他们的缺点，这可能是有益的。老实说，我们的许多梦想都是浪漫的，值得记住的是，您放弃的并不是未来的幻想版本。阿玛纳尼说，我们认为医生是医病的人，或者联合国的工作人员正在建立和平，但是后来他们的日常现实往往变得平淡无奇–医生正在他们医疗保健系统的官僚主义中前进。联合国的工人正在推动文书工作。</p><p> Amarnani speaks partly from personal experience. He once harboured a dream to become a computational cognitive neuroscientist, but he suffered repeated rejections and then the financial crisis hit. He changed gears to become a management scholar – ‘I thought I was selling my soul,’ he says, ‘but really what I was doing was just adjusting to the situation, being adaptable and trusting that, when you try something new, the passion will come.’ To help make peace with his decision, Amarnani focused on the negatives of the field he gave up –‘Decades of research on the brain has taught us next to nothing about the mind’ – and today he couldn’t be happier that he gave up his dream. ‘I grieved, genuinely,’ he says, ‘but life does go on.’</p><p> Amarnani的讲话部分来自个人经验。他曾经怀a着成为计算认知神经科学家的梦想，但他屡遭拒绝，然后金融危机袭来。他改变了方向，成为一名管理学者。他说：“我以为我是在卖掉自己的灵魂。但实际上，我所做的只是适应形势，适应并相信当您尝试新事物时，热情为了帮助实现他的决定而和平，阿玛纳尼（Amarnani）专注于他放弃的领域的负面因素-“数十年的大脑研究使我们几乎无所顾忌”-今天他再也不能快乐了他放弃了自己的梦想。他说：“我真的很伤心，但是生活还在继续。”</p><p>  It’s a cliché to say that one door closing means another opening, but it’s true. By letting go of an impossible dream, you’re freeing yourself to put time and effort into a potentially more rewarding project. It’s tempting to look at a high achiever such as Godin and assume that he arrived at his success via a direct path, propelled by grit and focused ambition. But, like most successful people, Godin has left behind many dreams in his past, including the sale of his company Yoyodyne to Yahoo for about $30 million in the late-1990s. ‘So I didn’t end up running a giant corporation. And that was fine,’ he says. ‘And I used to help run a summer camp up in northern Canada. And it was my dream for a long time. But if I had pursued that dream, I wouldn’t have the stuff I have now.’ Among other things, that includes authoring no fewer than 19 books since 1993, and being inducted into both the Marketing Hall of Fame and the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame.</p><p>  俗话说，一扇门的关闭意味着另一扇门的打开，但这是事实。通过放弃一个不可能的梦想，您可以释放自己的时间和精力来进行可能更具回报的项目。诱人的是，看看戈丁（Godin）这样的高成就者，并假设他是在勇气和专心致志的推动下，通过一条直接道路取得了成功。但是，与大多数成功人士一样，戈丁过去也留下了许多梦想，包括在1990年代后期以约3000万美元的价格将他的公司Yoyodyne出售给雅虎。 ‘所以我最终并没有经营一家大型公司。很好，’他说。 ‘而且我曾经帮助在加拿大北部经营一个夏令营。这是我很长一段时间的梦想。但是，如果我实现了这个梦想，我将没有现在拥有的东西。”其中包括自1993年以来创作不少于19本书，并入选“市场名人堂”和“直接市场厅”。名望。</p><p> Godin’s is an extraordinary career, but you too can find ways to redirect your passion and interests in new paths. If you can find something that fulfils the same needs, but which is more feasible, then that’s likely to be ‘a good replacement goal’, says Wrosch. If you dreamed of playing professional football, for instance, you could become a coach (and still play for your local club at the weekends). Garber has taken this approach: she still dances as a hobby – and enjoys it more now that there’s no pressure – and she’s combining her new career path as a journalist with her former dream. ‘This summer, I did a PR internship for a dance company, which was really rewarding, and I’m doing some similar work now,’ she says.</p><p> Godin的职业生涯非凡，但您也可以找到方法，以新的方式改变您的热情和兴趣。 Wrosch说，如果您找到满足相同需求但更可行的产品，则可能是“一个很好的替代目标”。例如，如果您梦想参加职业足球比赛，您可以成为一名教练（并在周末仍为您当地的俱乐部效力）。 Garber采取了这种方法：她仍然是一种舞蹈爱好，并且在没有压力的情况下更喜欢这种舞蹈–并且她将自己作为记者的新职业道路与以前的梦想相结合。她说：“今年夏天，我在一家舞蹈公司做过PR实习，这确实很有意义，现在我也在做类似的工作。”</p><p> It can be particularly painful to let go of a dream when you’re forced to do so by circumstance, such as for health reasons. But, still, there might be ways to channel your passion. If you dreamed of starting your family, for instance, but haven’t been able to for whatever reason, you might find fulfilment in teaching or childcare. Acceptance and commitment therapy – an offshoot of CBT –  teaches us to focus on what we can do in pursuit of our values and interests, rather than lamenting what we’ve lost. Say you dreamed of being a lawyer but health problems preclude such a heavy workload: perhaps your overarching concern to stand up for people could be expressed through community advocacy?</p><p> 当您出于健康原因被迫放弃梦想时，做梦尤其痛苦。但是，仍然有一些方法可以传达您的热情。举例来说，如果您梦想着要成立自己的家人，但由于某种原因而无法这样做，那么您可能会在教学或育儿方面有所成就。接受和承诺疗法（CBT的一个分支）教会我们专注于追求自己的价值观和利益时所能做的事情，而不是为自己的损失感到遗憾。假设您梦想成为一名律师，但是健康问题排除了如此繁重的工作量：也许您可以通过社区倡导来表达为人民辩护的总体关注？ </p><p> On the other hand, now you’re liberated from one particular dream, you might find it more appealing to use the newfound freedom to strike out in a completely different direction. If that’s the case, take your time and weigh up your options. Godin cautions against rushing. Instead, he talks about the ‘white, blank, empty, open space’ – that’s where ‘your subconscious will cook up the next thing you’re supposed to do,’ he says. ‘So, if you need to invent a new trapeze to hold on to, to get rid of this one, you’re probably not going to invent properly. You’re probably going to do it out of desperation. And I think it makes more sense to say, how do I use this open space to figure out what’s actually worth committing to?’</p><p>另一方面，现在您从一个特定的梦想中解放出来，您可能会发现，使用新发现的自由朝着完全不同的方向前进更有吸引力。如果是这种情况，请花点时间考虑一下您的选择。戈丁警告不要着急。他说，相反，他谈论的是“白色，空白，空旷，开放的空间”，在这里，“您的潜意识将烹饪您应该做的下一件事。” ‘因此，如果您需要发明一种新的飞人来坚持下去，而要摆脱它，您可能就不会适当地发明。您可能会绝望地这样做。我认为说这样更有意义，我该如何使用这个开放空间来找出真正值得承诺的内容？’</p><p> One practical exercise you could consider is to take a career interests quiz. There are many different versions available, but one of the most respected is the  Career Aptitude Test that’s based on the RIASEC theory put forward in the 1950s by the American psychologist John Holland, and which categorises your interests as being predominantly either Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising or Conventional.</p><p> 您可以考虑的一项实际练习是参加职业兴趣测验。有许多不同的版本可用，但最受推崇的版本之一是基于美国心理学家John Holland在1950年代提出的RIASEC理论的职业能力测验，该职业将您的兴趣归类为现实，研究和艺术，社交，进取或常规。</p><p> Certain careers are considered a better match to the different test categories (see a breakdown  here) – for instance, civil engineering falls under Realistic, and clinical psychology under Investigative. Underlying this approach is the basic idea that we’re more likely to excel and find satisfaction in career paths that match our underlying interests. Whether that’s true or not – and there’s a lively scholarly literature debating the evidence – the exercise might help fuel your imagination for what ambitions to pursue next.</p><p> 某些职业被认为是更适合不同考试类别的职业（请参阅此处的细分）–例如，土木工程属于“现实”，临床心理学属于“调查”。该方法的基本原理是，我们更有可能在与我们的基本兴趣相匹配的职业道路上表现出色并找到满足感。不管这是真的还是不正确的-并且有大量活跃的学术文献在讨论证据-该练习可能有助于激发您的想象力，以寻求下一个目标。</p><p> Our culture lionises grit and perseverance, but the ability to be adaptable and flexible, and pivot to new opportunities, is just as important.</p><p> 我们的文化充满勇气和毅力，但是适应能力和灵活性以及向新机遇转移的能力同样重要。</p><p> The common phenomenon of ‘goal shielding’ puts us at risk of persevering for too long with unobtainable dreams, though there is no surefire way to make the right decision on this.</p><p> 普遍存在的“目标遮蔽”现象使我们面临无法实现的梦想坚持不懈的风险，尽管尚无法确定正确的决策方法。</p><p> To assuage the pain of letting go of a dream, be realistic about what you’re giving up – even if you succeeded, it was unlikely to be the romanticised version you pictured.</p><p> 为了缓解放弃梦想的痛苦，请对自己要放弃的事情保持现实-即使您成功了，也不太可能成为您所描绘的浪漫版本。</p><p> To let go of a dream can be difficult and unsettling, but there will be other ways to channel or redirect your passion.</p><p> 放弃梦想可能很困难且令人不安，但是还有其他方法可以引导或重定向您的激情。 </p><p> Turn this moment to your advantage by exploring new opportunities and building your adaptability for the future. New dreams await.</p><p>通过探索新的机会并建立对未来的适应性，将这一刻转变为您的优势。新的梦想在等待。</p><p> A key part of having the capacity to move on from past dreams – ‘goal disengagement’ in the psychological jargon – is to relieve the sense of regret you feel, that nagging voice asking: ‘What if…?’ Earlier in his career, Wrosch  tested the benefits of a writing exercise for overcoming regret, one that was targeted at older adults for whom regret can be a particular issue. He and his colleagues found that the three-day exercise reduced regret intensity (as compared with a control group who didn’t complete the exercise) and this had a knock-on benefit for participants’ sleep quality.</p><p> 拥有从过去的梦想中继续前进的能力的关键部分-心理术语中的“目标脱离”-减轻您的后悔感，na的声音问：“如果……怎么办？” Wrosch在他职业生涯的早期测试了写作练习克服后悔的好处，该练习针对的是老年人，后悔可能是一个特别的问题。他和他的同事发现，为期三天的锻炼降低了后悔的强度（与未完成锻炼的对照组相比），这对参与者的睡眠质量具有连锁反应。</p><p> To try out the exercise for yourself, on the first day spend some time writing about those of your friends and peers who you know have regrets about dreams they’ve let go; on day two, spend some time writing about the external factors beyond your control that led to you giving up a particular dream or dreams; and finally, on day three, spend some time writing about your new dreams, why they’re interesting and enjoyable, and how they benefit others in your life or community. These three activities are based on the idea that it’s easier to let go of dreams when we realise that changing goals is an inevitable aspect of life; when we acknowledge the part played by external factors, rather than focusing on our own responsibility; and when we turn our attention to our uplifting replacement goals.</p><p> 为了自己进行练习，第一天花一些时间写信给您认识的朋友和同伴，他们对自己放弃的梦想感到遗憾；在第二天，花一些时间写一些无法控制的外部因素，这些外部因素导致您放弃一个或多个特定的梦想。最后，在第三天，花一些时间写一些关于您的新梦，为何有趣和令人愉悦以及他们如何使您的生活或社区中的其他人受益的梦想。这三项活动是基于这样的想法：当我们意识到改变目标是生活中不可避免的一部分时，放轻松梦想就容易了；当我们承认外部因素的作用时，而不是专注于我们自己的责任；当我们将注意力转向提升的更换目标时。</p><p> That exercise will hopefully help alleviate your regret at lost dreams but, as you move on, you could also use this moment to your advantage, to build your adaptability for the future. After all, such is life: you’ll likely have to let go of many dreams – both in your career and in your personal life. Learning to be flexible, how to pivot and find new purpose, is a skillset that’s just as desirable as having ‘grit’ or determination, though it’s not as exalted in the cultural consciousness.</p><p> 该练习有望帮助减轻您对梦lost以求的遗憾，但随着您的前进，您也可以利用这一时刻发挥自己的优势，以建立对未来的适应能力。毕竟，生活就是这样：您在职业生涯和个人生活中都可能不得不放弃许多梦想。学会灵活，如何枢纽并找到新的目标是一项技能，与具有“勇气”或决心的技能一样可取，尽管它在文化意识中并未得到崇高的评价。</p><p> This could involve your overall attitude to goals and dreams. Having just one intense, overarching dream will always be high-risk. So one simple way to increase your adaptability is to have at least two irons in the fire. Godin suggests starting a side hustle. ‘Turn off Netflix, turn off Facebook, and spend 20 hours of your free time a week doing a new thing without quitting your day job,’ he says. ‘Because this idea that everything has to be certain and perfect and full-time, I don’t think that’s particularly contemporary.’</p><p> 这可能涉及您对目标和梦想的总体态度。仅有一个强烈而首要的梦想永远是高风险。因此，提高适应性的一种简单方法是在火中至少有两个铁杆。戈丁建议开始忙碌起来。他说：“关闭Netflix，关闭Facebook，并每周花费20个小时的空闲时间来做新的事情，而不必离开日常工作。” ‘因为所有事情都必须是确定的，完美的和全职的，所以我认为这并不是特别现代。’</p><p> There is also some evidence that it’s possible to train one’s general adaptability for the future. These findings stem from the field of occupational psychology, and so they pertain to career adaptability, but the general philosophy is just as relevant for any kind of ambition.</p><p> 还有证据表明，有可能训练一个人对未来的总体适应能力。这些发现源于职业心理学领域，因此与职业适应性有关，但一般的哲学与任何野心都一样。</p><p> For instance, a 2012  study led by Jessie Koen at the University of Amsterdam suggested that it’s possible to train people (in this case, recent graduates) in several facets of ‘career adaptability’ – a flexible, forward-looking disposition that’s associated with greater odds of pivoting and finding satisfying re-employment opportunities. Specifically, exercises such as reflecting upon one’s values, visualising an ideal working day, training in information seeking, and in career planning, all helped to develop ‘concern’, ‘control’ and ‘curiosity’. The first of these career adaptability facets is about teaching people to look ahead and prepare for the future; the second is about being decisive (such as knowing when to change tack); and the last is about being open to different career opportunities. Other adaptability training  studies have produced similar results.</p><p> 例如，阿姆斯特丹大学的杰西·科恩（Jessie Koen）于2012年进行的一项研究表明，有可能在“职业适应性”的多个方面对人（在本例中为应届毕业生）进行培训-灵活，前瞻的性格与寻求和找到令人满意的再就业机会的可能性。具体来说，诸如反思一个人的价值观，形象化理想的工作日，在寻求信息方面的培训以及在职业规划方面的练习，都有助于培养“关注”，“控制”和“好奇心”。这些职业适应性方面的第一个方面是教导人们展望未来并为未来做准备。第二个是决定性的（例如知道何时改变策略）；最后是要面对不同的职业机会。其他适应性训练研究也产生了类似的结果。 </p><p> If you’re at school or college, it’s possible that your institution will offer a similar training programme. For everyone else, it might be a challenge to receive formal tuition in career adaptability, but you could take inspiration from the formal approach, for instance by reflecting upon what matters to you in life, spending time exploring new opportunities, and mapping out several alternative paths to your goals and dreams. In future, you could also consider planning in advance the conditions under which you’ll quit any particular goal or dream – that way, you avoid getting caught up in the emotion of a dream and persisting even when it’s to your disadvantage.</p><p>如果您在学校，则您的机构有可能会提供类似的培训计划。对于其他所有人来说，要获得职业适应性方面的正式学费可能是一个挑战，但是您可以从正式方法中获得启发，例如，反思生活中最重要的事情，花时间探索新的机会，并找出几种选择实现目标和梦想的途径。将来，您也可以考虑预先计划退出任何特定目标或梦想的条件-这样，您可以避免陷入梦想的情绪中并坚持下去，即使它对自己不利。</p><p> Let’s be realistic, though. No matter the preparations you put in place, and no matter how adaptable you become, the day you give up on a dream, you’re bound to feel sad. It’s only natural. You might well grieve. But do take comfort that it’s not forever. ‘That [bad] feeling will pass,’ says Armanani. ‘It’s all ephemeral.’</p><p> 现实一点吧。无论您进行了何种准备，也不管您变得多么适应，在放弃梦想的那一天，您一定都会感到难过。很自然你可能会很伤心。但是请放心，这不会永远存在。 “那种（不好的）感觉会过去的，”阿尔马纳尼说。 ‘都是短暂的。’</p><p> Garber experienced ‘a brief period of grief’ after letting go of her dancing dream, but two years later she says ‘it’s the best decision I ever made’. She’s still dancing, but now it’s purely for pleasure. And she’s loving her new passion of writing and journalism. ‘If something isn’t making you happy, don’t do it,’ she says. ‘Go find something else, because it’ll be worth it in the long run.’</p><p> Garber放弃了跳舞的梦想后经历了“短暂的悲伤”，但两年后她说“这是我做过的最好的决定”。她仍在跳舞，但现在纯粹是为了娱乐。而且，她热爱写作和新闻事业的新热情。她说：“如果某件事不能使你快乐，那就不要做。” ‘去寻找别的东西，因为从长远来看，这是值得的。’</p><p> The Career Relaunch  podcast is presented by the psychology researcher-turned insurance salesman-turned medic-turned marketeer-turned career coach Joseph Liu.
