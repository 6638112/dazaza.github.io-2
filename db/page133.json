and &#34;gasping for air&#34; during a terrifying mayday incident three years ago, a new aviation safety report has revealed.\n The Australian Transport Safety Bureau report released on Thursday shed disturbing details about an Express Freighters Australia aircraft, which was travelling from Brisbane to Melbourne on August 15, 2018.\n The crew donned oxygen masks when a caution light flickered, and the aircraft started an emergency descent.\n But during the initial part of the descent, the captain of the Qantas Boeing 737-376 was left &#34;temporarily incapacitated&#34; and &#34;gagging and gasping for breath&#34; by a reaction to the increased supply of breathing oxygen from the mask, according to the report.\n  A mayday was then declared by the co-pilot, also known as the first officer, and the aircraft started a diversion to Canberra Airport.\n  &#34;The first officer, cognisant that they had previously discussed feeling unwell, observed the captain slumped forward, gagging and gasping for air,&#34; the ATSB said.\n &#34;The first officer recalled checking on the captain during this episode but not receiving a response.&#34;\n  The captain radio called air traffic control, requesting the attendance of emergency services upon arrival at Canberra where the aircraft landed safely.\n The report noted that at &#34;no point&#34; were both pilots incapacitated at the same time.\n The investigation identified intermittent flickering of the master caution light and overheat annunciator were likely due to an electrical fault in the right wing-body overheat detection system.\n &#34;During the descent, the captain selected emergency flow on the oxygen mask resulting in an ingestion of gaseous oxygen, causing their temporary incapacitation,&#34; the report read.\n  &#34;The operating flight crew conducted the appropriate non-normal checklist, however the overheat indication could not be rectified due to the fault in the wing-body overheat detection system,&#34; the report read.\n &#34;An additional fault with an isolation valve in the aircraft pressurisation system prevented isolation of the right wing-body pressure duct.\n &#34;This led the crew to conduct further troubleshooting during which the cabin air supply was reduced.\n &#34;In conjunction with a higher than normal cabin leak rate, the reduced airflow also lessened the cabin pressure.&#34;\n After landing, both the captain and first officer were transported to hospital via ambulance for medical assessment.\n  Post\u2011occurrence medical testing and assessments did not identify lasting effects from the flight.\n  During inspections after the incident, Qantas engineers identified &#34;a range of serviceability issues&#34;

But the treadmills from Peloton are no ordinary  exercise machines. The company also sells video exercise programs for the treadmills through a subscription service, which can cost $39 a month.\n The removal of Just Run is related to a  voluntary recall it issued last month for the Tread+ and Tread product after the machines caused injuries to multiple children. In response, Peloton created a locking feature to prevent unauthorized access to the equipment. But the change came at the expense of Just Run, which once sat as a  virtual button on the Tread+ screen.\n In a statement, Peloton told PCMag that &#34;in our ongoing work to ensure our products are even safer, as part of our voluntary recall in collaboration with CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission), we released Tread Lock, a four digit passcode to secure Tread+ against unauthorized access,\u201d the company said. \u201cUnfortunately, Tread Lock is not yet available without a Peloton Membership, which means Tread+ owners without a subscription cannot access Just Run at this time.\u201d\n Still, Peloton says it&#39;s &#34;working on updates to Tread Lock that will allow us to make Tread Lock and Just Run available without a Peloton Membership,&#34; without elaborating.\n The demise of Just Run made headlines after Jennifer Strong, a Tread+ owner, posted about it on the Peloton Facebook group. She bought her machine in January 2019. But after a few months, she lost interest in the exercise programs from Peloton. Instead, she began using the \u201cJust Run\u201d function on her Tread+, which didn\u2019t require a subscription at all. It simply let her run on the machine like a normal treadmill.\n   \u201cUnfortunately at this time, \u2018Just Run\u2019 is no longer accessible without a Peloton membership,\u201d an email from Peloton\u2019s customer support told Strong, who posted it to Facebook.\n \u201cHow is this even possible that we cannot use the bike or tread anymore without a membership?! They\u2019re basically just paperweights now!\u201d she wrote.\n Her post has since sparked both anger and support over Peloton\u2019s decision to remove the free feature.\u00a0\u201cYou buy a $3,000 treadmill, then after you\u2019ve purchased [it], with a \u2018software update\u2019 they stop it from working until you pay them $39.99/mo? Sounds like Theft and  Ransomware to me,\u201d  wrote one user on Twitter.\n Other customers are questioning why anyone would buy a Peloton without a membership. \u201cI\u2019m baffled by the idea people use the Peloton without using the classes. Isn\u2019t that what Peloton is mostly founded upon?\u201d wrote one user in response to Strong\u2019s post.\n    The lack of clarity is frustrating Peloton customers such as Brianna Wu, a video game developer and former Congressional candidate, who also  publicized the removal of the Just Run feature for non-subscribers.\n \u201cI want Peloton to do the right thing here,\u201d she told PCMag. \u201cBecause their long-term success hinges on people feeling like they provide a good value. If people are scared their $3,000 investment is going to end up a paperweight, we don\u2019t help Peloton by excusing that.\u201d\n In the meantime, Strong hasn\u2019t been able to run on her Tread+ machine for the last week. And she has no plans on purchasing a monthly subscription.\n \u201cIf Peloton is going to cite safety is the issue for not using it I completely disagree,\u201d she told PCMag. \u201cThat\u2019s like buying a car and then the manufacturer making it not usable until you pay to use the airbags.\u201d\n This newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

", "note_en": "Firebolt, which has built a new kind of cloud data warehouse that promises much more efficient, and cheaper, analytics around whatever is stored within it, is announcing a major Series B of $127 million on the heels of huge demand for its services.\n The company, which  only came out of stealth mode in December, is not disclosing its valuation with this round, which brings the total raised by the Israeli company to $164 million. New backers Dawn Capital and K5 Global are in this round, alongside previous backers Zeev Ventures, TLV Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Angular Ventures.\n  Nor is it disclosing many details about its customers at the moment. CEO and co-founder Eldad Farkash told me in an interview that most of them are US-based, and that the numbers have grown from the dozen or so that were using Firebolt when it was still in stealth mode (it worked quietly for a couple of years building its product and onboarding customers before finally launching six months ago). They are all migrating from existing data warehousing solutions like Snowflake or BigQuery. In other words, its customers are already cloud-native, big-data companies: it\u2019s not trying to proselytize on the basic concept but work with those who are already in a specific place as a business.\n \u201cIf you\u2019re not using Snowflake or BigQuery already, we prefer you come back to us later,\u201d he said. Judging by the size and quick succession of the round, that focus is paying off.\n The challenge that Firebolt set out to tackle is that while data warehousing has become a key way for enterprises to analyze, update and manage their big data stores \u2014 after all, your data is only as good as the tools you have to parse it and keep it secure \u2014 typically data warehousing solutions are not efficient, and they can cost a lot of money to maintain.\n The challenge was seen first-hand by the three founders of Firebolt, Farkash (CEO), Saar Bitner (COO) and Ariel Yaroshevich (CTO) when they were at a previous company, the business intelligence powerhouse Sisense, where respectively they were one of its co-founders and two members of its founding team. At Sisense, the company continually came up against an issue: When you are dealing in terabytes of data, cloud data warehouses were straining to deliver good performance to power its analytics and other tools, and the only way to potentially continue to mitigate that was by piling on more cloud capacity. And that started to become very expensive.\n Firebolt set out to fix that by taking a different approach, re-architecting the concept. As Farkash sees it, while data warehousing has indeed been a big breakthrough in big data, it has started to feel like a dated solution as data troves have grown.\n \u201cData warehouses are solving yesterday\u2019s problem, which was, \u2018How do I migrate to the cloud and deal with scale?\u2019 \u201d he told me back in December. Google\u2019s BigQuery, Amazon\u2019s RedShift and Snowflake as fitting answers for that issue, believes, but \u201cwe see Firebolt as the new entrant in that space, with a new take on design on technology. We change the discussion from one of scale to one of speed and efficiency.\u201d\n The startup claims that its performance is up to 182 times faster than that of other data warehouses with a SQL-based system that works on academic research that had yet to be applied anywhere, around how to handle data in a lighter way, using new techniques in compression and how data is parsed. Data lakes in turn can be connected with a wider data ecosystem, and what it translates to is a much smaller requirement for cloud capacity. And lower costs.\n Fast forward to today, and the company says the concept is gaining a lot of traction with engineers and developers in industries like business intelligence, customer-facing services that need to parse a lot of information to serve information to users in real-time, and back-end data applications. That is proving out what investors suspected would be a shift before the startup even launched, stealthily or otherwise.\n \u201cI\u2019ve been an investor at Firebolt since their Series A round and before they had any paying customers,\u201d said Oren Zeev of Zeev Ventures. \u201cWhat had me invest in Firebolt is mostly the team. A group of highly experienced executives mostly from the big data space who understand the market very well, and the pain organizations are experiencing. In addition, after speaking to a few of my portfolio companies and Firebolt\u2019s initial design partners, it was clear that Firebolt is solving a major pain, so all in all, it was a fairly easy decision. The market in which Firebolt operates is huge if you consider the valuations of Snowflake and Databricks. Even more importantly, it is growing rapidly as the migration from on-premise data warehouse platforms to the cloud is gaining momentum, and as more and more companies rely on data for their operations and are building data applications.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 19:47:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5927\u6570\u636e,\u65b9\u6cd5,cheaper,\u6570\u636e", "title": "Firebolt\u4e3a\u5176\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b79\u96c6\u4e86127\u7c73\uff0c\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tFirebolt raises $127M more for its new approach to cheaper and more efficient big data analytics\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/firebolt-raises-127m-more-for-its-new-approach-to-cheaper-and-more-efficient-big-data-analytics/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u6570\u636e", "\u65b9\u6cd5", "cheaper", "\u6570\u636e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a37a85d426df4258f3d3e174fe21d44f.jpeg", "infoid": 1067946, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "VISA V -0.53\uff05\u540c\u610f\u652f\u4ed8\u8d85\u8fc720\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684TININ\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u745e\u5178\u521b\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5176\u6570\u5b57\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u8fde\u63a5\u8d85\u8fc73,400\u5bb6\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u3002\n  \u6700\u5927\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u5361\u7f51\u7edc\u6b63\u5728\u8d2d\u4e70\u91d1\u878d\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5ba2\u6237\u5df2\u6388\u4e88\u540c\u610f\uff0c\u8bf7\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u8054\u76df\u548cU.K\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u94f6\u884c\u76d1\u7ba1\u4f7f\u91d1\u878d\u516c\u53f8\u80fd\u591f\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ba2\u6237\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\n  \u94f6\u884c\u548c\u9762\u5411\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u4f7f\u7528Tink\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8ba9\u5ba2\u6237\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u7ba1\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u6784\u7684\u8d26\u6237\u3002\n  TINK CONNECKS\u7684\u94f6\u884c\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u673a\u6784\u5728\u6b27\u6d32\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc72.5\u4ebf\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\u901a\u8fc7TINK\uff0c\u94f6\u884c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6c47\u603b\u8d22\u52a1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u542f\u52a8\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e10\u6237\u6240\u6709\u6743\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e2a\u4eba\u91d1\u878d\u7ba1\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u601d\u8003\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u62e5\u6709400\u540d\u5458\u5de5\u3002\n      \u7b7e\u8bc1\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u989d\u5ea6\u4e3a18\u4ebf\u6b27\u5143\uff0c\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e21.15\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u6280\u672f\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4e0a\u5468\uff0cJPMORGAN CHASE\uff06amp;\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u8d2d\u4e70\u6570\u5b57\u8d22\u5bcc\u7ecf\u7406\u8089\u8c46\u853b\u50a8\u84c4\u548c\u6295\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8\u7ea610\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u63a8\u52a8\u5728U.K\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u96f6\u552e\u94f6\u884c\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n  Tink\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5305\u62ecPayPal Holdings ABN AMO BANK NV\u548cBNP Paribas\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u5355\u4f4d\u3002\n  \u4eca\u5e74\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u7b7e\u8bc1\u653e\u5f03\u4e8653\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8Pladion Inc.\u6311\u6218\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u3002 \n\u8be5\u90e8\u95e8\u8d77\u8bc9\u4e8e11\u6708\u963b\u6b62\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u6536\u8d2d\u4e8b\u9879\u5c06\u5141\u8bb8\u7b7e\u8bc1\u5728\u7ebf\u501f\u8bb0\u5361\u5e02\u573a\u975e\u6cd5\u7ef4\u62a4\u5784\u65ad\u3002 \u653f\u5e9c\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u653f\u5e9c\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u7b7e\u8bc1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6001\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5a01\u80c1\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u6da8\uff0c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u501f\u8bb0\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8fdb\u5165\u969c\u788d\u3002 ", "note_en": "Visa    V  -0.53%  agreed to pay more than $2 billion for Tink, a Swedish startup whose digital services connect more than 3,400 banks and financial institutions in Europe.\n  The largest U.S. card network is buying the financial-technology company to establish itself in Europe\u2019s fast-growing open banking market.
