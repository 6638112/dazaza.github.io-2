And what makes Vitalik Buterin think this is a &#34;Bitcoin only&#34; issue?\n Instead, some have already labeled it as the  Lehman Brothers of crypto, with the potential to send crypto to a glacial age, that might prevent its further adoption for a decade (in the best case scenario) or just make the whole crypto universe collapse on itself forever (what Nassim Nicholas Taleb has warned many times as the &#34; absorbing barrier&#34; or a point of no return!).\n In Lehman Brothers&#39; case, the paradox of centralization is that it eventually prevented a systemic collapse. Indeed, central players like the Fed and the government  bailed out the system (with the bailout of AIG first, and then with the Troubled Asset Relief Program which pumped back $700 billion in liquidity into the system).\n In the crypto space, without a last-resort authority in charge of preventing systemic risks, as everything is going awry, can this just mark the end of it all?\n I believe it&#39;s critical to answer these questions, to make sure we continue to see the blockchain and crypto ecosystem grow and really become the Web 3.0 we all dream of. And yet, to make this happen we need to make clarity on the short-term existential threats existing right now.\n And beyond all the scammy projects, buzz, and cultism going on in crypto, Tether is the most dangerous one, because it&#39;s sold as the &#34;real thing&#34; potentially masqueraded as the greatest Ponzi Schemes of all times.\n   As Bitcoin had gained traction over the 2010s, the idea of enabling other tokens to be built on top of Bitcoin&#39;s protocol took off (indeed, this was also the original idea of Ethereum in 2014).\n This gave rise to the Mastercoin project. The vision was to solve two of the most important barriers to Bitcoin mass adoption: Insecurity and instability (as highlighted in this  Coindesk piece).\n Mastercoin, therefore, has been  credited by some as &#39;inventing the ICO&#39; space.  Mastercoin would be rebranded as Omni by 2015.\n The rebranded Omni Protocol would serve as the foundation for Tether, which got built on top of this protocol (Tether was also an ERC20 token - built on top of Ethereum&#39;s blockchain protocol). At the same time, Tether initially was called &#34;Realcoin&#34; and only later on (by 2014) renamed Tether.\n As explained on its  website, nowadays  &#34;Tether tokens exist\u00a0as digital tokens built on bitcoin (Omni and Liquid Protocol), Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, SLP and OMG\u00a0blockchains.&#34;\n And as further explained  &#34;Tether Platform currencies are 100% backed by Tether\u2019s reserves. Tether tokens are redeemable and exchangeable pursuant to Tether Limited\u2019s terms of service. The conversion rate is 1 Tether USD\u20ae token (USD\u20ae) equals 1 USD.&#34;\n Tether had since the start a clear mission, that of facilitating the exchanges across digital currencies, by providing what&#39;s called a stablecoin. A stablecoin itself is a digital currency pegged to an underlying asset. In Tether&#39;s case that is the US dollar.\n Thus, by pegging the Tether to the dollar, whoever is converting its cryptocurrencies back to a stablecoin has the advantage of being able to trade back across various digital assets. They would be able to do so without having to incur wild price swings, which are intrinsic to the crypto world.\n  As liquidity providers, those are as good as those exchanges accept them as liquidity reserves.\n There are dozens of stablecoins and yet the top three (Tether, USD Coin and Binance USD)  almost reach a hundred billion market cap as of the time of this writing.\n And the most interesting part is that those stablecoins for better or for worse have become so popular that at this point there isn&#39;t really a conversion between Bitcoin and USD, rather the convention between Bitcoin to USDT (short for Tether) has become widely adopted.\n This implication is critical because it means that Bitcoin liquidity does not exist in fiat currency (to say you can&#39;t really convert all the existing Bitcoins back to dollars - at least not those that are going through central exchanges). This again poses a serious systemic risk, as in the short-term, if a good chunk of USDT would be exchanged back for dollars, it might be easy to imagine a massive liquidity drought.\n In fact, while some might say, &#34;you know Tether is only over $60 billion in market cap when Bitcoin is over $600 billion&#34; (at the time of this writing). But this reasoning doesn&#39;t make any sense. Because if a crisis of liquidity happens this would drag down the price of Bitcoin (and all the other cryptocurrencies) to the point that we don&#39;t know what would happen next.\n  What prompted in the first place this massive adoption of stablecoins, and  in primis of Tether?\n I mean why do people use stablecoins when they can simply trade back in dollars? There are various reasons for this phenomenon. However, incentives from central exchange platforms have widely pushed the adoption of stablecoins.\n One of the features that made stablecoins a good thing to have is the reduced intermediation fees to trade them.\n A second, killing feature that made stablecoins the go-to digital currency for investors is the fact that some central exchanges only accept them in the first place. As highlighted in the paper &#34; What Keeps Stablecoins Stable?&#34; Crypto exchanges like Binance and Poloniex, already in 2019, only accepted stablecoins as a medium of exchange.\n This means that &#34;liquidity&#34; across these exchanges is mediated by stablecoins (this implication is critical because it makes us redefine what liquidity means on those exchanges, and how this can be pumped up easily).\n This brings us back to a central issue for Tether. As the core assumption is that in case of a mass liquidation Tether would still be able to redeem it and yet maintain the peg with the dollar. Here the problem instead is that not only this peg would not be maintained.\n But worse of all, in case of a flight to liquidity it might create a massive negative domino effect on the whole crypto ecosystem.\n   Running a Central Exchange has been - paradoxically - one of the first viable business models on top of Bitcoin. That&#39;s a paradox because as the say goes &#34;Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins&#34; would imply that you don&#39;t need anyone holding the key for you.\n And yet &#34;we hold your key&#34; has been the main business model for successful exchanges like Coinbase. And many hard-earned lessons have been learned by the crypto community in the last decade as various central exchanges went bust (the epitome of that has been Mt. Gox bankruptcy back in 2014).\n So why did this central exchange business model work? Well, because it enabled a wider and wider number of people to join in. They could join without having to worry about wallets, storage, and more intricacies that make the crypto world still very hard to understand.\n You jump on a platform like Coinbase, with a great UX, a gamified section (the Earn platform enables you to start earning cryptocurrencies by answering a few simple questions) and you have the feeling to be already an expert.\n With the motto of &#34;you don&#39;t have to worry about your key&#34; central exchanges exponentially grew the user base, and with the increasing price of most cryptocurrencies, running a central exchange has become highly profitable.\n Perhaps,  in Q1 2021, a platform like Coinbase recorded an almost 10x increase in revenues from over $179 million to $1.59 billion.\n And the thing is, the whole central exchange business model is based on trading volume, as they make money mostly via fees.\n Central exchanges, therefore, have worked wonders in the crypto markets by easily expanding the user base.\n    A 2018 article, entitled &#34; Why Stablecoins Make No Sense&#34; called Tether a &#34;naive\u00a0stablecoin&#34; as it was not introduced as an independent currency. Instead, that is a sort of banknote or an &#34;I owe you&#34; or a promise of payment, that tells you that in case you want to exchange your USDT (Tether) back to dollars this will be easily backed.\n There is a problem here though, as what makes a banknote valuable is how much you can trust the bearer. And in the case of Tether, the bearer is a private company called Bitfinex.\n That is also why 2021 has become a key year in which Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) were needed. And among the most successful ones, Uniswap solved for liquidity - as  Decrypto highlighted -  &#34;by allowing the exchange to swap tokens without relying on buyers and sellers creating that liquidity.&#34; At this time also DEXs have some core issues (like so-called &#34; rug pulls&#34; one of the hardest problems to solve for a decentralized platform that isn&#39;t managed by any central player).\n In short, Central Exchanges solved for short-term liquidity (which is one of the greatest plagues of crypto) through stablecoins but - especially in the case of Tether - they create a plethora of other issues. The most fundamental one is that they only &#34;centralize the system&#34; by requiring investors to having to trust the bearer, thus killing the whole premise of a blockchain-based system.\n And things only get worse when the bearer is a private company, which lacks transparency.\n   Bitfinex is another central exchange that has become extremely popular (thanks to Tether) making it among the  top five central exchanges.\n This is owned and operated by\u00a0iFinex Inc., a company based in Hong Kong. While Tether is primarily issued by a company called  Tether Limited, owned by the same owners of Bitfinex.\n  Let&#39;s see some of the red flags that made this bearer very hard to trust.\n *Assuming that a &#34;blockchain economy&#34; can exist in the first place on these stablecoins backed by private companies with no regulation whatsoever. So the paradox here is that if we want a system driven by central exchanges and stablecoins regulation is a must!\n  Already in 2018 Bitfinex was alleged of hiding  $850 million in funds, masked as Tether reserves.\n  Bitfinex and Tether recklessly and unlawfully covered-up massive financial losses to keep their scheme going and protect their bottom lines,\u201d\n  Tether\u2019s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie. These companies obscured the true risk investors faced and were operated by unlicensed and unregulated individuals and entities dealing in the darkest corners of the financial system. This resolution makes clear that those trading virtual currencies in New York state who think they can avoid our laws cannot and will not. Last week, we sued to shut down Coinseed for its fraudulent conduct. This week, we\u2019re taking action to end Bitfinex and Tether\u2019s illegal activities in New York. These legal actions send a clear message that we will stand up to corporate greed whether it comes out of a traditional bank, a virtual currency trading platform, or any other type of financial institution.\n  Today\u2019s agreement requires Bitfinex and Tether to discontinue any trading activity with New Yorkers. In addition, these companies must submit regular reports to the OAG to ensure compliance with this prohibition.\n This case posed already some serious concerns about Tether as a stablecoin, and we were in a time where this whole thing could have been prevented, as the scale was still limited to less than a billion-dollar volume.\n An  article from NY Times, back in 2018, also claimed that back in 2017 the Bitcoin price was manipulated by Tether.\n Again, even only the suspect that this might be true is a serious concern for all the crypto space.\n  For the first time, in March 2021, Tether, which now became a mammoth, released for the first time:\n   While Tether claimed a cash reserve of 3.87%, it also claimed a giant commercial paper reserve which propelled it as a global giant, as the  Financial Times noticed.\n Therefore, the most worrying part of this report was the commercial paper backing, representing by large the most important backing for Tether.\n As  Coindesk has noted, commercial paper is  &#34;a form of corporate debt that can be easily converted to cash \u2013\u00a0   or not, depending on\u00a0   the issuer\u00a0and\u00a0   market conditions.&#34;\n As Coindesk further noted,  &#34;Tether declined to identify the borrowers of the loans or the collateral backing them.&#34;\n Thus, as far as we know, there are even more doubts and questions to be answered to this breakdown.\n  In a thread between  Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Paul Santos over Twitter, Paul Santos highlighted two very important points:\n 1. Price action of BTC is dictated by Tether trading pair: BTC/USDT, not BTC/USD. Look at the volume charts. Tether is BTC, even if you never trade for Tether.  2. Exchanges are fiat illiquid. They all shut down at the same time when their is a market crash to stop USD outflows.\n  If this turns out to be true, it means that, just like central banks, Tether is printing currency to pump short-term liquidity in the system (and help speculation), but behind it has a private company, of which we know little to nothing, if not the breakdown they recently provided!\n Imagine if the whole financial system was based on a person that told you &#34;I promise I can pay you back&#34; but showed you a wallet with plenty of toilet paper?\n  Central exchanges have become the primary enabler of the crypto-economy by expanding the user base of investors, with the motto of &#34;you don&#39;t have to worry about your key.&#34; As cryptocurrencies are still considered very risky by most banks, none or a few conventional banks want to do business with these exchanges. This led to a magic trick to solve the short-term liquidity issue these central exchanges face: stablecoins.\n In essence, stablecoins are the crypto version of banknotes where the trust is in the bearer to keep a stable peg between the digital currency and an underlying asset like let&#39;s say the dollar. And the popularity of these stablecoins depends on the willingness of the central exchange to accept them.\n Stablecoins turned out to be extremely successful in 2021 because they enabled investors to prevent higher intermediary fees. It gave them the ability to easily convert them into other digital currencies at any time. It also created a massive systemic risk. In short, a good chunk of the Bitcoin liquidity perhaps is tied to the Bitcoin/Tether peg. In short, if you want to convert a Bitcoin back to USD, you have to go through USDT (Tether) first. And if Tether is not backed by real USD there is no liquidity at all.\n Worse of all, if a flight to liquidity might happen this might make the whole crypto space insolvent. And without central authority potentially saving the system what will happen?\n  In case of a collapse of Tether what measures exist to prevent the whole system from collapsing?\n Answering these questions now makes the difference from having a crypto ecosystem destroyed or at least its long-term ability to drive change intact.\n Disclaimer:\u00a0 The opinions in this article belong to the author alone.

trailer from Warner Bros. for director James Gunn&#39;s forthcoming\u00a0  The Suicide Squad,\u00a0in which Courtney reprises his role as Captain Boomerang from 2016&#39;s   Suicide Squad. It&#39;s got quite bit of new footage and some small additional details (such as why Idris Elba&#39;s Bloodsport is in prison in the first place). Each of the three trailers released so far has been better than the last, so we have high hopes for this film.\n As  I&#39;ve written previously,\u00a0 The Suicide Squad is not a direct sequel to the 2016 film; Gunn has said he wanted to take the franchise in a new direction and introduce new characters. He drew inspiration from writer\u00a0 John Ostrander&#39;s original 1980s  Suicide Squad comics. (Ostrander has a small role in the final film.) Gunn  has described his R-rated film as a superhero version of the classic 1967 film\u00a0  The Dirty Dozen, selecting characters he described as &#34;loser, B-grade supervillains.&#34;\n  Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis reprise their 2016 roles as Col. Rick Flag and Intelligence Officer Amanda Waller, respectively, with Steve Agee playing John Economos, prison warden and aide to Waller. The squad this time around includes Elba&#39;s Bloodsport, Peacemaker (John Cena), Courtney&#39;s Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), King Shark (voiced by Rooker&#39;s   Cliffhanger co-star Sylvester Stallone), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Javelin (Flula Borg), and everyone&#39;s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).\n Other cast members include Polka-Dot Man (David Dastmalchian), whose trademark polka-dotted suit is actually a collection of gadgets; Weasel (Sean Gunn, James&#39; kid brother), an anthropomorphic weasel; Sol Soria (Alice Braga); TDK (Nathan Fillion); Mongal (Mayling Ng);\u00a0Flo Crawley (Tinashe Kajese); and Thinker (Peter Capaldi). Storm Reid plays\u00a0Bloodsport&#39;s daughter Tyla.\n Each of the prior trailers (released within a week of each other) had a very distinctive tone\u2014a deliberate choice by Gunn.\u00a0The  first was a red-band trailer (pretty tame as these things go) that played up the humor. It opened with a plan for Flag and his team to rescue Harley Quinn, who thwarted it by rescuing herself. Then there was some standard exposition to set up the basic story: namely, that the Suicide Squad members get the same deal as before: 10 years off their sentence if they successfully complete their mission, with a nanite injection that will explode should they disobey orders in any way.\n    The  second trailer, released on April Fool&#39;s Day, dispensed with the jokey tone and\u00a0running gags of King Shark&#39;s gruesome eating habits (&#34;num-num&#34;) in favor of a darker, more ominous tenor.\u00a0We got to see Polka-Dot Man in action, and TDK revealed a surprising ability to separate his arms from his body.\u00a0Bonus: we got a good look at the writing on the back of Harley Quinn&#39;s jacket: &#34;Live Fast Die Clown.&#34;\n This latest trailer falls somewhere between jokey and dark. It focuses more on Bloodsport, opening with him scrubbing floors in prison as Waller tries to recruit him for the squad. Waller uses Bloodsport&#39;s daughter&#39;s upcoming court case as leverage. &#34;I wouldn&#39;t take such extreme measures if this mission weren&#39;t more important that you could possibly imagine,&#34; Waller assures him. We also learn that Bloodsport is in prison because he put Superman in the ICU with the help of a kryptonite bullet, so he&#39;s got legit badass bona fides.\n In terms of new footage, we get an inter-squad debate over what kind of dog Weasel might be\u2014TDK guesses Afghan hound, Harley is hoping for werewolf\u2014with Flag assuring them Weasel is harmless. (&#34;I mean, he&#39;s not harmless, he&#39;s killed 27 children, but you know...&#34;) We also learn that our heroes&#39; mission is to destroy all evidence of the mysterious &#34;Project Starfish,&#34; which probably explains the colorful giant starfish-like  kaiju they end up battling.\n The Suicide Squad hits theaters and debuts on HBO Max on August 6, 2021. If you&#39;re fully vaccinated, I think this is one to see on the big screen, if you safely can. And expect to see more from this refreshed franchise in the future.

We started to build a casual relationship then. Fast forward to 2016. At my first fund, Cross Culture [Ventures], we were interested in investing in early childhood care. We were actually looking at a number of different companies and one of my partners, Suzy [Ryoo] was like, \u2018Have you heard of this company Wonderschool that Chris Bennett was starting, and I was like, \u2018Holy shit, I know Chris.\u2019 \u201d\n According to Bennet, Nichols reached out about the opportunity on Facebook Messenger. After the initial conversation and assessing some direct competitors, Nichols says Wonderschool was ultimately the right fit for Cross Culture\u2019s portfolio.\n  \u201cI used to go the TED conference every year,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cI met a woman who told me that early childhood education was really important [ \u2026 ] She said, \u2018A lot of the skills I use today as a CEO, a lot of those seeds were planted before the age of five.\u2019 I thought that was a really wild idea. I started doing research and realized there was a shortage of childcare in America.\u201d\n Bennett cringed slightly when we started the process of showing off the company\u2019s early deck. The first thing that jumped out at all of us was just how bare bones the presentation is: white text on a blue background, largely made up of bullet points.

months and it is still not finished!\n Our marketing created the campaign page themselves, because it takes IT forever to setup anything!\n Sounds familiar? I have been on both ends of these conversations, but mostly on the \u201cbeing yelled at\u201d end. For a long time, I was puzzled. Why was this happening?\n  You have a reasonable development team. Certainly expensive enough for your CFO to give you hard time. Despite that, things are still moving at snail&#39;s pace, at least according to your business users. Stuff is coming out of your pipeline, sure, but many good ideas, which could even be quickly developed, are killed, because no-one wants to wait until next quarter to test a simple business hypothesis.\n Many organizations adapt agile development methodologies with high hopes of solving this very issue. Often that fails miserably. What those Scrum certified consultants fail to mention is that Scrum optimizes for short term predictability, rather than throughput. Maybe Scrum has too many meetings for you, so you pick Kanban. Or rather what you think is Kanban, though it probably is not Kanban, but a single pile of tasks and a Jira board with few columns to go along with it. Result is more or less the same in both cases.\n Few companies even choose to go back to waterfall project management, because that at least gives them the illusion of long term predictability. It can definitely promise more than agile can deliver.\n  Too late in my career have I discovered  Kingman&#39;s formula. The formula originally appeared in an ancient math paper by J. F. C. Kingman in 1960 named \u201c The single server queue in heavy traffic&#34;. (Mind you, the server mentioned here is an actual person serving someone)\n   where  \u03c4 is the mean service time (i.e.  \\( \u03bc=\\frac{{1}}{{\u03c4}} \\) is the service rate),  \u03bb is the mean arrival rate,  \\( \u03c1=\\frac{{\u03bb}}{{\u03bc}} \\) is the utilization,  c a is the coefficient of variation for arrivals (that is the standard deviation of arrival times divided by the mean arrival time) and  c s is the coefficient of variation for service times.\n Understood? No? OK. I did not get it either at first, so let me explain. This formula, from the field of queueing theory, puts into relation the queue length (or in other words, how long does it actually take in real world days to develop anything here) with the following variables:\n variability in task size (are the tasks similar in size or some are small and some really big?)\n  utilization (what is the ratio between the entity performing the task is idle versus busy)\n You don&#39;t need to understand it completely in order to learn from it. The important takeaways are, that all three of the above increase the queue length. But they do so in a peculiar way with regards to the utilization. Under about 85% utilization, the variability does play a role, but not that big. Even with high variability, the work flows smoothly. But above 85% utilization the graph of queue length seems to explode exponentially. It becomes extremely sensitive to the two variabilities and above 95% the queue length starts quickly approaching infinity. Or it definitely feels that way to your users. Just ask them.\n Because the effect of high utilization is so large, much bigger than the influence of the two variabilities, the formula can be simplified and approximated as\n  If you plot it in a graph, it looks something like this. The graph is borrowed from The DevOps Handbook. Just notice how the wait time really takes off after hitting 85% utilization.\n    The variability of arrival rate is difficult to influence, as the tasks often originate outside of your control. There are still things you can do. To the outside world, IT looks like a opaque box, where you insert the tasks on one end and (sometimes) features come out the other end. The actual process however often involves multiple teams where the work is handed over and mini-queues also exist. Try to avoid batching of tasks in these internal handovers for more smooth workflow. And try to reduce the number of handovers by integrating more roles into a single team or eliminate the stages ruthlessly. Do you really need all those approval columns?\n Also, try to avoid big management planning sessions, where the board locks itself in a mountain resort for the weekend and creates a list of high priority projects for the following quarter. That does not help.\n  Task size is something we can influence more directly. If you take one thing from agile, it&#39;s the concept of User stories. If done right, a single user story should provide some value to some users and be ready to deploy within the two-week sprint. That means it should be small enough and uniform enough to help reduce the variability.\n Slicing user stories is an art in itself and would probably do for a separate article, but I will leave you with just one idea, that should help:  Try to solve a problem completely for a single class of users, however small that class is, rather than partially solve a problem for everyone.\n  The most important, but actually probably the simplest to influence, is the utilization of the team.  Just plan less work and give your team some slack. But simple does not mean easy. It&#39;s very counterintuitive. \u201cWhat do you mean, plan less work? How is that going to speed things up?\u201d Well, because science says so!\n But if science and beautiful math formulas fail to convince, you can reach for an example everyone should be able to understand. The analogy is not perfect, but works pretty well. I am talking of course about  traffic jams on the highway. I assume you have been in few. Have you noticed, how when the number of cars on the highway starts to increase, the speed you are driving goes down a bit? And then, it reaches some kind of seemingly illogical point, where suddenly everything comes to a screeching halt, even when there is no apparent reason like an accident or closure?\n Remember how the traffic experts keep telling you: \u201cIf there is a lot of traffic, slow down and avoid switching lanes to avoid causing a traffic jam?\u201d Well, that&#39;s because with a lot of traffic, the road has a  high utilization (ie. less space between cars). By switching lanes you are increasing the  variability of arrival (each segment of each lane works actually as a separate queue). By going fast, you are unable to keep driving a same constant speed like everyone else and thus increase the  variability of the duration of the task. You are constantly speeding up and slowing down. The task in this case means \u201cmoving one meter forward\u201d. Under high utilization, even slight increase in either of the two variabilities or the utilization itself has a huge effect on the queue size. The result: traffic jam.\n   You have to slow down to go faster. It&#39;s as simple as that. Aim for below 85% utilization. Same as we do not run our servers at 100% utilization, we should not run our teams at 100% utilization. If you do, expect your queues to approach \u221e.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:03:03", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5371\u9669,kingman,\u4efb\u52a1", "title": "\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f60\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u5371\u9669 ", "title_en": "Ignore the Kingman at your own peril", "transed": 1, "url": "https://taborsky.cz/posts/2021/kingman-formula/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5371\u9669", "kingman", "\u4efb\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f9e875478a46c0c63032e3ad14e54496.png", "infoid": 1067569, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters", "note_en": "This is an open access journal, and articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 License, which allows others to remix, tweak, and build upon the work non-commercially, as long as appropriate credit is given and the new creations are licensed under the identical terms.\n  Saffron,  Crocus sativus (Iridaceae), is a perennial herb, which earned its popularity as both medicine and spice. It is an inhabitant of different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, and India. The benefits of saffron as an antidepressant are well-documented. Almost 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds are obtained from the chemical analysis of this plant. Fewer than 50 constituents elucidated and identified so far showed phytochemical characteristics. The major bioactive compounds identified are safranal, crocin, and picrocrocin, which are responsible for its aroma as well as its bitter taste. This review is an attempt to encompass the methods of analysis and pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of saffron followed by its efficacious and safe potential.\n Crocus sativus L. belonging to Iridaceae family, commonly known as saffron, is a perennial herb widely cultivated in Iran and other countries, such as India and Greece. Commercial saffron is a spice comprises of dried red stigma with a small portion of the yellowish style attached to the flower of  Crocus sativus L., in Chinese its known as Fan-Hong-Hua. From decades saffron was used in traditional Chinese medicines for its expectorant, aphrodisiac, and antispasmodic effects.[ ] Saffron can be planted from an altitude of sea level to almost 2000 m, but it is more preferably adapted to hill sides and mountain valleys, ranging in altitudes between 600 and 1700 m.[ 2] Also, this plant can be cultivated in a dry and infertile place where there is an extreme water shortage in summer. The origin of the word saffron is the French term \u201cSafran,\u201d which was derived from the Latin word \u201csafranum\u201d and yellowish in color, phytochemical analysis have revealed that the color is mainly because of the degraded carotenoid compounds, crocin and crocetin.[ ] This is one of the valuable herb in the world because it requires properly plucked stigma from the flowers. Variation and high quality of final products are due to the harvest process involved.[ ]\n Saffron has been famous as both medicine and spice in some cultures. The stigma of saffron has been used as a medicine over 3600 years ago.[ ] Saffron was used in various opioid preparations for pain relief (sixteenth to nineteenth centuries).[ ] Also, saffron has been used in coloring tunics in the region of Spain and by the Babylonian culture around 2400 BC.[ 7] This expensive spice can be found in different mountainous regions of Asia Minor to Greece, Western Asia, Egypt, or Kashmir.[ 7] Each of the flowers has three red-colored stigma, and one stigma of saffron weighs approximately 2 mg. Approximately 1 kg of this valuable spice is made from 150,000 flowers that must be carefully picked.[ ]\n One of the most established findings regarding the benefits of saffron is its antidepressant activity. There are clinical trials conducted, evaluating the efficacy of saffron in mild-to-moderate depression. The studies reported that saffron was more effective than placebo and at least equivalent to the therapeutic doses of imipramine and fluoxetine. One of the top five most predominant diseases worldwide is depression.[ ] Depression can affect the quality of life of someone because of the facts that it can cause a headache, difficulty in thinking, and loss of interest.\n Recently, approximately 150 volatile and nonvolatile compounds have been detected from the chemical analysis of  C. sativus L. However, fewer than 50 constituents have been identified so far as the phytochemicals of  C. sativus L. The major constituents of saffron are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 9] The phytochemical agents in saffron are responsible for many pharmacological actions in the body. The phytochemical research has found that the color of saffron is mainly because of the degraded compound of carotenoids, which are crocin and crocetin.[ ] Many clinical studies focused more on the antidepressant effects of saffron.\n Saffron has intensive fragrant with slightly bitter taste and produces a bright yellow-orange solution when soaked in warm water.[ 10] Its stigma was shown to contain carbohydrates, minerals, mucilage, vitamins B1 and B2, and pigments. Crocin, crocetin, carotene, lycopene, and gigantic[ ] anthocyanin, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin are the oil-soluble pigments that can be found in the stigma.[ 12] The color of saffron is the result of degradation of carotenoid compounds named crocin. According to Wallis,[ 13] crocin constituent of saffron, which highly related to its intense color, is the natural water-soluble carotenoid. Crocetin in  C. sativus L. is a water-insoluble conjugated polyene with two carboxylic acid residues.[ 14] Crocetin esters or also known as crocin, which is hydrophilic and water soluble, are usually found in the saffron extract in which \u03b1-crocin, the glycosyl ester of crocetin, is the main contributor for the significant bright yellow-orange color of saffron.[ 15] Saffron has a unique flavor that is related mainly to the glycoside picrocrocin.[ 16] Picrocrocin is responsible for the unique flavor of  C. sativus L., which is found to be stable in fresh raw saffron and broken down when heated to release.[ ] Specific essential oils of the flower contribute to the sweet fragrance of saffron. The principal constituent of total essential oil of  C. sativus L., safranal is a carboxaldehyde volatile compound formed by deglucosylation of picrocrocin.[ 16] Saffron is widely used in food processing industry as colorant and flavoring agents. The essential oils also comprised several terpene aldehydes, ketones, and terpene derivatives (pinene and cineol).[ 10] The secondary metabolites present in the petals of  C. sativus L. are tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids, which include rutin, quercetin, luteolin, hesperidin, and bioflavonoids. Those compounds have been reported to have many pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory,[ ] antinociceptive,[ ] and blood pressure lowering effects.[ ]\n All  trans and  cis isomers of crocin reflect the characteristics of carotenoids by having ultraviolet (UV)-Vis spectra highlighting double peaks between 400 and 500 nm in the visible region.[ 21] Safranal is responsible for aroma, whereas its precursor picrocrocin, which is a monoterpene glycoside, is accountable for the bitter taste of saffron.[ 21] The pattern of UV absorption of picrocrocin can be seen with a broad band at 250 nm with the maximum absorption of 254 nm, reflecting the presence of an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated cycloaldehyde functional group in its molecular structure.[ 22] Picrocrocin underwent enzymatic or chemical hydrolysis to produce glucose and aglycone and then yielded safranal via dehydration during drying process.[ 22] Active components that indicate the quality and pharmacological studies of saffron are the enzymatic oxidative metabolites of glucoside derivative of zeaxanthin, which include  cis- and  trans-crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal.[ 23] The main phytochemicals that may contribute to the biological activities of  C. sativus L. are crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal.\n Crocin and saffron extract had been revealed to prevent memory and spatial learning impairment because of chronic-induced stress.[ ] Prophylactic property of saffron against memory deficiency had been proposed to occur as the result of the correlation between the antioxidant activity of saffron and the impairment because of oxidative stress.[ 21] Akhondzadeh  et al.,[ ] in 2004, had shown saffron extract to be equally efficient to imipramine during double-blind and randomized trial conducted over 6 weeks. The dried saffron petal also had been revealed to be effective in mild-to-moderate depression based on 6 weeks of double-blind randomized clinical trials.[ ] Crocin (30 mg/day), the main antioxidant constituent of saffron stigmas, was shown to amplify the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in treating patients with mild-to-moderate depression with the absence of substantial side effects based on the observation of 4 weeks of randomized, double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial with 40 patients of major depressive disorder.[ ] Scientifically proven traditional uses of saffron as antidepressant suggested that crocin exerts its antidepressant effect by increasing cAMP response element binding protein, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor inducible levels in rat hippocampus.[ ] Subacute administration of crocin was indicated to cause antidepressant effects in the rat. When saffron capsules administered to patients with a prior history of percutaneous coronary intervention who had depression, it was found to be equally effective as fluoxetine.[ ] In one of the 6-week pilot double-blind, randomized trial, the petal of the  C. sativus L. was found to be equally valid with the stigma in the treatment of depressed outpatients.[ 30] The petal constituent of  C. sativus L., kaempferol, was revealed to have antidepressant effect when evaluated using forced swimming test in mice and rats.[ 31] It has been perceived that current findings of biological activities of  C. sativus L., particularly its main constituent crocin, supported its medicinal used in traditional practices.\n According to Murray and Lopez,[ ] depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent psychiatric diseases and has been estimated to affect up to 21% of the world\u2019s population. Majority of patients are often reluctant to take synthetic antidepressant drugs in their appropriate doses because of the anticipated side effects such as the inability to drive a car, dry mouth, constipation, and libido.[ ] Hence, plant extracts are some of the most attractive sources of new drugs and have been shown to produce a better result with low side effects in the treatment of depression.[ ]\n C. sativus L. or commonly known as saffron is an expensive traditional spice. Its active components have shown several useful pharmacological effects such as anticonvulsant, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, radical scavenger effects, and learning and memory-improving effects.[ ] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ 30] stated that saffron had been widely used to relieve stomachaches, ease the pain of kidney stones, and treat depression in Persian traditional medicine.\n According to Srivastava  et al.,[ ] two active ingredients of  C. sativus L., which are crocin and safranal, have shown antidepressant effects. This is in accordance to the study carried out by Hosseinzadeh  et al.,[ 35] regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of  C. sativus L. stigma and their constituents, safranal and crocin, for the antidepressant activity by using forced swimming test in mice. The result obtained shows that the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of stigma (0.2\u20130.8 g/kg), safranal (0.15\u20130.5 mL/kg), and crocin (50\u2013600 mg/kg) could reduce the immobility time of the mice and the swimming time increased greatly. It is suggested that the inhabitation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin reuptake by crocin and safranal might be the possible mechanism of antidepressive effect of saffron.[ 30] Akhondzadeh  et al.[ ] also conducted a randomized trial to compare the efficacy of saffron with imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In another study, patients were assigned to receive capsule saffron (30 mg/day) three times a day (tds) or capsule imipramine (100 mg/day tds) for a 6-week research.[ ] The result showed that saffron at this dose was found to be effective comparable to imipramine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression.\n Because the stigma of  C. sativus L. (saffron) is very expensive, the researchers use the leaves of this plant as it is cheaper and possesses antidepressant effect. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized trial performed by Srivastava  et al.,[ ] 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of the petal of  C. sativus L. at dose of (30 mg/day) twice daily (bd) and capsule of placebo twice daily (bd) for a 6-week study. At 6 weeks, the petal of  C. sativus L. produced a significantly better outcome on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale than placebo. Hence, it is proven that the petal of  C. sativus L. does give antidepressant effect. Karimi  et al.[ 36] also conducted a study regarding the effects of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stigma and petal of  C. sativus L. for the antidepressant activity according to the forced swimming test in mice. It was shown that both stigma and petal reduced immobility time of the mice. In a double-blind and randomized trial performed by Akhondzadeh Basti  et al.,[ ] patients were randomly assigned to receive a capsule of petal of  C. sativus L. (15 mg bid) (Group 1) and fluoxetine (10 mg bid) (Group 2) for an 8-week study. At the end of the trial, the petal of  C. sativus L. was found to be effective as similar to fluoxetine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate depression. In study by Melnyk  et al. (2010), kaempferol (the active constituent in saffron petals) at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg in mice and 50 mg/kg in rat reduces depressive symptoms similar to fluoxetine.[ 37] Wang  et al.[ ] also conducted research regarding the antidepressant properties of stigmas and corms of  C. sativus L. The corms of  C. sativus L. were fractionated based on polarity and yielded petroleum ether fraction and dichloromethane fraction. At doses of 150, 300, and 600 mg/kg, it showed significant antidepressant-like activities as the immobility time in the forced swimming test and tail suspending test was significantly reduced by these two fractions.\n Hausenblas  et al.[ ] stated that, similar to antidepressants, saffron may exert its antidepressant effect by modulating the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, including serotonin (a mood-elevating neurotransmitter). Although it has been proposed that saffron increases serotonin levels in the brain, the exact mechanism of action for this is unknown. More specifically, a saffron extract might inhibit serotonin reuptake in synapses. Inhibiting synaptic serotonin reuptake keeps serotonin in the brain longer, thereby enhancing its positive effects while combating depression.\n Several analytical methods have been developed for the systematic separation and quantification of saffron ( C. sativus L.) metabolites.[ ] Several methodologies have been reported using different analytical tools to analyze the bioactive constituents of saffron, that is, picrocrocin, safranal, and crocin.[ , 40, 41, 42, 43] UV-vis spectrometry method is recommended by the International Standardization Organization to characterize the quality of saffron. The technique has been used for quality and stability studies of saffron, whereby the process is considered to be appropriate for recognizing the taste, color, and flavor of the spice (ISO/TS 3632, 2003). However, this method is not suitable for the identification and quantification of each component of saffron extract. This is because the technique is not specific and cannot adequately separate. Hence, because of mentioned reasons, the advanced stationary phases of analytical and preparative methods have been developed such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gel column chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, multilayer coil counter current chromatography with silica gel, aluminum oxide, and Sephadex LH-20.[ 41, 42, 44, ]\n Tarantilis  et al.[ ] and Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] in their studies reported other analytical methods such as reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) coupled together with mass spectrometry and photodiode array detector, and for the detection of volatile compounds, gas chromatography with mass spectrometer (MS).\n Most of the studies conducted have been focused on the analytical determination of the structure of crocin. However, the methods to isolate high-purity crocin have not been established.[ , 46] To obtain adequately pure crocin, the compound is first separated by chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 and then by preparative HPLC.[ 42] Through this method, crocin can only maximally be separated to seven fractions. The method also implies repeated procedures, which are time-consuming, before purified crocin can be isolated. A simple two-step method in which 20 fractions of crocin are separated simultaneously in the first step, and then high-purity pigment is obtained in a subsequent step has been reported by Zhang  et al.[ 46] The purity of the crocin compound was reported to be above 95%, whereby the methods used two-step, low-pressure liquid chromatography without preparative HPLC. Tarantilis and Polissiou[ 43] reported that isolation method namely micro-simultaneous steam distillation-solvent extraction and vacuum head space were more suitable to isolate the aroma components of saffron as compared to standard distillation method. Another method for the separation of crocin reported was crystallization, whereby the amount of obtained crocin from the first crystallization step was 17% of the stigma powder, but its purity was approximately 85%. The purity increased to more than 97% after a second crystallization step was performed. Therefore, the total amount of crocin obtained is 10% from the initial stigma powder of saffron.[ ]\n Other than the investigation of the biological activities of crocetin and crocin, it is also important to determine the pharmacokinetic aspects of the compounds such as its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in the body. Until now, most of the studies were carried out using  in vitro and  in vivo animal model, which mainly focuses on the absorption and metabolism parameters. Also, the review of the pharmacokinetic profile of those compounds in human body remains inadequate. A study was conducted by Umigai  et al.[ ] on 10 healthy human volunteers with a single dose of crocetin orally administered at three doses (7.5, 15, and 22.5 mg) in the 1-week interval to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of plasma crocetin by using RP-HPLC. They reported that crocetin was rapidly absorbed and detected in the plasma within 1h and reached a peak of mean maximum plasma concentration, C max (100.9\u2013279.7 ng/ml) around 4\u20134.8 h. The C max value was also reported to be increasing in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, the mean elimination half-life of crocetin, T 1/2, in human plasma was also ranging from 6.1 to 7.5 h.[ ]\n In pharmacokinetic study, one of the factors affecting the bioavailability of a compound is its solubility and absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. The research carried out by Xi  et al.[ ] using HPLC observed that crocin remained undetected in the serum of tested rats, regardless of gender, following single or repeated doses of oral administration. However, its hydrolysis product, crocetin, was found in low concentration in the serum. Crocin also was excreted mainly in feces. Besides, following repeated oral doses of crocin, no accumulation of crocetin was found in the serum.[ ] This suggests that crocin is hydrolyzed in the intestine into crocetin before being absorbed into the bloodstream following oral administration. In detail, on the basis of  in vitro study, crocin was reported to get hydrolyzed into deglycosylated  trans-crocetin and subsequently, absorbed by passive transcellular diffusion to a high extent within short time interval through intestinal cells.[ ]\n However, a recent study by Zhang  et al.[ ] showed that orally administered crocin could be absorbed through gastrointestinal tract \n......",

", "note_en": "The Cilium core team are excited to announce the Cilium 1.10 release. A totalof 2042 new commits have been contributed by a growing community of 280developers. Contributions have come from a wide list of different companiesincluding Alibaba, Datadog, Google, Isovalent, SuSE, Palantir among manyothers. We heard from users who are increasingly interested in betterintegration with the broader network, whether you&#39;re running Cilium in your owndatacenter environments or in the cloud. Thus, a major focus of this releasewas ensuring a seamless integration between the Kubernetes network andenterprise on-prem infrastructure.\n Egress IP Gateway: When integrating cloud-native applications with legacycounterparts operating outside the Kubernetes cluster, IP Address Managementcan be a pain point as Pod IPs are more dynamic than traditional networkendpoints. Through a new Kubernetes CRD, static IPs can now be associatedwith traffic as the packets egress the Kubernetes cluster. This allowsexternal firewalls to see consistent IPs and filter traffic for specific podspurely using the assigned static IP address.( More details)\n Integrated BGP Support: We\u2019ve simplified the ability to advertiseKubernetes service IPs via BGP to allow workloads outside the Kubernetesenvironment to easily communicate with Cloud Native applications. With 1.10we&#39;ve incorporated BGP service announcement support directly into Ciliumso that these services can be exposed without the need for any additionalexternal components.( More details)\n Standalone Load Balancer: Cilium&#39;s high performance, robustload balancing implementation is tuned for the scale and churn ofcloud native environments. Now you can replace expensive legacy boxes inyour network with Cilium as a standalone load balancer. This unlocks thepotential of DSR and Maglev for handling north/south traffic inon-premises environments without requiring Kubernetes to manage the networkborder.( More details)\n PCAP Recorder provides network observability into theStandalone Load Balancer by enabling full or partial packet capture fortraffic matching specific n-tuple filters. ( More details)\n Beyond the focus on integrating better with the broader network, we\u2019ve investedin making it  easier to install and run Cilium regardless of environment,further  improved performance, and added a whole set of highly requestedfeatures:\n WireGuard\u00ae Support: One of the most hotly requested features, Cilium nowsupports encrypting traffic between pods in the cluster using the modernWireGuard protocol as an alternative to the existing IPsec implementation.( More details)\n New Cluster Administration CLI: An experimental new Cilium command-lineinterface simplifies installation, troubleshooting and feature enablementby automatically detecting your environment constraints and configuringCilium with the best set of options.( More details)\n Better performance than ever: Cilium now has the ability to skipNetfilter connection tracking where it is not needed, has improvedNorth/South service handling, and we&#39;ve doubled throughput performancethrough improved Linux tunneling. Check all this out together with the new tuning guide to help you get the most from your network!( More details)\n Lots of other improvements: This release brings support for  KubernetesDual-Stack Services,  Native IPAM for Alibaba Cloud,and is the first release to distribute  official images for ARM64.New guides for Rancher and Rancher Kubernetes Engine make it easierto deploy Cilium in on-prem Kubernetes environments.\n  Cilium is open source software for transparently providing and securing thenetwork and API connectivity between application services deployed using Linuxcontainer management platforms such as Kubernetes.\n At the foundation of Cilium is a new Linux kernel technology called eBPF, whichenables the dynamic insertion of powerful security, visibility, and networkingcontrol logic within Linux itself. eBPF is utilized to provide functionalitysuch as multi-cluster routing, load balancing to replace kube-proxy,transparent encryption as well as network and service security. Besidesproviding traditional network-level security, the flexibility of eBPF enablessecurity with the context of application protocols and DNS requests/responses.Cilium is tightly integrated with Envoy and provides an extension frameworkbased on Go. Because eBPF runs inside the Linux kernel, all Ciliumfunctionality can be applied without any changes to the application code orcontainer configuration.\n     As Kubernetes became the de facto standard platform to containerize andmodernize application workloads, a significant pain point became connectingthese new services to components in the legacy environments. Traditionalworkloads have a fixed and unique IP that can be recognized by a firewall.Traffic coming from a containerized application will come from many differentIPs as containers spin up and down as needed and will most often present as theIP of the node on which each container sits. This makes it hard to set upsecurity boundaries for applications and to audit their behavior.\n The 1.10 release brings the egress gateway capability to Cilium. Cilium nowallows users to specify an egress NAT policy, such that egress traffic for theselected pods will be masqueraded with a consistent, user-defined IP address.As the following diagram shows, instead of directly egressing via eth0, trafficfrom pods running in the worker node egress the cluster via the gateway node.At this node, SNAT is applied to provide the consistent external IP foroutbound traffic. From there, networking components can be configured to treattraffic differently depending on the source IP address. For instance, a legacyfirewall is able to filter traffic that originates from pods with particularlabels, by matching purely on the source IP address of the inbound traffic.\n  As an example, the following policy instructs Cilium to use egress IP 192.168.33.100 for traffic from all pods in  default namespace and destinedto the external CIDR  192.168.33.13/32. That egress traffic will be redirectedto the (gateway) node to which  192.168.33.100 was assigned. More informationabout the egress gateway can be found in the getting started guide.\n apiVersion : cilium.io/v2alpha1 kind : CiliumEgressNATPolicy metadata :  name : egress -sample spec :  egress :  -  podSelector :  matchLabels :  # The following label selects default namespace  io.kubernetes.pod.namespace : default  destinationCIDRs :  - 192.168.33.13/32  egressSourceIP :  &#34;192.168.33.100&#34;\n    As Kubernetes becomes more pervasive in on-premise environments, usersincreasingly have both traditional applications and Cloud Native applicationsin their environments. In order to connect them together and allow outsideaccess, a mechanism to integrate Kubernetes and the existing networkinfrastructure running BGP is needed.\n The 1.10 release of Cilium brings integrated support for BGP, exposingKubernetes to the outside and all the while simplifying users&#39; deployments.The integration is done via  MetalLB, leveragingthe effective implementation of the service IP allocator and the L3 protocolsupport for BGP. With this, Cilium is now able to allocate service IPs forservices of type  LoadBalancer and announce them via BGP to their BGProuters. Now, services are able to be reached externally from traffic outsideof the cluster, without any additional components.\n  In the future, we plan to support announcing Pod CIDRs and the  EgressIP Gateway via BGP as well. This will further improve thebridging between Cloud Native and traditional environments.\n The following is an example  ConfigMap that&#39;s used to configure Cilium&#39;s BGPfeature. The two main aspects of the configuration are  peers and address-pools. The former is for connecting with the existing BGP routersin the network, so an IP address and an ASN are required. The latter is thepool from which Cilium will allocate an IP to a  LoadBalancer service. For abit of background, services of type  LoadBalancer in Kubernetes rely onanother component to fill the gap of allocating external IPs, which is whyCilium needs to be configured with that information.\n apiVersion : v1 kind : ConfigMap metadata :  name : bgp -config  namespace : kube -system data :  config.yaml :  |  peers: - peer-address: 10.0.0.1 peer-asn: 64512 my-asn: 64512 address-pools: - name: default protocol: bgp addresses: - 192.0.2.0/24\n     Cilium has been progressively adding support for allocating IP addressesdirectly from cloud APIs, notably from  AWS ENI (v1.6) and  Azure (v1.8).This release adds an IPAM mode for Alibaba Cloud, allowing Cilium to utilizeAlibaba Cloud ENI (Elastic Network Interface) for Pod IPs.The architectureensures that only a single operator communicates with the Alibaba Cloud APIsto avoid rate-limiting issues in large clusters.\n  In this mode, pods are assigned with ENI IPs, which are directly routable in theAlibabaCloud VPC. This simplifies communication of pod traffic within VPCs andavoids the need for SNAT. With the cloud-native network solution, user caneasily use cloud resource like Cloud Enterprise Network (CEN) or VPN gateway toconnect to your on-premises data centers.\n      With the 1.10 release, we are adding support for transparent encryption viathe  WireGuard protocol. Transparent encryptionis a feature which ensures that traffic between Cilium-managed pods is alwayssent through a secure tunnel, thereby allowing users to run Kubernetes inuntrusted networks.\n Cilium had support for transparent encryption via IPSec already since version1.4, but we were motivated to add WireGuard as an alternative option formultiple reasons. Firstly, WireGuard is a very opinionated protocol and doesnot allow the tuning of parameters such as the key size and cipher suite,which makes it very easy to use and simplifies deployment and operations.The encryption key pair for each node is automatically generated by Cilium andkey rotation is performed transparently by the WireGuard kernel module.\n  WireGuard also has performance advantages over IPSec for certain workloads. Inour recent  CNI performance analysis blog post,we evaluated both protocols and found that WireGuard can achieve very highthroughput for streaming workloads, but IPSec still can achieve better latency,and the encryption algorithm can be offloaded to the CPU in certain cases.The graph above shows a short excerpt from our experiments, make sureto read the full blog post for more details and explanations.\n Another technical advantage of WireGuard is that it integrates well into thearchitecture of the Cilium datapath. Because the secure tunnel is exposed asa Linux network interface, WireGuard makes it very easy to mark packetsoriginating from containers for encryption and subsequently forward them tothe secure tunnel device. The animation below shows the life of a WireGuardencrypted packet in Cilium:\n  WireGuard encryption in Cilium 1.10 is supported both in direct routing andtunneling mode, and may also be enabled in managed Kubernetes environments ifthe underlying Linux kernel supports it. Support for host-level encryptionand Cilium&#39;s L7 policy enforcement and visibility features is currently lackingand will be added in an upcoming Cilium releases.\n If you want to know more about the WireGuard integration in Cilium, make sureto watch to the recording of the   eCHO episode 3 livestreamand read our   getting started guidein the Cilium documentation.\n    Cilium has IPv4/v6 dual-stack support since it was created. In fact, in Cilium&#39;s very early prototype, we started out with an IPv6-only implementation. GivenKubernetes was lacking official dual-stack integration for some time now, theCilium IPv6 support for Pods and Services was a bit cumbersome to operate.With the last Kubernetes stable version that was released this has changed now:Kubernetes 1.21 introduced  beta support for dual-stack enabled by default.With Cilium 1.10, we integrated the Kubernetes dual-stack support, so thatPods are now properly integrated to allow for dual-stack IP address allocationand, similarly, Service IPv4/v6 addressing propagates down into the CiliumeBPF kube-proxy-replacement.\n  $  helm  install cilium cilium/cilium --version  1.10.0  \\ --namespace kube-system \\ --set ipv4.enabled=true \\ --set ipv6.enabled=true  $  kubectl get cep -n kube-system NAME ENDPOINT ID IDENTITY ID ENDPOINT STATE IPV4 IPV6coredns-755cd654d4-msqgm 2205 11023 ready 10.16.115.242 fd02::71cf\n    In previous releases, the Cilium core team have made snapshots available onARM64 platform for initial testing. However, until now the official images forCilium have not yet been prepared for this platform. During this developmentcycle, we worked on several improvements to the image build infrastructure forthe project to allow automatic build of multi-arch docker images for bothlinux/amd64 and linux/arm64 platforms. Beginning with Cilium 1.10, the officialCilium repositories on Docker Hub and Quay.io will host these multi-archimages.\n Installing Cilium on ARM64 works similarly to the setup on other platforms,using the same image tags and digests as the AMD64 docker images. This unlocks theability to run Cilium on a range of new hardware including AWS Gravitoninstances and Azure Linux/ARM64 pipelines. Cilium has even been spotted in thewild, running on a smartphone!\n Armbian trunk on a Snapdragon 835 (OnePlus 5) running k8s and Cilium eBPF  @armbian  @ciliumproject  @kubernetesio \ud83c\udf89  pic.twitter.com/QXMCiox12X\n\u2014 Ricardo Pardini (@SilvioSantoZ)  May 12, 2021\n     A new  CLI is available that can be usedto install and manage Cilium clusters. The CLI talks directly to the KubernetesAPI and offers a variety of functionality to manage different aspects ofCilium. The CLI is backward compatible to older versions of Cilium.\n   The  cilium status command allows to quickly determine the status of anyCilium installation. It will indicate the number of unhealthy Cilium componentsand quickly expose failure states in any of the nodes:\n $ cilium status /\u00af\u00af\\ /\u00af\u00af\\__/\u00af\u00af\\ Cilium: OK \\__/\u00af\u00af\\__/ Operator: OK /\u00af\u00af\\__/\u00af\u00af\\ Hubble: disabled \\__/\u00af\u00af\\__/ ClusterMesh: disabled \\__/Deployment cilium-operator Desired: 2, Ready: 2/2, Available: 2/2DaemonSet cilium Desired: 2, Ready: 2/2, Available: 2/2Containers: cilium Running: 2 cilium-operator Running: 2Image versions cilium quay.io/cilium/cilium:v1.10.0: 2 cilium-operator quay.io/cilium/operator-generic:v1.10.0: 2\n  A new connectivity test can be run with a single command ( cilium connectivitytest). It ensures correctness in networking, Kubernetes services andNetworkPolicy enforcement and is ideal to validate whether Cilium has beencorrectly installed.\n $ cilium connectivity test\u2728 [gke_cilium-dev_us-west2-a_test-21504] Creating namespace for connectivity check...\u2728 [gke_cilium-dev_us-west2-a_test-21504] Deploying echo-same-node service...[...]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ud83d\udd0c [pod-to-pod] Testing cilium-test/client-68c6675687-tcw9f -&gt; cilium-test/echo-other-node-588bf78fbb-84fvc...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u2705 [pod-to-pod] cilium-test/client-68c6675687-tcw9f (10.96.6.173) -&gt; cilium-test/echo-other-node-588bf78fbb-84fvc (10.96.5.226)[...]---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ud83d\udccb Test Report---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u2705 9/9 tests successful (0 warnings)\n    Following up work from previous releases,we continued to rigorously evaluate Cilium&#39;s networking performance. Our latestfindings were recently summarized in a blog post as well as integratedinto Cilium&#39;s  documentation,where we provided numbers for different types of direct routing workloads, showedhow eBPF enables for low-latency as well as high CNI throughput performance, andcompared WireGuard to IPsec.\n Guided by our in-depth performance evaluation, Cilium 1.10 includes a number ofdatapath improvements, this time mainly focussed on the VXLAN/Geneve tunnelingperformance as well as reduction of Netfilter overhead. Most notably:\n BPF host routingwas extended to support encapsulation. This means that maximizing performanceusing eBPF can now be achieved in both direct routing and tunneling modes. Inparticular, this improves the north-south service handling to be on par withthe direct routing mode since network traffic does not need to be processed bythe upper host stack anymore.\n We identified and fixeda performance issue in the Linux kernel, where the GRO aggregation of encapsulatedUDP packets for VXLAN and Geneve was delayed, leading to suboptimal performancewhen using encapsulation with Cilium. The fix has been backported to all stablekernels (e.g., 4.9)as well as integrated into downstream distributions such as Ubuntu LTS variants.In our test environment, this more than doubled the Gbit/s TCP single-streamthroughput rate for traffic subject to VXLAN and Geneve encapsulation.\n Finally, Cilium can now be configured to skip Netfilter conntrack: we introduced a newagent option,  --install-no-conntrack-iptables-rules, which allows to skipNetfilter connection tracking whenever possible. You can read more in the tuning guide.\n We will follow-up and publish in-depth results of our performance evaluation for thetunneling setups in an upcoming blog post. Preliminary results from our  test environment yield significant improvements as shown below for the threementioned areas.\n  For the regular Pod to Pod case where traffic needs to traverse through theVXLAN/Geneve tunnel we were able to significantly improve the bulk performancefor large data transfers, typically benchmarked through netperf TCP_STREAM tests.We added a small improvement to the Linux kernel&#39;s GRO engine which is responsibleto optimize the Linux&#39; stack traversal by aggregating MTU-sized packets up to64k super-packets in order to reduce the per-packet processing cost for thestack. We found that the aggregation would happen only inside the VXLAN/Genevedriver&#39;s GRO cell instead of the physical device right upon receive, meaning,packets had to traverse individually through the UDP stack to only be aggregatedthere. Moving the aggregation to the physical device significantly boosted the performance.\n    For the case where an external client is connecting to a Pod on a Cilium-managednode, for example, through a NodePort service, then the same improvements can beapplied  as done earlierfor the direct routing case. Meaning, forwarding can be performed right in thetc eBPF layer instead of having to push packets up the host stack. This resultsin significant gains in single stream throughput (TCP_STREAM) as well as significantreductions in latency for request/response-type workloads (TCP_RR and TCP_CRR).The gains in such scenarios are less visible when packets have to traverse thetunnel (e.g. for plain Pod to Pod case) since this mandates going through the upperUDP stack, but this is not the case for services where, for example, the backendsare local on the node. A typical use case is NodePort under  externalTrafficPolicy=Local.\n    For the last case we investigated the direct routing performance when users dohave the constraint of having to pass through the Netfilter subsystem in the hoststack, be it due to running an older kernel or simply due to having Cilium deployedwith custom Netfilter rules. In particular the Netfilter connection tracker canadd a significant cost to the fast-path and might not be needed in all deploymentsituations, especially since we added eBPF-based masquerading that can be used asan alternative already. This traversal cost can then be minimized by disabling theconnection tracking requirement for all Pod traffic, thus bypassing the Net\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-23 06:01:07", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u589e\u52a0,adds,cilium", "title": "CILIUM 1.10\u7248\u672c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86WIGUARD\u900f\u660e\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u652f\u6301 ", "title_en": "Cilium 1.10 release adds support for WireGuard Transparent Encryption", "transed": 1, "url": "https://cilium.io/blog/2021/05/20/cilium-110", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u589e\u52a0", "adds", "cilium"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067563, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5168\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07\u8bfb\u8005\u8ba2\u9605FT  \u9009\u62e9\u8d2d\u4e70\u5ba1\u5224\u8ba2\u9605$ 1\u6301\u7eed4\u5468\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u5ba1\u5224\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u6bcf\u6708\u6536\u8d3991\u7f8e\u5143  4\u5468\u63a5\u6536\u65e0\u9650\u7684\u4f18\u8d28\u6570\u5b57\u8bbf\u95eeFT\uff06\uff0339;

RISC-V is an open standard specifically designed to be forward-looking and evade as much legacy  cruft as possible. One example of this design is RISC-V&#39;s dynamic width vector instruction set, which allows developers to execute vector instructions on data of arbitrary size with maximum efficiency.\n In traditional processor designs, a vector instruction has a fixed width tied to the hardware register size of the processor\u2014for example, SSE and SSE2 allow use of a Pentium III&#39;s 128-bit registers, while making full use of an i7-4770&#39;s 256-bit registers requires a completely separate instruction set (AVX2) for the same mathematical operations. Moving up to an i7-1065G7&#39;s 512-bit registers requires yet another instruction set, AVX-512\u2014again, for the same underlying mathematical operations.\n In sharp contrast, RISC-V vector math allows a single set of CPU instructions to perform the same set of mathematical operations as efficiently as possible, using whatever size registers the current CPU design has available. This means a developer can simply write a single routine that will process vector operations as efficiently as possible on a phone with 64-bit registers or on a supercomputer with 1,024-bit registers.\n In addition to forward-looking features built into the RISC-V spec, the architecture is designed to provide flexibility that its designers did not or could not think of ahead of time. Generic RISC-V designs feature reserved opcodes, which designers of specific RISC-V CPUs may then take over to provide additional, arbitrary functionality.\n    The ability to &#34;take over&#34; reserved opcodes allows for greatly streamlined ASIC design, since both specialized instructions and general controller functionality can be provided on a single die\u2014and without CPU architects needing to reinvent any wheels to provide the generic controller functionality.\n For the moment, RISC-V is not a serious competitor to either Arm or x86 in the general-purpose processor space, but it&#39;s heavily used in the microcontroller space, due in part to its extensibility and inexpensive licensing. We do broadly expect RISC-V to become a third major player when it comes to general-purpose CPUs\u2014the sort that provide the &#34;main brain&#34; for phones, tablets, and traditional computers\u2014but that is still some years away.\n  The two new designs announced today are P270 and P550. P270 is SiFive&#39;s first CPU to fully support the optional RISC-V  vector extension 1.0 release candidate, and P550 is SiFive&#39;s highest-performing RISC-V processor to date\u2014also making it, as far as we know, the highest-performing RISC-V processor available.\n   As you&#39;d expect from the &#34;release candidate&#34; rider, RISC-V&#39;s &#34;V&#34; optional instruction set is not yet a frozen standard. When the V spec reaches 1.0\u2014without the &#34;release candidate&#34; rider\u2014it will be considered stable enough to freeze the feature set. This will allow developers to begin work on long-term projects using it for toolchains, functional simulators, and so forth, with some degree of certainty that the code the developers have written will &#34;just work&#34; on future CPU designs.\n It&#39;s worth noting that even once the release candidate tag is removed, the 1.0 version of the V instructions will still only be considered ready for public ratification. The first true production version of V will be 2.0, a version number awarded after public ratification is considered complete, with no major functionality changes necessary.\n    SiFive also offers a translation utility called Recode, which automatically converts legacy SIMD code to V-spec vector assembly.\n   Both P270 and P550 are Linux-capable designs, but the P270 is limited to a dual-issue, in-order pipeline with only eight stages. While the P270&#39;s full V extension support should make it a formidable processor for heavily vector-math-dependent applications, the P550 should prove far more powerful for applications closer to those currently handled by general-purpose CPUs.\n SiFive&#39;s new Performance P550 core features a 13-stage, triple-issue, out-of-order pipeline. SiFive claims that a four-core P550-based CPU takes up roughly the same on-die area as a single Arm Cortex-A75, with a significant performance advantage over that competing Arm design. SiFive says the P550 delivers 8.65 SPECInt 2006 per GHz, based on internal engineering test results\u2014a laudable result when\u00a0 compared to Cortex-A75 (and not too far behind an i9-10900K&#39;s 11.08/GHz). But it&#39;s well behind an Apple A14&#39;s 21.1/GHz.\n  First and foremost, we need to make one thing clear\u2014we are almost certainly\u00a0 not talking about Intel ditching the x86_64 architecture for RISC-V! Modern x86_64 CPUs from Intel and AMD include management and supervisory cores, which are not directly accessible to end users. These are typically Arm CPU cores; for example, AMD&#39;s first APUs used Cortex-A5 for their platform security processor.\n The joint  announcement from Intel and SiFive is unclear on just what Horse Creek will be. Intel generally reserves the &#34;Creek&#34; names for socketed platforms rather than all-in-one system on chip (SoC) boards. This suggests that, in all likelihood, the P550 will be limited to supervisory or management duties within x86_64 Horse Creek CPUs rather than directly processing instructions from software running on that platform.\n Anandtech&#39;s Ian Cuttress\u00a0 points out\u00a0that building the P550 directly into Horse Creek\u2014which will be built on Intel&#39;s newest 7nm process node\u2014might provide Intel with simpler testing and more rapid development of the new 7nm process itself.", "posttime": "2021-06-23 05:23:09", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

startups with a total addressable market of about $1.3 trillion.\n Today, about 19 companies are making their way through the incubator in hopes of joining recent GM startups like OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance, GM Defense and BrightDrop, the commercial electric vehicle delivery business that launched in January. Not everything will make it, Fletcher told the audience, noting \u201cwe add new things all the time.\u201d\n Launching any startup presents challenges.\u00a0But launching multiple startups within a 113-year-old automaker that employs 155,000 people globally is another, more complex matter. The bar, which determines whether these startups are ever publicly launched, is specific and high. A GM startup has to be a new idea that can attract new customers and grow the total addressable market for the automaker, using existing assets and IP.\n  The 2010 Chevrolet Volt is a noteworthy moment on the GM timeline. The vehicle marked the company\u2019s first commercial push into electrification since the 1990s EV1 program. Fletcher, who was the chief engineer of the Chevy Volt propulsion system from 2008 to 2011, noted that the Volt was the beginning of a change within the automaker that eventually led to other commercial products including the all-electric Chevy Bolt, the hands-free driver assistance system Super Cruise and its current work on autonomous vehicle development with its subsidiary Cruise.\n I don\u2019t know that the Volt was a root exactly of what we\u2019re seeing today. But I think it was definitely the start of a groundswell of really looking at, how do we inject technology that customers are excited about and care about quickly? How do we engage them deeply in the process? \u2026 Which we\u2019ve always done \u2026 just, I think there was a climate there where the appetite was so strong with a certain group of customers for the technology that it allowed us to get really a front row seat with them, which was game changing for those of us on the frontlines. And obviously, there have been many programs that have had that in their own ways, but you really see that accelerating now with the advent of everything we\u2019re doing in electrification and autonomous and a portfolio that is just emerging even to the notion of applying some of these great technologies to our new full size, truck and SUV programs. So it\u2019s really broad, based across the company, which is exciting.   (Timestamp: 4:56)\n Fletcher explained how working to commercialize new technology changed how the company interacted with customers.\n With new technologies, one, you get to a new customer base sometimes. So, really understanding what that customer is looking like and putting them at the center of everything. Also, different technologies have different development processes and timelines and pipelines for activity. So, it really allowed us to start to think about how to approach each step of our product development and customer engagement differently. And the Volt was an interesting time too, because that was the advent of new social media was really starting to become much more popular. And so we were very connected with those customers and a great customer base that gave us tremendous feedback very directly, you know, through at the time, what was a new channel.

It will also use the funding to continue its expansion in overseas markets, including Vietnam, where Toss launched last year.\n Viva Republica, which  hit unicorn status in 2018, has now raised more than $940 million in equity funding.\n   Founder and chief executive officer SG Lee told TechCrunch that Toss Bank will focus on lending, and also offer savings accounts with competitive interest rates.\n \u201cA lot of challenger banks and neobanks are focusing on the banking experience, such as cards, so their main revenue source is interchange fees,\u201d he said. \u201cToss is quite different because we already cover all that. We cover P2P payment, money transfer, cards and all sorts of services. So we are focusing on loans, unsecured loans, mortgages, all sorts of loans. We are going to use this vehicle to give the most competitive interest rates to users, and Toss Bank will not have a separate app, since we have super app strategy.\u201d\n  One of the reasons Toss Bank is focusing on loans is because if someone has a middling credit score, many South Korean banks will only offer them loans at subprime interest rates, Lee said. Toss Bank will be able to offer better rates because its risk-scoring model leverages data from its millions of users.\n Toss now claims a total of 20 million users (or more than a third of South Korea\u2019s 51.7 population) and of that amount, 11 million are monthly active users.\n The app launched as a Venmo-like peer-to-peer money transfer platform in 2015, before adding more services. Now its users can turn to the app for almost all of their financial needs.\n For example, they can check their balances at different banks and credit cards on a dashboard. Merchants can use Toss Payments to send and receive online payments and manage their business finances. Other features include budgeting tools, bill payments, a credit score tracker and insurance plans. Lee said more than 20% of bank accounts and credit cards in South Korea are already registered on Toss.\n As a financial super app, Toss Bank will be able to supplement information from South Korea\u2019s main credit rating agencies with its own data about user transactions: for example, where do they spend money, how often do they spend, their cash flow and balances.\n  Lee added that one of South Korea\u2019s leading credit bureaus, KCB (Korea Credit Bureau), backtested Toss\u2019 engine with data from over two million users, and it turned out to be 150% better in terms of differential power analysis and 30% lower in delinquency rates. \u201cThis is the first engine that counts this asset-related data, and no machine-learning technologies have been used in credit evaluation\u201d in South Korea, he said. \u201cI think Toss Bank is really well-positioned to disrupt the whole loan market.\u201d\n In March, Toss also launched an investment service called Toss Securities, designed to make stock trading accessible to new investors who shy away from traditional brokerages. Over the past three months, it has signed up more than 3.5 million users.\n Viva Republica launched Toss in Vietnam, its first international market, in 2020, and the app now has services like no-fee money transfers, debit cards and a financial dashboard through a partnership with CIMB bank. Toss currently claims more than three million monthly active users in Vietnam and says it adds more than 500,000 active users every month. Toss is planning to enter other Southeast Asian markets, too.\n Toss hasn\u2019t finalized a timeline, but it is targeting Malaysia for its next market by the end of this year. \u201cThe product that we built for Vietnam is actually quite scalable across all Southeast Asia markets, so it\u2019s a matter of time,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut we want to focus on the Vietnam market because it\u2019s scaling increasingly fast and we have to cover the growth.\u201d\n As for the possibility of holding an initial public offering or finding another exit opportunity, Lee said the company is still finalizing its plans. \u201cAs an Asian company, reaching a $7.4 billion valuation is pretty high, and I think at some point we will face not being able to do more fundraising in the private market. So we\u2019re targeting to raise once more by the end of this year or early next year for over $300 million. That will be our last private fundraising, and then we\u2019re thinking a timeline of three years, and we are reviewing not only for a Korean listing but also a U.S. listing.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-23 05:22:21", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7a0b\u5e8f,\u5f00\u53d1,republica,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "Viva Republica\uff0c\u97e9\u56fd\u91d1\u878d\u8d85\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6298\u817e\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\uff0c\u4f30\u503c\u4e3a7.4\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u5347\u9ad8410\u7c73 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tViva Republica, developer of Korean financial super app Toss, raises $410M at a $7.4B valuation\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/viva-republica-developer-of-korean-financial-super-app-toss-raises-410m-at-a-7-4b-valuation/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7a0b\u5e8f", "\u5f00\u53d1", "republica", "\u94f6\u884c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "e59f470f2d988a67d1b4ba96250be1dd.jpg", "infoid": 1067558, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5468\u4e8c\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u5458\u5de5\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u66f4\u6539\u6216\u7533\u8bf7\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u504f\u8fdc\u5de5\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u5c55\u671b\u4e86\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u540e\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8bd5\u56fe\u5f04\u6e05\u695a\u7ba1\u7406\u66f4\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u7269\u6d41\u3002\n 5\u6708\uff0c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Sundar Pichah\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e8620\uff05\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u8ba1\u5212\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u670920\uff05\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8c37\u6b4c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u5206\u914d\u7684\u8c37\u6b4c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u5176\u4ed660\uff05\u7684\u4eba\u6bcf\u5468\u51e0\u5929\u4ece\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6821\u56ed\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n   \u5982\u679c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5458\u5de5\u8bf7\u6c42\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8d54\u507f\u5c06\u8c03\u6574\u5230\u5f53\u5730\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a0e\u7387\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u6216\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u96c7\u5458\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u642c\u5230\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u51cf\u5c11\u3002\u65b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u79f0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u663e\u793a\u5458\u5de5\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5176\u5de5\u8d44\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5c06\u5728\u5f53\u5730\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9876\u7aef\u652f\u4ed8\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u80a1\u7968\u8d62\u5f97\u80a1\u7968\uff06\uff0339;

The company said another 20% of employees could work from a Google office other than their normally assigned one if they wanted to. The other 60% would be working from their normal office campus a few days a week.\n   If Google employees request transfers to new markets, their compensations would be adjusted to the rates of the local region. For many employees working in San Francisco or New York, that could mean a decrease if they are moving to smaller markets. The new software, called the Work Location Tool, will show employees estimates of how their salaries might change depending on location.\n A Google spokeswoman said the company will pay employees at the top of the local market, and equity won&#39;t decrease for transferring US employees.\n  &#34;With our new hybrid workplace, more employees are considering where they live and how they work,&#34; a Google spokeswoman said in a statement. &#34;To better equip people with the information they need to explore their options, we&#39;ve built a tool that will allow all employees to request to move to a new location, or go remote.&#34;\n The new tool highlights the several new factors companies need to consider as they move to hybrid work models. Flexibility has become a key issue as companies try to bring employees back into offices after more than a year of remote work. Some companies,  like Reddit, have announced that they will not alter employee pay if they move out of expensive areas like the San Francisco Bay Area or New York City.\n  Google was one of the first big companies to let its massive employee base work from home when the  coronavirus pandemic took hold. The company won&#39;t require employees to return to offices in any capacity until September of this year.\n Other tech companies have also been rethinking what work at the office could look like after the pandemic.  Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg said last year that the social-networking giant will allow some employees to  work from home permanently. He said about half of  Facebook&#39;s workforce could work remotely over the next five to 10 years. Twitter made a  similar announcement, and CEO  Jack Dorsey also  extended the policy to his other company, mobile-payments firm Square.\n Update, 11:38 a.m. PT: A Google spokeswoman initially gave CNET the incorrect name of the tool. It&#39;s the Work Location Tool.\n  Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic. We delete comments that violate  our policy, which we encourage you to read.

This is due in large part to their past success in distributed IT development, remote IT operations, and remote maintenance. IT companies have required their staff to essentially do at home what they had been doing in the office years before. Moreover, to meet the constraints of working from home, the demand for IT services has increased across many other market sectors, including retail, entertainment, education, and healthcare, leading to a more profitable IT market.\n    While this news is largely positive for IT companies, the pandemic is also taking its toll on the upstream supply of IT labor, and software developers in particular. These effects could constrain hiring and innovation over the next two to three years. Due in part to travel embargos, limited access to educational loans, and delays in student visa processing, U.S. colleges and universities are observing significant declines in graduate-level enrollments in computer and information science this year. These declines are translating into one-year enrollment deferrals, meaning a temporary, but significant reduction in expected 2021 graduation rates.\n Two years ago, in 2019, U.S. colleges and universities awarded more than 136,000 bachelor&#39;s, master&#39;s, and Ph.D. degrees in computer and information science (CIS).  6 Among which, 35,200 of these degrees were awarded to nonresident aliens, among whom 27,200 or 77% earned either a master&#39;s or doctoral degree, placing these graduates in a higher skilled technology category. Recently, the American Council on Education (ACE) reported a 43% decline in pandemic-era enrollments for international students based on recent surveys.  5 This decline will reduce CIS post-graduates by 11,700 students in 2021, and would disproportionately affect higher-skilled graduates with more than two years of industry experience. While this story is still playing out, we should already anticipate a tighter IT labor market, particularly among higher-skilled technology jobs.\n    Prior to the pandemic, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimated that approximately 1,469,200 full-time software developers were working in the U.S. in 2019, earning an average salary of $107,510. Over the next 10 years, BLS estimates the U.S. labor market will add 316,000 software developer jobs, which is a phenomenal 22% growth rate, or an average of about 31,000 new jobs each year. By comparison, lesser-skilled computer programmer jobs would decline by 9% to fewer than 193,800 jobs by 2029, showing a continued shift in the U.S. labor market toward higher-skilled IT jobs that include the engineering practices of software design, software construction and maintenance. The 43% decline in new CIS graduates reported by the ACE would reduce BLS estimated job growth by 38% in 2021 by leaving thousands of jobs unfilled.\n In our review of published 2018 data from the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), 61% of the top 200 companies that hire graduates under Optional Practical Training (OPT) conduct business in management consulting, and information technology, including retail, finance, and healthcare;  9 see the sidebar  here. This includes popular consulting companies, such as Deloitte, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and KPMG, as well as popular technology companies, such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. We estimate that in 2018 there were 46,700 new workers authorized under STEM OPT who were potentially working in IT-related fields. If true, then a decline of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021 could reduce the available OPT-authorized IT workforce by as much as 25%.\n    When labor-supply shortages arise in IT, the impact can negatively affect both productivity and innovation. In a survey of electronic and mechanical engineering and IT firms in Northern Ireland, Bennett and McGuinness found that skill shortages in hard-to-fill and unfilled vacancies reduce firm-level performance.  1 Hard-to-fill vacancies include those requiring more experience and qualifications, such as IT positions that require at least two years of experience, which are reported to be 40% more difficult to fill than entry-level positions. Unfilled vacancies are measured by the raw number of open positions within the last 12 months, which is independent of how recruiters interpret &#34;difficult to hire.&#34; In general, Bennett and McGuinness found that hard-to-fill vacancies reduced productivity levels by 65%, while unfilled vacancies reduced productivity levels by 75%. This productivity loss is amplified when the company has a large proportion of new graduates and inexperienced workers, or when the company has significant investments in R&amp;D, which otherwise drives up productivity when labor shortages are minimal. Substantiating the impact of labor shortages on innovation, Horbach and Rammer analyzed three years of the German Innovation Survey and found that unfilled positions in high skill areas correlates with increased canceling of innovation projects.  4\n Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies. What makes a company attractive to a prospective employee is driven in part by the skills that a prospective hire feels they can develop on the new job. Based on an analysis of employment data from over 50,000 workers, Tambe et al. found that IT employees accept a &#34;compensating differential,&#34; such as trading pay for other job attributes, when they can work with novel and emerging IT systems and develop their skills on the job.  7 Furthermore, their analysis shows employees value working on interesting IT systems above most other employer attributes, such as pay and other benefits. They also note that recent graduates who arrived with newer skills in a high-demand job market would have more job options, and thus be more competitive hires.\n    Instead of waiting for positions to become hard-to-fill and unfilled\u2014leading to more lost productivity and reduced innovation\u2014companies can take two strategic steps to attract and retain high-skilled employees: establish a dual career path for managerial and technical staff, and invest in employee education and training.\n In 1988, Ginzburg and Baroudi identified the need to define a non-managerial technical career ladder to complement the traditional management track for promotions.  3 Over the last seven years, we observed that over 50% of graduates of the Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) have entered senior positions. These graduates enter either a managerial track, such as Project and Program Manager or Staff Software Engineer, or they enter a technical track, such as Senior Software Engineer and Software Development Engineer II and above. The technical track encourages career growth without shifting one&#39;s responsibilities to primarily cover management activities. In April 2020, we looked at career paths of alumni who graduated from 2015\u20132017 recording 44 alumni who ascended the technical ladder within their companies, and 10 who ascended by changing employers. Companies that allow employees to move between tracks afford employees more flexibility to pursue skill development within the company versus looking outward for open positions elsewhere. For example, we observed CMU MSE alumni working for a few years as technical leaders, building critical service infrastructure, who later chose to develop their personnel and project management skills by moving to a management track. We also see the converse, though less often: after having managed a team for some time, an alumnus/alumna chooses to re-enter a product or project team as a technical leader in a non-management role. In our discussions with alumni, these shifts were not viewed as career compromises, but as skill development opportunities.\n  Unfilled positions lead to increased churn as skilled employees jockey for better jobs at more attractive companies.\n  Another way to attract and retain employees, and to support internal career advancement, is to engage employees in on-the-job education by providing online learning benefits in addition to pay. One consequence of the pandemic has been large moves by colleges and universities toward online learning. Coursework in artificial intelligence and machine learning, DevOps, and software architecture are now online and taught by the world&#39;s experts in these topics. Online learning opportunities come in different sizes, from one-to three-course certificates to part-time degree programs that students complete over two to three years. In many cases, employees dedicate 10\u201312 hours a week to online courses, while applying this advanced knowledge to their workplace projects. To build such benefits, companies should consider several issues, including: how to allow for flexible schedules that accommodate online classes; how much to compensate employees for course tuition, recognizing these newly learned skills will transfer to their workplace performance; and whether a certificate or a degree program is the right incentive for recruitment and retention. Certificates may be attractive to senior employees, whereas a graduate degree could entice recent hires looking for more experience and seek additional formal education aimed at advancing their careers internally.\n By emphasizing career paths that foster skill development, companies can move to keep employees more engaged with new opportunities that demonstrate their intellect and entrepreneurship. Moreover, providing corporate support for online software engineering education can re-energize a culture of innovation. Together, these investments can help companies reduce their exposure to the effects of this pandemic, while the upstream supply of IT labor replenishes to meet growing demand.\n    It is evident a labor shortage is expected to arrive soon and that it will disproportionately affect highly skilled workers. With an estimated reduction of 11,700 CIS graduates in 2021  5 and the BLS estimated 22% growth in software developer jobs,  8 there could be thousands of positions left unfilled or hard-to-fill. The added difficulty of hiring skilled employees from a smaller labor supply has the potential to cost companies through lost productivity and reduced innovation. The remaining question is how will companies creatively hire and retain high-skilled employees amidst all the coming turmoil? Companies can get ahead of the shortfall with two strategic steps: establishing a dual career path that allows employees to grow, and investing in employee education and training.\n  1.
