In Israel, however, it is available at government expense for soldiers who have been badly injured and need sexual rehabilitation.</p><p>在许多国家，替代性别治疗 - 其中一个人被雇用作为患者＆＃39;性伴侣 - 是有争议的，而且没有广泛实践。然而，在以色列中，它可以在政府费用中获得严重受伤和需要性康复的士兵。</p><p> The Tel Aviv consultation room of Israeli sex therapist Ronit Aloni looks much as you would expect. There is a small comfy couch for her clients and biological diagrams of male and female genitalia, which she uses for explanation.</p><p> 以色列性治疗师Ronit Aloni的Tel Aviv咨询室看起来很多。她的客户和男性和女性生殖器的生物图都有一个小舒适的沙发，她用来解释。</p><p> But what happens in the neighbouring room, which has a sofabed and candles, is more surprising.</p><p> 但是，邻近的房间发生了什么，具有沙发和蜡烛，更令人惊讶。</p><p> This is where paid surrogate partners help teach some of Aloni&#39;s clients how to have intimate relationships and ultimately, how to have sex.</p><p> 这是付费代理合作伙伴帮助教授一些aloni＆＃39;客户如何拥有亲密关系，最终如何发生性关系。</p><p> &#34;It doesn&#39;t look like a hotel - it looks more like a house, like an apartment,&#34; says Aloni. There&#39;s a bed, a CD player, an adjoining shower - and erotic artwork adorns the walls.</p><p> ＆＃34;它没有看起来像一个酒店 - 它看起来更像是房子，就像一个公寓，＆＃34;阿隆尼说。 ＆＃39;一张床，CD播放器，相邻的淋浴和色情艺术品装饰着墙壁。</p><p> &#34;Sex therapy is, in many ways, couple therapy and if somebody doesn&#39;t have a partner then you cannot complete the process,&#34; she goes on. &#34;The surrogate - she or he - they&#39;re there to model the partner role in a couple.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;性治疗是在许多方面，夫妻治疗以及如果有人没有合作伙伴，那么你就无法完成这个过程，＆＃34;她去了。 ＆＃34;代理人 - 她或他 - 他们＆＃39;在那里建模合作伙伴角色。＆＃34;</p><p>  Although critics liken this to prostitution, in Israel it has become accepted to the extent that the state covers the cost for soldiers with injuries that affect their ability to have sex.</p><p>  虽然批评者比较这是卖淫，但在以色列中，虽然国家涵盖了士兵的成本，但受伤的影响影响他们发生性行为的能力。 </p><p> Sex is part of life, it&#39;s the satisfaction of life... it&#39;s not that I&#39;m being Casanova - this is not the issue</p><p>性是生命的一部分，它的生活满意度......它不是那个我是Casanova的＆＃39; m是casanova  - 这不是问题</p><p> &#34;People need to feel they can pleasure somebody else and that they can get pleasure from somebody else,&#34; says Aloni, who has a doctorate in sexual rehabilitation.</p><p> ＆＃34;人们需要觉得他们可以享受别人，并且他们可以从别人那里得到乐趣，＆＃34;阿诺人说，他有博士学位的性康复。</p><p> &#34;People are coming for therapy. They&#39;re not coming for pleasure. There is nothing similar to prostitution,&#34; she adds firmly.</p><p> ＆＃34;人们正在接受治疗。他们＆＃39;重新出现乐趣。卖淫没有什么类似的，＆＃34;她坚定地增加了。</p><p> &#34;Also, 85% of the sessions are [about] intimacy, touching, giving and receiving, communicating - it&#39;s about learning to be a person and how you relate to other people. By the time you have a sexual relationship, that&#39;s the end of the process.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;此外，85％的会话是[关于]亲密，触摸，给予和接受，沟通 - 它关于学习成为一个人以及如何与其他人联系。当你有性关系的时候，这个过程的结束。＆＃34;</p><p>  Mr A, as he wants to be known, was one of the first soldiers who got Israel&#39;s Ministry of Defence to pay for sex surrogate therapy after a life-changing accident nearly 30 years ago, when he was an army reservist.</p><p>  A先生，他想知道，是第一位获得以色列的士兵之一，曾在近30年前在近30年前在陆军书房近30年前的生命转变事故后支付性替代治疗部的第一位士兵之一。</p><p> A fall from a height left him paralysed from the waist down and unable to have sex in the ways that he had previously.</p><p> 从一个高度落下他瘫痪从腰部瘫痪，无法以他以前的方式发生性行为。</p><p>  &#34;When I was injured I made a list &#39;To Do,&#39;&#34; he says. &#34;I have to [be able to] do a shower by myself, I have to eat, dress by myself, to drive by myself and have sex independently.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;当我受伤时，我做了一个名单＆＃39;做，＆＃39;＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;我必须通过自己淋浴，我必须吃，穿着自己，驾驶自己，独立发生性行为。＆＃34; </p><p> Mr A was already married with children, but his wife did not feel comfortable talking about sex to doctors and therapists, so she encouraged him to seek help from Aloni.</p><p>A先生已经与孩子结婚，但他的妻子对医生和治疗师的性别谈论性别感到舒服，所以她鼓励他寻求Aloni的帮助。</p><p> He explains how Aloni gave directions and feedback to him and his surrogate partner before and after each session.</p><p> 他解释了Aloni如何在每次会议之前和之后向他和他的代理伙伴提供指示和反馈。</p><p>  &#34;You start from the beginning: you&#39;re touching this, you&#39;re touching there and then it&#39;s building step-by-step until the last stage of getting an orgasm,&#34; he says.</p><p>  ＆＃34;你从一开始就开始：你＆＃39;重新触摸这一点，你＆＃39;在那里触摸那里，然后逐步地建造它直到获得高潮的最后阶段，＆＃34 ;他说。</p><p> Mr A argues it was right for the state to pay for his weekly sessions, just as it did other parts of his rehabilitation. Today the cost of a three-month treatment programme is $5,400.</p><p> A先生辩称，国家为他的每周课程支付的是正确的，就像他康复的其他地方一样。今天，为期三个月的治疗计划的费用为5,400美元。</p><p> &#34;It wasn&#39;t the goal of my life to go to a surrogate, OK, I was injured and I want[ed] to rehabilitate in every aspect of my life,&#34; he says, sitting in his wheelchair, in a tracksuit, on his way to play table tennis.</p><p> ＆＃34;它不是我生命中的目标，然后去代谢，好吧，我受伤了，我想要[ed]在我生命中的各个方面都康复，＆＃34;他说，坐在轮椅上，在轨道上，在途中玩乒乓球。</p><p>  &#34;I didn&#39;t fall in love with my surrogate. I was married. It was just to study the technique of how to get to the goal. I took it as a very logical thing that I have to do.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;我没有爱上我的代理人。我结婚了。这只是研究如何实现目标的技术。我把它作为我必须做的非常合乎逻辑的事情。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;Sex is part of life, it&#39;s the satisfaction of life,&#34; he says. &#34;It&#39;s not that I&#39;m being Casanova, this is not the issue.&#34;</p><p>  ＆＃34;性是生命的一部分，它的生活满意度，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;它不是那个＆＃39;我是Casanova，这不是问题。＆＃34; </p><p>  A steady stream of people of different ages and backgrounds visits Aloni discreetly at her clinic.</p><p>稳定的不同年龄和背景的人流谨慎地访问Aloni。</p><p> Many are struggling to have a romantic relationship because of intimacy issues or anxiety, or have suffered sexual abuse. Others have physical and mental health conditions.</p><p> 由于亲密的问题或焦虑，许多人正在努力拥有浪漫的关系，或者遭受性虐待。其他人有身心健康的条件。</p><p> Aloni has focused particularly on disabled clients since the start of her career. Several of her close relatives had disabilities including her father, a pilot, who suffered a brain injury after a plane crash.</p><p> 自从她的职业生涯开始以来，Aloni特别关注残疾人士。她的几个近亲残疾，包括她的父亲，这是一个飞行员，在飞机失事后遭受脑损伤。</p><p> &#34;All my life I was next to people having to deal with and overcome different disabilities,&#34; she says. &#34;All these people were very well rehabilitated and so I had this very optimistic approach.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我的一生都在不得不处理和克服不同残疾的人旁边，＆＃34;她说。 ＆＃34;所有这些人都很好地康复，所以我有这种非常乐观的方法。＆＃34;</p><p>  Aloni became close to a surrogate who worked with disabled people while studying in New York.</p><p>  阿洛尼靠近纽约学习时与残疾人合作的代理人。</p><p> When she came back to Israel in the late 1980s, she gained the approval of leading rabbis for the use of sexual surrogates and started providing therapy at a rehabilitation centre on a religious kibbutz - a rural community.</p><p> 当她在20世纪80年代后期回到以色列时，她批准了领先的拉比，以利用性替代物，开始在宗教Kibutz的康复中心提供治疗 - 农村社区。</p><p> The rabbis had one rule - no married men or married women could be surrogates - and Aloni has followed it ever since.</p><p> 拉比有一个规则 - 没有已婚男人或已婚妇女可能是代理人 - 而且阿诺人自从此遵循了。 </p><p> Over time, she has won backing from the Israeli authorities. Out of about 1,000 people who have had surrogate sex therapy at her clinic, dozens have been injured army veterans - many with brain trauma or spinal cord injuries, whose treatment has been funded by the state.</p><p>随着时间的推移，她赢得了以色列当局的支持。在约有1000人在她的诊所进行了替代性爱治疗的人中，数十人受伤了陆军退伍军人 - 许多脑创伤或脊髓损伤，其治疗由国家资助。</p><p> Aloni believes that Israel&#39;s family-oriented culture and its attitude towards its armed forces has worked in her favour. At 18, most Israelis are called up for military service and they can continue as reserve soldiers into middle age.</p><p> 阿洛尼认为，以色列＆＃39;对其武装部队的面向家庭的文化，致力于她的青睐。在18岁时，大多数以色列人都被称为军事服务，他们可以继续作为中年储备士兵。</p><p> &#34;We are in a war situation all the time since the country was established,&#34; she says.</p><p> ＆＃34;我们在该国成立以来一直在战争情况下，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> &#34;Everybody in Israel knows people who were injured, or died and everybody has a positive approach to compensating these people. We feel obliged to them.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;以色列的每个人都知道受伤或死亡的人，每个人都有积极的方法来弥补这些人。我们觉得有义务。＆＃34;</p><p>  A tall man of about 40 is sitting in his garden in central Israel with a blanket across his lap. He is a former reserve soldier whose life was shattered in the 2006 Lebanon War.</p><p>  一个大约40个的一个高大的人坐在他的庭院里，在以色列中部，横跨他的膝盖。他是一名前储备士兵，在2006年的黎巴嫩战争中遭到了掠夺。</p><p> David - as we will call him - was left unable to talk or move.</p><p> 大卫 - 正如我们会叫他的那样 - 被遗忘了无法谈话或移动。</p><p>  He can only communicate with the help of his occupational therapist - if she supports his arm and holds a pen in his hand, he can write on a whiteboard.</p><p>  他只能在他的职业治疗师的帮助下沟通 - 如果她支持他的手臂并握着一支笔，他可以在白板上写。 </p><p> &#34;I was just an ordinary person. I&#39;d just got back from a trip to the Far East. I was studying in university and worked as a barman. I used to love sports and being with friends,&#34; David says.</p><p>＆＃34;我只是一个普通人。我＆＃39; d刚从远东旅行回来。我在大学学习，并担任男人员。我曾经喜欢运动，和朋友在一起，＆＃34;大卫说。</p><p> When his military unit came under attack, he suffered serious leg and head injuries and went on to spend three years in hospital.</p><p> 当他的军事单位受到攻击时，他遭受严重的腿部和头部受伤，并在医院花了三年。</p><p>   &#34;When I started the surrogate therapy, I felt like a loser, like nothing. In therapy. I started feeling like a man, young and handsome,&#34; David says.</p><p>   ＆＃34;当我开始替代治疗时，我觉得一位失败者，就像一无所生一样。在治疗中。我开始感觉像一个男人，年轻和英俊，＆＃34;大卫说。</p><p> &#34;It was the first time that I felt that since my injury. It gave me strength and it gave me hope.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;这是我第一次感受到伤势以来。它给了我力量，它给了我希望。＆＃34;</p><p> This was an intimate relationship that David started, knowing that it would have to end. So was there a risk that he would be emotionally hurt?</p><p> 这是大卫开始的亲密关系，知道它必须结束。那么有风险他会在情绪上伤害吗？</p><p> &#34;Initially, it was difficult for me because I wanted the surrogate all to myself,&#34; he says. &#34;But I realised that even if we&#39;re not partners, we&#39;re still good friends. And it&#39;s worth it. It&#39;s worth everything. It just helps you rebuild yourself all over again.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;最初，对我来说很难，因为我想要自己的代理人，＆＃34;他说。 ＆＃34;但我意识到即使我们＆＃39;重复伙伴，我们还是好朋友。它是值得的。它＆＃39值得一切。它只是帮助你再次重建自己。＆＃34;</p><p> While the usual rules are that surrogates and clients cannot be in contact outside of the therapy, David and his surrogate - a woman who uses the alias Seraphina - were given special permission by Dr Aloni&#39;s clinic to stay in touch when their sessions ended.</p><p> 虽然通常的规则是代理人和客户不能在治疗之外联系，大卫和他的代理人 - 一个使用Alias Seraphina的女性 - 获得了Aloni博士和＃39; S诊所的特殊许可，以便在他们的会议时保持联系结束了。 </p><p> Since the treatment, those close to David say they have seen a transformation in him. He has been focusing on plans for the future.</p><p>自治疗以来，那些靠近大卫的人说他们已经看到了他的转变。他一直专注于未来的计划。</p><p> While having a sex life remains very difficult, before Covid-19 struck he had begun socialising more, going out with the help of his carers.</p><p> 在Covid-19击中之前，在患有性生活中仍然很困难，他已经开始社交了，在他的照顾者的帮助下出去。</p><p>  Seraphina has worked as a surrogate with Ronit Aloni for over a decade. She is slim with bobbed hair and is warm and articulate.</p><p>  Seraphaina已成为ronit aloni的代理人超过十年。她的头发苗条苗条，是温暖和铰接的。</p><p> Recently she published a book about her experiences. Titled More than a Sex Surrogate, the publishers describe it as &#34;a unique memoir about intimacy, secrets and the way we love&#34;.</p><p> 最近她发表了一本关于她经历的书。出版商以不同的表演者为标题为＆＃34;关于亲密，秘密和我们爱的方式的独特回忆录;</p><p> Like all of the surrogate partners at the Tel Aviv clinic, Seraphina has another job. Hers is in the arts. She says she took on her role for altruistic reasons.</p><p> 像Tel Aviv诊所的所有代名合作伙伴一样，Seraphina还有另一份工作。她在艺术中。她说她在利他主义的原因接受了她的职责。</p><p> &#34;All those people that suffer under the [surface] and have all those hidden secrets that they walk around with, I really wanted to help because I knew I had the ability,&#34; she explains.</p><p> ＆＃34;所有那些受到[表面]的人，并拥有他们走在一起的所有隐藏的秘密，我真的想帮助，因为我知道我有能力，＆＃34;她解释道。</p><p> &#34;I had no problem with the idea of using sexuality or my body or touch in the therapy process. And the subject was fascinating to me, sexuality was fascinating to me.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;我对使用性行为或我的身体或触摸在治疗过程中没有问题。这个主题对我令人着迷，性欲对我来说是令人着迷的。＆＃34; </p><p> Seraphina describes herself as &#34;like a tour guide&#34;, saying she takes clients on a journey in which she knows the way.</p><p>Seraphaina描述了自己和＃34;像导游＆＃34;，说她需要客户在她知道的方式。</p><p> You cannot rehabilitate a person without rehabilitating their self-esteem, their perception of being a man or a woman</p><p> 你不能在没有恢复自尊的情况下恢复一个人，他们对作为一个男人或女人的看法</p><p> She has worked with about 40 clients, including another soldier, but says that the severity of David&#39;s injuries posed a unique challenge. She learned how to help him to write so that they could chat privately.</p><p> 她曾与其他40名客户合作，包括另一名士兵，但表示，大卫的严重程度＆＃39;受伤的严重程度构成了一个独特的挑战。她学会了如何帮助他写，以便他们可以私下聊天。</p><p> &#34;David is the most extreme case ever known. It was like walking in a desert - you had no idea of the direction [in which] to go,&#34; she says.</p><p> ＆＃34;大卫是最极端的案例。就像在沙漠中散步 - 你不知道[中]的方向，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> &#34;I had to be very, very creative because he doesn&#39;t move at all. I moved his body as I imagined he would have moved if he could. He felt his body but he could not move it.</p><p> ＆＃34;我不得不非常，非常有创意，因为他完全没有。我想象他想象他会搬到身体。他觉得自己的身体，但他无法移动它。</p><p> &#34;He always said: &#39;She knows exactly what I want, even if I don&#39;t say anything.&#39; So, it was really flattering.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;他总是说：＆＃39;她完全知道我想要什么，即使我不说话。＆＃39;所以，它真的很讨人喜欢。＆＃34;</p><p> While being a surrogate, Seraphina has had boyfriends who, she says, accept what she does. But she knows other women and men who have stopped acting as surrogates for the sake of their personal partners or to get married.</p><p> 虽然是代理人，但Seraphina有男朋友，她说，接受她所做的事。但她知道其他妇女和男性，他们为他们的个人合作伙伴或结婚而停止表现为代理人。 </p><p>  She explains that saying goodbye to clients after they have been intimate is necessary but can be difficult.</p><p>她解释说，在亲密之后向客户说再见，但可能很困难。</p><p> &#34;I say, it&#39;s like going to a vacation. We have an opportunity to have a wonderful relationship for a certain short time and do we take it or give it up?</p><p> ＆＃34;我说，它和＃39;喜欢去度假。我们有机会在一定短时间内拥有一个美好的关系，我们拿走或放弃吗？</p><p> &#34;And it&#39;s the happiest break-up anybody can have. It&#39;s for good reasons. I can cry sometimes, but at the same time, I&#39;m so happy.</p><p> ＆＃34;和＃39;任何人都可以拥有的最快乐的分手。它出于充分原因，＆＃39; s。我有时可以哭泣，但同时，我很开心。</p><p> &#34;When I hear that anybody is in a relationship or had a baby or got married, it&#39;s unimaginable how happy and thrilled and thankful I am for what I do.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;当我听到任何人都在恋爱关系或有婴儿或结婚时，它＆＃39;令人不快的令人难以想象的幸福和兴趣，感谢我所做的。＆＃34;</p><p>  Late in the evening, Ronit Aloni is still working, giving an online lecture to a group of sexologists from Europe and as far afield as South America.</p><p>  晚上迟到了，罗尼特阿尔尼尼仍在工作，向一群来自欧洲和南美洲的儿童学家提供在线讲座。</p><p> She recounts cases and quotes studies suggesting surrogacy is more effective than classic psychological therapy at treating sexual problems.</p><p> 她叙述了案件和报价研究表明代孕比治疗性问题的经典心理治疗更有效。</p><p>  &#34;This is most interesting, those therapists who did already work with surrogates all of them said that they will do it again,&#34; she tells them.</p><p>  ＆＃34;这是最有趣的，那些已经与代理人合作的治疗师所有人都说他们会再做一次，＆＃34;她告诉他们。 </p><p> With modern surgery helping more severely wounded soldiers to survive she believes surrogate treatment could be used more widely.</p><p>现代手术有助于更严重受伤的士兵生存，她认为可以更广泛地使用替代治疗。</p><p> &#34;You cannot rehabilitate a person without rehabilitating their self-esteem, their perception of being a man or a woman,&#34; she says.</p><p> ＆＃34;你不能在没有恢复自尊的情况下恢复一个人，他们对男人或女人的看法，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> &#34;You cannot ignore this part in our life. It&#39;s very important, powerful. It&#39;s the centre of our personality. And you cannot just talk about it. Sexuality is something dynamic, is something that has to be between us and other people.&#34;</p><p> ＆＃34;你不能忽视我们生活中的这一部分。它＆＃39非常重要，强大。它＆＃39;我们的个性中心。你不能只是谈论它。性欲是一种动态的东西，是我们和其他人之间的东西。＆＃34;</p><p>  &#34;We know how to joke about sexuality. We know how to humiliate people, we know to be very conservative or too extreme about sexuality,&#34; she says.</p><p>  ＆＃34;我们知道如何开玩笑。我们知道如何羞辱人们，我们知道是非常保守的或过于极端的性行为，＆＃34;她说。</p><p> &#34;It&#39;s never really balanced. It&#39;s never weaved into our life in the way it&#39;s supposed to be, and sexuality - it&#39;s life. This is how we bring life.
