of the big tech companies are effectively curbing the spread of COVID-19 disinformation.\n &#34;It&#39;s exhausting to keep saying this, but none of the tech platforms are doing enough to curb the toxic lies polluting their platforms,&#34; said Luca Nicotra, Campaign Director at Avaaz.\n The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned about a COVID-19 &#34;infodemic&#34; that threatens to undermine the global response to the health crisis.\n Avaaz has called on social networks, and the European Union, to tackle COVID-19 misinformation in a similar way to climate change.\n  &#34;We urgently need a &#39;Paris Agreement for Disinformation&#39;,&#34; said Nicotra, &#34;but that requires the Big Tech platforms to agree on a strong Code of Practice that has meaningful commitments and measurable action.&#34;\n  V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the European Commission&#39;s Vice-President for Values and Transparency, has supported the calls from Avaaz.\n &#34;We must have tools to punish those whose involvement can be proven [of spreading disinformation],&#34; Jourova tweeted on Thursday.\n Euronews has contacted Facebook -- which also owns Instagram -- Twitter, and YouTube&#39;s parent company Google for a response to the study.\n   In their study, Avaaz found 240 pieces of fact-checked misinformation about COVID-19 that were spreading on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube.\n This content had reportedly been liked, shared, and commented on more than 2.8 million times.\n &#34;The big four tech platforms are failing to act on 37% of the COVID-19 disinformation content sample studied in this research,&#34; Avaaz added.\n Overall, YouTube was found to be the worst social network for acting on COVID-19 misinformation, Avaaz said, where over 92% of the misinformation on YouTube analysed by the study had not been acted on.\n Twitter also fared poorly, failing to tackle 74% of the COVID-19 falsities found by Avaaz, while Facebook (27%) and Instagram (7%) had also neglected to remove some misinformation.\n   The video-sharing platform said previously stated that it banned content about the coronavirus that posed a &#34;serious risk of egregious harm&#34; or contradicted medical information given by the WHO and local health authorities.\n &#34;YouTube has long-standing policies prohibiting harmful and misleading medical or health-related content on the platform,&#34; a spokesperson told Euronews.\n &#34;We have continued to act quickly to update our policies related to COVID-19 to better meet the challenges we are seeing on YouTube. In addition to removing violative content, we raise up authoritative information to provide users with additional context.&#34;\n Avaaz noted that fact-checking videos is &#34;more difficult&#34; than fact-checking written posts or images, but said YouTube had had &#34;ample time&#34; to find a solution.\n YouTube said their teams had removed more than 900,000 videos related to &#34;dangerous or misleading COVID-19 medical information.&#34;\n   Facebook has also stated that it shares the goal of &#34;reducing the spread of misinformation&#34;, and has criticised the new study.\n &#34;Avaaz\u2019s analysis does not take into account the more than 18 million pieces of content that we\u2019ve removed from Facebook and Instagram for violating our COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies since the beginning of the pandemic,&#34; said a company spokesperson.\n &#34;We\u2019ve also labeled more than 167 million pieces of COVID-19 content rated false by our network of fact checking partners.&#34;\n &#34;There is no playbook for a program like ours and we\u2019re constantly working to improve it,&#34; the spokesperson added.\n Avaaz&#39;s study found that COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook had received more interactions than on any other platform.\n   Social networks have previously been cited for their algorithms, which recommend new content and topics to users and aim to keep them on the platforms.\n Previous studies have said that these algorithms also push social media users towards content containing dangerous conspiracy theories and misinformation.\n But the report by Avaaz has also found that tech companies are not tackling misinformation equally in different languages.\n Nearly half (49%) of fact-checked misinformation content in major non-English European languages is not acted upon, the report claimed.\n That compares to English, where only 29% of COVID-19 misinformation is not tackled, Avaaz said.\n  The group said that most of the misinformation spreading about COVID-19 in Italian (84%) and Portuguese (62%) had not been actioned.\n Meanwhile, Spanish and German speakers were most protected online with measures lacking for only 20% and 21% of false content, respectively.\n In a statement to Euronews, Twitter said that they were accelerating their worldwide efforts to remove COVID-19 misinformation.\n &#34;Making certain that reliable, authoritative health information is easily accessible on Twitter has been a priority long before we were in the midst of a global pandemic,&#34; said a company spokesperson.\n &#34;Since the beginning of COVID-19, we\u2019ve expanded and increased our investment in those efforts. We\u2019ve removed more than 22,400 Tweets and challenged 11.7 million accounts worldwide.&#34;\n Avaaz also noted that the preference of Twitter and Youtube to remove misinformation, rather than label it, could become a risk to freedom of speech.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:36:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5df4\u9ece,paris,avaaz", "title": "\u201c\u6211\u4eec\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u201d\u5df4\u9ece\u7684\u8bfd\u8c24\u534f\u8bae\u201c\u201d ", "title_en": "\u201cWe urgently need a 'Paris Agreement for Disinformation' \u201c", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.euronews.com/2021/06/24/social-networks-still-failing-to-tackle-covid-19-misinformation-report-claims", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5df4\u9ece", "paris", "avaaz"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9c2eec3d8fa75e7979ed5d98ceb85036.png", "infoid": 1068673, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u88f8\u9aa8\u6811\u9707\u52a8\u7801\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7279\u5b9a\u7528\u4f8b\u3002  \uff08\u6211\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2acosi\uff06\uff0339; m\u7f16\u5199\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u7684codemod\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fbi\uff06\uff0339; m\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u5806\u968f\u673a\u52a9\u624b\u51fd\u6570 - \u73b0\u5728eslint\u62b1\u6028\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u5220\u9664\u3002\u56e0\u6b64 \u8fd9\u68f5\u6811\u9707\u52a8\u4e86codemod\u3002\uff09  \u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u975e\u5e38\u82b1\u54e8\u7684\u88e4\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7784\u51c6\u4e00\u5207\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002 \u6211\u53ea\u60f3\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f17\u6240\u5468\u77e5\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u7784\u51c6\u6811\u6728\u6447\u6643\u3002 \uff08alletlist\u4e0e\u6821\u820d\uff09\u3002  \u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5c0f\uff08\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u8fd9\u8d62\u4e86\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6446\u8131\u4f60\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u5207\u3002\uff09  \u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\uff06\uff0339;\u6211\u521a\u521a\u6447\u6643\u7740\u4e00\u5207\uff08\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff01\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u83b7\u5f97\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5e38\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u5373\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\uff09 ", "note_en": "This is a bare-bones tree shaking codemod that can be adapted for targeting specific use cases.\n (I made this cos i&#39;m writing a seperate codemod for a migration I&#39;m working on.

", "note_en": "Spacetime-altering shock waves came from massive neutron stars crashing into black holes millions of years ago\n    There are moments when life as an astrophysicist is like hanging around at the bus stop. You wait ages for a cataclysmic cosmic event to send shock waves through the fabric of spacetime and then two come along at once.\n Years after scientists began their search for quivers in spacetime anticipated by  Albert Einstein, gravitational wave detectors in the US and Europe have detected the first signals from two neutron stars crashing into black holes hundreds of millions of light years away.\n   \u201cWe are talking about objects that have more mass than the sun that have been gobbled up,\u201d said Dr Vivien Raymond at Cardiff University\u2019s  Gravity Exploration Institute. \u201cWe would like for the neutron stars to be ripped apart and shredded because then there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for interesting physics, but we think these black holes were big enough that they swallowed the neutron stars whole.\u201d\n The first collision, called GW200105, was spotted in data recorded on 5 January 2020 by the US Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Ligo). Gravitational waves unleashed by the event suggest that a neutron star twice as massive as the sun fell into a black hole nine times more massive than the sun. Moving at the speed of light, these gravitational waves, which squeeze and stretch spacetime as they race across the universe, would have taken 900m years to reach Earth.\n  Ten days later, Ligo and the Virgo gravitational wave detector in Italy recorded a second distinct signal, named GW200115, that was produced when a neutron star 50% more massive than the sun crashed into a black hole six times more massive than the sun. The event was even more distant than the first at 1bn light years away. Details are published in  The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n Black holes and neutrons stars are what is left behind when stars reach the end of their lives and collapse under their own gravity. In some cases they are born as a pair, in binary star systems where one star orbits another. Neutron stars are among the most exotic objects in the known universe. Measuring 20 miles wide they have crusts and crystalline cores. They are so dense that a teaspoon of neutron star weighs as much as Mount Everest.\n  Gravitational waves pass through Earth all the time, but the shudders in spacetime are too subtle to detect unless they are triggered by collisions between extremely massive objects. Scientists reported the  first detection of gravitational waves from the collision of two black holes in 2016 and have since spotted waves from  neutron star mergers. Recording gravitational waves from neutron stars hitting black holes marks another first.\n \u201cWith these events, we\u2019ve completed the picture of possible mergers amongst black holes and neutron stars,\u201d said Chase Kimball, a graduate student at Northwestern University in Illinois. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that there are no new discoveries to be made with gravitational waves. There are plenty of expected gravitational wave sources out there that we\u2019ve yet to detect, from continuous waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars to bursts from nearby supernovae, and I\u2019m sure the universe can find ways to surprise us.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:36:16", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u661f\u5f62,waves,\u9ed1\u6d1e", "title": "\u4ece\u5730\u7403\u4e0a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u661f\u5f62\u9ed1\u6d1e\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2 ", "title_en": "Gravitational waves from star-eating black holes detected on Earth", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jun/29/gravitational-waves-from-star-eating-black-holes-detected-on-earth", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u661f\u5f62", "waves", "\u9ed1\u6d1e"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "a27ab0c126d9518cb35c8759cf288cd8.png", "infoid": 1068671, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7d22\u5c3c\u5ba3\u5e03\u5b83\u5df2\u5728Housemarque\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Sony has  announced that it has acquired Finnish indie developer Housemarque just two months after  the launch of Housemarque&#39;s\u00a0 Returnal as one of the highest-profile exclusives on the young PlayStation 5 console.  Housemarque has a long history with Sony consoles, dating back to 2007&#39;s   Super Stardust HD on the then-new PlayStation 3 and running through  PS4 launch standout  Resogun. Housemarque is also the studio behind the 2017 PS4 twin-stick shooter  Nex Machina, which Ars&#39; Sam Machkovech  gave an honorable mention in his Games of the Year list\u00a0at the time. The last Housemarque game on a non-Sony console was 2008&#39;s little-remembered  Golf: Tee it Up on the Xbox 360. &#34;It\u2019s pretty hard to imagine a launch of a PlayStation platform without there being something from Housemarque,&#34; Hermen Hulst, the head of PlayStation Studios, said in  an interview with The Washington Post. &#34;The games they create are just so different from everything else we\u2019ve got, so I love the diversity of the experiences that we\u2019re able to offer.&#34;\n Also speaking to The Washington Post, Housemarque co-founder and Managing Director Ilari Kuittinen said Sony was in talks to acquire the studio even before  Returnal was released. Kuittinen also said that Sony offered assistance to the small team developing  Returnal, which represented a turn toward 3D exploration and high-end production values for a studio previously known for simpler arcade shooters.\n    Hulst said Housemarque will be looking to expand its approximately 80-person studio in light of the acquisition but that &#34;obviously they\u2019re not going to be a giant 500-man team\u2014that\u2019s not the goal.&#34; Sony is not disclosing the amount spent on the Housemarque purchase.\n Sony&#39;s last major gaming acquisition was the\u00a0 2019 $229 million purchase of  Spider-Man developer Insomniac. Microsoft, meanwhile, recently\u00a0 spent billions on Bethesda Softworks\u00a0a few years after  scooping up  Psychonauts 2 studio Double Fine and  several other indie studios, including Undead Labs ( State of Decay), Playground Games ( Forza Horizon), Ninja Theory ( Hellblade), and Compulsion Games ( We Happy Few).\n Speaking to British GQ, Hulst said he doesn&#39;t see Sony engaging in an &#34;arms race&#34; where both console-makers try to secure as many exclusive studios as possible. &#34;We&#39;re very selective about the developers that we bring in,&#34; he said. &#34;I&#39;m always looking for people that have a similar set of values, similar creative ambitions, and work very well with our team that we can further invest in and help grow as creators. It&#39;s not like we&#39;re going around and just making random acquisitions. They\u2019re very, very targeted acquisitions of teams that we know well.&#34;\n &#34;With the backing of [Sony] and its family of studios supporting us, we can truly grow into our place in the industry and show what Housemarque can create with no limitations,&#34; Kuittinen  wrote in a blog post announcing the acquisition. &#34;We can\u2019t wait to show everyone what will be in store in the upcoming years, and we hope to usher in more lasting memories and exhilarating titles for the next quarter century and beyond.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 00:54:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5f00\u53d1,\u8d2d\u4e70,purchases,\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4", "title": "\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7684PS5\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u7d22\u5c3c\u8d2d\u4e70\u4e86\u5f80\u8fd4\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u5ba4 ", "title_en": "Sony purchases Returnal developer Housemarque after successful PS5 debut", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/sony-purchases-returnal-developer-housemarque-after-successful-ps5-debut/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5f00\u53d1", "\u8d2d\u4e70", "purchases", "\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4"]}]
