%p%s%s%s%s%n&#39;, my iPhone permanently disabled it\u2019s WiFi functionality. Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~),&#34;  tweeted Schou.\n Schou told BleepingComputer that his experiment worked successfully on an iPhone XS, running iOS version\u00a014.4.2.\n Tests conducted by BleepingComputer on\u00a0an iPhone running iOS\u00a014.6 confirm an iPhone&#39;s wireless functionality would break after connecting to the strangely named wireless network.\n  In multiple tests attempting to connect to this strange SSID, our Wi-Fi settings would begin to function erratically, but all led to the same behavior - the breaking of our iPhone&#39;s wireless connectivity.\n In some tests, connecting to the SSID would fail, but we could no longer access\u00a0our regular\u00a0wireless network.\n Other tests led to the behavior described by\u00a0Schou, where the iPhones Wi-Fi setting would be disabled, and we could no longer enable it again, as shown below.\n  The only way to fix our iPhone&#39;s broken Wi-Fi feature was to reset the device&#39;s iPhone network settings, which we describe how to do at the end of the article.\n A bug like this is serious, considering\u00a0malicious actors could plant rogue WiFi hotspots (needing no password) in popular areas to bork\u00a0iPhone devices that connect to them.\n According to users, the issue is unique to iPhones and does not appear to be reproducible on Android devices:\n So I haven&#39;t done any homework on this bug / wouldn&#39;t even really know where to look but i&#39;m guessing this is just an ios bug?? Old ass android had no issue connecting to and saving it both open and with wpa2.  pic.twitter.com/ydegK7AR7x\n\u2014 MobCat (@MobCat99)  June 19, 2021\n  Other security researchers who saw Schou&#39;s tweet and analyzed the  crash report\u00a0believe that an input parsing issue likely causes this bug.\n When a string with &#34;%&#34; signs exists in WiFi hotspot names,\u00a0iOS may be mistakenly interpreting the letters following &#34;%&#34;\u00a0as\u00a0string-format specifiers when they are not.\n In C and C-style languages,  string format specifiers\u00a0have a special meaning and are\u00a0processed by the language compiler as a variable name or\u00a0a command rather than just text.\n For example, the following  printf\u00a0command does not actually print the &#34;%n&#34; character\u00a0but stores the number of characters (10) preceding %n into the variable &#34;c.&#34;\n The &#34;%n&#34; is merely a format specifier and not an actual text string. As such, the output of the following line will simply be\u00a0&#34;geeks for geeks,&#34; with no mention of &#34;%n.&#34;\n   Some users have  claimed previously inserting\u00a0the  relatively innocuous &#34;%x&#34; format specifiers in their WiFi SSID\u00a0to avoid causing major issues for unsuspecting WiFi users.\n When asked what was his motivation to name his WiFi hotspot with the funky string specifiers, the reverse engineer said:\n &#34;All my devices are named after format strings to f*** with poorly developed devices,&#34; Schou told BleepingComputer.\n  Although restarting your iPhone won&#39;t fix the issue, this bug is not permanent and can be fixed without resetting your entire device.\n Instead, you can follow these simple steps to reset your iOS network settings to resolve the issue:\n You will now be at the Reset screen, where you can reset various features of iOS or the device itself.\u00a0  \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAt this screen, select the &#39;Reset Network Settings&#39; option and confirm you would like to continue when asked.\n The device will now restart and reset all of your network settings back to factory default. Once it has restarted, enter your passcode, and you can reconfigure your Wi-Fi settings again.\n \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bBleepingComputer has reached out to Apple for comment before publishing, and we are awaiting their response.\n Update 20th Jun 11:13 AM: Linked to a researcher&#39;s analysis of the crash report\u00a0associated with this bug,\u00a0published after we first

", "note_en": "In the 1980s and 1990s a common piece of advice for people working in the professional managerial class was to \u2018dress for the job you want, not for the job you have.\u2019 Throughout these decades, folks dressed aspirationally\u2014a culture of power suits and padded shoulders. All this status-jockeying came at a high cost. Tailoring, dry cleaning, and the attendant rituals of maintaining everything to and from the office. Shoeshines, pressing services, taxi fees, and a general restriction of mobility.\n At the apotheosis of aspirational PMC office culture, Silicon Valley utopianism intervened. From the late 90s, a sort of casual revolution asserted itself. Billionaire tech CEOs wore cheap, comfortable and functional clothing, and the status hierarchy was undermined.\n Aspirational office attire persisted in conservative corners of the working world, as vestigial as barristers\u2019 wigs, but the mass-cultural sense was that we would heretofore be judged not by our clothing, but by our productive output.\n    2020 was the year of the great disruption. In a matter of days offices were abandoned, and work from home was entrenched.\n It took roughly a month before it started to happen. Senior execs across the tech industry, whether through a longstanding fascination with camera technology, or through access to AV support and personal assistants, emerged from the electronic ether with impeccable home studio setups.\n  Bill Gates faces off against a Bloomberg anchor in a traditional studio environment. The anchor\u2019s setup is acceptable but by no means impeccable. Her self-presentation is overawed by Gates\u2019 setup.\n  What\u2019s pernicious about this new organization: whereas the status of a double-breasted banker suit is transparently obvious, the technical arrangement that conspires to give an amazing streaming setup is altogether inscrutable to lay people.\n  1) Good lighting that can be precisely calibrated, both in brightness and in colour temperature\n     6) The technical expertise to understand how colour temperature, shutter speed, aperture, and ISO conspire together to form a beautiful picture.\n This line of reflection raises an adjacent question: how does fashion transition from the In Real Life domain to the virtual domain?\n  Fashion is equal parts Baudelaire\u2019s notion of the ephemeral, and a preoccupation of constructing identity and appearance in the domain of the social.\n When fashionistas enter the virtual social field of the screen, but waste all their efforts on their combination of garments within the space, my mind jumps immediately to the skeuomorphic designs of the early iPhone.\n    I want to see Gucci deliver a home studio build for their elite clients, that fully and completely \u2018guccifies\u2019 their space. Again, this is not reducible to the physical objects ordered in the visual field. It extends to the optics, to the lighting, maybe even the film grain of their digital feed, evoking 8mm film cameras, or anamorphic cinematograph.\n An elevated home studio will convincingly communicate that the subject is basking in a Kyoto bamboo forest. Lush projected backgrounds, ambient natural thrumming, organic shadow-cast.\n Put another way, fashion is mediated self-presentation. The domain of all possible self-presentations is infinite, and fashion exists in this arbitrary space, now playful, now historical, now futuristic, now mournful. Those who use their full field of expression to evoke these moods in a field of infinite possibility will be the determining forces of fashion.\n Of course a day will soon come when augmented and virtual realities will fully absorb these reflections, but that is not yet our world.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 18:55:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

Bloomberg and Elon Musk paid relatively little \u2014 and sometimes nothing \u2014 in federal income taxes between 2014 and 2018, according to an analysis from the news organization ProPublica that was based on a trove of IRS tax data.\n The analysis showed that the nation\u2019s richest executives paid just a fraction of their wealth in taxes \u2014 $13.6 billion in federal income taxes on $401 billion of their wealth, which was tabulated by Forbes.\n The documents reveal the stark inequity in the U.S. tax system, as plutocrats such as Bezos, Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and Musk were able to benefit from a complex web of loopholes in the tax code and the fact that the United States puts its emphasis on taxing labor income versus wealth. Much of the wealth that the rich accrue \u2014 like shares in companies they run, vacation homes, yachts and other investments \u2014 is not considered \u201ctaxable income\u201d unless those assets are sold and a gain is realized. Even then, there are loopholes in the tax code that can limit or erase all tax liability.\n The rare window into the tactics of the nation\u2019s top billionaires comes as  President Joe Biden is trying to overhaul the tax code so that corporations and the rich pay more. Biden has proposed raising the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, which would reverse the reduction ushered in by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts.\n But the documents and the conclusions of the analysis could renew calls for Biden to consider a wealth tax, given that a higher marginal tax rate would do little to raise the tax bills of the 25 richest Americans. From 2014 to 2018, the 25 wealthiest Americans paid an average of 15.8%, or $13.6 billion, in personal federal income taxes.\n Lawmakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have championed the idea of placing a 2% tax on an individual\u2019s net worth above $50 million \u2014 including the value of stocks, houses, boats and anything else a person owns, after subtracting any debts.\n Warren said on Twitter that the ProPublica report showed \u201cour tax system is rigged for billionaires who don\u2019t make their fortunes through income, like working families do.\u201d\n Biden and his advisers have deemed the idea of a wealth tax unworkable. Instead, he has sought $80 billion to beef up the IRS so it is better able to go after tax cheats. And he has proposed doubling the tax on capital gains \u2014 the proceeds of selling an asset like a stock or a boat \u2014 for people earning more than $1 million.\n   At a New York Times DealBook event in February, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that a wealth tax is \u201csomething that has very difficult implementation problems.\u201d She suggested that other changes that would increase taxes on wealth that is transferred at death could have a similar effect. In March, however, Yellen suggested that she remained open-minded about a wealth tax.\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d Yellen said on ABC News, before pointing to other tax ideas that would also impact the rich.\n ProPublica did not reveal how it obtained the information, and it could not be independently verified by The New York Times. But the publication said the documents were provided to the outlet \u201cin raw form, with no conditions or conclusions\u201d and that it had run the information past every executive whose information was included in the article.\n \u201cEvery person whose tax information is described in this story was asked to comment,\u201d ProPublica said, adding that those who responded \u201call said they had paid the taxes they owed.\u201d\n In a separate editors\u2019 note, the outlet said it was publishing the information \u201cquite selectively and carefully \u2014 because we believe it serves the public interest in fundamental ways, allowing readers to see patterns that were until now hidden.\u201d\n The report highlights the techniques that the wealthy often use to reduce their tax bills, including taking advantage of a complex web of loopholes and deductions that are perfectly legal and can significantly minimize tax liability. That includes borrowing huge sums of money backed by enormous stock holdings. Loans are not taxed and the interest that the executives pay on the borrowed money can be deducted from their tax bills.\n In 2007, Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, paid nothing in federal income taxes even as his company\u2019s stock price doubled. Four years later, as his wealth swelled to $18 billion, Bezos reported losses and received a tax credit of $4,000 for his children, according to ProPublica.\n  Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long said publicly that the tax code should hit the rich harder, paid just $23.7 million in taxes from 2014 to 2018, when his wealth rose by $24.3 billion.\n In 2018, Bloomberg, who controls the media giant Bloomberg LP, reported income of $1.9 billion and paid $70.7 million in income tax. According to the report, Bloomberg was able to reduce his tax bill through deductions, charitable donations and \u201ccredits for having paid foreign taxes.\u201d\n In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesman for Bloomberg said they would \u201cuse all legal means at our disposal to determine which individual or government entity leaked these and ensure that they are held responsible.\u201d\n  The Treasury Department said that the federal government is working to determine how the tax records got released.\n \u201cThe unauthorized disclosure of confidential government information is illegal,\u201d said Lily Adams, a Treasury spokeswoman. \u201cThe matter is being referred to the Office of the Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, all of whom have independent authority to investigate.\u201d\n  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing where he was testifying Tuesday, Charles Rettig, the IRS commissioner, said that he could not comment on the apparent breach at his agency but said that it was being scrutinized.\n \u201cI can confirm that there is an investigation with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d Rettig said. \u201cThe investigators will investigate.\u201d\n  Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chairman of the finance committee, told Rettig that he was concerned about the security of taxpayer data. He also emphasized that the disclosures made clear that the tax code needs to be rewritten.\n \u201cWhat this data reveals is that the country\u2019s wealthiest, who profited immensely during the pandemic, have not been paying their fair share,\u201d Wyden said, adding that he has proposals to fix that disparity.\n After the hearing, Wyden declined to offer specifics about his plan to address the issue, but emphasized his concern about unfairness in the tax code.\n \u201cThe people I represent are doing work, like treating COVID patients, they\u2019re paying taxes with every paycheck,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThe country\u2019s wealthiest, including during the pandemic, profited handsomely and then do not pay their fair share because they have figured out with good lawyers and accountants how to defer and delay and postpone and almost do it in perpetuity.\u201d\n Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the committee, said that the disclosures added to his concern about a Biden administration proposal to give the IRS more access to the financial information of taxpayers. He suggested that the agency could not be trusted to keep the data secure.\n The president said on Twitter on Tuesday that he was continuing to work with Republicans on infrastructure and jobs legislation and said that he would not seek a tax increase on anyone who earns less than $400,000.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s long past time the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share,\u201d Biden said.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 18:49:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,paid,\u7a0e\u6536", "title": "\u6700\u5bcc\u6709\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ad8\u7ba1\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5173\u6ce8 ", "title_en": "Wealthiest U.S. executives paid little to nothing in federal income taxes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2021/06/08/wealthiest-us-executives-paid-little-to-nothing-in-federal-income-taxes-report-says.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "paid", "\u7a0e\u6536"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f2552f957d62b30861903738d49ec3c0.jpg", "infoid": 1067176, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u521a\u521a\u4e5d\u5341\u5c81\uff0c\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u6211\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6d3b\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u4ed6\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e00\u822c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5c16\u9510\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u548c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u7a7a\u9699\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0e\u6211\u548c\u6211\u4e00\u8d77\u5206\u4eab\u4e86\u5947\u602a\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8f76\u4e8b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u5b66\u9662\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b14\u8bb0\uff1a\u4ed6\u7ad9\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u5c3c\u5c14\u65afBohr\u7684\u7535\u68af\u91cc\uff0c\u6bcf\u5f53\u4ed6\u6253\u5f00\u5634\u5df4\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u70df\u6597\u5c31\u4f1a\u5411\u5730\u677f\u4e0a\u6389\u5230\u5730\u677f\u4e0a;\u4ed6\u5728\u666e\u6797\u65af\u987f\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0coppenheimer\u4e32\u8d77\u4e86\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u6f14\u8bb2\u8005;\u5f53\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u666e\u6797\u65af\u987f\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u7b7e\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u672c\u4e66\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u552f\u4e00\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u624d\u80fd\u56de\u5bb6\u662fAlbert Einstein\uff0cJohn Von Neumann\u548cArnold Toynbee\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u7559\u90a3\u5f20\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\uff01\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n \u6545\u4e8b\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7b11\u58f0\u6563\u53d1\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u89c6\u955c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u662f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4fe9\u90fd\u5b89\u9759\u4e86\u3002\u8c08\u8bdd\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u626d\u8f6c\u5230\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u5b9a\u7406\u5177\u6709\u76ee\u653f\u6027\u7684\u6f14\u5458;\u4e00\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u9075\u5faa\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e09\u6708\u671d\u7740\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u751f\u6d3b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\u3002\u6211\u7236\u4eb2\u5728\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u548c\u4ed6\u4ece\u672a\u80fd\u9884\u671f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u60ca\u53f9\u3002\u5b9a\u7406\u662f\u5c06\u4ed6\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4ed6\u7528\u8bfa\u8d1d\u5c14\u00b7\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u63c9\u6413\u80a9\u8180\u3002\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5c0f\u5b9d\u77f3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ed6\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u6837\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u5b66\u662f\u5728\u4ed6\u751f\u547d\u4e2d\u8ba2\u8d2d\u7684\u95e8\u6237\u3002\n \u201c\u5230\u6240\u6709\u8ba2\u5355\uff01\u201d\u6211\u7238\u7238\u8fd8\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6761\u6b3e - \u751a\u81f3\u9ed8\u91ccgell-mann\uff01 - \u4f46\u6211\u505a\u5230\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u8ba2\u5355\uff01\u201d\u4ed6\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u505a\u5230\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u9996\u5148\u505a\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4ed6\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u3002\n    \u6ce8\u518c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4eba\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6545\u4e8b\u3002 ", "note_en": "The Rockmore theorem made its first\u2014and perhaps only\u2014named appearance in print in 1977, in the journal  Physics Letters, Volume 72B, No. 4. A photocopy of the journal page hung on my father\u2019s office door, at Rutgers University, in New Jersey. The author of the article\u2014one B. L. Birbrair, of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.\u2014wrote that, in 1959, my dad had demonstrated that the \u201cinteraction between quasiparticles exactly compensates\u201d for \u201cthe difference between the effective and real mass\u201d of an \u201cinfinite non-superfluid fermi system.\u201d Since then, he went on, \u201cthe statement  J(\u0394 = 0) =  J rig\u201d has been known as \u201cthe Rockmore theorem.\u201d\n My dad had underlined those last three words in bold, black pen. Other professors on the same hallway displayed conference posters on their doors, in which they were featured as keynote speakers in exotic locales. My dad couldn\u2019t produce such a poster, but the photocopy, which hung amid  New Yorker cartoons, preprints, and departmental announcements, showed something arguably more valuable.\n Theorems are mathematical facts justified by proofs\u2014logical, airtight arguments made of other facts and deductions. Usually, a proof consists of statements taking the form \u201cif this, then that\u201d; this chain of \u201cifs\u201d is grounded in bedrock mathematical truths. In high-school geometry, you probably saw some simple proofs\u2014two-column accounting ledgers, with statements on one side and justifications on the other. Many proofs by professional mathematicians are baroque in comparison; they contain twists, turns, and surprise appearances, with intermediate steps, known as propositions, claims, or \u201clemmas,\u201d that require proofs of their own. A theorem is only published if it\u2019s been deemed interesting by journal editors and successfully \u201crefereed\u201d by external evaluators. Mathematicians prove thousands each year, but of the many published theorems only a few are named.\n The eponymous theorems are the most famous, but are they rightly named? There\u2019s Pythagoras\u2019 well-known beauty, a fact about the three sides of a right triangle: the sum of the squared lengths of its two shorter sides equals the squared length of its hypotenuse ( a 2 +  b 2 =  c 2). A proof for the Pythagorean Theorem can be found among Euclid\u2019s \u201cElements,\u201d the thirteen-volume treatise on geometry that many see as an exemplar of Greek mathematics. The Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero connected the theorem to Pythagoras some five centuries after his death, though the attribution is hardly a slam dunk. Part of the beauty of Pythagoras\u2019 theorem is that it admits revelation through a broad range of proofs. So far, there have been more than a hundred. Even Albert Einstein  set one down. It seems likely that some other early geometer could have been the first.\n You may have also heard of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. It\u2019s a fact about other kinds of numerical \u201ctriples\u201d: it says that, if you make a small change to the Pythagorean equation, and replace the exponents with larger whole numbers, then there are no solutions where  a,  b, and  c are all whole numbers. \u201cIt is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, a fourth power into two fourth powers,\u201d the mathematician Pierre de Fermat explained, around 1635. Fermat, a jurist by day and a mathematician during his off-hours\u2014the mathematician and writer E. T. Bell called him the \u201cPrince of the Amateurs\u201d\u2014put down his theorem in the margin of a book, and added that he had \u201cdiscovered a truly marvellous demonstration\u201d of it, \u201cwhich this margin is too narrow to contain.\u201d He never explained himself elsewhere. It was arguably the most famous mathematical cliffhanger of all time.\n Fermat was a genius, and for years we mathematicians gave him the benefit of the doubt. But his theorem\u2019s proximity to the readily proved Pythagorean theorem, and the mathematicians\u2019 credo of \u201ctruth means proof,\u201d meant that its lack of resolution couldn\u2019t be ignored. Over the centuries, the failed proofs accumulated, and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem became the mathematician\u2019s version of \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d The techniques developed to attempt its proof grew in scope and ingenuity, becoming a body of thought far beyond anything Fermat could have imagined.\n  Finally, in the mid-nineteen-eighties, progress on various aspects of algebraic geometry suggested a way forward to the mathematician Andrew Wiles. He devoted roughly seven years to proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. When he was pretty sure that he had a proof, he brought in a few close mathematician friends for some sanity checks, and rumors began to spread that he would soon make a historic announcement. During a lecture on June 23, 1993, before a standing-room-only audience, Wiles proved Fermat. Or did he? Whereas some proofs of the Pythagorean theorem can be understood by those with little or even no mathematical background, the adjudication of Wiles\u2019s proof required the convening of a group of absolute experts\u2014a Supreme Court of mathematics. A painstaking refereeing process revealed some holes in the proof, and Wiles went back to the blackboard, this time with the help of a friend and colleague, Richard Taylor. Together, they plugged the holes, making Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem into a real theorem. Three and a half centuries had passed. In a sense, the theorem was no longer Fermat\u2019s.\n Even the Rockmore theorem is subtly misnamed. My father\u2019s original family name was Rochmovich, or Rochemovitz, or one of any number of variations on that theme\u2014it depended on who was writing the name on a form, beginning with the clerk who processed my great-grandfather through Ellis Island, in 1881, when the name was Rochomovyitz, or possibly Rochomowitz. According to my father, my great-grandfather came from Ukraine. He might have been fleeing conscription or the frequent pogroms for which the region became well known. In 1908, the name became Rockmore\u2014at some point, I was told that it was chosen for its \u201cstrong American sound.\u201d The page that records the change in the records of the New York State Legislature is littered with a host of similar transformations, marking the first stages of American assimilation for many Jewish families.\n  Origins, whether of family names or ancient Greek theorems, can be tricky to uncover. Although the many variations on Rochomovich share a derivation from the Yiddish word for compassion (\u201c rachmones\u201d), Rockmore is culturally hard to place. (My father has never forgotten the department chair who told him, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you were Jewish when we hired you.\u201d) Rockmore is an uncommon name, and family lore has it, semi-ironically, that all Rockmores are related. I know for a fact that I\u2019m related to the painter Gladys Rockmore Davis and her painter son, Noel Rockmore, famous for his portraits of the Preservation Hall jazz greats; there are more distant connections to the theremin virtuoso Clara Rockmore, and to a war hero or two. Once, checking into a hotel, I shared a laugh with the African-American woman behind the desk, also a Rockmore, as we tried to find a common ancestor in one of my family\u2019s thoroughly assimilated Christian branches. But, in truth, I don\u2019t know much of my family tree; my father\u2019s father was one of at least twelve children, but there was a big family rift long ago, and my father\u2019s side has always seemed to begin and end with his parents and brother, now all gone.\n  My father\u2019s father was always moving from job to job, either flush or deep in the hole. For a while, the family lived in Oceanside, on the South Shore of Long Island, where my dad, a bookish kid, could nurture his interests in birds and stars. In 1925, ten thousand members of the Ku Klux Klan had rallied in Oceanside; in 1940, partly because of anti-Semitism, the family moved back to Brooklyn, where my grandmother worked as a bookkeeper in her brother\u2019s mirror-making business. My father spent two years at the yeshiva next door and two years in high school, and then won the New York City Latin competition. His \u201cplan,\u201d according to the caption of his high-school yearbook, was to go to Columbia University. He applied, and my grandmother told him that she had learned, from an admissions officer, that his application had been among those diverted owing to \u201cregional quotas\u201d\u2014systems used by Ivy League institutions to limit the number of Jewish students. He never did see the rejection letter; it may have just been the money.\n He attended Brooklyn College, majoring in mathematics and commuting by subway while living at home. After graduation, he was accepted to Columbia\u2019s doctoral program in physics. He started graduate school a little after the Second World War, during a golden age of research built on the momentum of the Manhattan Project. A steady succession of discoveries in quantum mechanics seemed to be moving relentlessly toward a grand unified theory; experimental physics was diving ever deeper into the atom to reveal a wild jungle of subatomic particles, whose interactions required models of ever-greater precision and sophistication. A small stipend as a teaching assistant supported him, and from time to time allowed him to send some money downtown to his parents and brother. (Their finances and support would always be a concern.) He took classes with the Nobel laureate I. I. Rabi, and his thesis adviser was Robert Serber, Oppenheimer\u2019s right-hand man on the Manhattan Project. From Ukraine to Columbia, an unlikely career as a scientist was emerging.\n The work that would become the Rockmore theorem was contained in a paper that my dad published a few years after he graduated. The theorem settles a conjecture about a version of a \u201cmany-body problem\u201d\u2014a scenario in which many things orbit one another in an intricate, hard-to-predict dance. In this case, the bodies are subatomic particles called fermions. It had been conjectured that, under certain conditions, when you accounted for all of the particles\u2019 mutual pushes and pulls, the total inertia of the system\u2014that is, its over-all tendency to continue to whirl about\u2014would add up to zero. \u201cVanishing to all orders,\u201d is how we say it. My father was able to reveal a previously unseen symmetry which manifested itself in a perfect accounting of contributions and withdrawals from the system\u2019s inertial bookkeeping. It\u2019s a dense piece of work, somewhere in the middle of the range of complexity bookended by the Pythagorean theorem on one side and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem on the other; its six pages are mainly equations, with a little bit of interpolative and explanatory text.\n  For me, the symbols are mathematical madeleines. They remind me of the pads of paper that were scattered around our house, each full of my father\u2019s scribblings\u2014his version of the sandpiper tracks that had delighted him as a child. When I was a child myself, I would watch him on the couch, deep in thought, scratching away with a mechanical pencil. At some point, I thought that I might like to have a life like that.\n My dad loved his result, and the Rockmore theorem turned out to be a ticket to a tenured university position. He had job security in a profession he liked and could support his own small family and help his parents and brother, but he never felt that he received the notice he deserved. He didn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t on those posters. I only learned this later. From my perspective, he\u2014and we\u2014had it all. He could spend all day trying to figure out how the world worked, writing beautiful equations; summers were generally spent travelling to conferences and visiting collaborators in wonderful places. But when my father retired, at seventy, that was the end of physics for him. I was shocked. How could he have devoted more than five decades to trying to understand the workings of the subatomic world and then quit cold turkey? But enough was enough. There was music to listen to, and an interest in painting and drawing to indulge. Clara, Gladys, and Noel were calling.\n Today, he is just past ninety, and lives in an assisted-living facility near me. His memory of the past is generally still sharp, with gaps here and there. He shares with me the odd career anecdote as we compare notes from the academy: the time he stood in an elevator with Niels Bohr, whose pipe dropped to the floor every time he opened his mouth to speak; the seminar he attended at Princeton where Oppenheimer skewered the young speaker; the day he checked out a book on Egyptology from the library at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, and discovered that the only other people to ever take it home had been Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, and Arnold Toynbee. \u201cI should have kept that library card!\u201d he said.\n The stories flow freely, hopscotching over time and space and speckled with laughter. But there are also moments of reflection, when my father is looking deeply into the rearview mirror, trying to make sense of how it\u2019s all come to this point. We both get quiet then. Conversation can often wind back to the theorem. A theorem has a teleological cast; one idea follows another, in a steady march toward a concise conclusion. A life isn\u2019t necessarily like that. My dad still marvels at a career and a life that he never could have anticipated. The theorem was the lever that catapulted him from those early and complicated days in Crown Heights to a middle-class life, in which he rubbed shoulders with Nobel laureates. I like to think that, in this perfect little gem of a result, he found some of the order in chaos that he was looking for on a human scale. His life was hardly as orderly as math, but math was a gateway to order in his life.\n \u201cTo all orders!\u201d my dad still says. \u201cOthers computed a few terms\u2014even Murray Gell-Mann!\u2014but I did it to all orders!\u201d He\u2019s right. He did. And he did it first, and there\u2019s a theorem with his name on it to prove it.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-21

of this article is to introduce you to the top 5 serverless AWS services which I think every tech-founder or Indie Hacker should know. This is not a deep dive on these services and I want to explain them in a high level fashion and tell you why they are worth using and learning. With these services you are able to build almost every web- and mobile application you can think of. Almost all high level programming languages such as Python, TypeScript, JavaScript and Java can be used with these services. So, let\u2019s jump straight in.\n   I   start with the obvious one, Amplify. Important to note is, that there are two (almost three) \u201cservices\u201d called Amplify within AWS. We have to distinguish between:\n  We talk about  Amplify CLI here. With the Amplify CLI you are able to bootstrap your backend with a few commands within the Command Line Interface. Amplify has several categories you can add, for example these are:\n  With a few commands you are able to build fullstack applications with a guided CLI.\n The  main benefit in my eyes is the  graphql-tranform library. This library enables you to create your data schema with custom annotations like  model or  connection and the library transforms this schema to a valid GraphQL schema and at the same time creates CloudFormation templates for creating your backend resources such as DynamoDB tables, Cognito connections, etc.\n   It creates the type Holding. The  model annotation creates a table in DynamoDB with id as the primary key.  currentPrice will be resolved by the lambda function  priceResolver.\n The  main drawback in my eyes is that you are not as flexible as with building up your infrastructure with a typical IaC solution like CDK or Terraform. Since a lot of magic is happening with Amplify you will likely run into some issues, especially when you are working with several team environments and lambda layers.\n Nevertheless, it is a great tool, it has a great community and the team is still developing the services further. The backend of  deposur was completely bootstrapped with Amplify. If you want to learn one service, learn this one!\n   This brings us to the next service, AppSync. AppSync is a fully managed GraphQL API by AWS. GraphQL enables you as a developer to get exactly the data you need without worrying about fetching too much or too less data overfetching &amp; underfetching). In general you have three main functions within AppSync. These are  Queries, Mutations and  Subscriptions.\n With  Queries you can query data from different data sources. That means that you can have a type  Holding for example which gets data from different sources. Lets take our example schema again:\n  The attribute  ISIN   is a string which comes from DynamoDB, the  currentPrice gets resolved by a Lambda function called  priceResolver. Lambda resolvers give you the main flexibility here. In the lambda function you can have as much customised code as you need (request two different APIs, clean &amp; preprocess data, \u2026) and respond with exactly this data you need in your application. It doesn\u2019t matter where your data lives, AppSync gives you the opportunity of resolving it under one hood for the application. This is a great deal of flexibility.\n     With  Mutations you can change your data and update it.  Subscriptions give you the ability to live update your data.\n  Why should you learn AppSync as a founder? First of all you get the main benefit of using GraphQL which is working with type safety and giving the frontend developer the power of requesting exactly the data it needs. Secondly, you have so much flexibility by connecting every data source you need. Third, you let AWS doing most of the work. You have one single endpoint and no hassle with parsing requests and connecting different AWS services together. It will reduce your development time immensely.\n   Now let\u2019s go back to the roots, Lambda. Lambda is the most common known serverless service. When people talk about serverless many people just refer to lambda. The basic idea behind the lambda service is to run your code without ever thinking about infrastructure. AWS\u2019s promise is just that your code will be executed. Lambda supports several runtimes such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Rust, Go and many more. One of the latest features is that custom docker containers can be used as a runtime and that pricing happens every millisecond instead of every 100 ms. The maximum runtime of lambda is 15 minutes, take that into consideration when building your application. The only infrastructure setting is the memory setting.\n Pricing: Lambda is  cheap. The first million requests per month are free. From that point on it will be calculated based on the minutes the lambda runs.\n  Always increase memory to about 4 GB, the faster it runs the cheaper it is. There is a great  library to test this assumption\n Declare all your static variables such as DynamoDb from boto3 outside of your handler function -&gt; Decreases cold starts\n Keep cold starts in mind when designing your application. If you need certain response times pre-heat your lambda or  provision concurrency before.\n  Lambda gives you the ability of executing code without ever worrying about infrastructure. The pricing is really awesome. Your whole application can be based on Lambda. It depends on the use case and the overall architecture (go event-driven!) but most of the applications I know can be easily adopted to several lambda functions. You just pay on-demand, you have small development cycles and the deployment is way easier.\n   Let\u2019s look at Authentication. Cognito is AWS\u2019s service for authentication and authorisation. You can use it for Sign-Up and Sign-In purposes, fine granular user group control and even federated logins such as Facebook, Google &amp; Apple Login. If you start your SaaS business you really want to give users a seamless authentication experience and offer social logins. This is easily possible with Cognito. Cognito differentiates  User Pools &amp; Identity Pools.\n  Identity Pools: Identity pools are for creating unique identities for users and giving them access to other AWS services. This is needed for example for generating temporary credentials for anonymous users.\n   Why? Give your users the seamless authentication experience they deserve. With Cognito you are able to do that at any scale. You can customise your Sign-Up and Sign-In pages however you want or you can even use pre-built ones by AWS. With federated logins you are able to offer on-click logins.\n   The last service I want to introduce is DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database which is highly scalable and highly available. I build almost every use case and project now with DynamoDB and I am a huge fan of it.\n  Streams: You can have streams for triggering something (e.g. a lambda function) on every update on a table\n DynamoDB is basically a key, value database where you can store different datatypes as a value. A value can also be a nested list or nested list of objects (like JSON). A DynamoDB Item looks like that:\n  The key is the column name (ISIN) and the value is the data type (S: String) with the actual value. The item can also be shown with a typical JSON syntax:\n   DynamoDB has some great features for increasing the performance even more such as Global Tables, DynamoDB Accelerator, Point-In-Time recovery and many more. When designing DynamoDB tables it is always important to keep you access patterns in mind. Rick is doing a wonderful job explaining DynamoDB strategies in this  video.\n Pricing: Pricing is based on reading, writing and storing data. Again, if you just start out your SaaS product the price is so low that it won\u2019t cost you a Dollar. If you have a predictable amount of read and write requests you can even use provisioned capacity which is even cheaper.\n  Thats it! These are the services you should consider when building your application. All of these services have the great benefit of developing your application in a cloud-native way. These are:\n Risk-Free. If nobody uses your app you won\u2019t be charged. That minimises your risk immensely.\n  Secure. You won\u2019t secure your servers and applications as good as AWS engineers do. Concentrate on your business logic and let the boring stuff AWS do.\n  This was a high level overview of course and was not intended as a deep dive for the single services or to be complete. There are many more great services AWS offers.
