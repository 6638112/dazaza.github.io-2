First published in 1843, the story recounts a heinous act \u2014 murdering a housemate and stuffing his body beneath the floorboards \u2014 and the narrator\u2019s attempt to rationalize it after the fact. While the crime takes up most of the story, the drama lies elsewhere: in the mind of the narrator, as he strains to make sense of the senseless thing he\u2019s done. Poe\u2019s style, all em dashes and italics, is the dark mirror of the agony it portrays: pulled apart by anxiety, the narrator\u2019s mind ultimately comes undone in the story\u2019s final line. Mistaking the hammer of his own heart for that of the dead man, he breaks down the wall between his inner monologue and the outside world: \u201c[T]ear up the planks! here, here! \u2014 it is the beating of his hideous heart!\u201d\n But what tale does the heart tell? On the surface, Poe\u2019s story is about the unbearable nature of guilt, his narrator a precursor to Raskolnikov cowering in his flat or Stephen Dedalus sweating in church. The thumping of the titular organ has become a shorthand for criminal conscience, for what happens when we can\u2019t let certain things slide. But beneath the crime and cover-up is an account of thinking in general, of how mind and matter flow into one another in ways we can\u2019t control. The murder plot, which seems to come from somewhere else (\u201cIt is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain\u201d), sharpens the narrator\u2019s senses and steadies his hand. But guilt is something physical, too: ringing in his ears, beating through his feet. Poe not only makes us  feel the tortured dissembling he describes, but he also seems to insist that thinking is feeling: minds are always battling to keep the passions in check lest they burst forth in catastrophic ways. The heart, in other words, tells a tale of the mind \u2014 and what happens when it is pushed to the limit.\n Embodied cognition, as dramatized in \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d is a way of accounting for such limits and the terror we feel when confronting them. Poe would know: his life story could be told in much the same way, a pendulum that swung erratically from ambition to addiction over his short 40 years. He poured his struggles onto the page \u2014 sometimes consciously, sometimes less so \u2014 and the result is a body of work that is still among the best known in American letters. What tortured him in the material world seems to have fed his imagination; he turned his confrontations with life\u2019s limits (including the horror of death) into a canon of literature that toed the line between madness and method. His own mind, like that of the narrator in \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d was always on the move, racing between ellipses and exclamation points as he tried to make sense of the world around him and pull it all together. That effort, a grand cosmology, was his final unfinished project, but the dark pieces Poe produced along the way may have proved that any grand project was doomed, if not to failure, then to feeling \u2014 ultimately \u2014 incomplete.\n  The horrors Poe conjured were in many ways his own. The macabre poems and short stories for which he is known are only a part of Poe\u2019s tale, though they are more familiar to readers today than the intellectual and cultural terrain across which he ranged widely (and darkly) in his short life. At turns a well-regarded author and a much-maligned editor, a critic so sharp he made more enemies than friends, Poe was one of the first Americans to make a living by letters alone. It wasn\u2019t much of a living, to be sure, stalked as he was by financial hardship that propelled him from one venture to another. But the circumstances that made Poe\u2019s life so hard to  live help explain why it still captivates us. He was an inventor \u2014 of genres, of moods \u2014 and insofar as necessity is the mother of invention, understanding Poe\u2019s struggles becomes crucial to understanding his written work.\n This is the central insight of  The Reason for the Darkness of the Night: Edgar Allan Poe and the Forging of American Science, a splendid new biography by the historian John Tresch. Poe\u2019s manic omnivory, his intellectual passions and professional struggles, is the heart of the book, helping Tresch show that what we now call science emerged alongside (and often through) practices we deem mystical, if not misguided. For Tresch, Poe\u2019s zigzagging trajectory from astronomy to the occult and back again is proof less of science\u2019s strange bedfellows and more of a tragic narrowing in what it means to be scientific. Poe\u2019s stories, on this view, do more than mirror the science and technology of his day. Literature and science were densely entangled, pursued in tandem by boundary-crossers like Poe and his followers. \u201cEven while exploring the outer limits of imagination and irrationality,\u201d Tresch writes, Poe \u201cwould continue to ask how a poet might love science and how deem it wise.\u201d Flights of fancy, or even folly, were not antithetical to science; they were often its driving force.\n Tresch is eager to restore Poe to his rightful place in this tangled history. The book \u201creturns Poe\u2019s cosmology to its place at the summit of his life and thought, showing his work as a singular expression of the tumultuous ideas and passions of his age, thoroughly bound up with the emergence of modern science.\u201d From childhood as an orphan to his death 40 years later, Poe\u2019s tragic life furnishes both a narrative arc and a who\u2019s-who of the literary and scientific establishment in the antebellum United States. Weaving private letters and published works into a broader history, Tresch uses Poe as a drunken Virgil, through whose hazy eyes we catch glimpses of abolitionism and the Mexican-American War, new technologies and the Second Great Awakening. The effect is dizzying \u2014 and part of the point. Presidential elections are on par with editorial spats, hoaxes sit side by side with discoveries. In Poe\u2019s mind (if not Tresch\u2019s), boundaries \u2014 between self and other, science and society, poetry and politics \u2014 tend to shimmer, even dissipate. It\u2019s not just that Poe was an outsider (though he was); even the insiders experienced the Jacksonian period as one of dissolution. But Poe seems to have felt the era\u2019s ups and downs more acutely than almost anyone.\n  Money issues weren\u2019t Poe\u2019s only plague. Mental health, and particularly addiction, troubled him from a young age. What we now call alcoholism (or, per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d) haunts the pages of Tresch\u2019s biography, appearing either to foil Poe\u2019s plans or to drown his sorrows when they failed for other reasons. The lexicon of addiction was different then, and descriptions by both Poe and his contemporaries are at once strange and familiar. His \u201chope of relieving a nervous attack\u201d reads like the kind of self-medication we still see so often, while later struggles with \u201cthe Fiend of Intemperance\u201d are signs of a Victorian vernacular. Drinking led to gambling, exacerbating financial stress and trapping Poe in a vicious cycle he broke only occasionally. \u201cI became insane,\u201d Poe wrote near the end, \u201cwith long intervals of horrible sanity. During these fits of absolute unconsciousness I drank, God only knows how often or how much.\u201d If Poe\u2019s life and texts are the train tracks of his biography, then alcohol is its third rail, a power that was ever-present \u2014 and frequently devastating.\n Problems like Poe\u2019s were thought of less as dependence or disease than they are today, and more as a war against an external threat. The reason the temperance activist Carrie Nation smashed all those saloons later in the century was the terrifying power of alcohol itself; breaking bottles was supposed to release men from a spell. Intangible forces were being invoked everywhere: from anti-alcohol crusades and Christian revivalism to mesmeric performances and theories of luminiferous ether. The self, it seemed, was buffeted by hidden energies \u2014 some dark, some divine. Poe\u2019s personal struggles were reflected in much of his writing, in pieces that tested the limits of prosody and plot or tugged at the boundaries of literature and science. His own ordeals became those of his characters. Poe drank, wrote a friend, \u201c[t]o calm &amp; quiet the excessive nervous excitability under which he labored\u201d on \u201cThe Raven,\u201d \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart,\u201d and lesser-known pieces like \u201cSonnet \u2014 To Science\u201d or (Tresch\u2019s favorite)  Eureka: An Essay on the Material and Spiritual Universe. Taken together, these form a cosmology, a poetics of limitation through which Poe strained the bounds of meter and materialism. The habits he hated in the real world haunted the worlds he imagined, too.\n It\u2019s hard not to read Poe in light of his all-too-human limits. Tresch does so occasionally, suggesting for example that Poe\u2019s raven might have been \u201cthe embodiment of guilt and shame, the return of the repressed, whether individual or national.\u201d His reading of \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d as a perverse \u201cscientific experiment\u201d that \u201cdramatized the dark side of the Enlightenment\u201d is a compelling one, though its central unraveling will be just as familiar to anyone who has struggled with the temptations that tormented Poe. After all, the genre Poe is famous for inventing \u2014 detective fiction \u2014 makes science seem like obsession, spinning method and meaning out of the smallest of clues. Characters from Sherlock Holmes (partly based on Poe\u2019s Auguste Dupin) to Dr. Gregory House fueled deduction with drug abuse, testing the limits of the brain and the liver at once. While Poe\u2019s Dupin is not (obviously) a victim of such habits, he \u201centers into the mind of his opponent\u201d via a method that troubles the limits of the self in related ways. In Poe\u2019s published work and private life, the self is less sovereign, less stable than it seems. Minds flicker, fracture, or fade out.\n  Tresch\u2019s title is a reference to limits of another sort. It stems from an astronomical puzzle on the minds of many in Poe\u2019s day: if space is infinite, as the Newtonians believed, then why is the night sky not completely illuminated with starlight? After all, in an infinite universe, each spot in the sky should be filled with a star more or less distant from the point of observation. In  Eureka, the last lecture Poe gave and the text with which Tresch begins and ends his biography, Poe proposed a solution: the universe has limits, both spatial and temporal. Poe\u2019s cosmology leaned on limitation as a necessary framework for life\u2019s meaning. Everything that exists, every atom and poem alike, was a consequence of this fundamental finitude; each embodied a balancing act of attraction and repulsion through which the larger drama of spiritual unity unfolded. If this strikes you as confusing \u2014 you are not alone. Tresch, a fan, describes  Eureka as \u201cpunishingly digressive and lopsided\u201d \u2014 much like the cosmology it described. Intentional or not, this affinity between style and substance was classic Poe: brilliant but alienating, revealingly of its moment and frustratingly ahead of its time.\n Eureka embodied its own argument, its style stretched thin in mirroring how an infinite soul expands into a finite universe. And Tresch\u2019s biography does something similar. It is a tall task to layer so many histories \u2014 political, cultural, literary, scientific \u2014 onto the life of a single individual, even one so idiosyncratic as Poe. At times, Tresch pushes past where Poe can lead. Alexander Dallas Bache, one of the forgers of American science, features heavily for someone Poe never met. The same goes for P. T. Barnum, a \u201cforger\u201d in quite another sense, though Poe did engage with him briefly in print. Tresch is reaching here, but for a reason: Bache and Barnum are poles at the ends of a spectrum, along which Poe raced back and forth. \u201cPoe\u2019s strategies,\u201d Tresch argues, \u201cwere at times those of Bache, at times those of Barnum. Pushed by poverty and the threat of starvation, he constantly shifted his positions; in his writings the pursuit of truth was accompanied by the play of glitter and shadow.\u201d Poe was pushed by necessity not just to invent but also to imitate, to take conventions \u2014 whether social or literary \u2014 and see how far he could run with them.\n After all, conventions are another kind of limit. It\u2019s no accident that Poe is remembered best for his contributions to some of our most codified genres: mystery and horror, detective stories and science fiction \u2014 to say nothing of scientific papers themselves, more hidebound than anything else. Those who live and breathe in the world of such genres \u2014 as authors or readers, fans or scholars \u2014 tend to see their limits as a form of freedom, a foundation for the wildest fantasy and speculation that guards against the full collapse of meaning. Biography does something similar: knowing roughly where we\u2019ll start and stop, authors can give us many worlds at once. Poe embodies this perfectly: we peel back the layers on one man\u2019s life, and we find everything from personal trauma to cosmological drama. Yes, Poe is a special subject. His mind expands outward, capturing a sense of the infinite in a finite space (like the utopian technologies and cosmograms Tresch analyzes elsewhere). But taking biography as a starting point rather than an end in itself, we find a lesson we share with Poe: that the only thing scarier than a sense of our limits is the fiction that we can somehow transcend them.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:23:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u65f6\u95f4,sanity,warning", "title": "\u53ef\u6015\u7684\u7406\u667a\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u57c3\u5fb7\u52a0\u00b7\u827e\u4f26Poe ", "title_en": "Horrible Sanity: An Edgar Allan Poe for Our Time", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/horrible-sanity-an-edgar-allan-poe-for-our-time/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u65f6\u95f4", "sanity", "warning"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0d50ec486946000a5a307b1cd6c9803f.jpg", "infoid": 1067806, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6444\u5f71\u5e08\u57fa\u7763\u5f92K.\u674e\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bb6Paquita Wiggins\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u8f6c\u79fb\u975e\u6d32\u88d4\u7f8e\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u5408\u6cd5\u67aa\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u53d9\u8ff0\n          \u62c6\u9664\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u9ed1\u67aa\u6240\u6709\u6743\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u662f\u4e24\u4e2a\u65e5\u5e38\u516c\u6c11\u7684\u4f7f\u547d\uff1a\u57fa\u7763\u5f92K.

", "note_en": "How photographer Christian K. Lee and activist Paquita Wiggins are working to shift the narrative on legal gun ownership among African Americans\n          Dismantling the stereotypes connected to Black gun ownership in this country is the mission of two everyday citizens:\u00a0Christian K. Lee, a photojournalist based in Austin, Texas and Paquita Wiggins, an LGBTQ activist residing in our nation&#39;s capital. Both believe there is a misconception that lies at the heart of gun ownership in the Black community. Lee and Wiggins are working to change outdated notions they say deem being Black and armed as dangerous, threatening, and antithetical to what it means to be a law-abiding citizen in the United States.\n    Wiggins and Lee are just two out of the many who want to change misconceptions about gun ownership in the Black community and put forth a positive narrative about Black America\u2019s right to bear arms.\u00a0 With law enforcement mistrust\u00a0and\u00a0 crime at an all-time high, according to Pew Research, these two myth busters see gun ownership as a means to create safe and thriving communities, as well as protect Black households and neighborhoods.\n    As a gun owner and award-winning photojournalist, with features in Rolling Stone, Buzzfeed, ABC News, National Geographic and the Washington Post Magazine, Lee has been laser-focused on creating positive imagery on Black people and guns. &#34;My work is not about me, it&#39;s about others and I utilize my camera as a tool to learn about people from all over,&#34; said Lee.\n    In a recent project, entitled \u201c Armed Doesn&#39;t Mean Dangerous,\u201d Lee photographs Black Americans with their firearms to dispel a longstanding myth about danger connected to Black Americans and their Second Amendment right to possess a firearm.\n    &#34;My subjects feel their lives might be threatened or put at risk because they have grown up without proper gun education,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Those who I photograph feel deeply that there is a new need to educate themselves and their families. Seeing the new rise of protest by far-right groups as a sign that they remain behind, these citizen have a learning curve when it comes to gun education and exercising their Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n  The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearm industry&#39;s trade association, found that 40 percent of 2020&#39;s gun sales were to first-time buyers and that purchases by\u00a0 Black Americans skyrocketed by 56 percent, more than any other race.\n  According to Lee, many of the subjects he photographs are homeowners, professionals and members of the middle class, designations that have allowed them to escape much of the stigma attached to Black gun ownership in America.\n  &#34;What I found ironic is how people perceive African-American gun owners in my project,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI often wonder if their perceptions would change if my subjects lived in different ZIP codes or were photographed in attire that is stereotypically connected with violence, would that type of imagery infringe upon their access to the 2nd Amendment?&#34;\n  This open question is what has made gun ownership in the Black community so polarizing.\n  &#34;As a Chicago native, the reason why most Black folks don&#39;t want to be gun owners isn&#39;t because they are scared of guns themselves, but it is because much of the trauma in their communities are connected to guns. Whether it be the gun violence at the hands of a citizen or a police involved shooting, guns always seem to be the center piece,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Just look at the case of Breonna Taylor, she was found dead in home after a firearm was legally used to protect her and her family. This weird dynamic has casted a grave shadow on gun ownership for the Black community.&#34;\n  This is a shadow that LGBTQ activist, Second Amendment supporter and Black lesbian Paquita Wiggins is working to break down in the Black LGBTQ community. As a trained licensed architect and small business owner, Wiggins has started her own Black gay, lesbian, and transgendered gun club and become a leading voice in the fight for more Black LGBTQ gun ownership as a means of protection. &#34;One of the biggest misnomers about the Black Second Amendment community is that we are somehow ignorant and unprofessional \u2014 and this is far from the truth,&#34; said Wiggins.\n  &#34;The Black LGBTQ community has always been progressive, on both Black and LGBTQ issues. And while we have seen a lot of positive progress in policy change for the LGBTQ community, we have not seen those changes take root for the Black community, which we are also a part of,&#34; Wiggins added. &#34;This lack of change has caused gun interest and ownership in the Black LGBTQ community to grow. Owning firearms allows us to protect ourselves and our families from potential police violence and the rise in White Supremacy.&#34;\n  Wiggins was also quick to call out the National Rifle Association (NRA) and other pro-gun groups for their lack of advocacy among Black gun owners and their active participation in making gun ownership harder for Black Americans throughout history.\n  Citing California&#39;s 1967 Mulford Act, an NRA-supported state bill prohibiting the open carry of loaded firearms, as an affront to the Black Panthers\u2019 calls for more Black gun-ownership, Wiggins said, &#34;For a long time in this country, gun laws and regulations revolved around removing guns from the hands and home of Black people.&#34;\n  The Black community is the fastest growing gun-owning demographic in the United States.\u00a0Driven by the dueling pandemics of COVID-19 and racial injustice, as well as a history of fighting for rights and freedoms against all odds, Black gun ownership has seen an increase that mirrors American culture&#39;s changing landscape.\n  &#34;As Black ownership continues to increase, we should be working to educate, inform, and empower those who want to be legal firearms owners,&#34; said Wiggins. &#34;A lot of people assume that you have to be part of the conservative movement to believe in the Second Amendment and we need to change that. In many instances the Black community, especially those that identify as queer, are unprotected and vulnerable and those realities can be changed with personal and legal gun ownership.&#34;\n  As Wiggins&#39; Black LGBTQ gun club continues to grow, she is focused on creating gun owner clinics on state and local gun laws, and monthly meet-ups at the gun range to improve her members\u2019 accuracy and comfort in utilizing their legal firearms.\n  Lee and Wiggins are not trying to convince their communities that gun-ownership is a must. Instead, they want African Americans to see positive images of themselves when it comes to legal gun ownership. They also want American society at large to not fear Black gun owners when they see them in the community.\n  &#34;Owning a firearm is a right afforded to all Americans. So regardless of how someone feels when they see a Black person with a gun, we as a nation must condition ourselves to know that it is acceptable,&#34; said Lee. &#34;Some Black citizens are going to exercise their Second Amendment right and others are not. Those that choose to exercise their rights, should be allowed to without fear of their lives.&#34;\n  While Black gun ownership continued to rise during the pandemic, numbers are now starting to stabilize. According to the FBI&#39;s NICS Adjusted Background Check System \u2014 a database used to conduct background checks on people who want to own a firearm or explosive, as required by law \u2014\u00a0\u00a0 gun background checks were down 17 percent in May 2021 from a year ago.\u00a0May 2021 background checks were the second strongest for the month on record, only to be surpassed by May 2020, when background checks for firearms totaled 1.6 million.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:22:51", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

...... ", "note_en": "The woman was to show up at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection office at 9 a.m. to view the document, and department officials weren\u2019t entirely sure what was going to happen from there. Two lawyers with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office would be present. An archivist specializing in historical artifacts had been brought in. Armed guards \u2014 four of them \u2014 would watch over the meeting to make sure that everything went over smoothly. No funny business. No sudden moves. Everyone figured this document viewing on May 25 near Denver International Airport would be an emotional one for the woman. She\u2019d already been sitting in her car in the parking lot outside, crying, since midnight, steeling herself for what was about to occur.\n In fact, Julia Turing had been rehearsing this moment for weeks, anticipating it for years.\n   In early 2018, federal agents had seized a number of historical artifacts from Julia\u2019s Conifer home that had originally belonged to British code breaker and computer science pioneer Alan Turing, the subject of  The Imitation Game,  a biopic starring Benedict Cumberbatch released in 2014. That\u2019s when most people learned about Turing. They learned about Julia in 2020, when the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office  filed a complaint that accused her of stealing Turing\u2019s belongings from a British boarding school during the 1980s. News outlets around the world ranging from the  Associated Press to the  BBC ran stories quoting the government\u2019s court filings about this strange Colorado woman who had devoted much of her life to an early-twentieth-century math genius, had purportedly taken some of his posthumous relics without permission, and had even changed her last name to match his in some kind of homage. What was behind Julia Turing\u2019s obsession? Derangement? A kind of fetish? Or something else?\n    In all the coverage, one thing was missing: Julia\u2019s own voice. Not until  Westword reached the 59-year-old via a P.O. box listed on some court documents did any media outlet obtain her side of the story.\n   In the late 1960s, the little brown-haired girl was finally enjoying a period of relative peace when her mother returned to pluck her off the front porch of her first foster home. Known then as Julie Ann Schwinghamer, the child had been cared for by a Native American family near Squaw Valley, California, after both of Julia\u2019s parents had abandoned her. Her father had left the family when Julia was three. Her mother had taken to the bottle, then Valium, all the while prone to violent outbursts.\n  In contrast, living with a foster family and running barefoot around the countryside was like a dream\u2026until Julia\u2019s mother came calling. Julia now says her mother had discovered that she could claim additional welfare with little Julia under her roof. And so her chaotic family life picked up where it had left off, this time in the regional farming hub of Dinuba, California. Fights and screaming matches, including with Julia\u2019s brother, were almost daily occurrences. Amid the chaos, Julia didn\u2019t learn to read or write, and the local elementary school held her back in second grade. She tried running away multiple times. Still, Julia had her momentary escapes, including the movies. And so on one hot summer afternoon, when Julia\u2019s mom wanted her out of the house, she went to the cinema on Dinuba\u2019s main street to see what was playing. The film was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s sci-fi classic,  2001: A Space Odyssey.\n \u201cI was really drawn into it,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cAnd what disturbed me most was HAL 9000.\u201d\n She\u2019d never seen nor imagined anything like the talking computer in Kubrick\u2019s film, which infamously turns on its human masters once they\u2019ve left Earth\u2019s orbit. The image of HAL\u2019s unblinking red eye wore on her until Julia did something she\u2019d never done before: She went to the public library.\n Timidly, the girl asked the librarian, \u201cDo you have anything about machines that talk?\u201d\n The librarian was confused at first, until she placed a finger on what Julia was asking about.\n  She handed Julia a couple of books, but they weren\u2019t much use to a girl who couldn\u2019t read. After flipping through pages of dense text, Julia returned to the shelves to find something more visual. She hit paydirt with a bound volume containing pictures of early computers. The photographs mesmerized the child: all those beeping machines, some of them taking up entire rooms.\n But nothing prepared her for a photograph tucked away toward the back of the book. It wasn\u2019t of a machine, but of a man.  A man whom many historians regard as the pioneer of computer algorithms, the general-purpose computer, and a founding father of both theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\n   \u201cThe moment I saw his face, it was like I knew him,\u201d Julia recalls. \u201cIt was an odd feeling of extreme familiarity.\u201d\n Taking the book home, she kept the volume open to the picture for the duration of her library loan. Then she checked it out again.\n When her mother caught sight of the book, she scoffed. \u201cWho is this?\u201d\n So began a lifetime of teasing and misunderstanding over Julia\u2019s reverence for Alan Turing. Julia just couldn\u2019t articulate it. How to explain that this image felt alive to her? Somehow, she was bound to Alan Turing.\n  \u201cMy thought was, is Alan Turing alive? Because I would like to meet him,\u201d she recalls.\n Julia\u2019s desire to know everything she could about Alan Turing propelled her to learn to read and write. That\u2019s when she discovered that the mathematician had died in 1954, and that his legacy extended far beyond computers. In fact, Turing had even been an accomplished marathon runner.\n Julia was inspired. Not only did she start excelling in school, but she followed Turing\u2019s footsteps into track and field. The quiet girl whose family had told her she\u2019d never amount to anything began to run. And run. And run.\n \u201cSoon I became the fastest runner in school,\u201d she says. \u201cMy teachers couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n  This run continued after Julia was put up for adoption and settled in with a foster family in Morro Bay, California. Going by the last name of Elliott (her step-father&#39;s name) in high school, Julia began breaking regional track records, even running an 11.5-second 100-meter dash, according to the May 15, 1980, edition of the  Sun-Bulletin newspaper.   She was propelled by a growing inspiration for Alan Turing. \u201cHe was my father figure, all the way up until I was nineteen,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThen it changed drastically from there.\u201d\n      Although Julia felt intimately connected to Turing, she was disturbed by how little she knew of his personal life. But she was hardly alone in that regard in the 1980s. Alan Turing remained relatively obscure until 2012,  when the British government declassified key documents that revealed the extent to which his code-breaking skills helped to undermine the Germans\u2019 enigma machine in World War Two, changing the course of the war and giving the Allies a significant advantage over their Nazi adversaries.\n  \u201cBut back then there was so little information about him, and I was hungry to learn more,\u201d Julia remembers. \u201cFor instance, I still didn\u2019t really understand the situation of how he died.\u201d\n For details like that, Julia had to dig deep. She tracked down books from England and sought primary source material. That\u2019s when she started learning that Turing had endured a tumultuous personal life of his own. It came to a head in 1952, when he was prosecuted for homosexual acts \u2014 then still a crime in the U.K. \u2014 after he had reported a petty burglary and had admitted to having a male lover in his house. After being found guilty of \u201cgross indecency,\u201d Turing was subjected to chemical castration. The English government forced him out of the secret service, and just weeks before his 42nd birthday, Turing was found dead at his home. An inquest found his death to be suicide by cyanide poisoning.\n But in 1984, Julia \u2014 then 22 years old \u2014 only knew some of these specifics. To find out more about Turing, she decided to make a trip to England. She used money that an insurance company had paid her following a car accident to buy her plane ticket.\n In England, Julia hit the ground running. She toured the universities where Turing had once walked the stone corridors, either as a student or a researcher. These included Oxford, Cambridge and King\u2019s College. At each school, she requested to view any archived material available on Turing, but archivists and librarians were suspicious. Who was this American lady, and why was she so interested in Turing? Julia remembers being disappointed that her access was so limited.\n  She was about to give up on school archives when she remembered one more institution that Turing had attended from 1926 to 1931, when he was a teenager: Sherborne School, a prestigious,  all-boys boarding school in Dorset.\n It was here that Julia finally got access to the types of artifacts she was looking for. Turing\u2019s mother had donated many items to the school between 1965 and 1967; they included things like Turing\u2019s school reports, photographs, medals (including Turing\u2019s OBE \u2014 Officer of the Order of the British Empire \u2014 which is similar to the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the U.S.) and school certificates, among them his Ph.D. diploma in mathematics from Princeton University.\n  Julia was amazed to find herself face to face with so many important items from Turing\u2019s life. These were things that he had held, had interacted with, had \u2014 even for a minute \u2014 contemplated and diverted some of his genius to. Julia felt Turing\u2019s presence like never before.\n Given Turing\u2019s obscurity at the time, it wasn\u2019t surprising that the Sherborne librarian told her that people rarely came to look at the Turing archive.\n  What happened next all those years ago is at the heart of the recent legal mess. While the librarian did not give Julia permission to take any items, Julia also spoke to the school\u2019s treasurer, Colonel A.W. Gallon.\n According to Julia, Gallon confirmed that visitors rarely came to see the Turing archive. She says that after she shared her troubled life story with Gallon, including how Turing was so inspirational to her, Gallon told her that she could take Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma, since it meant so much to her.\n  While there is no direct evidence to document Julia\u2019s version of this conversation, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that Gallon later supported the idea that Julia could keep the Ph.D. But things get sticky from there, because Julia did steal from the school.\n Julia returned to Sherborne after her initial visit to view the items a second time. When the librarian left her side and she found herself alone, the librarian\u2019s comment about so few people caring to visit the Turing archive rang through her mind. Her heart raced as an irrepressible urge welled up.\n \u201cI made a mistake,\u201d Julia says. \u201cI was young. I felt that Alan Turing\u2019s things were in danger because no one really wanted them and they were just sitting there. So I made a mistake. I took some items.\u201d\n According to a memo written by Gallon after he retired in 1989, Sherborne wasn\u2019t aware of the theft until Julia contacted the school soon after her visits.\n \u201cI did not see her again but she wrote expressing her joy at having a collection of Turing items, and included photo of them laid out on a table \u2014 his photo, OBE &amp; so on,\u201d Gallon wrote. \u201cI was not aware that she had taken them, nor indeed was the librarian! I asked him [the librarian] to make a list of the missing items but it proved to be incomplete because we had no inventory anyway\u2026I gave up any hope of ever getting A.T.\u2019s things back \u2018til one day she wrote saying she was sending them back. A parcel arrived. It contained more than the Librarian had listed which made me cross.\u201d\n Both Sherborne and Julia saved some of the correspondence between her and Gallon \u2014 which recently became exhibits in the government\u2019s case in Colorado.\n  After returning many of the items to Sherborne \u2014 indeed, more than the school\u2019s librarian knew existed \u2014 Julia wrote:  Please forgive me for what I did. I know what I did was wrong\u2026.I want you to know that it was very hard for me to steel [sic]. For I have never stolen before in my life and did feel very badly for taking them.\n   Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   I do hope that I have your name right\u2026If the Turing memorabilia arrived safely then all will be forgotten as far as we are concerned. I think I can understand how you have felt and what motivated you is an action out of character with your normal self. Thank you for phoning. It was such a great relief for us when you chose to respond, and I repeat my invitation to come and continue and research in the future.\n On August 20, he followed up to confirm receipt of the items, while noting that Julia did not return one photograph.\n  Dear Miss Schwinghamer,   You will be pleased to know that the parcel arrived safely and I am grateful to you for what is a very [illegible] gesture and one of which Alan Turing [illegible] would be proud. I am sorry that you have retained the one photograph. Particularly as there was a negative among the collection from which you could have had another one done. I have now [illegible] here, and because of your action, you may keep the photograph. I have told the police here that you have returned all but the photograph and that as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. I hope that they will pass this on to the police there, but you will have this letter to show them in case you are questioned.\n Julia seemed to have taken the words \u201cthe matter is closed\u201d at their fullest implication.\n What Gallon likely didn\u2019t know (his letters and memo never mentioned it) was that Julia still had a number of items, including a miniature version of his OBE medal. For Julia, after Gallon declared the matter closed, it seemed that anything she still had of Turing\u2019s was rightfully hers. Once again, his spirit had come through their cosmic connection and made everything work out. Her love for Turing only grew.\n Sometime in early 1988, Julia legally changed her name to Julia Mathison Turing, in a play off of Turing\u2019s father\u2019s name, Julius Mathison Turing. \u201cI was done with being bounced around from place to place and from name to name,\u201d she explains. \u201cI took his name because I thought it was appropriate. He saved my life.\u201d\n The name change was reflected in Julia\u2019s next correspondence with Gallon. Because despite matters being \u201cclosed\u201d in 1984, Julia needed his assistance again a few years later.\n The bizarre episode occurred in late 1988, when Julia had a domestic dispute with a foster sister, Carol Elliot, with whom she was again living in Morro Bay. Carol and Julia had always had a contentious relationship.  According to Julia, Carol thought she was a freak because of her adulation of Alan Turing, and she knew how important the Turing artifacts were to Julia.\n  After an argument over Carol\u2019s boyfriend, whom Julia threatened to report for alleged criminal behavior, Carol took Turing\u2019s Ph.D. diploma and a couple of his photos to the Morro Bay Police Department and told the cops that Julia had stolen them from Sherborne School in England.\n  On September 15, 1988, Julia wrote Gallon, pleading with him to return the diploma to her:\n I am sure that Alan is as sorrowful as I am over my terrible loss of his Ph.D. If there was only some way you could understand just how much Alan means to me. I believe maybe you would allow Alan\u2019s Ph.D. to remain with me until I would eventually return it as I had promised, because you have shown me your generosity to me [sic] before.\n Incredibly, Gallon seemed swayed by Julia\u2019s letters and decided to send back the diploma. On November 19, he wrote:\n Dear Miss Turing:  Thank you for your long letter and the press cuttings. I have written to Sgt. Beuer of the Morro Bay Police saying that you may keep the diploma. If I am too late and it arrives here, I will send it back to you.\n Authorities in Colorado located these letters, along with a customs declaration from Britain, that seem to support this twist in the story: Gallon did gift the Ph.D. diploma \u2014 along with a couple of Turing photos \u2014 to Julia. In fact, rather than being angry with Julia, Gallon even said that he was rooting for her success as an officer in the U.S. Army and as a standout track-and-field star:\n Good luck with the Olympic selection. We shall be looking out for you in 1992.\n At least Gallon wasn\u2019t being misled about Julia\u2019s career accomplishments. They were unbelievable yet true.\n  \u201cFaster than a private dodging his platoon sergeant, speedier than an M-16 on rapid fire, able to leap the Headquarters building with a single bound, look out Flo Jo, here comes Lt. Turing.\u201d U.S. Army writer Cliff Jackson wrote that at the start of an April 11, 1990, article titled \u201cThe Champion\u201d for the newspaper that served Julia\u2019s Army posting in Stuttgart, Germany.\n  The piece continued: \u201c2nd Lt. Julia M Turing is one of the 11th Chemical Company\u2019s platoon leaders. How fast is she? In a 200 meter dash her average time is 22:88; when you compare that time to the world class time of 20.5, that\u2019s nothing to sneeze at.\u201d\n More than a dozen newspaper articles document Julia\u2019s career record as a track star. They range from coverage of her accomplishments in high school (fourth in California\u2019s state finals) to winning the 100, 200 and 400 meter races in the 1988  Community College State Championships in California. After completing her higher  education at Arizona State University, Julia donned a uniform for the Army and continued running as a member of the Armed Forces. In 1990, she was named the military\u2019s \u201cService Athlete of the Year.\u201d  Stars and Stripes noted that she was \u201cthe sixth fastest sprinter in the U.S.A.\u201d\n With headlines like \u201cAgainst All Odds\u201d \u2014 that one from the  Star Presidian of San Francisco \u2014 articles took note of her difficult upbringing and overcoming the challenges of being shuttled between foster families. One article also mentioned that an \u201cAllen A. Turing\u201d [sic] was Julia\u2019s inspiration.\n But then duty called, and Julia\u2019s running career took a break as the U.S. military prepared to invade Iraq. A lieutenant in the Army\u2019s Chemical Company, Julia was stationed in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm, where she briefed incoming soldiers on possible sources of chemical attacks from Saddam Hussein\u2019s forces.\n Julia worried that her deployment would hamper her quest to represent the United States at the Olympics, but after returning from the Middle East, she won six gold medals at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships, breaking a 39-year military record for the most gold medals at a single event.\n  She was at the peak of her training when she arrived at the Olympic trials in Barcelona, Spain \u2014 the final, qualifying event for the 1992 Olympic games. But she also arrived in the Catalonian capital with multiple running-related injuries. Reporters wanted to know: Could she push through it? Julia said that she would try to overcome any pain and give \u201c101 percent,\u201d just as she had at the 1991 Armed Forces Championships.\n But as the deadline approached, Julia\u2019s foot was killing her. She finally got it X-rayed, and doctors found that she had broken it in two places. Her right leg also had stress fractures.\n \u201cYou can\u2019t compete,\u201d doctors said. \u201cIf your leg breaks, you\u2019ll never walk normally again.\u201d\n Julia attempted the 200-meter race anyway, but had to pull up before she rounded the first turn. Her running career was over.\n  After the first Gulf War, the Army downsized. With little use for a chemical warfare specialist, Julia was placed on reserve, she says. She decided to leave the Army and work a low-level job for the Department of Justice instead \u2014 the job that brought her to Colorado. While living on the Front Range, Julia continued to collect and sell Turing-related artifacts and memorabilia. She set up an eBay page where she offered Turing artwork she\u2019d made using oil pencils on h\n......", "posttime": "2021-06-24 03:22:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "alan,turing,\u56fe\u7075", "title": "Alan Tures\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8c1c ", "title_en": "Alan Turing's biggest fan remains the real enigma", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.westword.com/news/alan-turing-enigma-british-codebreaker-homeland-security-colorado-11996659", "via": "", "real_tags": ["alan", "turing", "\u56fe\u7075"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "087f898caf907fc4f4bb60b95c67bfc1.jpg", "infoid": 1067804, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Rob Hudock\u662f\u4e00\u4f4d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u5242\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u516c\u53f8\u62db\u52df\u6700\u4f73\u4eba\u624d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u5206\u6563\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8bc9\u8bbc\u3002\n  \u4ee4\u4eba\u75db\u82e6\u5730\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u5c31\u4e1a\u6709\u5173\u3002\u4e0e\u5c31\u4e1a\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\u4f1a\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd - \u4ece\u9632\u6b62\u5173\u95ed\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4ea4\u6613\u6761\u6b3e\u6216\u5927\u5e45\u9650\u5236\u6f5c\u5728\u4e70\u5bb6\u6c60\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\n  \u5e78\u8fd0\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u524d\u5f97\u5230\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u6709\u70b9\u8fdb\u5165\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u8ba1\u5212\u9000\u51fa\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5f88\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c31\u5fc5\u987b\u8fde\u7eed\u83b7\u53d6\u5de5\u4f5c\u9e2d\u5b50\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u3002\n \u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5265\u593a\u6216\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9500\u552e\u3002\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\u8d44\u4ea7\u9500\u552e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u80a1\u7968\u9500\u552e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002\n  \u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u666e\u904d\u5c31\u4e1a\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u8303\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5728\u60a8\u8ffd\u6c42\u4ea4\u6613\u4e4b\u524d\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5c31\u4e1a\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u4ea4\u6613\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u662f\u5de5\u8d44\u548c\u5c0f\u65f6\u95ee\u9898 - \u8ba1\u65f6\u548c\u5de5\u8d44\u5355\uff0c\u5de5\u8d44\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5458\u5de5\u4e0e\u72ec\u7acb\u627f\u5305\u5546;\u8c41\u514d\u4e0e\u975e\u8c41\u514d\uff09\uff0c\u81b3\u98df\u548c\u4f11\u606f\u671f\uff0cPTO\u653f\u7b56\u548c\u7ec8\u6b62\u652f\u51fa\u3002 ", "note_en": "Rob Hudock is an experienced litigator focusing his 20-plus years in practice on helping companies recruit the best talent available while avoiding distracting workplace issues or lawsuits.\n  Distressingly often, these problems are related to employment. Inattention to employment issues can have a significant impact on deals \u2014 from preventing closings and reducing the deal value to altering the deal terms or significantly limiting the pool of potential buyers.\n  Fortunately, such issues typically can be resolved well in advance with a little forethought and legal guidance. It\u2019s important to get your employment ducks in a row long before you start planning your exit.\n What follows is an overview of the three main categories of employment issues that can derail or delay a sale.

Swarm co-founder and CEO realized just how much the cost curve had changed when she and her co-founder Ben Longmeir realized that they could outfit tiny satellites Longmeir had created as a kind of space lover\u2019s hobby with the equipment needed to provide low-bandwidth connectivity to low-powered devices around the world.\n In this week\u2019s episode of Found, Sara walks us through how she went from an engineering career that included stints at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Google, to building Swarm as a first-time founder and CEO. We covered a range of topics including how Sara and Ben decided who would be CEO, what it\u2019s like leading a small but growing team, and how to evaluate your decisions as a founder, and commit to a course of action to move forward.\n Sara was extremely candid with us about her experience as a founder and CEO, and this is definitely one of our most open and honest conversations to date.\n  We loved our time chatting with Sara, and we hope you love yours listening to the episode. And of course, we\u2019d love if you can subscribe to  Found in Apple Podcasts, on  Spotify, on  Google Podcasts or in  your podcast app of choice.

describes itself as a \u201cfood meets friends\u201d \u2014 essentially a social commerce platform for ordering from restaurants, with \u201csnack\u201d, the CEO tells me, of having a double meaning of eating (of course), and a flirtatious reference to a cutie pie \u2014 has picked up a $70 million, a super-sized Series B that it will be using to continue expanding to more markets in the U.S.\n Conceived four years ago while Kevin Tan, the CEO who co-founded the company with Jamie Marshall, was still a student at Yale studying physics, Snackpass has grown by remaining true to its higher-ed roots. The startup now has 500,000 users across 13 college towns, and has seen its growth explode 7x in the last three months alone. This round values the startup at over $400 million.\n  This latest tranche of funding is coming from an interesting group of investors. Led by Craft Ventures, it also includes Andreessen Horowitz (which led its  $21 million Series A), General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and a long list of individual backers that speaks to the attention Snackpass is getting and the place it\u2019s carving out for itself as a go-to food platform for millennials and younger users.\n That list includes AirAngels, the Airbnb alumni investor syndicate; Bastian Lehmann of the Uber-acquired delivery giant Postmates (et tu, Bastian?); David Grutman, a Miami-based hospitality entrepreneur; Draymond Green of the San Francisco Warriors; Gaingels; HartBeat Ventures, Kevin Hart\u2019s venture fund; musician celebs the Jonas Brothers; Shrug Capital (the VC that says it\u2019s interested in consumer startups that are actually interesting to \u201c non-tech\u201d audiences); Stephen Paglucia, co-owner of the Boston Celtics; hip DJ Steve Aoki; Turner Novak of Banana Capital; William Barnes of Moving Capital; and the Uber alumni investor syndicate.\n The vast majority of food-ordering platforms these days are focused around delivery and in many cases ways of getting an edge over other platforms in executing on that \u2014 a push that often comes at the expense of margins than are thinner than a Roman pizza. Snackpass\u2019s big breakthrough, if you could call it that, was to simply dial back from that one-upmanship, moving away from that premise altogether, aiming to disrupt something much more mundane: the queue.\n Tan said Snackpass asked its users what they would do if they weren\u2019t using the app, and they said, \u201cOh, I just stand in line to order,\u201d he told me in an interview.\n \u201cThe market share right now is owned by people standing in line at the register, and placing their order. Our vision is that in five years that will no longer exist, like, there will be no more registers. We don\u2019t think it makes any sense.\u201d\n He notes that for those who really want delivery, people can opt for that, too \u2014 Snackpass integrates with DoorDash, UberEats and others to fulfill that \u2014 but 90% of the orders on Snackpass are pickup, meaning that not only does the company then not have to deal with its own fleets of delivery people, and the infrastructure of that, but the operating costs to provide that are also not there.\n It turns out that actually a lot of young people seem happy to pop out to get something nice to eat. It means they get to socialise, and take a selfie with their food or drink (boba tea figures strongly) at the venue where it\u2019s being bought. It becomes an experience.\n It\u2019s also where the market is in another sense. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realize is delivery is only 8% of the restaurant industry,\u201d Tan told me. \u201cAnd while it\u2019s very much competed for by like big companies, and it\u2019s a huge market, the restaurant industry, is like, much bigger, it\u2019s $800 billion. And 90% of that purchasing is still offline,\u201d he continued, referring to the many people who just queue up, order, buy, and leave. \u201cIt\u2019s anonymous, and it\u2019s on the verge of disruption. And we\u2019re focused on that much bigger blue ocean.\u201d\n Its formula seems to be working with its target users. Tan said that the service has\u00a080% penetration with students in the markets where it has launched. The average customer orders four and a half times a month, with some customers ordering every day. \u201cYou can actually see that it\u2019s like, five to ten times more engagement than the delivery platforms, like UberEats or DoorDash.\u201d\n The company\u2019s commissions vary and start at 7% and it\u2019s current suite includes online ordering, self-service kiosks, digital menus, marketing services, and a customer referral program. It\u2019s already profitable but as it continues to grow (and maybe extend to other demographics) you can imagine it adding and expanding on all of these.\n There is something about Snackpass that reminds me a lot of Snapchat, not just that the names have a similar ring to them, and not just that they have resonated with college-aged users (and not just that they both squarely target them). It\u2019s something of the whimsy of the app, and how it takes a light touch in its approach to do something that might otherwise feel cumbersome, or mundane, or what, basically, older people do.\n Right now, there isn\u2019t much of a social \u201cuser graph\u201d per se on Snackpass, nor does it integrate particularly deeply with any specific social apps, but you could imagine a partnership there down the line, especially considering that Snap is getting a whole lot more involved with commerce now.\n \u201cIn building a social experience around food through shared rewards, gifting, and a social activity feed, Snackpass has created a dynamic and attractive restaurant ordering system,\u201d says Bryan Rosenblatt, partner, Craft Ventures, in a statement. \u201cThe growth of its marketplace and virality of the product coupled with Snackpass\u2019 outstanding \u00a0team and vision, make it the ultimate solution for consumers and businesses alike. We are thrilled to help take Snackpass to the next level with this latest round of funding.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:44:27", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u793e\u4f1a,platform", "title": "Snackpass\u541e\u566c7000\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\u4e3a400\u7c73+\u4f30\u4ef7\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u98df\u54c1\u8ba2\u8d2d\u5e73\u53f0\u8de8\u8d8a500k\u7528\u6237 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSnackpass gobbles up $70M at a $400M+ valuation as its social food ordering platform crosses 500k users\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/snackpass-gobbles-up-70m-at-a-400m-valuation-as-its-social-food-ordering-platform-crosses-500k-users/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u793e\u4f1a", "platform"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8587788a7fc806d4b0eb5c3785bb28b4.jpg", "infoid": 1067800, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7ebd\u7ea6\uff08CNN Business\uff09\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u8ba1\u5212\u4ece\u7ebd\u7ea6\u603b\u90e8\u7981\u6b62\u5de5\u4eba\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u6536\u5230Covid-19\u75ab\u82d7\u3002\u8be5\u89c4\u5219\u4e5f\u5c06\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u5ba2\u4eba\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u3002\n \u6839\u636e\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0cMorgan Stanley\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5927\u90fd\u4f1a\u533a\u7684\u5458\u5de5\u5907\u5fd8\u5f55\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u90fd\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e2d\u4e0eA\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u578b\u5458\u5de5\u5b58\u5728\uff06\uff0334;\u9700\u8981\u57287\u67081\u65e5\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u3002\n \u6e90\u5934\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u75ab\u82d7\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u5458\u5de5\uff0c\u6216\u6709\u52b3\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u8bbf\u5ba2\u7684\u8363\u8a89\u57fa\u7840\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u91d1\u878d\u65f6\u671f\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u65b0\u95fb\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u3002\n     \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8ba1\u5212\u5c06\u96c7\u5458\u548c\u5ba2\u4eba\u6269\u5927\u96c7\u5458\u548c\u5ba2\u4eba\u57287\u670812\u65e5\u5f00\u59cb\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u53ca\u97e6\u65af\u5f7b\u65af\u7279\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\u5730\u533a\u7684\u75ab\u82d7\u63a5\u79cd\u6388\u6743\u3002\n   \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u63a5\u79cd\u75ab\u82d7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u4e3e\u8d77\u50cf\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u90e8\u8986\u76d6\u7269\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4f53\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u66f4\u6b63\u5e38\u7684\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6e90\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u3002\n  \u6469\u6839\u58eb\u4e39\u5229\uff08MS\uff09\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98James Gorman\u5148\u524d\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u8fd4\u56de\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u66fe\u5728\u5458\u5de5\u4e0a\u66fe\u5728\u672c\u6708\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u5927\u4f1a\u4e0a\u8bc4\u8bba\u8fc7\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u94f6\u884c\uff06\uff0339;\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5de5\u4eba\u56de\u5230\u603b\u90e8\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u5728\u5927\u82f9\u679c\u548c\uff0339;\u65f6\u4ee3\u5e7f\u573a\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u53bb\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u7684\u4e00\u5bb6\u9910\u9986\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u5165\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u60a8\u5728\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6208\u5c14\u66fc\u8bf4\u3002\u4ed6\u8fd8\u8b66\u544a\u4ed6\u4f1a\u662f\uff06\uff0334;\u975e\u5e38\u5931\u671b\u7684\uff06\uff0334;\u5982\u679c\u5de5\u4eba\u9003\u79bb\u52b3\u52a8\u8282\u7684\uff06\uff0339;\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

The rule will apply to non-vaccinated guests and clients as well.\n According to a source close to the company, Morgan Stanley said in a memo to its employees in the New York metropolitan area that all staff working in buildings with a &#34;large employee presence&#34; are required to confirm their vaccination status by July 1.\n The source added that &#34;vaccine attestation is on an honorary basis for employees, contingent workforce, clients and visitors.&#34; The Financial Times was the first to  report the news.\n     The company plans to expand the vaccination mandate to employees and guests in other Morgan Stanley locations in New York City and nearby Westchester starting July 12.\n   &#34;Operating within a fully vaccinated environment allows us to lift restrictions like the use of face coverings and the need to maintain physical distancing, returning to more normal office conditions,&#34; the source added.\n  Morgan Stanley  (  MS) CEO James Gorman has previously taken a hard line on employees  returning to the office: Gorman commented at an investing conference earlier this month that it was time for the bank&#39;s New York workers to head back to the headquarters in the Big Apple&#39;s Times Square.\n  &#34;If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office. And we want you in the office,&#34; Gorman said. He also warned he would be &#34;very disappointed&#34; if workers aren&#39;t back by Labor Day. And if they&#39;re not, then &#34;we&#39;ll have a different kind of conversation,&#34; he said.\n Gorman added at the time that more than 90% of its workers have said they have already received the vaccine and that he expects this number to eventually hit 98% to 99%.\n He did note some employees may choose to not get vaccinated for health or religious reasons, adding that the company will deal with these situations on a case-by-case basis.\n Even more than other industries,  Wall Street is in a rush to turn the page on the pandemic era of remote work.\n   Goldman Sachs  (  GS) asked its employees to be back at the office last week, and it ordered staffers to divulge whether they&#39;ve been vaccinated.

The project is intended as auxiliary processor in larger SoC designs or as\u00a0 ready-to-go\u00a0stand-alone custom / customizable microcontroller.\n When I started to dive into the emerging RISC-V ecosystem I felt overwhelmed by the complexity. As a beginner it is hard to get an overview \u2013 especially when you want to setup a minimal platform to tinker with: Which core to use? How to get the right toolchain? What features do I need? How does the booting work? How do I create an actual executable? How to get that into the hardware? How to customize things?\u00a0  Where to start???\n So this project aims to provides a\u00a0 simple to understand\u00a0and\u00a0 easy to use\u00a0yet\u00a0 powerful\u00a0and\u00a0 flexible\u00a0platform that targets FPGA and RISC-V beginners as well as advanced users.\n The NEORV32 is not based on another RISC-V core. It was build entirely from ground up (just following the official ISA specs) having a different design goal in mind. The project does not intend to replace certain RISC-V cores or just beat existing ones like\u00a0 VexRISC\u00a0in terms of performance or\u00a0 SERV\u00a0in terms of size.\n The project aims to provide\u00a0 another option\u00a0in the RISC-V / soft-core design space with a different performance vs. size trade-off and a different focus:\u00a0 embrace\u00a0concepts like documentation, platform-independence / portability, RISC-V compatibility,\u00a0 customization\u00a0and\u00a0 ease of use.\n    Stop breadboarding and soldering \u2013 start making immediately!

Ever. Private, independent, and transparent, Brave Search is the real alternative to Google. On mobile, desktop, and anywhere the web takes you. Search private. Search with confidence.\n    Brave Search is the world\u2019s most complete, independent, private search engine. By integrating Brave Search beta into its browser, Brave offers the first all-in-one browser / search alternative to the big tech platforms. Brave Search beta is also available in other browsers, at  search.brave.com.\n  Yes, it\u2019s available to everyone at  search.brave.com. It can also be set as the default search engine in the Brave browser, if you choose to do so.\n Note that Brave Search beta is a work in progress, so results for some queries, regions, or languages may not yet be as refined as you\u2019d like. Please be patient, and please do tell us how we can improve (use the feedback icon on any results page). Rome, as they say, wasn\u2019t built in a day\u2014a perfect alternative to Google won\u2019t be either. But, with your help, it  will happen.\n    We do not believe in walled gardens, so you can also set Brave Search as the default search engine in most browsers. And, in the future, we plan to offer API access to Brave Search so it can power other search engines.\n  We\u2019re currently thinking through different search experiences to offer our users. Some want a premium, ad-free search experience. Others want a free, ad-supported model. We think choice is best. Brave Ads  with rewards is definitely possible, once we\u2019re ready to take on the challenge of privacy-protected search ads.\n  Most search engines\u2014even supposedly \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d ones\u2014don\u2019t have their own index. They\u2019re just fa\u00e7ades that rely exclusively on third-parties. At Brave, we want to build our own search index, because this means independence. And independence means choice. Choice for the user to have alternatives, and choice that allows Brave to not be beholden to the policies of third parties (e.g. censorship, biases, economic interests, etc).\n Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page. This mixing is a means-to-an-end toward 100% independence. For full transparency and to measure Brave\u2019s progress toward that goal, Brave provides a \u201cResults independence\u201d metric. This anonymous calculation shows the % of search results that come from Brave versus these third parties. Note that no matter the independence metric, your privacy will always be 100%.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:35:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

that an episode of historic heat will torch much of the Pacific Northwest late this week into early next, with temperatures 30 degrees or more above average set to topple monthly and all-time records.\n  \u201cRecord-Breaking and Dangerous Heatwave coming to the West,\u201d  tweeted the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center Wednesday. \u201cOver 80 sites are forecast to break daily high temperature records starting this weekend.\u201d\n Highs on Sunday could approach 100 degrees in Seattle and 107 in Portland, Ore., cities where a significant portion of the population lacks air conditioning. Seattle has only reached the century mark twice in more than 75 years of records. If Portland hits 107, it would match  its highest temperature ever recorded.\n  \u201cThree words will describe weather for inland areas this weekend into early next week \u2026 HOT, VERY HOT,\u201d the National Weather Service office in Portland wrote in a discussion.\n  In Spokane, Wash., the mercury could reach 110 degrees by Monday. The Weather Service in the Spokane office is referring to the episode as a \u201chistoric and dangerous  heat wave,\u201d predicting triple-digit heat Saturday to Tuesday. \u201cWe currently anticipate that Tuesday will be the hottest day with highs between 105 and 115 for most of the inhabited area,\u201d it wrote.\n The Weather Service has issued excessive-heat watches from extreme Northern California through large parts of Oregon and Washington, warning that heat-related illnesses are likely for some, with concern for residents without adequate air conditioning \u2014 \u201ci.e. a lot of people,\u201d the Spokane office wrote.\n   Temperatures were already toasty Tuesday across the Columbia Basin of eastern Washington state and extreme northeast Oregon, where highs climbed into the upper 90s. That marks a mere taste of what\u2019s to come. Wednesday and Thursday will feature similar temperatures before the mercury spikes Friday, with a few spots hitting 100.\n   Widespread highs in the range of 100 to 110 degrees are expected Saturday, both within the coastal valleys and well inland. Temperatures may top 110 degrees in some spots by Sunday, with signals that the heat may stick around until the middle of next week.\n The skyrocketing temperatures can be traced to a sprawling ridge of high pressure colloquially known as a \u201cheat dome.\u201d That high deflects inclement weather to the north, bringing copious sunshine, sinking air and clear skies. Weak high pressure is in control across the northwestern Lower 48 but will be replaced by a robust high-pressure system slated to move ashore and into southern British Columbia during the day Saturday.\n  In downtown Seattle, a high near 96 is forecast Saturday, 97 Sunday and 94 on Monday. Average highs this time of year tend toward 74.\n   The airport has hit 100 degrees or higher only twice \u2014 once on July 20, 1994, and again July 29, 2009, when highs spiked to 103. While that\u2019s not in the forecast now, temperature predictions have been trending hotter, and both the American GFS and European models hint that it\u2019s possible, illustrating just how rare heat of this magnitude will be.\n  It has been nearly three years since Seattle logged an official heat wave, entailing three consecutive days at or above 90 degrees.\n Farther inland, temperatures will be markedly warmer, as in Spokane. The city of nearly 220,000 could see highs topping 90 degrees for upward of a week in the current weather pattern. Both weekend days are expected to top 100 (102 Saturday and 106 Sunday), with Monday and Tuesday\u2019s high anticipated to reach around 110. That would break the city\u2019s June record of 105 and all-time (any month) record of 108 degrees.\n \u201cMultiple days in a row of these temperatures will make heat illness all the more likely if precautions aren\u2019t taken because the heat will continue to stress the body each day,\u201d wrote the Weather Service office in Spokane.\n  In Yakima, Wash., the heat will also be unbearable, with highs near 110 degrees Sunday through Tuesday. In nearly 80 years of bookkeeping, Yakima has measured only two stretches of three or more days hitting 105 degrees. Yakima has also hit 110 degrees only once on record \u2014 on Aug. 10, 1971. It\u2019s not out of the question that Monday ties or breaks a record.\n   Other cities in the Pacific Northwest will also be excessively hot: A high of 107 is expected in Boise, Idaho, on Monday. Medford, Ore., could hit 107, too.\n The heat will be dangerous both because of its extreme magnitude and extended duration. With nighttime lows falling to only around 70 in most places, there will be little opportunity for the air inside homes to cool off.  Two-thirds of Seattle-area and nearly one-third of Portland homes lack air conditioning. That means the elderly and vulnerable populations will be especially at risk for heat-related illnesses, since mild nighttime lows will offer little relief for the body.\n  Conditions will also be problematic from a wildfire and drought standpoint. Red-flag warnings for wildfire danger are posted from the Four Corners region through interior Oregon, and more alerts will be issued in the days ahead. A few \u201cdry thunderstorms\u201d \u2014 or lightning-producing thunderstorms with little to no rain \u2014 are possible, which could ignite new blazes.\n As of Wednesday, large fires were active in 11 states. So far this year, more than 29,000 fires, the most in a decade, have burned more than 1.1 million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.\n  Equally disconcerting will be the exacerbation of ongoing extreme to exceptional drought in the West. The forthcoming outbreak of heat, made worse by human-induced climate change, will further dry soils and reinforce drought conditions. The drought, in turn, will make future extreme heat events more likely.\n   \u201cThe heat will unfortunately be bad news for farmers, too,\u201d wrote the National Weather Service in Spokane. \u201cLow relative humidities and no precipitation will worsen the already bad  drought. Plus, fuel models suggest record dryness this early in the season, so wildfires are a concern.\u201d\n More than 55 percent of the West is experiencing an extreme or exceptional drought \u2014 the two most severe categories \u2014 as scant precipitation and above-average temperatures wreak havoc on agriculture and water resources. Looking ahead, continued anomalously hot and dry conditions are expected there for the remainder of the summer.\n This next blast of heat comes on the heels of a historic heat wave  that set nearly 4,000 records in the West last week. Phoenix hit at least 115 degrees  for a record six days in a row, and Tucson topped 110  for a record eight straight days. The heat wave expanded into Mexico, where a location just south of the U.S. border soared to 124.5 degrees, the  highest temperature ever recorded in the country during June.\n   The intensity of last week\u2019s heat wave, like the one forthcoming, is connected to human-caused climate change and the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n Even after the worst of the heat wave eases by the middle of next week, temperatures in the Pacific Northwest are expected to remain warmer than normal.

the presentation said.\n The company said the program would provide permanent employment. Concerns about being offered a job made the engineering residency feel &#34;probationary,&#34; the Google employees&#39; presentation said.\n Alphabet&#39;s Google plans to shut down a long-running program aimed at entry-level engineers from underrepresented backgrounds after participants said it enforced &#34;systemic pay inequities,&#34; according to internal correspondence seen by Reuters.\n Google confirmed it was replacing the Engineering Residency with a new initiative, saying it is &#34;always evaluating programs to ensure they evolve and adapt over time to meet the needs of our employees.&#34;\n   Critics have long argued that Google and its tech industry peers favor white, Asian and male workers in hiring, promotions and pay. Companies have grown more attuned to concerns about workforce diversity since the Black Lives Matter protests a year ago.\n The Google residency, often referred to as &#34;Eng Res,&#34; has since 2014 given graduates from hundreds of schools a chance to work on different teams, receive training and prove themselves for a permanent job over the course of a year. It offered a cohort of peers for bonding, three former residents said.\n Residents were Google&#39;s &#34;most diverse pool&#34; of software engineers and came &#34;primarily from underrepresented groups,&#34; according to a June 2020 presentation and an accompanying letter to management that one source said over 500 current and former residents signed.\n Compared with other software engineers, residents received the lowest possible pay for their employment level, a smaller year-end bonus and no stock, creating a compensation deficit &#34;in the mid tens of thousands of dollars,&#34; the presentation said.\n  Nearly all residents converted to regular employees, according to the presentation. Many alumni years later have continued to feel the &#34;negative effect&#34; of their starting pay on their current salary, it said. Google said it worked to eliminate long-term disparities when hiring residents permanently.\n The letter came after Google  gave big donations to promote racial justice amid the global outcry over the police murder of George Floyd. Black, Latinx and female staff &#34;deserve more than just &#39;the opportunity to be at Google,&#39;&#34; the letter said.\n &#34;Google is willing to invest large sums of money in issues of racial inequity outside of the workplace, but still seems unwilling to address or even acknowledge the role that the Eng Res program plays in enforcing systemic pay inequities,&#34; it said.\n Vice President Maggie Johnson emailed alumni on June 2 saying Google would replace the residency with a new program it was devising for 2022, called Early Career Immersion (ECI). The message, seen by Reuters, did not explain reasons for the switch but said ECI would include mentoring and training.\n The company said the program would provide permanent employment. Concerns about being offered a job made the engineering residency feel &#34;probationary,&#34; the Google employees&#39; presentation said.\n The old program tried to provide &#34;a wide range of high potential engineers&#34; a chance to &#34;hone their skills and gain relevant experience as they start their careers,&#34; Google said in a statement. &#34;Our Early Career Immersion onboarding program will provide a new approach.&#34;\n Google continues to run other fixed-term residencies, including 26-month roles working on internal technical systems and an 18-month program for artificial intelligence researchers.

", "note_en": "Climate scientists are increasingly concerned that global heating will trigger tipping points in Earth\u2019s natural systems, which will lead to widespread and possibly irrevocable disaster, unless action is taken urgently.\n The impacts are likely to be much closer than most people realise, a a draft report from the world\u2019s leading climate scientists suggests, and will fundamentally reshape life in the coming decades even if greenhouse gas emissions are brought under some control.\n  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is preparing a landmark report to be published in stages this summer and next year. Most of the report will not be published in time for consideration by policymakers at  Cop26, the UN climate talks taking place in November in Glasgow.\n A draft of the IPCC report apparently from early this year was leaked to Agence France-Presse, which reported on its findings on Thursday. The draft warns of a series of thresholds beyond which recovery from climate breakdown may become impossible. It warns: \u201cLife on Earth can recover from a drastic climate shift by evolving into new species and creating new ecosystems \u2026 humans cannot.\u201d\n Tipping points are triggered when temperatures reach a certain level, whereby one impact rapidly leads to a series of cascading events with vast repercussions. For instance, as rising temperatures lead to the melting of Arctic permafrost, the  unfreezing soil releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that in turn causes more heating.\n  Other tipping points include the  melting of polar ice sheets, which once under way may be almost  impossible to reverse even if carbon emissions are rapidly reduced, and which would raise sea levels catastrophically over many decades, and the possibility of the  Amazon rainforest switching suddenly to savannah, which scientists have said  could come quickly and with relatively small temperature rises.\n Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, said: \u201cScientists have identified several potential regional and global thresholds or tipping points in the climate beyond which impacts become unstoppable or irreversible, or accelerate. They could create huge social and economic responses, such as population displacements and conflict, and so represent the largest potential risks of climate change. Tipping points should be the climate change impacts about which policymakers worry the most, but they are often left out of assessments by scientists and economists because they are difficult to quantify.\u201d\n Previous work by the IPCC has been  criticised for failing to take account of tipping points. The new report is set to contain the body\u2019s strongest warnings yet on the subject.\n Simon Lewis, a professor of global change science at University College London, said: \u201cNothing in the IPCC report should be a surprise, as all the information comes from the scientific literature. But put together, the stark message from the IPCC is that increasingly severe heatwaves, fires, floods and droughts are coming our way with dire impacts for many countries. On top of this are some irreversible changes, often called tipping points, such as where high temperatures and droughts mean parts of the Amazon rainforest can\u2019t persist. These tipping points may then link, like toppling dominoes.\u201d\n  He added: \u201cThe exact timing of tipping points and the links between them is not well understood by scientists, so they have been under-reported in past IPCC assessments. The blunter language from the IPCC this time is welcome, as people need to know what is at stake if society does not take action to immediately slash carbon emissions.\u201d\n Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, declined to comment on the draft report but stressed that avoiding dire impacts was still possible. \u201cIt\u2019s important people don\u2019t get the message \u2018we\u2019re doomed anyway so why bother?\u2019. This is a fixable problem. We could stop global warming in a generation if we wanted to, which would mean limiting future warming to not much more than has happened already this century. We also know how. It\u2019s just a matter of getting on with it,\u201d he said.\n According to AFP, the IPCC draft details at least 12 potential  tipping points. \u201cThe worst is yet to come, affecting our children\u2019s and grandchildren\u2019s lives much more than our own,\u201d the report says.\n The reportmay be subject to minor changes in the coming months as the IPCC shifts its focus to a key executive summary for policymakers.\n It says that with 1.1C of warming above pre-industrial levels clocked so far, the climate is already changing. A decade ago, scientists believed that limiting global warming to 2C above mid-19th-century levels would be enough to safeguard the future.\n That goal is enshrined in the 2015 Paris agreement, adopted by nearly 200 nations who vowed to collectively cap warming at \u201cwell below\u201d 2C \u2013 and 1.5C if possible. On current trends the world is heading for 3C at best.\n Earlier models predicted that Earth-altering climate change was not likely before 2100. But the UN draft report says prolonged warming even beyond 1.5C could produce \u201cprogressively serious, centuries-long and, in some cases, irreversible consequences.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-24 02:32:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6cc4\u9732,steps,\u62a5\u544a", "title": "IPCC\u5bf9\u6cc4\u9732\u62a5\u544a\u8349\u7a3f\u4e2d\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u63d0\u793a\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9884\u8b66 ", "title_en": "IPCC steps up warning on climate tipping points in leaked draft report", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/climate-change-dangerous-thresholds-un-report", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6cc4\u9732", "steps", "\u62a5\u544a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5e1f3d42b1b4187ebfe3af50eae2a8ed.jpg", "infoid": 1067790, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "NASA\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6bd4\u5c14\u5c3c\u5c14\u68ee\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u9884\u8ba1\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u8d23\u4efb\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u4e8e8\u67084\u65e5\u4e3e\u884c\u7684\u519c\u5386\u5170\u5fb7\u65af\u7279\u6297\u8bae\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u575a\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\uff0c\u540e\u8005NASA\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5176Artemis\u8ba1\u5212\u5411\u524d\u8fc8\u8fdb\u3002\n \u7eb3\u5c14\u900a\uff06\uff0339;\u8bc4\u8bba\u662f\u56de\u5e94\u7f8e\u56fd\u623f\u5c4b\u79d1\u5b66\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6280\u672f\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5728Artemis\u4e0a\u8981\u6c42\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u56fd\u5bb6\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u5c40\u6253\u7b97\u7528\u6765\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f52\u8fd8\u6708\u4eae\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ee7\u7eed\u524d\u5f80\u706b\u661f\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u5c06\u6709\u8ba1\u5212\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u7eb3\u5c14\u900a\u8bf4\uff0c\u53c2\u8003Artemis\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u6297\u8bae\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u3002\n \u540e\u6765\uff0c\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u3002\u6bd4\u5c14\u798f\u65af\u7279\uff08D-Ill\u3002\uff09\u8be2\u95ee\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8ba1\u5212\u662f\u5426\u5305\u62ecA\uff06\uff0334;\u8d44\u6e90\u52a0\u8f7d\uff06\uff0334;

This would seem to set a firm timeline after which NASA can move forward with its Artemis program.\n Nelson&#39;s comments came in response to members of the US House Science, Space, and Technology Committee asking for specifics on Artemis, which NASA intends to use to return humans to the Moon and eventually go on to Mars.\n &#34;I will have a plan to announce,&#34; Nelson said, referring to Artemis specifics and the protest timeline.\n Later, US Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) asked whether this plan would include a &#34;resource loaded&#34; schedule and budget for the Artemis program, and Nelson responded, &#34;Yes sir.&#34;\n This would represent a significant step forward for Artemis, as resource loading is a formal process by\u00a0which a schedule integrates cost, schedule, and risk. It requires communication between the agency&#39;s leadership, program managers, and cost estimators and ultimately allows for more informed decision-making. It would signal to Congress that the Artemis program has concrete plans and goals rather than existing only as a PowerPoint presentation.\n  In mid-April,  NASA selected SpaceX to conduct a &#34;demonstration&#34; mission of its Starship vehicle as a Human Landing System on the Moon. This crewed flight would occur no earlier than 2024.\n NASA based its decision, in part, on cost.\u00a0&#34;We looked at what\u2019s the best value to the government,&#34; Kathy Lueders, chief of the human exploration program for NASA, said at the time.\n The decision was swiftly followed by protests from the two other bidders for the Human Landing System contract, a &#34;National Team&#34; led by Blue Origin and another team led by Dynetics.\u00a0&#34;NASA has executed a flawed acquisition for the Human Landing System program and moved the goalposts at the last minute,&#34; Blue Origin said in a statement that accompanied its sealed protest.\n Nelson was confirmed as NASA administrator after the contract award was announced and after the protests were filed. Nelson has subsequently said he supported NASA&#39;s contract award to SpaceX but that he also will abide by US GAO decision on the protest.\n     One of the big questions before Congress is whether to fully fund the Human Landing System, the key remaining technology needed to return humans to the Moon. NASA asked for $3.3 billion in fiscal year 2021 to start development of two landers. Congress provided just $850 million for this year&#39;s budget.\n As a result, NASA said it only had enough funds for one lander and chose what it deemed the lowest-cost, most technically ready option: SpaceX&#39;s Starship vehicle. Nelson said he very much would like to have competition in the lander program, but, he said, &#34;That will depend on you all.&#34; In other words, if Congress appropriates substantially more funding for a lunar lander program for the 2022 budget, then NASA will be able to support development of two lunar landers.\n Several members of Congress tried to object to this idea. Brian Babin (R-Texas) noted that the Biden administration had only asked for $1.2 billion in the recent 2022 President&#39;s Budget Request for a Human Landing System. This is only about one-third of the amount the White House requested in the 2021 budget. &#34;Once you dig into the details, some concerning themes emerge,&#34; Babin said of the fiscal year 2022 NASA budget request, suggesting that it was really the White House that was not committed to Artemis.\n But Nelson was having none of this.\u00a0&#34;The Congress appropriated $850 million,&#34; Nelson told Babin. &#34;And so you can only get so many pounds of potatoes out of a five-pound sack. If you all are generous... then we&#39;re going to try to rev it up.&#34;\n So until NASA receives more money\u2014above and beyond the $1.2 billion budget request for the coming fiscal year\u2014it will have to press ahead with its current plan.\n  Another theme during the hearing was questions about whether private companies, such as SpaceX, could develop vehicles safe enough for human spaceflight. Nelson noted that SpaceX is already doing this with its Crew Dragon vehicle in low Earth orbit. Even if NASA is buying spaceflight as a service rather than owning the systems outright, the agency still has adequate supervision of safety, he said.\n But could private companies be counted on to deliver this service beyond low Earth orbit? This is what\u00a0Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) wanted to know. He cited the Apollo program (and NASA&#39;s development of the Apollo rockets and spacecraft) as a model Artemis should emulate.\n Nelson gently pushed back on this as well. &#34;In the Apollo program, we got to the Moon with American corporations,&#34; Nelson said. &#34;They did all the work. NASA supervised it. NASA had a reason to supervise it, because NASA&#39;s responsibility is to make sure it is safe. We&#39;re just continuing that in a different way.&#34;\n Nelson also reiterated that NASA is committed to developing the Human Landing System with fixed-price contracts, which should allow for shorter timelines and lower costs.", "posttime": "2021-06-24 01:55:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40,nasa,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u8d44\u52a9,chief", "title": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u9996\u5e2d\u63d0\u9192\u56fd\u4f1a\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u6ca1\u6709\u8d44\u52a9\u6708\u7403\u5170\u5fb7\u7684\u4eba ", "title_en": "NASA chief reminds Congress they\u2019re the ones not funding a lunar lander", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/nasa-expects-a-decision-on-a-lunar-lander-protest-by-early-august/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40", "nasa", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u8d44\u52a9", "chief"]}]
