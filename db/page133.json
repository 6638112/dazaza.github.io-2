more than three million specimens collected by botanists and naturalists over a span of 200 years. The project, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, is part of a larger, ongoing effort by natural history institutions worldwide to make their biological collections easily accessible to researchers studying broad patterns of evolution, extinction, range shifts, and climate change.    In a new study published in the journal  Applications in Plant Sciences, researchers involved in the project analyzed the rate at which   could be reliably photographed, digitized, and databased to assess how much similar efforts might cost in the future.\n  &#34;Everybody who was interested in this recognized very early on just how much labor and money we were talking about,&#34; said senior author Joey Shaw, associate professor of biology and herbarium curator at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.\n  Although digitization efforts had been underway at large institutions since the turn of the century, to date, no one had developed a robust framework for determining how much it cost to bring a set of collections online, noted Shaw.\n  &#34;No one had really been doing it at any sort of scale to understand how many specimens you could catalog per minute.&#34;\n  Such information can be vitally important for smaller institutions that rely on a dwindling fraction of administrative funding to maintain their collections. At universities and liberal arts colleges, these efforts are also heavily reliant on students, who perform the work for college research credit or as   employees, which comes with its own associated set of benefits and pitfalls.\n  Digitizing specimens is often the first direct experience students have with natural history, and, for many, it blossoms into a lifelong appreciation for biology. For some, as was the case for four authors on the study, this appreciation later culminates in graduate studies and careers in the natural sciences.\n  Student employment, however, is by nature transient, and resources invested in training students is often duplicated when they graduate or move on to other projects. So, at the outset of the project&#39;s conception, Shaw and his colleagues wanted to integrate into their analyses the lag associated with student training along with the subsequent increase in productivity as students gained experience.\n  The resulting estimates were incredibly precise, to the extent that Shaw and his colleagues could pinpoint exactly when classes let out by analyzing the rates at which specimen photographs were uploaded.\n  &#34;The students ended up being so efficient that the computer and internet speed actually starting slowing down the process when classes let out, when there&#39;s a surge of people picking up their phones,&#34; Shaw said.\n  With hundreds of thousands of specimens now freely accessible online, Shaw hopes that their data will help inform workers at other herbaria hoping to replicate their results. All of the partnering institutions in this study are members of the SouthEast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC), which supports more than 200 herbaria in the region that house a combined 15 million specimens, the majority of which have yet to be digitized.\n  With increasing amounts of habitat loss due to urbanization and deforestation, herbaria offer researchers a valuable window into ecosystems long-since developed or demolished. Many collections include specimens that are now extinct in the wild, while others have yielded the discovery of entirely new species. And as average global temperatures continue to rise, scientists are increasingly turning to herbaria collection data to analyze the effects climate change has already had on plant communities.\n  &#34;Biologists have accumulated species data from all over the world, in the form of biological specimens, since at least the Renaissance, and we continue this practice today,&#34; Shaw said. &#34;Our recent work has been to convert the data of these biological specimens into a freely accessible online database. It will be the largest dataset assembled on Earth&#39;s biodiversity, and we are only at the beginning of dreaming up research, conservation, and land management questions that will be answered with this database.&#34;        More information:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCaleb Powell et al, Estimating herbarium specimen digitization rates: Accounting for human experience,  Applications in Plant Sciences (2021).

"note_en": "The small chopper surpassed the 1-mile (1.6 km) mark of its total flight distance on Saturday (July 24) when soared over a rocky region called &#34;Raised Ridges&#34; at its Jezero Crater home. The sortie was the 10th and highest trip yet for Ingenuity, which arrived on Mars with NASA&#39;s  Perseverance rover in February. Ingenuity&#39;s  first flight occurred in April.\n  &#34;With the Mars Helicopter&#39;s flight success today, we crossed its 1-mile total distance flown to date,&#34; officials with NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California wrote in an  Instagram update late Saturday. JPL is home to the mission control for Perseverance and Ingenuity.\n    Flight 10 was the most challenging yet for Ingenuity, with 10 different waypoints for the helicopter to hit as it flew over its &#34;Raised Ridges&#34; target. It reached a maximum altitude of 40 feet (12 meters), a new record height, and flew about 310 feet (95 m). From take off to landing, the entire flight lasted 165.4 seconds. That&#39;s just under 3 minutes.\n  During the flight, Ingenuity was expected to snap a series of images, including ones that could help scientists create stereo images of the Raised Ridges rocks. The ridges are an area mission scientists are considering to send the Perseverance rover.\n &#34;We will be imaging Raised Ridges because it&#39;s an area that Perseverance scientists find intriguing and are considering visiting sometime in the future,&#34; JPL mission managers in a  July 23 status update.\n  Ingenuity is now parked on its seventh airfield on Mars as mission scientists examine telemetry and images from the flight.\n  Originally designed to fly four flights on Mars, the Ingenuity helicopter is the first vehicle to ever attempt powered flight on another world. The 4-lb. (1.8 kilograms) chopper arrived on Mars folded up in the belly of the Perseverance rover and was initially expected to fly only four flights over 30 Martian days (called sols) as a proof of concept.\n The solar-powered helicopter completed its primary mission in April, with NASA  extending its operations. In this extended phase, Ingenuity is being used for reconnaissance to seek out interesting spots for the Perseverance rover.\n &#34;Aerial scouting aids the Perseverance Mars rover team in deciding what moves to make next,&#34; JPL officials wrote in Saturday&#39;s  update.\n Email Tariq Malik at\u00a0tmalik@space.com\u00a0or follow him\u00a0@tariqjmalik.

"note_en": "For many of us, playing with Lego was a great pastime that eventually fell by the wayside as real-world responsibilities like school and work dulled our youthful spirit. Despite this, it remains legal for anyone to build with Lego, and there are many diehard fans that continue to create well into adulthood. YouTuber  BigPlanes is one such builder, who has recently outdone himself  by faithfully recreating the Airbus A380.\n As shared by  AutoEvolution, the build is a substantial one both in the effort involved and the actual physical size of the finished product. The model boasts a seven-foot wingspan, is six feet long, and the vertical stabilizer itself is a full three feet high. Over 40,000 parts went into constructing the plane, including several Lego motors for actuating the control surfaces and turning the engines.\n   The plane is finished in an authentic Emirates airline livery, with attention down to the finest details. The plane doesn&#39;t just look good on the outside either, with the entire interior modeled as well. Removing the roof of the plane reveals the cockpit and upper deck, home to first and business class. Underneath, the lower deck contains the economy class seats, in a suitably desert-themed color scheme just as you might see on a real Emirates flight. Even the flight attendants fit the theme, wearing the characteristic hat and scarf of the Emirates uniform.\n   If it&#39;s a part of an Emirates A380, you&#39;ll find it here. Details like the crew sleeping quarters, first-class bars, and luxury suites are all present. There&#39;s also nice touches like the foldable landing gear, the cargo hold, and a full 16 doors to access the aircraft, just like the real thing. The figurines, known as minifigs in the Lego world, all have plenty of personality, too. There&#39;s a couple of grandmas, a suspicious-looking interloper in coach, and one man who apparently boarded the flight after time traveling from the 19th Century. The latter&#39;s mustache is truly a sight to behold.\n  We&#39;re more used to seeing  impressive car builds from the Lego world, both from  the Danish blockmaker itself as well as from  more unofficial sources. Regardless, it goes to show just how much you can achieve if you master the Lego craft. Of course, the investment in both parts and time are significant, though; on top of the thousands of blocks, the build took a full 10 months to construct. If you&#39;re not doing anything for the next year or so, though, you could certainly take on such a build yourself. Just make sure you&#39;ve got room in the house.", "posttime": "2021-07-25 21:52:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u73b0\u573a,airbus,\u4e50\u9ad8",

solar-power unit,  Tesla Energy, asks a team of more than 20 employees to scour social media and reviews sites for customer complaints, a former employee told Insider.\n The person, who left the company this year and asked not to be named, said that as well as solving customers&#39; issues, the team tried to get customers to delete their posts.\n A separate team of nine people looked specifically for posts aimed at CEO Elon Musk, the ex-employee said. This chimes with a job ad Tesla Energy  put out in January for a &#34;Customer Support Specialist&#34; \u2014 the advert said applicants would address &#34;social media escalations&#34; aimed at Musk.\n A former manager at Tesla Energy, who worked at the company until last year and asked not to be named, also said a dedicated team searched for social-media complaints. &#34;They would basically just look up #TeslaEnergy, #Elon, just anything that has to do with Tesla and energy and Elon,&#34; they said.\n     On top of resolving the customer&#39;s issue, both employees said staff were instructed to politely ask customers to delete their social media complaints. Insider verified the identities and employment of both former employees.\n  The first former employee said they did not work on either of the social media complaint teams, and usually dealt with complaints that came through Tesla&#39;s customer-service channels.\n But they were also expected to scour the internet for unhappy customers in their &#34;downtime.&#34; The ex-employee estimated they dealt with an average of 18 complaints from customers from the regular customer service pipeline every day, so they had to find time around these to look for angry posts on social media.\n     &#34;There&#39;s almost no downtime and that&#39;s what makes it difficult,&#34; they said, adding that they worked during breaks to avoid getting swamped by deadlines.\n The former manager said that posting on social media was sometimes a faster way for customers to get the company to address complaints than going through customer service.\n A Tesla Energy customer, who asked not to be named, told Insider they received this exact advice from their dedicated project manager when they had problems with their solar roof contract.\n &#34;She told me to go online and complain ... on Twitter or Facebook, because she said the only thing this company listens to is social media sentiment,&#34; the customer said. The customer posted on Twitter, but said they didn&#39;t know if it made a difference as they were never specifically contacted by Tesla about it.\n     Tesla Energy customers told Insider in May that the company had ghosted them for weeks on end. One prospective customer that Insider spoke to for that report said a Tesla rep called him after he complained on  Twitter. The same customer told Insider in an email that nobody from Tesla asked him to take the tweet down.\n   Do you work at Tesla Energy?

look at cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin.\n Amazon is looking to add a digital currency and blockchain expert to its payments team, suggesting the company could be taking a more serious look at cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.\n According to  a recent job posting, Amazon&#39;s payments acceptance and experience team is seeking to hire an &#34;experienced product leader to develop Amazon&#39;s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap.&#34;\n  &#34;You will leverage your domain expertise in Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Cryptocurrency to develop the case for the capabilities which should be developed, drive overall vision and product strategy, and gain leadership buy-in and investment for new capabilities,&#34; according to the job posting, which was  previously reported by Insider.\n  An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement: &#34;We&#39;re inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon. We believe the future will be built on new technologies that enable modern, fast, and inexpensive payments, and hope to bring that future to Amazon customers as soon as possible.&#34;\n The company&#39;s cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, offers a service called  managed blockchain. But Amazon doesn&#39;t accept any cryptocurrencies as payment for its products. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy (then CEO of AWS)  said in 2017 that the company wasn&#39;t particularly focused on blockchain technology, though he acknowledged Amazon was &#34;watching it carefully.&#34;\n Digital currencies like bitcoin have grown in popularity in recent years, leading to more institutional adoption. Technology companies have also warmed up to cryptocurrency, including  Facebook, which has backed a digital currency project called Diem. In May,  Apple  said it was looking to hire a lead negotiator to strike partnerships with &#34;alternative payments&#34; partners, listing cryptocurrency as one area of potential job expertise.", "posttime": "2021-07-25 21:06:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe,amazon,\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u6570\u5b57,hiring", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u8058\u8bf7\u201c\u6570\u5b57\u8d27\u5e01\u548c\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u201d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4\u5bf9\u201c\u73b0\u4ee3\u201d\u652f\u4ed8\u611f\u5174\u8da3", "title_en": "Amazon's Hiring a 'Digital Currency and Blockchain' Lead, Confirms Interest in 'Modern' Payments", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/amazon-is-hiring-a-digital-currency-and-blockchain-expert.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u533a\u5757\u94fe", "amazon", "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u6570\u5b57", "hiring"]}]
