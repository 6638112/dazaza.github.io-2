Williams founded Sierra as a telecommunications consultancy in 1979, when he was twenty-five; the company was the body to which his wife Roberta gave breath. Her  Mystery House and  King’s Quest, interactive stories of murder and fairy-tale chivalry, set a course for Sierra through the rest of the twentieth century as the leading developer of adventure games.  King’s Quest begat  Leisure Suit Larry; an adults-only joke book by and for boomer dads;  Space Quest, a goofy, comic saunter through pop sci-fi, and for those who could not sanction such buffoonery, the fastidious cop procedural  Police Quest. The psychosexual horror of  Gabriel Knight and  Phantasmagoria; the pun-laden cultural exchange of  Quest for Glory: novelists have made careers writing about families with less personality than the Sierra product line.</p><p>在一本新出版的自传中，威廉姆斯还表示，他不想让你以自己的方式记住这家公司。威廉姆斯在1979年创立了Sierra，当时他25岁，当时他是一家电信咨询公司；他的妻子罗伯塔(Roberta)给了这家公司一口气。她的“神秘之家”和“国王的任务”，关于谋杀和童话骑士精神的互动故事，为塞拉在20世纪余下的时间里作为冒险游戏的领先开发商设定了道路。King‘s Quest诞生了休闲套装Larry；这是一本仅限成人阅读的笑话书，作者是婴儿潮一代的父亲，也是为婴儿潮一代的父亲们准备的；Space Quest是一本愚蠢的漫画漫步在流行科幻小说中，对于那些不能批准这种滑稽行为的人来说，还有挑剔的警察程序警察探索。加布里埃尔·奈特(Gabriel Knight)和幻影(Phantasmagoria)的性心理恐怖；充满双关语的文化交流--追求荣耀：小说家的职业生涯是写个性不如塞拉产品线的家庭。</p><p>  Williams wasn’t a game designer, but a visionary who saw the company always moving forward, leading the market with other genres, other software, online worlds connecting every kind of person. That Sierra is instead remembered, basically entirely, for these 2D adventure games from the eighties and nineties is, he says, because the company was killed.</p><p>威廉姆斯不是游戏设计师，而是一个有远见卓识的人，他看到公司一直在前进，用其他类型的软件和在线世界引领着市场，连接着各种类型的人。他说，人们之所以记住塞拉，基本上是因为这些80年代和90年代的2D冒险游戏，是因为公司被扼杀了。</p><p>   Williams has compared the end of Sierra to watching his child be tortured to death, but does not, in his book, offer a culprit, and has no real animosity for the most obvious candidate. Why is that? I spoke to Williams, and many others, to understand: if Sierra On-Line was murdered, why does Ken Williams seem to like the man who did it?</p><p>威廉姆斯曾将塞拉事件的结束比作眼睁睁看着他的孩子被拷打致死，但在他的书中，并没有提供罪魁祸首，也没有对最明显的候选人抱有真正的敌意。为什么会这样呢？我与威廉姆斯和其他许多人交谈，以了解：如果塞拉在线公司是被谋杀的，为什么肯·威廉姆斯似乎喜欢做这件事的人？</p><p>  Roberta Williams remembers it was Paris. In the lobby of  Le Bristol, before dinner with Sierra’s board of directors. It was the early 1990s. Sierra had gone public, and was fueling growth and share prices with aggressive acquisitions and early adoption of technologies like sound cards and compact discs that translated into lavish on-screen production value. Roberta’s vision as much as her husband’s had brought Sierra to this point; she was established not just as a creative leader in game design but a powerbroker in a public tech company making about a hundred million a year, with an international salesforce and a board that took meetings at luxury hotels abroad.</p><p>罗伯塔·威廉姆斯记得那是巴黎。在与塞拉董事会共进晚餐之前，在勒布里斯托尔的大堂。那是20世纪90年代初。Sierra已经上市，并通过积极收购和早期采用声卡和光盘等技术来推动增长和股价，这些技术转化为丰厚的屏幕生产价值。罗伯塔的远见和她丈夫的远见让塞拉走到了这一步；她不仅是游戏设计领域的创意领导者，而且是一家年收入约1亿零1年的公共科技公司的权力掮客，拥有一支国际销售队伍和一个在国外豪华酒店开会的董事会。</p><p>   Maybe that was why Walter Forbes came through the hotel lobby in jogging clothes and asked Roberta, can I talk to you alone?</p><p>也许这就是为什么沃尔特·福布斯穿着慢跑服穿过酒店大堂，问罗伯塔，我能和你单独谈谈吗？</p><p>  Forbes, who sat on Sierra’s board, was a greying, bushy-browed Harvard MBA and venture capitalist whose current gig was a company selling consumers complicated access to negotiated discounts at a variety of hospitality and shopping brands. The business was called Comp-U-Card, or CUC. (Time obviously has been unkind to the acronym.) Forbes had bought a seat on CUC’s board with a capital investment, then used the position to oust the founder.</p><p>福布斯是塞拉董事会的成员，是一位头发花白、眉毛浓密的哈佛MBA和风险投资家，他目前的工作是一家向消费者出售各种酒店和购物品牌谈判折扣的复杂渠道的公司。这项业务被称为Comp-U-Card，或CUC。(时间显然对这个缩写很不友好。)。福布斯用一笔资本投资购买了CUC董事会的一个席位，然后利用这一职位罢免了这位创始人。</p><p>   Forbes led Roberta to a quiet area of the lobby. He had two things to say. One, that he was on his way up to take a shower before dinner. Second, a question. “Have you and Ken ever thought about selling Sierra?”</p><p>福布斯把罗伯塔带到了大厅的一个安静区域。他有两件事要说。其一，他正要上楼去洗个澡，然后再吃晚饭。第二，一个问题。“你和肯有没有想过卖掉塞拉？”</p><p>   Sierra was a high-profile public company, so it wasn’t as though Roberta never expected the question. Just not out of the blue, from a CEO in jogging gear whose business model even Ken didn’t fully understand. And why was Forbes asking her, she wondered, without Ken there?</p><p>塞拉是一家备受瞩目的上市公司，所以罗伯塔并不是没有预料到这个问题。只是不是突如其来的，来自一位穿着慢跑装备的首席执行官，他的商业模式连肯都不完全理解。她想知道，为什么“福布斯”在没有肯在场的情况下问她？</p><p>      “But if you ever were,” he said, “what sort of price would you be looking at?”</p><p>“但如果你是，”他说，“你会考虑什么样的价格呢？”</p><p>   Or had he pulled her aside  because Ken wasn’t there? Because Ken was the CEO and Roberta the wife, the dreamer of castles and dragons at the kitchen table, whom Steven Levy described in his book  Hackers as “a demure, passive girl” so shy she “could hardly make a phone call”? Even while it was happening, Roberta suspected Forbes was looking for the weak link. Who’d blurt out something important, something she shouldn’t.</p><p>或者他把她拉到一边是因为肯不在那里？因为肯是首席执行官，而妻子罗伯塔是厨房餐桌上城堡和龙的梦想家，史蒂芬·利维(Steven Levy)在他的书“黑客”(Hacker)中将她描述为一个“端庄、被动的女孩”，如此害羞，以至于“几乎打不出电话”？即使在这件事发生的同时，罗伯塔也怀疑福布斯正在寻找薄弱的一环。谁会脱口而出一些重要的，她不应该说的话。</p><p>    “I often ask myself if I could have known that Walter Forbes was a crook,” writes Ken Williams.</p><p>肯·威廉姆斯(Ken Williams)写道：“我经常问自己，我是否能知道沃尔特·福布斯(Walter Forbes)是个骗子。”</p><p>   Williams is a forthright, burly programmer who’s had the same Tom Selleck mustache for forty years and used to be chastised by the readers of his company magazine for never smiling in photographs. As a child, his family fled rural Kentucky and the legacy of a grandfather suspected of bootlegging and murder, for the opportunity of California; Joan Didion’s dreamers of the golden dream.</p><p>威廉姆斯是一名直率、魁梧的程序员，他留着汤姆·塞莱克(Tom Selleck)的胡子已有40年之久，过去曾因在照片中从不微笑而被公司杂志的读者斥责。孩提时代，他的家人逃离肯塔基州的乡村，逃离涉嫌走私和谋杀的祖父留下的遗产，以换取加州的机会；琼·迪迪恩(Joan Didion)的黄金梦想梦想家。</p><p>   Williams’ dreams were uncomplicated. He wanted to be rich. “I wanted to live a different life than the one I grew up in,” he writes. “I read books about business executives who owned yachts and jets, and who hung out with beautiful models in fancy mansions.” Roberta was a beautiful California girl who lived “in the fancy side of town, in a pool”; on a double date, Ken downed a beer to show her he could piss farther than his friend. The simplistic plots of Roberta’s early  King’s Quests more or less mapped to Williams’ ambitions. Get the power. Get the girl.</p><p>威廉姆斯的梦并不复杂。他想发财。“我想过一种不同于我成长过程中的生活，”他写道。“我读过一些书，讲的是拥有游艇和喷气式飞机的企业高管，和漂亮模特在豪华豪宅里闲逛的故事。”罗伯塔是一个美丽的加州女孩，她住在“镇上花哨的一面，在游泳池里”；在一次四人约会中，肯喝下了一瓶啤酒，向她展示他可以比他的朋友撒尿得更远。罗伯塔早期国王任务的简单化情节或多或少映射到了威廉姆斯的野心上。接通电源。抓住那个女孩。</p><p>  He had programming acumen and unabashed salesmanship. “I was a selling machine. I loved selling and I especially loved making money. I claimed every sales award and couldn’t stop selling,” he writes about his college paper route.</p><p>他有编程头脑和厚颜无耻的推销本领。“我是一台卖东西的机器。我喜欢卖东西，尤其喜欢赚钱。我赢得了每一个销售奖，不能停止销售，“他写到他的大学报纸路线。</p><p>   In Sierra lore, he’s famous for hacking the late-‘70s Apple II to render black-and-white line art for Roberta’s  Mystery House. The work was not perfect, it had glitches—which Williams exploited to make the computer produce color graphics. He loved pushing the boundaries of technology, not just for its own sake but for the competitive advantage it could give his company.</p><p>在塞拉的传说中，他因侵入70年代末的苹果II，为罗伯塔的神秘之家绘制黑白线条艺术而闻名。这项工作并不完美，它有小故障-威廉姆斯利用这一点让计算机产生彩色图形。他喜欢突破技术的界限，不仅是因为它本身，也是因为它可以给他的公司带来竞争优势。</p><p>  By 1990, Sierra had established the Sierra Network, a proprietary social network with multiplayer games; they envisioned, essentially, the breadth of  Second Life with the mainstream appeal and brand integration of  Fortnite, but running on modems and servers housed in a local Wild West-themed restaurant. In Williams’ mind, the competition was never adventure game developers like LucasArts and Broderbund, but Microsoft and Disney.</p><p>到1990年，塞拉已经建立了塞拉网络，这是一个拥有多人游戏的专有社交网络；他们基本上设想了“第二人生”的广度，具有堡垒之夜的主流吸引力和品牌整合，但运行在当地一家以狂野西部为主题的餐厅里的调制解调器和服务器上。在威廉姆斯看来，竞争从来不是像卢卡斯艺术公司(LucasArts)和布罗德本德(Broderbund)这样的冒险游戏开发商，而是微软和迪士尼。</p><p>  By his late thirties, the backwoods of Kentucky were in the rear view. Williams had everything he’d ever wanted. On February 2, 1996, Walter Forbes surprised him with an offer for just a little bit more.</p><p>到了他快三十岁的时候，肯塔基州的边远地区已经成了他的后视线。威廉姆斯得到了他想要的一切。1996年2月2日，沃尔特·福布斯(Walter Forbes)出人意料地提出了一个稍微高一点的报价。</p><p>   Forbes was recommended to Williams by another board member, a fellow venture capitalist. Williams was approached by his first venture capitalist in 1982, when few people, himself included, quite understood what one was. “[But] she was a good salesman,” he writes, “and I was always open to new ideas.” A million dollars in exchange for 20% of the company seemed too good to be true, but Williams figured that such investment was necessary to Sierra&#39;s evolution into a grown-up business. Once he’d put one venture capitalist on the board, they multiplied like moneyed rabbits, culminating in the arrival of Forbes.</p><p>福布斯是由另一位董事会成员，一位风险投资家同事推荐给威廉姆斯的。1982年，威廉姆斯的第一位风险投资家找到了威廉姆斯，当时包括他自己在内的几乎没有人完全明白什么是风险投资家。“(但是)她是个优秀的推销员，”他写道，“我总是乐于接受新想法。”100万美元换取公司20%的股份似乎太好了，简直令人难以置信，但威廉姆斯认为，这样的投资对于塞拉发展成为一家成熟的企业是必要的。一旦他让一位风险资本家进入董事会，他们就会像有钱的兔子一样成倍增加，最终以福布斯的到来而告终。</p><p>   As a board member, Forbes advocated to grow Sierra by acquiring other software companies. It had paid off. In the financial year about to end, Sierra would declare an increase in revenues to $158 million with a net income of $17.8 million, up from a $7.9 million loss two years prior. But that was nothing to CUC, which in its last financial year had pulled in $1.4 billion in revenue. From coupons.</p><p>作为董事会成员，福布斯主张通过收购其他软件公司来发展塞拉。它得到了回报。在即将结束的财政年度，Sierra将宣布收入增加到1.58亿美元，净收入为1780万美元，高于两年前的亏损790万美元。但这对CUC来说算不了什么，该公司在上一财年实现了14亿美元的收入。从优惠券。</p><p>  Forbes drew Williams aside after a board meeting in Bellevue, Washington, and said CUC wanted in on software. Would Sierra consent to be acquired for, say, a billion dollars?</p><p>福布斯在华盛顿州贝尔维尤召开董事会会议后将威廉姆斯拉到一边，并表示CUC希望参与软件领域。比方说，塞拉会同意以10亿美元的价格被收购吗？</p><p>   Roberta had never warmed to Forbes, but he was Ken’s kind of guy: a flashy, charismatic and well-connected salesman who flew private jets, socialized with the likes of Bill Gates, made sweeping predictions about the online future, and even already had an internet retailer, NetMarket, in his pocket.</p><p>罗伯塔从未对“福布斯”感兴趣，但他是肯喜欢的那种人：他是一位风度翩翩、富有魅力、人脉深厚的推销员，他驾驶私人飞机，与比尔·盖茨(Bill Gates)等人交往，对在线未来做出全面预测，甚至口袋里已经有一家互联网零售商NetMarket。</p><p>   Forbes wanted CUC to enter and dominate the software market in one stroke, by acquiring not just Sierra, but LucasArts, Broderbund, the educational software maker Davidson and its subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment.  King’s Quest, Leisure Suit Larry, Monkey Island, Myst, Prince of Persia, Carmen Sandiego, Math Blaster and  WarCraft on the same balance sheet. (And, by November, Williams would have the rights to  Half-Life.) “He had come to Ken with the idea that this is kind of a done deal,” Roberta says, “and if you don’t do it, you’re really stupid, because this is going to be  big. Your stockholders and your board would not like it; it’s almost like you have to do it.”</p><p>福布斯希望CUC不仅收购Sierra，还收购LucasArts、Broderbund、教育软件制造商戴维森(Davidson)及其子公司暴雪娱乐(Blizzard Entertainment)，一举进入并主导软件市场。“国王的任务”、“休闲套装拉里”、“猴岛”、“神秘”、“波斯王子”、“卡门·桑迭戈”、“数学狂人”和“魔兽”都在同一资产负债表上。(到11月，威廉姆斯将拥有“半条命”的权利。)。罗伯塔说：“他来找肯的想法是，这是一种已经完成的交易，如果你不去做，你就真的很愚蠢，因为这将是一件大事。”你的股东和董事会不会喜欢的，你几乎必须这么做。“。</p><p>  On February 12, Williams negotiated with Forbes’ team an offer of a tax-free stock exchange, in which each share of Sierra stock would be exchanged for 1.225 shares of CUC stock; with CUC’s stock valued at approximately $48 per share, this represented a premium of about 69% over Sierra’s actual trading price. As offers go, it was an extremely generous one to Sierra’s shareholders and employees—who generally held some amount of Sierra stock as part of their compensation package—and Williams and Roberta, whose 9% stake in the company would increase in value to $64.8 million. (In CUC stock.) Forbes boasted to Williams that CUC had “a long history” of “beating Wall Street expectations”; that its stock “consistently outperformed the market.”</p><p>本月12日，威廉姆斯与福布斯团队就免税换股的提议进行了谈判，每股塞拉股票将换成1.225股国联股票，国联的股票价值约为每股48美元，这比塞拉的实际交易价格溢价约69%。就出价而言，这对Sierra的股东和员工来说是非常慷慨的-他们通常持有一定数量的Sierra股票作为薪酬方案的一部分-以及威廉姆斯和罗伯塔，他们持有公司9%的股份，价值将增加到6480万美元。(在CUC股票中。)。“福布斯”向威廉姆斯吹嘘说，CUC在“超越华尔街预期”方面有着“悠久的历史”；它的股票“一直跑赢大盘”。</p><p>  It was an offer Williams couldn’t refuse; at least not back in 1996, when he did not know the reason CUC consistently outperformed the market and could offer a billion dollars for Sierra was because it made numbers up.</p><p>这是威廉姆斯无法拒绝的报价；至少在1996年是这样，当时他不知道为什么CUC的表现一直好于市场，可以出价10亿美元收购Sierra是因为它编造了数字。</p><p>        “They hated it,” he remembers of the board’s reaction. “Because we were on a roll. We were unstoppable at that point.” If it was an acquisition where Sierra would retain control, that’d be one thing, but a merger with three major developers under a parent with no software experience? &#34;It was beyond bad inside Sierra.&#34;</p><p>“他们讨厌它，”他回忆起董事会的反应。“因为我们进展顺利。在这一点上，我们是不可阻挡的。“。如果这是一次收购，塞拉将保留控制权，这是一回事，但与一家没有软件经验的母公司旗下的三家主要开发商合并，在塞拉内部是非常糟糕的。</p><p>   “I didn’t want to sell it,” says Mike Brochu, a Texan who Williams hired in 1994 out of the finance world as Sierra’s chief financial officer, and who was promoted within a year to president and chief operating officer. A self-described hired gun, he was brought in to tighten up Sierra’s professional discipline and stuck around longer than intended after developing an unexpected affection for the business of game development and Williams personally. These days, Brochu talks about Sierra like a gunslinger about that ranch where he could have settled down.</p><p>“我不想卖掉它，”德克萨斯人迈克·布罗楚(Mike Brochu)说。1994年，威廉姆斯从金融界聘请他担任塞拉的首席财务官，并在一年内被提升为总裁兼首席运营官。他自称是一名受雇人员，他被请来加强塞拉的职业纪律，在对游戏开发业务和威廉姆斯个人产生了意想不到的喜爱后，他留在了这里的时间比预期的要长。这些天，Brochu像枪手一样谈论塞拉，谈到他本可以在那里定居的牧场。</p><p>   “I pleaded with him,” says Jerry Bowerman, an MBA and investment banker who Williams had hired for a kind of apprentice role, and later progressed to vice president of product development. “It made my hair stand up on the back of my neck. Here&#39;s this company that sells a coupon, and it’s now going to own two to three entertainment software companies?”</p><p>“我恳求过他，”杰里·鲍尔曼(Jerry Bowerman)说，他是一名MBA和投资银行家，威廉姆斯聘请他担任学徒角色，后来晋升为产品开发副总裁。“它把我的头发都竖起来了。这是一家销售优惠券的公司，现在它将拥有两到三家娱乐软件公司吗？“。</p><p>  Brochu and Bowerman were Williams’ lieutenants (“The three musketeers,” Bowerman says) and intimately involved in the crisis talks that followed Forbes’ offer, conducted in secret to avoid leaks that might impact the stock price.</p><p>布罗朱和鲍尔曼是威廉姆斯的副手(“三个火枪手，”鲍尔曼说)，他们密切参与了福布斯出价后的危机谈判，秘密进行，以避免可能影响股价的泄密。</p><p>   The other major voice in the room was Roberta. “I was not a fan of it. When Walter asked me did we ever think of selling the company and I said no, I meant it.” Like Brochu, she enjoyed what she was doing—at what other company and in what other time would a designer best known for fairy tale adventures be given millions of dollars, creative control, a brand new film studio with a live actors and full marketing support  to make a violent and sexual Grand Guignol with puzzles? Moreover, she didn’t really trust Forbes. “I always had a little bit of intuition about Walter. Not that he was a crook or anything like that, just…. take him with a grain of salt.”</p><p>房间里的另一个主要声音是罗伯塔。“我不是它的粉丝。当沃尔特问我我们有没有想过出售公司时，我说没有，我是认真的。“。和布罗朱一样，她也很享受自己正在做的事情--在其他什么公司，在其他什么时间，一个以童话冒险而闻名的设计师会获得数百万美元，创意控制权，一个全新的电影制片厂，有现场演员，并提供全面的营销支持，用拼图制作一个暴力的、性感的大吉诺尼？此外，她并不是真的信任“福布斯”。“我对沃尔特总是有一点直觉。不是说他是个骗子或类似的东西，只是…。。对他持保留态度。“。</p><p>  Roberta had tremendous influence on Ken’s decision-making, who particularly valued her read of people and character. “I can&#39;t tell you how many times in a meeting [where] we&#39;re trying to get Ken to make a decision, he would say ‘I need to sleep on it,’” says Bowerman. “That, I came to learn was code for, ‘I need to go home and talk it over with Roberta.’” Around 1984, the venture capitalists on Sierra’s board pushed a merger with an educational developer, Spinnaker, to which Roberta was opposed and Williams amenable. Roberta blew up the deal by arriving late to a meeting between Sierra and Spinnaker and declaring, “These guys are a joke.”</p><p>罗伯塔对肯的决策产生了巨大的影响，肯特别重视她对人物和性格的阅读。鲍尔曼说：“我记不清有多少次会议上我们试图让肯做出决定，他会说‘我需要再考虑一下’。”“我学到的意思是，‘我要回家和罗伯塔商量一下。’”1984年左右，塞拉董事会的风险资本家推动与教育开发商Spinnaker的合并，罗伯塔反对，威廉姆斯听从。罗伯塔在塞拉和斯宾纳克的一次会议上迟到，并宣称“这些家伙是个笑话”，从而破坏了这笔交易。</p><p>  It wasn’t just Roberta who had his ear. Ken advertised himself as a leader open to persuasion. “Ken would look you straight in the eye and say, ‘Here’s what I think, but I can be convinced otherwise,’” says Brochu. “And he meant it. If you had a better argument or a better way or a different idea, he would listen. It wasn’t his way or the highway.” When designer Jane Jensen pitched Williams her steamy voodoo mystery  Gabriel Knight,  he said, “Nobody wants to play something dark and depressing on the computer,” but trusted her enough to greenlight it. In 1996, in spite of a personal distaste for violent shooters, he saw the potential in, and agreed to publish,  Half-Life.</p><p>不只是罗伯塔有他的耳朵。肯宣传自己是一位乐于劝说的领导人。“肯会直视你的眼睛说，‘这是我的想法，但我可以相信不是这样的，’”布罗楚说。“他是认真的。如果你有更好的论点、更好的方法或不同的想法，他会听的。这不是他的方式，也不是高速公路。“。当设计师简·延森(Jane Jensen)向威廉姆斯推销她的热气腾腾的巫毒神秘加布里埃尔·奈特(Gabriel Knight)时，他说，“没有人想在电脑上玩黑暗和压抑的东西”，但他足够信任她，会给它开绿灯。1996年，尽管他个人对暴力枪手深恶痛绝，但他看到了“半条命”的潜力，并同意出版“半条命”。</p><p>   But Bowerman—who says Williams viewed him as a protégé; that Williams once said “I was like the son he never had, even though he had two sons”—struggled to make the case against CUC. “Nobody beats Wall Street estimates exactly by a penny 24 quarters in a row,” he remembers warning Williams of CUC. “That’s categorically impossible. Does not happen.”</p><p>但是鲍尔曼-他说威廉姆斯把他视为门徒；威廉姆斯曾经说过“我就像他从未有过的儿子，尽管他有两个儿子”-很难对CUC提起诉讼。“没有人连续24个季度比华尔街的估计高出一分钱，”他记得曾警告过威廉姆斯对CUC的看法。“这绝对是不可能的。不会发生的。“</p><p>  “Management has an obligation to look at the bigger picture and say, is this good for shareholders? At the time, I honestly thought it was.” The money was one thing, but CUC would theoretically provide the financial stability and resources for Sierra to continue its growth.</p><p>“管理层有义务着眼于大局，然后说，这对股东有利吗？当时，我真心实意地认为是这样的。“。资金是一回事，但从理论上讲，CUC将为Sierra提供财务稳定和资源，使其继续增长。</p><p>   “You&#39;d have to convince your shareholders that you can do a much better job if they didn&#39;t sell, and they&#39;re sitting on a pretty decent premium to sell. They invested in you for a reason and they want to make their money,” says Brochu, who saw the math, and did not fight the deal too hard.</p><p>“你必须让你的股东相信，如果他们不出售，你可以做得更好，而且他们坐拥相当可观的溢价出售。”他们投资你是有原因的，他们想赚钱，“布罗楚说，他明白了这一点，并没有对这笔交易进行太激烈的抗争。</p><p>  Roberta resisted. “But I was made to realize, and it was true,” she says, “that we kind of had to. The deal was so put-together and at the time Walter was very well thought of on Wall Street. CUC was a big deal and Walter was almost thought of as a god. I don’t know why, but he was.” And if a god offers you a billion dollar deal and you say no, “you could theoretically be sued by your shareholders.”</p><p>罗伯塔拒绝了。“但我不得不意识到，这是真的，”她说，“我们有点不得不这么做。这笔交易做得非常好，当时沃尔特在华尔街非常受欢迎。CUC是一件大事，沃尔特几乎被认为是神。我不知道为什么，但他确实是。“。如果上帝向你提供了10亿美元的交易，而你拒绝了，“理论上你可能会被你的股东起诉。”</p><p>  At least, you’d need an argument that the company would be better off not to sell. And Ken was tired.</p><p>至少，你需要一个论据，证明公司不出售会更好。而且肯也累了。</p><p>   “It was hard for Ken to try to really run and grow the company as it could be,” says Roberta. “He was experiencing a lot of stress and just didn&#39;t quite know what to do about that. So the idea for Ken of merging the company or selling was appealing to him just for that reason. I, on the other hand, was having a great time.”</p><p>罗伯塔说：“肯很难做到真正经营和发展公司。”“他承受着很大的压力，不知道该怎么办。”因此，肯合并或出售公司的想法就是因为这个原因而对他有吸引力的。另一方面，我玩得很开心。“。</p><p>   Williams’ natural competitiveness and excitement to do new things with computers made him a good fit to lead a public company that fed on growth and expansion, but maybe in the same way that a lightbulb is a good fit to lead electricity. It would never have been enough, not for Williams nor the board, for Sierra to have levelled out as, say, a boutique producer of high-quality adventure games. Sierra needed to stake out territory on the internet even before modems were common in households. It didn’t have a footprint in Europe, so it had to buy a French developer. It didn’t make racing games, so it had to buy a company that did. Repeat with image editing software, landscape design software, golf games, submarine games. (Who looks around and says “I simply must own a company that makes submarine games”?)</p><p>威廉姆斯天生的竞争力和对用计算机做新事物的兴奋使他非常适合领导一家依靠增长和扩张的上市公司，但可能就像灯泡非常适合引领电力一样。对于威廉姆斯和董事会来说，如果塞拉成为一家精品冒险游戏生产商，比如成为一家精品生产商，那是永远不够的。甚至在调制解调器在家庭中普及之前，塞拉就需要在互联网上监视领土。它在欧洲没有足迹，所以不得不收购一家法国开发商。它不做赛车游戏，所以它不得不买下一家做赛车游戏的公司。重复图片编辑软件、景观设计软件、高尔夫游戏、潜水艇游戏。(谁会环顾四周，说“我必须拥有一家制造潜水艇游戏的公司”？)。</p><p>  A sale, to a massive and prosperous company like CUC, would not only relieve Williams of the headaches of investors and quarterly reports but guarantee the livelihoods of his thousand employees and their families. Williams had nearly lost it all years before: in 1982, at the urging of Sierra’s first set of venture capitalists, he agreed to pivot from computer software to video game cartridges for, e.g., the Atari; an industry that brutally crashed months later. “He had to mortgage his house to make payroll and still had to lay off the majority of the team,” says Bowerman. “It profoundly scarred Ken and Roberta. They took the responsibility as board members and Ken as CEO like ten times more seriously after that.”</p><p>出售给CUC这样一家庞大而繁荣的公司，不仅会让威廉姆斯从投资者和季度报告中解脱出来，还会保证他的1000名员工及其家人的生计。威廉姆斯在几年前几乎失去了一切：1982年，在塞拉第一批风险资本家的敦促下，他同意从计算机软件转向视频游戏盒，例如雅达利(Atari)；这个行业在几个月后残酷崩溃。鲍尔曼说：“他不得不抵押他的房子来发工资，但仍然不得不解雇团队的大部分人。”“这给肯和罗伯塔留下了深刻的伤疤。在那之后，他们作为董事会成员和肯担任首席执行官的责任要严肃十倍。</p><p>  It didn’t necessarily matter that CUC was not the buyer Williams ever would have expected. “The chance to be part of a $2 billion company that I thought was going places was exciting,” he says. “If all that happened was I got stuck running Sierra, that would be perfectly fun. Then I could actually get closer to the product. Or if I flipped over and ran NetMarket and was going into shopping, that could be fun. And if the worst happened and I was flushed out entirely, and all I had was a lot of money, that would be fun, too.” As early as 1980, Williams was dreaming of the kind of success that would allow him and Roberta to retire at thirty. “As fun as developing games are, when you&#39;ve done it for, at that point, almost 18 years, that gets a little old.”</p><p>CUC不是威廉姆斯预期的买家，这并不一定重要。他说：“有机会成为一家市值20亿美元的公司的一部分，我认为它会取得成功，这是令人兴奋的。”“如果所发生的一切都是我在管理塞拉时陷入困境，那将是非常有趣的。这样我就可以更接近产品了。或者，如果我翻了个身，经营NetMarket，然后去购物，那可能会很有趣。如果最坏的情况发生了，我完全被赶走了，而我只有一大笔钱，那也会很有趣。“。早在1980年，威廉姆斯就梦想着能让他和罗伯塔在30岁退休。“尽管开发游戏很有趣，但如果你已经做了将近18年，那就有点陈旧了。”</p><p>  Anyway, he had no choice. “He has a fiduciary responsibility, and the board has a fiduciary responsibility, to take the offer seriously,” says Bowerman. “All that&#39;s true. What they never  did do was, like, hire an investment bank to say, is this actually a fair offer?”</p><p>不管怎样，他别无选择。鲍尔曼说：“他有信托责任，董事会也有信托责任，认真对待收购要约。”“这一切都是真的。他们从来没有做过的事情是，比如聘请一家投资银行来说，这真的是一个公平的报价吗？“。</p><p>   Had they done so, they’d have found only confirmation that CUC was a healthy, hungry start-up well-liked by Wall Street. While CUC wouldn’t let Sierra see its internal financial data, it did have assurances from the Big Four accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young that the books were not just in order but reflected a company so fabulously wealthy that it could pay for Sierra not with cash, but pieces of itself.</p><p>如果他们这样做了，他们只会发现CUC是一家深受华尔街欢迎的健康、饥渴的初创公司。尽管CUC不愿让Sierra查看其内部财务数据，但它确实得到了四大会计师事务所安永(Ernst&amp；Young)的保证，即这些账簿不仅是井然有序的，而且反映了一家极其富有的公司，它可以用自己的部分资金而不是现金来支付Sierra的费用。</p><p>         On February 20, 1996, less than three weeks after Forbes floated the idea, CUC announced that Sierra and Davidson were to be acquired for $1.06 and $1.14 billion respectively in CUC stock. Broderbund and LucasArts were out. “We just weren’t interested at their price, nor in being acquired for stock in their company,” says Broderbund founder Doug Carlston. “It was a short meeting.”</p><p>1996年2月20日，在福布斯提出这一想法不到三周后，CUC宣布将分别以10.6亿美元和11.4亿美元的CUC股票收购Sierra和Davidson。布罗德外滩和卢卡斯艺术公司出局了。Broderbund创始人道格·卡尔斯顿(Doug Carlston)表示：“我们对他们的价格不感兴趣，也对被收购为他们公司的股票不感兴趣。”“那是一次短暂的会议。”</p><p>   “This acquisition represents an opportunity for Sierra to capitalise on what we already do extremely well: develop the highest-quality interactive entertainment, education and productivity titles in the industry,” Williams said in a press release. “CUC brings potentially 40 million new consumers in the interactive marketplace. We’re looking forward to growing this business with CUC and reaching every one of those customers.”</p><p>威廉姆斯在一份新闻稿中说：“这次收购对Sierra来说是一个机会，可以利用我们已经做得非常好的东西：开发业内最高质量的互动娱乐、教育和生产力游戏。”他说：“CUC可能在互动市场带来4000万新消费者。我们期待着与CUC一起发展这项业务，并接触到这些客户中的每一个。“。</p><p>  CUC’s stock fell 17 percent. Sierra and Davidson’s stock, after an initial surge, followed it down.</p><p>CUC的股价下跌了17%。塞拉和戴维森的股票在最初飙升后，紧随其后下跌。</p><p>   Forbes assured the markets that all would be well. “Our goal is to be the largest content provider in the electronic marketplace,” he said. “There’s a new age coming—and if you believe in that then you have to like the moves we’re making.” When an analyst who downgraded CUC’s stock questioned the wisdom of a $2 billion acquisition as CUC’s first step into the software industry, Forbes defended the move as the literally only way CUC could do business. “We’re owners. We don’t like joint ventures…. we don’t want to share any of this.” Not only would the acquisition of Sierra and Davidson allow CUC to compete with Microsoft and Disney in entertainment and edutainment, Forbes said, but the developers could also work on “a more attractive interface” for the CUC website; so, there were lots of ways in which CUC would benefit.</p><p>福布斯向市场保证，一切都会好起来的。他说：“我们的目标是成为电子市场上最大的内容提供商。”“一个新时代即将到来--如果你相信这一点，那么你就必须喜欢我们正在采取的行动。”当一位下调CUC股票评级的分析师质疑以20亿美元收购CUC作为CUC进军软件行业的第一步是否明智时，福布斯为此举辩护，称这是CUC做生意的真正唯一途径。“我们是业主。我们不喜欢合资企业…。。我们不想分享这一切。“。福布斯说，收购Sierra和Davidson不仅可以让CUC在娱乐和教育娱乐方面与微软和迪士尼竞争，而且开发人员还可以为CUC网站开发“更有吸引力的界面”；因此，CUC将在很多方面受益。</p><p>   Reaction inside Sierra—where the news broke via an email from Williams shortly in advance of the press release—was puzzled. “I don’t think it’s inaccurate to say that none of us had any idea what CUC International was,” says a senior artist with Sierra at the time.</p><p>塞拉利昂内部的反应令人困惑-在新闻稿发布前不久，这一消息是通过威廉姆斯发来的电子邮件爆出的。“我不认为说我们都不知道CUC International是什么是不准确的，”当时Sierra的一位资深艺术家说。</p><p>   Craig Alexander, then the general manager of Sierra’s Oakhurst studio, agrees. “It seemed odd because they weren’t a media company. We always assumed we&#39;d be bought by a large media concern or Hollywood studio or a technology company.”</p><p>克雷格·亚历山大(Craig Alexander)当时是塞拉奥克赫斯特工作室的总经理，他对此表示赞同。“这看起来很奇怪，因为他们不是一家媒体公司。我们总是认为我们会被一家大型媒体公司、好莱坞制片厂或一家科技公司收购。“</p><p>  It scared Al Lowe, the creator of  Leisure Suit Larry. “When CUC took over, [they s</p><p>这吓坏了休闲服“拉里”的创造者艾尔·洛。“CUC接手的时候，(他们)。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vem8/inside-story-sierra-online-death-cuc-cendant-fraud">https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vem8/inside-story-sierra-online-death-cuc-cendant-fraud</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/欺诈案/">#欺诈案</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/captured/">#captured</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
