"note_en": "The proportion of people in England with coronavirus antibodies dropped by more than a quarter in the space of three months, researchers have revealed, fuelling concerns over reinfection.\n The findings come from  the React-2 study, which is based on home finger-prick antibody test results from random participants across all 314 local authorities.\n The first results, based on data from 100,000 people,  were released in August, revealing that about 6% of the population of England had the antibodies \u2013 protective proteins produced in response to an infection \u2013 although the team say that could be a slight underestimate.\n The new work \u2013 not yet peer-reviewed \u2013 extends this with more testing in two fresh cohorts, each yielding results from more than 100,000 adults.\n The results reveal that just 4.4% of those tested in the most recent round, between 15 and 28 September, had detectable coronavirus antibodies.\n \u201cAs a whole, these data suggest the possibility that decreasing population immunity will lead to an increased risk of reinfection as detectable antibodies decline in the population,\u201d said Graham Cooke, co-author of the report and professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London.\n The researchers said antibodies would be expected to decline over time, but just how long that takes, and how far levels fall, differ between viruses \u2013 factors that are important when it comes to how long protection lasts.\n Prof Wendy Barclay, chair of influenza virology at Imperial College London and co-author of the report, said it was not yet known what level of antibody is needed to protect someone from infection or reinfection with Covid-19, but experiments suggested it could be around the same level as the antibody test\u2019s threshold of detection.\n Some have raised the possibility that other components of the immune system might continue to offer protection even if antibodies have waned \u2013 such as T-cells, which can kill infected cells, or B memory cells, which can rapidly produce new antibodies. However, the team said it is too soon to know if that is the case, or for how long that protection might last, while it is difficult to measure levels of such T-cells.\n \u201cThe fact that people get reinfected regularly throughout their lives with seasonal coronaviruses [that cause common colds] suggests that the immunity, whether or not it is antibody mediated and/or T-cell mediated, probably isn\u2019t very long-lasting,\u201d said Barclay, who added that the team suspect the body reacts to infection with the new coronavirus in a similar way.\n But she said the new results do not necessarily mean that immunity arising from vaccination would be short-lived. \u201cA good vaccine may well be better than natural immunity.\u201d\n Barclay added that if a second infection did occur, immunological memory might mean it would be less severe than the first. But, she noted, data is currently lacking: only a few cases of reinfection have, so far,  been confirmed around the world.\n The team said antibodies were still good indicator of protection against reinfections, adding that the low prevalence of antibodies against the coronavirus and the rapid pace at which they had been shown to fall undermine the case for a herd immunity policy without a vaccine.\n \u201cWhen you think that 95 out of 100 people are unlikely to be immune and therefore likely to be susceptible, then we are a long, long way from anything resembling a population-level protection against onward transmission,\u201d said co-author Helen Ward, professor of public health at Imperial.\n The team said the lack of reinfections could be because it is difficult to confirm such cases \u2013 but it may also be that not enough time has passed for antibody levels to have declined to the point where most people are susceptible to reinfection.\n Cooke added that it remains

"note_en": "The skeptical world has lost a towering figure in James Randi, stage magician, lightning rod, and co-founder of the modern skeptical movement. In 1976, Randi joined philosopher Paul Kurtz, astronomer Carl Sagan, psychologist Ray Hyman, science writer Martin Gardner, and other motivated science advocates and critics of fringe claims to establish North America\u2019s first formal skeptical organization, then known as CSICOP\u2014the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (now called CSI, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry).\n Randi may be the single most influential person in the history of skepticism from the 1970s through the first decade of the 21 st century. His classic book  Flim-Flam! is a defining text for scientific skepticism. He pioneered many of skepticism\u2019s investigative techniques, and many of the arguments and attitudes of skeptical activists. While much of the skeptical literature consists of historical sleuthing and critical analysis, Randi was known for his distinct activist approach to confronting paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. His dramatic public expos\u00e9 of televangelist Peter Popoff remains one of the clearest modern examples of a fringe proponent unmasked by evidence gathered in the field. Most skeptics would describe Randi as a powerful inspiration for their own work, myself included.\n As an activist and showman, Randi certainly stood out. He adopted an outspoken, confrontational public persona beloved by his fans and detested by critics. Sagan said Randi was \u201caccurately self-described as an angry man.\u201d Science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote that \u201cRandi strikes back and when the pseudoscientists howl, he knows he has hit the mark.\u201d Beginning in 1964, Randi trumpeted a direct challenge to paranormal claimants: \u201cperform  any paranormal feat of  any kind under the proper observing conditions\u201d mutually agreed in advance, and win $10,000. That prize eventually grew to $1 million, yet it went unclaimed. Though many were tested, no one ever succeeded in demonstrating any paranormal power whatsoever.\n Randi leaves behind a husband and many devoted friends. I did not know Randi well, so I will leave it to his loved ones to eulogize him as a person. I\u2019ve been asked instead to briefly consider his legacy as a \u201cfounding father\u201d within the history of skepticism.\n That question is complex because people are complex. Like Houdini and Barnum before him, Randi was a showman first. His public persona was larger than life, while his private life was largely unknown for most of his career. He crafted and curated his public persona, from his chosen legal name to his choice to come out as a gay man at age 81.\n His activist work on the public stage is his most visible legacy. It would frankly be difficult to overstate the impact of his work upon organized skepticism. Randi\u2019s contributions to skepticism were foundational and monumental. It\u2019s likely that the worldwide network of skeptical organizations would never have happened without Randi\u2019s energy and example.\n At the same time, Randi\u2019s greatest contributions were sometimes controversial. His Project Alpha, for example, sent magicians undercover into a parapsychology lab where they posed as psychics. The lab was fooled completely, and embarrassed when Randi revealed the truth. Similarly, Randi hoaxed Australian media into giving press coverage to a fake guru Randi had invented from whole cloth. These projects were widely celebrated by skeptics. They also forced skeptics to consider questions such as the ethics of using deception in our work (a discussion that skeptics and our critics continue to this day).\n Magicians have been leaders and essential partners in the necessarily multidisciplinary study of paranormal claims since the days of Houdini. For decades, Randi was the preeminent skeptical magician. He approached paranormal claims with a vast store of specialized expert knowledge that scientists and journalists lack. No one was better qualified to expose, for example, the stage magic trickery of so-called \u201cpsychic surgeons\u201d who preyed upon cancer patients for money. By the same token, Randi was not a scientist. He sometimes misspoke on scientific questions in which he was not an expert. (His doubts regarding climate science led me to argue in 2009 that there are \u201climits on the kinds of scientific arguments into which skeptics may responsibly wade.\u201d)\n How do we even begin to weigh such a long and extraordinary career? Randi helped to create the movement I love. All skeptics are indebted to his work. So too are the people rescued from swindlers by Randi\u2019s debunking. Especially notable were his campaigns against the heartless frauds of psychic surgery and fake bomb detecting devices.\n His work will be discussed for decades as we continue what Randi began. He was one of skepticism\u2019s fiercest, most visible, and most influential advocates. The skeptical project will not be the same without him. His exit from this stage leaves us now to decide how the show must go on.\n Reflecting on Randi\u2019s successful debunking, Sagan said, \u201cit would be as dangerous to rely on him to expose all the quacks, humbugs, and bunkum in the world as it would be to believe those same charlatans.\u201d Randi was one man. He couldn\u2019t do everything, and he couldn\u2019t do it forever. And yet, the work of James Randi and his pioneering colleagues actually did change the world, at least a little bit. They directed our notice to urgent problems ignored by mainstream society. Their attempts to grapple with those problems provide examples for us to learn from, adapt, and expand. It falls on us to accept that challenge. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to get taken,\u201d Sagan said, \u201cwe need to do this job for ourselves.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-10-27 12:30:57", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "2020,\u5170\u8fea,randi", "title": "\u8a79\u59c6\u65af\u00b7\u5170\u8fea\u5728\u7eaa\u5ff5\u9986\uff0c1928-2020", "title_en": "James Randi in Memoriam, 1928\u20132020", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/20-10-24/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["2020", "\u5170\u8fea", "randi"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "531c0f2a2861270bb9325f0acdb5eb5a.jpg", "infoid": 1031403, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7279\u522b\u611f\u8c22Archive.org\u4e3b\u6301\u672c\u671f\u8282\u76ee\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5267\u96c6\u7684\u4e0b\u8f7d\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7f51\u5740\u627e\u5230\uff1ahttp://archive.org/details/computerchronicles", "note_en": "Special thanks to archive.org for hosting these episodes.

"note_en": "When Clara thinks about balancing her business as a sex worker and her life as a nursing student, she tries to channel the Disney character Hannah Montana.\n In the show, the main character Miley Stewart seems like a normal teenager, but she has a double life as pop star Hannah Montana, and Clara said keeping her own identities separate is the key.\n \u201cHannah Montana,\u201d said Clara, 20, who asked to keep her last name private over concerns about discrimination. \u201cBest of both worlds, but you keep them separate. You don\u2019t mix business with pleasure.\u201d\n Clara, who goes to college in Florida, was working in the university hospital as a patient care assistant until she said at least a dozen nurses caught the  coronavirus, and the hospital changed staffing, leaving Clara without a job. Without a paycheck and bills to pay, she decided to open an account on OnlyFans, a site known for homemade pornography. It\u2019s been a hectic couple of months for Clara, and even with the TV character in the back of her head, she said it\u2019s still been a challenge to manage it all.\n    \u201cI feel like I\u2019m walking on a tightrope with being blindfolded while holding two pounds of oranges... No matter where I\u2019m going, I\u2019m either going to fall to the right or to the left, but I have to keep going straight,\u201d she said.\n Clara is a first-generation American, the daughter of immigrants from Peru, and she\u2019s determined to use what she describes as the skills God gave her \u2014 a good brain, the ability to work hard, and an ease with people \u2014 to make her parents proud and show people that she\u2019s going somewhere. Sex work wasn\u2019t part of her plan, but it\u2019s helping her stay on the path to where she wants to go so long as she can just hold on to the oranges.\n \u201c[I\u2019m the kind of person] who thinks the whole world is watching, and what I\u2019m doing with OnlyFans, in a way it\u2019s true, said Clara. \u201cIt\u2019s the future that holds me down, and then expectations, making sure I don\u2019t disappoint anyone. What\u2019s going to happen now? You know.\u201d\n Stories of young women paying their way through school with sex work are nothing new, but in the seven months since the WHO declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic, online sex work \u2014 often left out of discussions of ride-hailing and food delivery apps \u2014 has become an increasingly mainstream facet of the gig economy, and people like Clara say the risks are worth it to keep themselves afloat.\n \u201cAt the end of the day, nobody is paying my rent for me, nobody\u2019s gonna pay my car insurance, my phone bill, my cat food. Nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I have to do it. And it\u2019s been so helpful.\u201d\n In the spring, when cities across the country were cheering each night to celebrate healthcare workers as heroes, Michelle Bleimeyer was fired from her job as a home-care nurse.\n Bleimeyer, 33, had been working for the family in western Massachusetts for about a year, caring for a 2-year-old with a chromosomal condition. She said she wasn\u2019t exactly sure why she\u2019d been fired, but the dynamic had changed when the child\u2019s parents started working from home.\n \u201cOne was an office manager and the other was an accountant... I think that was part of the problem. I think they were both a little bit on edge from working from home, and that\u2019s part of the reason why I got canned,\u201d she said.\n Bleimeyer got her nursing degree in 2009, and said it was hard to find a job in the aftermath of the Great Recession. \u201cI was panicking because my student loans were coming due, and I wound up really liking [home care],\u201d she said.\n    Bleimeyer had also been enrolled in a master\u2019s degree program in midwifery earlier this year, but failed a test around the same time she was fired. She was already struggling with depression and anxiety, so she decided it was time to take a break. She knew about OnlyFans from Twitter and decided to open an account when she realized the money she was getting from unemployment wasn\u2019t enough to live on.\n In many ways, this is how sex work has always functioned. \u201cPeople who were not sex workers started using OnlyFans and became sex workers due to losing their other jobs during COVID-19. So, again you see sex work, as it often is, as a sort of gig of last resort for people,\u201d said sex worker rights advocate Kate Zen. \u201cThis is the way it\u2019s always been. Not just during this pandemic. For a lot of the people ... sex work is not necessarily their only occupation, or the main occupation even, it\u2019s this emergency source of informal income that they can get when they\u2019re in a bind.\u201d\n But OnlyFans, which has been around since 2016 and was a popular source of alternative income for porn performers and other sex workers before the pandemic, has grown rapidly as shutdowns force people to stay home and the US faces  massive unemployment. It has attracted mainstream attention from celebrities likes  Beyonc\u00e9 and  Bella Thorne, and many more people like Bleimeyer and Clara who had not done sex work before.\n The site is a subscription platform that allows content creators to post paywalled photos and videos, chat with subscribers, and receive tips. While the content on the site is not all pornography, that is what it\u2019s most well known for.\n Bleimeyer, who is unabashed and frank about the ups and downs in her life, said that so far the experience has been better than she expected. She posts lingerie photos, nudes, and some videos, and when she chats with subscribers through messages, she says they have been more polite than she expected.\n \u201cActually they ask before they send their dick pics. It has been a very lovely experience,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was most surprised by.\u201d\n While the notion of sex work itself may be new to many users, Clara and others said posting on the site didn\u2019t feel like a huge leap because the content is not that different from what they\u2019re already posting on Twitter or Instagram.\n Mia, 32, who was 8 months pregnant when she lost her job as a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home in South Carolina in April, said it seemed obvious to make money off the pictures she was already posting.\n Mia, who asked to go by the name she uses on her OnlyFans account for privacy reasons, is not romantically involved with the baby\u2019s father at this point, and she said she posts provocative pictures on Twitter or Instagram. \u201cI guess to just garner attention and get people\u2019s curiosity going, like \u2018OK, I see what she\u2019s doing over there,\u2019\u201d she said.\n    Mia had some money saved, plus the stimulus money and her tax refund, and that was enough to survive on for a couple of months. But when she learned that a friend was making a lot of money on the platform, she figured: why not?\n \u201cI already post borderline explicit content on my social media, so why not get paid for it?\u201d she said.\n At a time of incredible financial precarity, some of the women who spoke to BuzzFeed News said that staying out of debt was also a priority. Student loan payments were  paused through September, but federal reserve officials  have warned for years that the level of student debt in the US,  which ballooned after the Great Recession, is unsustainable, and young women like Clara have taken that seriously.\n When Clara was unable to work at the hospital, she said people suggested she take out loans like other students, but she has heard horror stories from older nurses at the hospital about how much they\u2019re still paying on loans, and she wants nothing to do with that.\n \u201cAs soon as I graduate, I\u2019m going to owe so much more money than the original loan ... for a shitty apartment?\u201d she said. She also said she would have a higher payment because of her parents\u2019 poor credit, and that it just wasn\u2019t worth it. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled financially my whole life and I don\u2019t want the burden of, you know, trying to buy a house, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Aw shit, I have to pay my loan from five years ago.\u2019\u201d\n Nikki, another nursing student who is based in Detroit and also asked to go by the name she uses on her OnlyFans account for privacy reasons, had a similar perspective.\n Nikki decided to go back to school for a nursing program in May, after dropping out of college a few years ago when she got injured in a lacrosse game. She said she\u2019s always wanted to be a nurse, but the tuition fees are based on her father\u2019s salary even though he\u2019s not paying for school.\n \u201cI\u2019ve heard nothing but bad things about student loans... I just don\u2019t do the payments. I never have, I never really want to,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s stupid to pay extra for something I could just pay for now and pay less. Interest is crazy on school loans especially.\u201d\n Like other gig economy jobs, OnlyFans takes a cut of content creators\u2019 pay \u2014 20% \u2014 and offers no benefits to people making a living on the platform. But while many workers for companies like Uber and DoorDash said they had been  worse off during the pandemic, Nikki \u2014 who was working as an Uber driver before she started on OnlyFans \u2014 said making money from online sex work has made her life easier.\n Nikki enrolled in an accelerated nursing program this spring, and said managing the workload has been intense.\n \u201cI\u2019m in an accelerated program on top of everything so I\u2019m at a fast pace. It\u2019s just so crazy to balance that and work,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like four years in one...They just throw everything at you all at once. We were doing 4 chapters every class. We had two exams a week, it was just so much.\u201d\n She said she prefers the work on OnlyFans because it gives her more time to study.\n \u201cI\u2019ve definitely not had to do Uber as much, so I\u2019m home more, which helps with studying because I can study and be on OnlyFans at the same time,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not out driving all the time. It\u2019s easier just doing like one thing instead of being out and about all the time. It\u2019s made my life a lot easier.\u201d\n Mia, similarly, said she\u2019s using the money she makes on OnlyFans to supplement her savings while she pursues a nursing degree.\n Mia decided to pursue work as a certified nursing assistant after caring for her grandfather, who had Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and she had been doing the work for nine years before she was laid off in April.\n \u201cI used to care for my grandad back in 2011. When he passed away, my boyfriend at the time was saying, \u2018You know you could go to school for this type of stuff,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI [was] basically trying to fill that void because I had spent almost two years every day taking care of him because he lived next door to me.\u201d\n She said she\u2019s always wanted to pursue a nursing degree, but between work and family obligations there had never been enough time. Since she\u2019s only working about two hours a day on OnlyFans right now, she\u2019s using the extra time to enroll in a nursing program.\n \u201cThe plan [now] is to go from CNA [certified nursing assistant] to LPN [licensed practical nurse] to RN [registered nurse]\u2026 you know, life got in the way, I had a couple of children, the work schedule can be demanding,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a nurse since I was a teenager, but never took the time to apply myself.\u201d\n While some of the  newcomers during the pandemic say they only plan to be on the site temporarily, Mia said she\u2019s intending to stay on even after she gets her nursing degree.\n \u201cI\u2019m gonna continue doing it [once I get my LPN],\u201d she said. \u201cIf I promote myself every day for a year, it has to get somewhere, it has to take off at some point. I want to see the earning potential behind it.\u201d\n The promotion work is no small task. OnlyFans doesn\u2019t have a main page for viewers to discover new accounts to follow, so content creators must build a following and advertise through other social media accounts.\n Bleimeyer said she had picked up tips on how to use OnlyFans through groups on the encrypted chat app Telegram and in conversations on Twitter, and Nikki said she\u2019s been learning online too.\n Nikki has only been on the platform for a couple of weeks, and said she was nervous about what to post at first. Would it be too explicit? Not enough? Weird in some way? But she\u2019s been googling and got the hang of it from watching other people\u2019s accounts.\n \u201cI honestly watch YouTube videos and I search the internet. It\u2019s like studying,\u201d said Nikki.\n She also joined Reddit groups and learned about financial domination, a sexual fetish where submissives give money or gifts to their master, on Twitter. She didn\u2019t know anything about it, but it seemed like the best way to make money on OnlyFans, so she did some research.\n She said it was a little strange at first, but she has 58 \u201cslaves\u201d now, and it\u2019s paying off. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it though. I mean, I\u2019ll wake up some mornings and \u2014 this morning I woke up to a $100 Cash App just because,\u201d she said, laughing in amazement. \u201cThat\u2019s just one of my slaves. He pays me $100 every time he gets paid.\u201d\n The influx of newcomers to OnlyFans has created issues for more experienced sex workers who were already using the platform, or who joined after in-person work  became untenable in the spring. Referral bonuses  were cut in May because so many new users had joined, and rates for pay-per-view messages and tips  were capped in August.\n The changes have led to  growing suspicion that a platform made popular by sex workers is  once again abandoning them. But Zen said most of the experienced sex workers she had spoken with were still able to make good money on the platform despite their misgivings, and were primarily worried that the growing attention to the platform would lead to attempts by sex work abolitionists \u2014 who often frame their arguments in terms of the anti\u2013sex trafficking movement \u2014 to shut it down. One woman, Zen said, told her \u201cshe feels like it\u2019s only a matter of time before the anti-trafficking bandwagon is going to jump on it. So, her main concern is \u2018How do I make as much money as I can on this platform that\u2019s being good to me right now before the bubble bursts and it becomes bad again?\u2019\u201d\n While the increasing numbers of people using OnlyFans indicates some degree of widespread acceptance for online sex work, the work is still heavily stigmatized, and Heather Berg, an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the increased visibility of the platform has also produced a backlash.\n \u201cThe expected answer is that OnlyFans is mainstreaming, and I think that&#39;s partially true,\u201d Berg told BuzzFeed News via email in response to a question about growing acceptance of the platform. \u201cBut increased visibility has brought intensified pushback as much as it has more mainstream acceptance. We&#39;re seeing increased online harassment from incels and concern trolling from anti-sex worker feminists and conservatives.\u201d\n Bleimeyer said she had faced harassment online before she started the OnlyFans account, but that it\u2019s gotten significantly worse.\n \u201cIt\u2019s different than just being a woman online, because that\u2019s its own special harassment,\u201d said Bleimeyer. \u201cYou\u2019re more quickly discounted, you\u2019re just written off immediately to some people.\u201d\n  \u201cIt makes me really mad,\u201d said Clara. As a patient care assistant, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen people die, I\u2019ve seen people not being able to breathe. I\u2019ve seen coworkers wondering when we\u2019re going to have more people working because the workload has gotten so bad \u2026 I&#39;ve seen it all, and it\u2019s just insane when people try to bring me down, saying like, \u2018Oh why are you talking, you know nothing.\u2019 And it\u2019s actually like, \u2018Dude, I do.\u2019 I know a lot.\u201d\n While Bleimeyer is open about her work on OnlyFans \u2014 \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a midwife, it\u2019s kind of along the same lines\u201d \u2014 the other women who spoke to BuzzFeed News said they felt they had to keep at least some elements of their work a secret because they feared judgment or  consequences at work.\n \u201cGoing into nursing and OnlyFans is not really a great mix. You can get in trouble for that,\u201d Nikki said, adding that she believed it was possible to lose your license. \u201cI\u2019m very wary about it. I don\u2019t want to ever lose my license if I go to school and pay all this money.\u201d\n For Clara, the experience has created a distance with her classmates that she said is hard to overcome. \u201cI feel isolated from a lot of the students. I feel that if they were to find out \u2014 a lot of them do know, and they\u2019re OK with it \u2014 but I feel like if other people know, they\u2019re going to get a bad idea of me.\u201d\n Zen said it was too early to tell whether the growing numbers of online sex workers will mean anything for sex worker rights. She also cautioned that such discussions in the context of OnlyFans are limited because they focus on a legal form of sex work, but she thought it was hopeful that people were using the term \u201csex worker\u201d more openly.\n Clara has gone back to work in the hospital again and was doing sex work alongside her work as a patient care assistant, but she tested positive for COVID-19 after working with a patient who had it last week and is stuck at home again while she and her boyfriend recover.\n  \u201cJust because I\u2019m someone who\u2019s basically a cam girl doesn\u2019t mean that I deserve less than anybody else. People have to stop being so judgmental. We\u2019re in hard times right now. The way people choose to support themselves is their own business,\u201d she said.\n \u201cIf it\u2019s not hurting you, then why is it such a big deal?\u201d \u25cf", "posttime": "2020-10-27 11:57:35", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u62a4\u58eb,nurses", "title": "\u8fd9\u573a\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u8ba9\u62a4\u58eb\u4eec\u6210\u4e86\u82f1\u96c4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e5f\u8ba9\u4e00\u4e9b\u4eba\u8f6c\u5411OnlyFans\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u6536\u652f\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "title_en": "The Pandemic Made Nurses Heroes.

"note_en": "Kendall \u2014 who today runs  Moment, an app that helps users monitor device habits and reinforces positive screen-time behavior \u2014 isn\u2019t done campaigning against his former employer yet. On Friday morning, we talked with him about the FTC inching closer to filing an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook for its market power in social networking; what he thinks of the DOJ\u2019s separate  antitrust lawsuit against Google, filed last Tuesday; and how venture capital contributed to the \u201cunnatural\u201d ways the companies have commanded our attention \u2014 and advertisers\u2019 dollars along with it.\n   TC: Like everyone else, you wrestle with addition to the apps on your phone. At what point did you decide that you wanted to take a more public role in helping to identify the problem and potentially help solve it.\n TK:\u00a0 I\u2019ve always been interested in willpower, and the various things that weaken it. I have addiction in various parts of my family and extended family, and I\u2019ve seen up close substance abuse, drug abuse. And as I started to look at this problem, it felt really similar. It\u2019s the same shape and size as being addicted to drugs or having a behavioral addiction to food or shopping. But it didn\u2019t seem like anyone was treating this with the same gravity.\n TC: What has been the reaction of your colleagues to you turning the tables on this industry?\n TK: It has evolved in the sense that at the beginning of this, I was kinder to Facebook. When I started talking publicly about my work with  Moment,   I said, \u2018Look, I think that those folks are focused on the right issues. And I think they\u2019re going to solve the problem.\u2019 And I was out there throughout 2018, saying that. Now I\u2019ve gotten a lot more vocal [about the fact that] I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing enough. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happening quickly enough. I think they\u2019re absolutely negligent. And I think the negligence is really about not fully and accurately understanding what their platforms are doing to individuals and what their platforms are doing to society. I just do not think they have their arms around it in a complete way.\n Is that deliberate? Is that because they\u2019re delusional? I don\u2019t know. But I know that the impact is very serious. And they are not aligned with the rest of us in terms of how severe and significant that impact is.\n I think everyone within Facebook has confirmation bias, probably in the same way that I have confirmation bias. I am picking out the family at the restaurant that\u2019s not looking at each other and staring at their phones and thinking, \u2018Look at Facebook, it\u2019s ruining families.\u2019 That\u2019s my confirmation bias. I think their confirmation bias is \u2018There\u2019s so much good that Facebook has done and is doing for the world.\u2019 I can\u2019t dispute that, and I suspect that the leaders there are looking to those cases more often and dismissing the severity of the cases that we talk about, [including] arguably tipping the election in 2016, propagating conspiracy theories, propagating misinformation.\n  TK: I think that something has to change. What I would really like to see is the leaders of government all over the world, the consumers that really care about this issue, and then the leaders of the company get together and maybe at the start it\u2019s just a discussion about where we are. But if we could just agree on the common set of facts of the situation that we\u2019re in, and the impact that these platforms are having on our world, if we could just get some alignment in a non-adversarial dynamic, I believe that there is a path whereby [all three can] come together and say, \u2018Look, this doesn\u2019t work. The business model is incongruent with the long-term well-being of society, and therefore \u2014\u00a0 not unlike how fossil fuels are incongruent with the long-term prospects for Earth, we need to have a reckoning and then create and a path out of it.\n Strict regulation that\u2019s adversarial, I\u2019m not sure is going to solve the problem. And it\u2019s just going to be a drawn-out battle whereby more individuals are going to get sick [from addiction to their phones], and they\u2019re going to continue to wreak havoc on society.\n TC: If this antitrust action is not necessarily the answer, what potentially could be on the regulatory front, assuming these three are not going to come together on their own?\n TK: Congress and the Senate are looking really closely at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act that allows \u2014 and has allowed since it got put in place in 1996 \u2014 platforms like  Google   and Facebook to operate in a very different way than your traditional media company does, in that they\u2019re not liable for the content that shows up on their network.\n That seemed like a great idea in 1996. And it did foster a lot of innovation because these bulletin board and portal-ike services were able to grow unabated as they didn\u2019t have to deal with the liability issues on every piece of content that got posted on their platform. But you fast forward to today, it sure seems like one of the ways that we could solve misinformation and conspiracy theories and this tribalism that seems to take root by virtue of the social networks.\n If you rewind five or 10 years ago, the issue that really plagued Facebook and to a lesser extent, Google, was privacy. And the government threatened Facebook again and again and again, and it never did anything about it. And finally, in 2019, it assessed a $5 billion fine and then ongoing penalties beyond that\u00a0 for issues around privacy. And it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s been a year since those were put in place, and we haven\u2019t had any issues around privacy with Facebook.\n TC: You were tasked with developing Facebook\u2019s ad-driven business and coming up with a way for  Pinterest   to monetize its users. As someone who understands advertising as well as you do, what do you think about this case that the DOJ has brought against Google. What\u2019s your hot take?\n TK: If you\u2019re trying to start an online business, and you want to monetize that business through advertising, it\u2019s not impossible, but it is an incredibly steep uphill battle.\n Pinterest ultimately broke through when I was president of Pinterest and working on their revenue business. But the dominance of both Google and Facebook within advertising makes it really difficult for new entrants. The advertisers don\u2019t want to buy from you because they basically can get to anyone they want in a very effective way through Google and Facebook. And so what do they need Pinterest for? What do they need Snap for? Why do they need XYZZ startup tomorrow?\n That\u2019s on the advertising side. On the search side, Google has been stifling competition for years, and I mean that less in terms of allowing new entrants into search \u2014 although the government may be asserting that. I actually mean it in terms of content providers and publishers. They\u2019ve been stifling Yelp for years. They\u2019ve been basically trying to create these universal search boxes that provide the same local information that Yelp does. [Yelp] shows up organically\u00a0 when I search for sandwich shops in downtown San Mateo, but then [Google puts] their own stuff above it and push it down to create a wedge to hurt Yelp\u2019s business so that [Google] can support and build up their own local business. That\u2019s anti-competitive.\n TC: Along with running Moment, you\u2019ve been talking with startups that are addressing some of the issues we\u2019re seeing right now, including startups that tell you if a news outlet is left- and right-leaning so you\u2019re aware of any biases ahead of time. Would you ever raise a fund? We\u2019re starting to see these solo GPs raise  pretty enormous first-time funds and people seemingly just as happily entrust their money to you.\n TK. I think traditional venture capital, with traditional limited partners, and the typical timeframe of seven years from when the money goes in and the money needs to come out, created some of the problems that we have today. I think that companies are put in a position, once they take traditional venture capital, to do unnatural things and grow in unnatural ways. Absolutely the social networks that took venture capital felt the pressure at the board level from traditional venture capitalists to grow the user base faster and monetize it more quickly. And all those things led to this extractive business model that we\u2019re looking at today with a critical eye and saying, \u2018Oh, whoops, maybe this business model is creating an outcome that we don\u2019t really like.\u2019\n If I ever took outside money to do more serious professional-grade investing, I would only take it from wealthy individuals and there would be an explicit term that basically said, \u2018There\u2019s no time horizon. You don\u2019t get your money back in seven to 10 years necessarily.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the criteria you need to have if you\u2019re really going to do investing in a way that doesn\u2019t contribute to the problems and misaligned incentives that we\u2019re dealing with today.", "posttime": "2020-10-27 11:53:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

"note_en": "From the People of the United States of America: From time to time in human societies, things get so bad with the governments that we set up that we have to take a step back, stop being citizens of that government and just be basic humans again, loyal only to the primary needs of humanity. This is one of those times and it\u2019s only fair if we are going to take such a drastic step, that we first explain why. We owe everybody that.\n First of all, we  start by taking for granted that nobody\u2019s life should matter more than anyone else\u2019s. Everyone should have the right to live their life without people oppressing them. At minimum everyone should have the right to live. Nobody should be prevented from moving around freely or doing whatever they want as long as they are not causing harm to someone else. More than that, every human has the right to seek out things that bring them joy.\n  The whole reason we create governments is so that communities can come together and agree among themselves to set up structures that make sure that ALL the humans among them have access to these fundamental needs. If the structure that they set up stops functioning properly, if it becomes corrupted, if it stops serving the needs of the people, then it is critical that those humans be allowed to dismantle that structure in order to build one that does a better job. They need to be allowed to create new structures that are better at keeping them safe and happy.\n Nobody is suggesting that we take the dismantling of a government lightly. Things must have gotten really bad for this to be the only option left. Humans by nature don\u2019t like change and even when they\u2019re being harmed, they\u2019re more likely to just endure that harm than to break down a whole system that they\u2019re comfortable with and used to. But if things get so bad that the government starts abusing and harming its citizens in the name of gaining more power, it\u2019s every human\u2019s moral duty to burn that government down and build one that protects them better from would-be dictators.\n The American people are now facing down these exact same kinds of abuses. We have tried to be patient, but now we\u2019re fed up and the whole thing needs to come down.\n The entire Trump administration has been a long list of human and civil rights abuses and every single thing he has done has been to gain absolute power over the government.\n  He has interfered with state Governors\u2019 abilities to take care of their states in times of crisis, constantly breaking promises and being unreliable, just to wear them down so that they will do whatever he wants and then neglects them even when they do it.\n He has abused the powers of the Presidency, leveraging people\u2019s rights for business purposes.\n He turns public events into personal campaign stunts, wearing all the rational people down with his antics and erratic behavior\n He has repeatedly fired the heads of critical agencies for refusing to support his illegal and abusive orders.\n He routinely leaves these positions unfilled so that Congress doesn\u2019t have a formal say in confirming nominations. This allows him to keep unconfirmed lackeys at the heads of agencies where Congress can\u2019t touch them and they can sabotage and exploit the agencies without consequence, leaving the public without the safety those agencies provide. This causes chaos.\n He has imposed harsh immigration laws and is directly attacking the economies of States and cities that allow people he doesn\u2019t like into their borders.\n He has rigged the Judicial system, conspiring with Congress to break rules to secure his judge appointments.\n   He has flooded our cities with militarized personnel against the wishes of local populations and their governments.\n He glorifies violent law enforcement and elevates them above the rest of the humans in the country\n He has corrupted the Justice Department and Congress, using them to help him create a wholly unconstitutional set of policies\n He pardons and covers for crimes committed by these henchmen and refuses to allow any accountability for their treason\n     He has leveraged the oversized jurisdiction of the Border Patrol to impose their power on areas and people they were never intended to.\n He has trampled the rule of law, all protocol and policy. He shows no respect whatsoever for the institutions of government.\n   He has withdrawn us from crucial environmental treaties, deregulated industry, refused aid for wildfires, and has allowed over 200,000 people to die needlessly from a preventable pandemic\n  He turns dissidents against each other, threatening them with high crimes if they don\u2019t turn against their fellow protestors.\n He starts riots and leverages those brutal, merciless folks embedded in our every community, the police, whose known rules of engagement are \u201canyone who\u2019s not a cop can die\u201d\n Over and over again we have pointed these things out. We have complained. We have petitioned. We protested in the streets. None of this has worked and instead of listening to us, Trump has merely responded with increased violence. To put it plainly, a President whose every act is the same as a dictator isn\u2019t fit to run a country. And a government who lets him isn\u2019t fit to govern.\n We tried to be empathetic to those who support Trump and his nationalism. We tried to give them the heads up that they had made a terrible choice. We tried to remind them that many of them were immigrants and that they should think twice about how we deny others entry. We tried to appeal to their sense of honor. To their sense of civics. To their sense of duty. We tried to appeal to the fact that we\u2019re all in this together and that we are all one nation. We tried to explain that backing authoritarianism would be terrible for everyone. But they wouldn\u2019t listen. We tried. We wanted to fight Trump together. But they mock justice and shun the idea of unity. So nothing personal, but they picked a side.\n So we, the true Patriots of the United States of America, in the name of all that is good and holy, declare that we aren\u2019t standing for it anymore. This country failed to live up to its promises and it\u2019s time to build something new and better.\n   We intend to and we swear our lives, our money, and our sacred honor to each other.", "posttime": "2020-10-27 11:14:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,human,\u653f\u5e9c", "title": "\u65b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u5ba3\u8a00\u3002\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u65f6\u4e0d\u65f6\u5730", "title_en": "A New American Manifesto.

"note_en": "Law enforcement agencies across the United States are scrambling to secure funding for new cellphone-tracking equipment after the maker of the controversial \u201cStingray\u201d device quietly announced last year it would no longer sell equipment directly to local law enforcement.\n    L3Harris Technologies, formerly known as the Harris Corporation, notified police agencies last year that it planned to discontinue sales of its surveillance boxes at the local level, according to government records. Additionally, the company would no longer offer access to software upgrades or replacement parts, effectively slapping an expiration date on boxes currently in use. Any advancements in cellular technology, such as the rollout of 5G networks in most major U.S. cities, would render them obsolete.\n \u201cHarris Corporation has advised that effective June 2020 they will no longer provide cellular tracking technology and vital software updates,\u201d the Miami-Dade Police Department (MDPD) said in a report from May of this year.\n  Gizmodo has reviewed similar statements from local California agencies in Anaheim, Ventura County, and San Bernardino. \u201cThe Sheriff\u2019s Office cannot obtain upgrades to the current equipment in order to keep up with technological changes in the cellular telephone industry,\u201d a five-year \u201ccapital improvement plan\u201d drawn up in Ventura   reads. \u201cThe current equipment is no longer as useful as it was even two years ago, and will eventually become completely obsolete,\u201d it says.\n The MDPD and at least five other law enforcement agencies have turned to a North Carolina company named Tactical Support Equipment to supply new cell-site simulators known as the Nyxcell V800/F800 TAU\u2014surveillance technology manufactured by a Canadian firm named Octasic.\n   Minutes from a September 2019 Houston, Texas, city council meeting reference a   $528,452 payment to Tactical Support Equipment. The New York State Police purchased a \u201ccell site simulator\u201d for   $458,900 from the same company in 2018, according to the state comptroller\u2019s office. A deleted record from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which was cached by Google, requests over   $2.7 million in funding and states, \u201cOctasic manufactures the Nyxcell line of cellular equipment,\u201d adding the \u201conly vendor authorized to distribute Nyxcell hardware, software and associated training services in the United States is Tactical Support Equipment (TSE).\u201d\n Law enforcement of nearly every variety in the U.S. are known to use cell-site simulators to track the locations of cellphones. The devices, roughly the size of a suitcase, are typically mounted inside of police vehicles. They operate by masquerading as a cellular base station, or cell tower, which connects mobile devices to cellular networks.\n  Originally designed solely for military and national security use, the devices are colloquially known as \u201cStingrays\u201d after the popular model once manufactured by the Harris Corporation . Over the course of a decade, Harris has kept pace with evolving cellular standards by rolling out newer models such as the Hailstorm and the Crossbow, two devices that target 4G networks.\n Octasic\u2019s Nyxcell V800 can target most modern phones while maintaining the ability to capture older GSM devices. Florida\u2019s state police agency described the device, made for in-vehicle use, as capable of targeting eight frequency bands including GSM (2G), CDMA2000 (3G), and LTE (4G).\n  According to a   contract record reviewed by Gizmodo, the Nyxcell appears to include \u201ca mobile workstation\u201d capable of displaying and rendering maps to \u201creveal real time accurate locations of the target cellular device without manipulation of the device.\u201d\n From at least 2011 through 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation required local police departments to sign non-disclosure agreements when purchasing cell-site simulators. That may no longer be the case, according to Mike Katz-Lacabe, founder of the Center for Human Rights and Privacy, which has spent years researching and tracking the use of these devices.\n  Katz-Lacabe, who was first to discover that L3Harris had discontinued sales to local law enforcement, said the Alameda County District Attorney was not placed under an NDA when it purchased a Harris Hailstorm in 2016. \u201cWhen we spoke to the person responsible for handling the public records requests for the Alameda County District Attorney, we were informed that the FBI did not require an NDA prior to purchasing a [cell-site simulator] from Harris,\u201d he said.\n A 2018 patent assigned to Octasic claims that Nyxcell forces a connection with nearby mobile devices when its signal is stronger than the nearest legitimate cellular tower. Once connected, Nyxcell prompts devices to divulge information about its signal strength relative to nearby cell towers. These reported signal strengths (intra-frequency measurement reports) are then used to triangulate the position of a phone.\n  Octasic appears to lean heavily on the work of Indian engineers and scientists overseas. A self-published biography of the company notes that while the company is headquartered in Montreal, it has \u201cR&amp;D facilities in India,\u201d as well as a \u201cworldwide sales support network.\u201d   Nyxcell\u2019s website, which is only a single page requesting contact information, does not mention Octasic by name. Gizmodo was, however, able to recover domain records identifying Octasic as the owner.\n While police departments have each paid well over a half-million dollars for the equipment bundle, it appears that in a few instances agencies are funding their purchases using grants from the federal government. Departments have typically relied on grants in the past to purchase phone-tracking equipment, such as those offered through the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Urban Area Security Initiative.\n  The San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department assured county officials this year that purchase of a Nyxcell would be largely supported through grants, according to a   December 2019 financial impact report. The sheriff\u2019s office, which noted it uses cell-site simulators roughly 300 times per year, said of the Harris device: \u201cThe equipment and license are noticed to expire in 2020. As cell phone technology evolves, the current simulator has become obsolete. There is no option from the manufacturer to upgrade or replace parts and other components, nor to renew the service contract.\u201d\n Upgrading to the Nyxcell would cost roughly $636,500, the report says, but would be paid for through a U.S. Treasury fund derived from assets seized by the federal government and a 2018 High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) grant.\n  Seized assets and taxes levied against citizens caught with illegal narcotics have long been used to fund the purchase of cell-site simulators. In 2010, for example, North Carolina\u2019s State Bureau of Investigation used a \u201cdrug tax\u201d\u2014ranging anywhere from $3.50 per gram of marijuana to $50 per gram of cocaine\u2014to purchase Harris equipment for tracking Nextel phones.\n  Police records in multiple states describe Tactical Support Equipment (TSE) as the sole U.S. vendor from which authorities can purchase Nyxcell. TSE describes itself as a small, veteran-owned business \u201cwith extensive and real-world reconnaissance, surveillance and communications experience.\u201d Employees of the company, according to its self-published biography, served in various theaters of war dating back to the U.S. invasion of Panama in December 1989.\n  TSE has won numerous federal contracts and supplies military, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies with myriad surveillance and communications equipment, government records show.\n Octastic did not return multiple requests for comment when asked to respond to privacy concerns raised by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Organization, which has   described cell-site simulators as \u201cincredibly invasive surveillance technology\u201d often deployed secretly and without the knowledge of judges overseeing cases involving their use.\n  Calls and voicemail messages to Octastic Executive Chairman Michael Laurence and CEO Sebastien Leblanc went unanswered. The company did not respond to emails asking whether the devices included any technical safeguards intended to prevent potential abuse of the devices. Octasic did not respond when asked whether its devices are capable of intercepting text messages or the actual content of phone calls.\n Likewise, TSE managers and executives, asked about technical safeguards and whether its police customers are contractually restricted from discussing the technology publicly, did not respond to questions by email. Reached by phone on Thursday, a TSE employee said that everyone at the company was \u201cin a meeting.\u201d No one returned our calls.\n  \u201cIt is important that the public is informed about these powerful and expensive surveillance devices, especially when local police departments rarely understand how the technology works,\u201d Katz-Lacabe said. \u201cWhen Harris Corporation was selling these to state and local law enforcement agencies, the software only allowed tracking of cell phones.\u201d But the \u201cfederal version,\u201d he noted, \u201cenabled them to be used to intercept phone calls and text messages.\u201d\n  These newer cell-site simulators haven\u2019t received the same level of scrutiny from reporters and independent researchers. With its creator and distributor so far refusing to answer any questions, we are unable to report on Nyxcell\u2019s full range of capabilities at this time.", "posttime": "2020-10-27 10:54:11",

"note_en": "Facebook VP of Play Jason Rubin discusses the company&#39;s battles with Apple, the technical challenges of delivering cloud games, Microsoft&#39;s deal to distribute its own xCloud games, and the importance of the new Player Name policy.\n     Facebook on Monday \t revealed a broad new cloud gaming strategy aimed at upending the lucrative and fast-growing mobile games ecosystem. While other tech behemoths \u2014 including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia \u2014 have aimed their cloud gaming strategies at big-budget &#34;AAA&#34; titles, Facebook will attempt to leverage new data centers and its planet-spanning user base to reshape the world of casual free-to-play games.\n  As part of the new gaming initiative, \t Facebook will allow users to create an alternate &#34;Player Name.&#34; While the company has allowed pseudonyms in the past in limited cases, Facebook has long emphasized the importance of real-name identities across its services. With Player Names, Facebook appears to be officially embracing selectable alternate identities for the first time.\n The initial goal for the new cloud service is to let users instantly play full mobile-quality games within Facebook without having to download them from an app store. And along with instant gameplay comes instant marketing: Now, a Facebook ad for a video game may sometimes let users actually play the game itself.\n  Broadly, Monday&#39;s announcement appears meant to reposition Facebook as a major mass-market gaming platform for the first time since the FarmVille era a decade ago. When Facebook shifted to a mobile-first strategy, games largely fell by the wayside for the company. Yet mobile is generally thought to represent at least half of the global $160 billion video game industry.\n Facebook \t acquired the Spanish cloud gaming company PlayGiga for about $80 million last year, but the contours of Facebook&#39;s overall cloud gaming plans had remained shrouded until now.\n &#34;If you want to reach more of the gaming audience, you have to deliver more advanced graphics and experiences, and that is the cloud platform,&#34; Jason Rubin, Facebook&#39;s VP of Play, said in an interview last week. (Rubin, a longtime game executive, transferred from Facebook&#39;s virtual reality operation to its Gaming division in the spring.) &#34;You want to be able to deliver whatever type of game you want to deliver to the widest possible audience. This is the answer to that problem.&#34;\n Unsurprisingly, Facebook&#39;s new gaming service will not work on Apple&#39;s iOS, at least for now. Apple is essentially locked in a war with much of the rest of the tech and gaming industries about its rules for games and commerce on its mobile devices. Instead, the service will launch on Facebook&#39;s Android and desktop versions.\n &#34;What&#39;s unique about Facebook&#39;s approach is the focus on free-to-play games,&#34; said Lewis Ward, an analyst at IDC. &#34;The fact they&#39;re going to support ads in the service right out of the gate is also unique. And the orientation toward mobile games is also pretty distinct.&#34;\n  Facebook appears to be building its new cloud gaming data centers around graphics systems from Nvidia, though neither company would comment on a vendor relationship. As Facebook expands its cloud gaming-ready data centers, the service will be available initially in some Western, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern parts of the United States.\n Cloud-streamed games available this week include Asphalt 9: Legends by Gameloft; Mobile Legends: Adventure by Moonton; PGA TOUR Golf Shootout by Concrete Software; and Solitaire: Arthur&#39;s Tale by Qublix Games. Though Facebook invested heavily to subsidize individual games for its Oculus VR devices, Rubin was cagey about whether the company would also fund and develop its own cloud games.\n Separately, companies initially advertising on the service include 2K Games, FunPlus, Gameloft, Glu Mobile, Gram Games, Rovio and Wildlife Studios.\n In a wide-ranging conversation last week, Rubin explained more about the strategy, the company&#39;s battles with Apple, the technical challenges of delivering cloud games, \t Microsoft&#39;s deal to distribute its own xCloud games on Facebook, and the importance of the new identity policy.\n   Over time, it&#39;s become more and more evident that the communities built around gaming are becoming bigger and a larger and larger part of people&#39;s lives.\n  We have a 700-million-person gaming community on Facebook today, but we think that&#39;s a billion-person community, if not more, and the reason we&#39;re being held back is that our gameplay is limited to HTML5. Current games are extremely limited by what HTML5 can deliver from a technical standpoint, and so they tend to be simple, hyper-casual type of games. Words with Friends is a perfect example of something that does really well on HTML5.\n But if you want to reach more of the gaming audience, you have to deliver more advanced graphics and experiences, and that is the cloud platform. We don&#39;t own a phone manufacturing plant. We don&#39;t want to put out a game console. That&#39;s not what Facebook is about. Facebook wants to deliver entertainment to you instantly, connections to you instantly, community to you instantly. And if you put all those things together, you want to be able to deliver whatever type of game you want to deliver to the widest possible audience. This is the answer to that problem.\n [At this point in the interview, Rubin starts playing Asphalt 9, a mobile driving game, on Facebook.]\n Now I don&#39;t have to download this and can play as much as I want within Facebook. What&#39;s important is that it&#39;s free to play because we don&#39;t want to charge anyone anything. We can always go to the app store and download it and keep their progression and keep their purchases. We&#39;re not trying to replace app stores.\n  [Rubin returns to the game menu and in a few seconds is playing Golf Shootout.]\n Notice how quickly I can switch games. App stores don&#39;t provide this. So there&#39;s a huge amount of consumer upside here. And that always translates to developer upside because they can put more games in front of people.\n  Yes. We also offer cloud-playable ads. So imagine a world where you get a notification about your friend: &#34;Jill just shot 4-under on this course.&#34; Or, better yet. &#34;Jill is playing on Hole 2 right now. Would you like to play with Jill?&#34; You say yes and now you and Jill are playing golf together live, right from your feed.\n And it was an ad paid for, perhaps, by the golf company or it was a post made by your friend. Nobody else can deliver that. So we think this is revolutionary for games and are frustrated that we can&#39;t bring it to all gamers on all platforms and are being restricted from certain mobile platforms.\n When you talk about frustration, obviously you mean Apple. Give me a little bit more texture about why you think it&#39;s unfair and how you think Apple may be treating games differently than other forms of content.\n Apple treats games entirely differently from every other form of content. I can go into many ways.\n I can&#39;t promote anything on iOS. I&#39;m not allowed to have in-app purchases. And, by the way, if you play this golf game on our cloud platform on Android, we&#39;re giving the 30% to Google and the 70% to the developer. But we&#39;re giving Google the money. So this isn&#39;t a question of money we&#39;re talking about. I can&#39;t give Apple the money. They won&#39;t let me do that. So any game based on IAP \u2014 golf being one of them \u2014 I can&#39;t deliver because the developer can&#39;t make their money.\n  Next, it&#39;s a cloud game. I&#39;m not allowed to have a cloud game inside Facebook. Oh, I can do it on the open web, great, but I can&#39;t point to that game from Facebook, so all of my discoverability is now out. Apple&#39;s rules are set up to make it so we don&#39;t know what we can deliver. We intend to find a way, but it&#39;s really, really hard.\n How fully fledged is the business model at this point, in terms of things you&#39;re sure about versus areas where you think you might have to adjust?\n Certain aspects of the business model are very easy to understand. We have a massive game advertising business. One of the hardest things for an advertisement or an advertiser to do is get you to leave Facebook, because you came there to see what your friends are doing, catch up on some news or whatever else, not to jump into an app store and download. So our ability to deliver game content right then and there without leaving the Facebook environment is really powerful.\n  So that part of the business is very easy to understand. The challenges that we might face are in places where we don&#39;t understand the ruleset in terms of what some of the platforms are restricting us from doing.\n  So if you can turn up an interactive playable ad in the exact same form factor as a current static ad, how much more is that worth to the publisher?\n Our belief is that it&#39;s instrumentally different. And by the way, the cost of building a cloud ad \u2014 even though they&#39;re far more complex and cool from a user&#39;s perspective \u2014 is a lot cheaper because it&#39;s just your game. You don&#39;t have to go build in HTML5 or do a video.\n Let&#39;s get to what was required technically here. Facebook obviously runs one of the largest private clouds in the world, but I&#39;m sure gaming presented fundamentally different challenges than what you&#39;ve been doing over the last 15 years.\n  Just in terms of the technical requirements and latency and responsiveness and the basic data center provisioning side of this, where are you?\n Right, so the biggest difference between the data centers that we had in the past and the data centers required to do this is that modern games use GPUs to push out their polygons, and if you try to run these games on CPUs, which we did originally because that was the easiest thing for us to get mocked up, the performance just isn&#39;t there. A beefy fan-driven GPU is where all the processing needs to happen to get the graphics fidelity of something like an Asphalt 9, and there&#39;s nothing else that Facebook had been doing in the past that really drove us to need those servers. Streaming video, for example, is a CPU-intensive task, not a GPU-intensive task.\n  So we&#39;ve had to install these GPUs and their primary purpose is for cloud streaming games. That is the biggest change we&#39;ve had to make.\n Big publishers now are being bombarded by all kinds of different cloud gaming business models and opportunities. Everyone&#39;s got a different proposition, from Stadia or Luna to xCloud or Nvidia or Shadow or Sony. So they have the pick of the litter in terms of the models and distribution channels that work for them. How are you differentiating what you&#39;re offering to publishers and developers from all the other cloud offerings?\n If you put all of the cloud streaming opportunities on a chart, we would be farthest away from all the rest of them in the sense that we&#39;re targeting free-to-play. We&#39;re not promising 4K or 60 frames a second. We don&#39;t have any premium titles at all. Many of our titles will be mobile. I just don&#39;t think the same developer is getting courted.\n  There&#39;s obviously crossover, but I think we&#39;re pretty far away from everybody else and so really the opportunity has taken some of the partners by surprise, like, &#34;We thought everyone was going to be going after the AAA stuff, and here you are focusing on the mobile side.&#34; And the mobile side is bigger from a business standpoint.\n  So we will be running demos of xCloud games, but they will be running on their infrastructure so they&#39;re responsible for the quality, which will be awesome. They&#39;re figuring out how to do advertising to get people excited about things on Facebook like other developers are, it&#39;s just that those products are Microsoft Xbox products. It&#39;s a great opportunity for them to reach our users.\n How aggressive will Facebook be in commissioning and developing your own original games for this platform, in addition to distributing content from others?\n Well we did do that in VR, 100%, because nobody was going to take the flier. I&#39;m not sure we do on Facebook Gaming.\n One of the reasons we needed to seed things in VR is because it was going to take a long time to get to the massive user base. This product&#39;s the opposite. People are just going to stumble on cloud games in the Facebook app they already use, so this product can meet a massive user base overnight. And because of that massive audience, there is a reason for developers and publishers to do this.\n  On the new Player Names, it&#39;s seemed that for most of the company&#39;s history there has been an insistence on users using real names. Is this the first time that Facebook is allowing official alternate identities?\n At one point Facebook made a real push to only use your real name, and with the LGBT community, specifically the transgender community, there were some issues with that. And I believe we rolled back policies in that space a few years ago.\n Additionally, I think there are some countries, and I would point to Japan as one of them, where being your real self and being able to express yourself are not necessarily considered in the same way as they are in the West. And we&#39;ve found that allowing people to use alternate names has increased their ability to share.\n  But even when Facebook allows a pseudonym, there has not been the ability to officially switch identities or screen names on the platform. So this seems to be a different philosophy here in terms of leaning into multiple switchable personalities for different contexts rather than requiring one identity across all contexts.\n Right. So now, my Player Name on Facebook is MadMac. Mac was a dog of our family that passed away a couple weeks ago. So MadMac is completely glued to Jason Rubin. If I misbehave, Facebook always knows that MadMac is Jason Rubin and anything that we can do to Jason Rubin can be done to MadMac. There is no anonymity, 100% not.\n  Now when it comes to true pseudonymity \u2014 which is to say, &#34;Who else can know who I am?&#34; \u2014 there are going to be different kinds of levels of that in different places but we&#39;re not really shooting for true pseudonymity, either.\n We are hoping that if I want to play golf and golf is a game that decided it would put me in a course with a bunch of people I don&#39;t know, that I can be MadMac so that my real name doesn&#39;t show up there, but if I misbehave both Concrete [the game&#39;s developer] and Facebook know that MadMac and Jason Rubin misbehaved.\n Now when you want to connect with fellow players in the game and you&#39;re playing as MadMac, when you connect with some other pseudonym and want to make friends, are your real identities on both sides mutually revealed at that point?\n Yes exactly. If the two of us are playing in an open tournament in golf, you may not know who I am, but if I decide that I enjoy playing with you, and we decided to be friends, we are effectively choosing then to let each other know who we are. We&#39;re trying to encourage the best possible behavior, and this happens in gaming groups all the time.\n  And as this rolls around Facebook in various ways, there are really good reasons for safety to have this and for people to be able to express themselves and be involved in community. The key takeaway here is that true anonymity \u2014 i.e. I sign up for an account with a name that&#39;s completely unverified and I go harass people \u2014 is 100% not on the table here in any way.\n So in order to make a Player Name, I have to have a real account first\n Correct. And if you lie on your real account, you&#39;re in violation of policies, and we&#39;re aware of you from the beginning.\n Tell me about the process: &#34;How do we encourage positive behavior, hopefully, through how we design our identity policies?&#34;\n There are a lot of really good reasons to allow a very tight pseudonymity on a platform like Facebook. For example, let&#39;s say that I want to join an AA group. Gaming is just one of the places we&#39;re experimenting first because there is an even higher risk if you&#39;re talking about a drug addiction or a suicide hotline.\n  If MadMac doesn&#39;t work out, and for some reason somewhere down the line we had to change policies, I&#39;ll be a lot less upset than if I was in a suicide hotline and something happens, right? There are some great places on Facebook to allow pseudonymity, for human health and for other things. We just have to get it right.", "posttime": "2020-10-27 10:35:13", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,facebook,\u6e38\u620f,\u82f9\u679c", "title": "\u91c7\u8bbfFacebook Play\u526f\u603b\u88c1\u6770\u68ee\u00b7\u9c81\u5bbe(Jason Rubin)\uff0c\u8c08\u5230Facebook Gaming\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u4e0e\u82f9\u679c\u7684\u6597\u4e89\uff0c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e91\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u591a", "title_en": "Interview with Jason Rubin, Facebook's VP of Play, on Facebook Gaming, the company's battles with Apple, technical challenges of delivering cloud games, more", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.protocol.com/facebook-cloud-gaming", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "facebook", "\u6e38\u620f", "\u82f9\u679c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "07449f3ce34dbe1e624e4a624ab8bc20.png", "infoid": 1031394, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5468\u4e94\u83b7\u6089\uff0cgihub\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u5220\u9664\u4e86youtube\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u534f\u4f5c\u8bba\u575b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e00\u76f4\u6258\u7ba1\u5728https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl.\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u884c\u52a8\u662f\u5bf9DMCA Section512\u901a\u77e5\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u5373RIAA\u53d1\u51fa\u8981\u6c42\u5220\u9664youtube-dl\u7684\u901a\u77e5\uff0c\u8be5\u901a\u77e5\u662f\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u81ea\u7531\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8bb8\u53ef\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7gihub\u53d1\u5e03\u548c\u5206\u53d1\u7684\u3002\u5728\u901a\u77e5\u4e2d\uff0cRIAA\u63f4\u5f15DMCA\u7b2c1201\u6761(\u5220\u9664\u6570\u5b57\u9650\u5236\u90e8\u5206)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u79fb\u9664YouTube-dl\uff1b\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1youtube-dl\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u6743\u7528\u9014\u3002YouTube-dl\u6709\u5f88\u591a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4e3e\u51e0\u4e2a\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u529f\u80fd\uff1a", "note_en": "We learned on Friday that GitHub  removed youtube-dl&#39;s primary collaboration forum and code repository from their site, which had been hosted at  https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl.

"note_en": "Amid the pandemic,  buyers have been flocking to the lakefront crescent in southwest Michigan and northwest Indiana often called Harbor Country. The Move to Michigan deal offers incentives to look slightly farther north up the Lake Michigan coastline. The southernmost ZIP code it covers, 49106 in Bridgman, is 86 miles from downtown Chicago.\n While farther from Chicago than, say, New Buffalo (71 miles from downtown Chicago), these towns have restaurant districts and nice beaches, including the spectacular sand dunes at Warren Dunes State Park near Bridgman and Silver Beach County Park in St. Joseph. The area also includes some economically depressed areas, such as in Benton Harbor.\n The $15,000 grant is forgivable at the rate of $5,000 per year\u2014which means for each full year the recipient stays in Michigan, the debt goes down by $5,000, until it\u2019s gone after three years.\n The money comes with some stipulations: It&#39;s available only to people who:  \u2022 are not already living in Michigan;  \u2022 pledge to get a Michigan driver&#39;s license and become permanent Michigan residents, and  \u2022 certify that they work for a company outside southwest Michigan.\n \u201cWe have thousands of people who come over here from Chicago on weekends. Why not come over and live in a beautiful place?\u201d\u00a0said Rob Cleveland, president and CEO of Cornerstone Alliance.\n Cleveland said that while his group ordinarily recruits businesses to locate in the region, the remote-working phenomenon pointed toward a different approach: \u201cIf you can\u2019t recruit Google, go recruit a Google engineer.\u201d\n Along with the cash, the Move to Michigan incentive package includes a menu of other offers, from which buyers choose options worth $5,000. They include use of a discount program for Whirlpool appliances, a one-year free pass on the South Shore Line that runs from Chicago to South Bend, Ind., a free membership in a  Benton Harbor fitness facility, free use of the driving range at  Harbor Shores\u00a0in Benton Harbor, and car service to local airports for a year.\n Those incentives are designed to \u201cmake moving here easier,\u201d Cleveland said. The idea is to help newcomers get settled into using local amenities, like the Welcome Wagon of old.\n People who move to the area might remain employed elsewhere, Cleveland said, \u201cbut they\u2019ll have kids they put in the schools, they\u2019ll spend time at the breweries.

"note_en": "Intonarumori are  experimental musical instruments invented and built by the Italian  futurist  Luigi Russolo between roughly 1910 and 1930. There were 27 varieties of intonarumori in total with different names.\n   Russolo built these instruments to perform the music outlined in his  Art of Noises  manifesto. The instruments were completely acoustic, not electronic. The boxes had various types of internal construction to create different types of  noise. Often a wheel was touching a string attached to a  drum. The wheel rattled or bowed the strings, while the drum functioned as an acoustic resonator. Many of the instruments featured a handle on top of the box, which was used to vary the string tension. Pulling the handle raised the tone, and the horn attached to the box amplified the sound. Intonarumori (&#39;noise makers&#39; in Italian) made noise, but not at a very high volume, since they were all acoustic devices.\n     Most of Russolo&#39;s instruments were destroyed in Paris when the city was bombed during World War II. Others have simply disappeared.  [1] Original sketches still exist, however, along with a few sound recordings of the original instruments. Based on these sources, three collections of reconstructions exist.\n As part of its celebration of the 100th anniversary of Italian Futurism, the   Performa 09 biennial, in collaboration with the  Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) and the  San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, invited  Luciano Chessa (author of the book  Luigi Russolo, Futurist. Noise, Visual Arts, and the Occult) to direct a reconstruction project to produce accurate replicas of Russolo\u2019s legendary Intonarumori instruments. This project offered the set of 16 original intonarumori (8 noise families of 1-3 instruments each, in various registers) that Russolo built in Milan in the summer of 1913. These intonarumori were physically built by luthier Keith Cary in  Winters, California, under Chessa\u2019s direction and scientific supervision. The concert premiered at the  San Francisco Museum of Modern Art on October 16, 2009, before traveling to New York City for its Performa 09 presentation at  The Town Hall on November 12, 2009.  [2] In September 2010 Chessa presented the recreated intonarumori in its first Italian appearance, a concert event at the  Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto in  Rovereto, Italy, as part of the  Festival Transart, which featured performances by  Nicholas Isherwood.

Festival,  [4]  Golan Levin and  Spike Wolff, felt the time was ripe for a presentation of noise and decided to reconstruct the forgotten Intonarumori instruments for the festival.  [5]  Carl Bajandas, a sculptor, an instrument builder, took the lead and built 10 Intonarumori instruments. Meanwhile, experimental composer, music technologist  John Ozbay, has been asked to compose for the Intonarumori instruments.  [6]  [7] The performance took place in Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Kresge Theatre on April 4, 2013. Followed by performances of electronic/experimental music artists, Jeremy Boyle, Michael Johnsen, Eric Singer and Lesley Flanigan.  [4]  [6]  [8]\n Dutch sound artist Wessel Westerveld made a series of replicas. Westerveld&#39;s replicas are the most professional versions with welded steel horns instead of cardboard and nailed steel cones like the Italian and NYC ones. The woodwork of these versions are also real hard wood instead of plywood. Westerveld has also made a few open variants with the sound system visible from the outside.  [9] Westerveld performs regularly with his Intonarumori in collaboration with Dutch sound artist  Yuri Landman. The Dutch replicas were shown and played by Westerveld at the Tuned City festivals in several cities, and a few times at the  Gogbot Festival in  Enschede. In 2012  Lee Ranaldo wrote a score for the instruments at the  Performa Festival in NYC. In 2015 the Italian band King Tongue staged a tribute to Russolo at Circolo Filologico in Milan performing along with an orchestra of four intonarumori.  [10] Czech composer  Miroslav Pudlak&#39;s Intonarumori Concerto, for three Intonarumori soloists and chamber orchestra, was premiered by the  Berg Orchestra in Prague in 2018.

"note_en": "Touch is the first sense by which we encounter the world, and the final one to leave us as we approach death\u2019s edge. \u2018Touch comes before sight, before speech,\u2019 writes Margaret Atwood in her novel  The Blind Assassin (2000). \u2018It is the first language and the last, and it always tells the truth.\u2019 Human foetuses are covered in fine hairs known as lanugo, which appear around 16 weeks of pregnancy. Some researchers believe that these delicate filaments enhance the pleasant sensations of our mother\u2019s amniotic fluid gently washing over our skin, a precursor to the warm and calming feeling that a child, once born, will derive from being hugged.\n Touch has always been my favourite sense \u2013 a loyal friend, something I can rely on to lift me up when I\u2019m feeling down, or spread joy when I\u2019m on a high. As an Italian living abroad for more than a decade, I often suffered from a kind of touch hunger, which had knock-on consequences for my mood and health more generally. People in northern Europe use social touch much less than people in southern Europe. In hindsight, it\u2019s not surprising that I spent the past few years studying touch as a scientist.\n Lately, though, touch has been going through a \u2018prohibition era\u2019: it\u2019s been a rough time for this most important of the senses. The 2020 pandemic served to make touch the ultimate taboo, next to coughing and sneezing in public. While people suffering from COVID-19 can lose the sense of smell and taste, touch is the sense that has been diminished for almost all of us, test-positive or not, symptomatic or not, hospitalised or not. Touch is the sense that has paid the highest price.\n But if physical distance is what protects us, it\u2019s also what stands in the way of care and nurturance. Looking after another human being almost inevitably involves touching them \u2013 from the very basic needs of bathing, dressing, lifting, assisting and medical treatment (usually referred to as  instrumental touch), to the more affective tactile exchanges that aim to communicate, provide comfort and offer support (defined as  expressive touch). Research in osteopathy and manual therapy, where practitioners have been working closely with neuroscientists on affective touch,  suggests that the beneficial effect of massage therapy goes well beyond the actual manoeuvre performed by the therapist. Rather, there is something special simply in the act of resting one\u2019s hands on the skin of the client. There is no care, there is no cure, without touch.\n The present touch drought arrived after a period in which people were already growing more afraid of touching one another. Technology has enabled this distance, as social networking sites have become the primary source of social interaction for children and adolescents. A recent survey  showed that  95 per cent of teens have access to a smartphone, and  45 per cent say that they are online \u2018almost constantly\u2019.\n Another reason for touch-scepticism is the growing global awareness of how touch is a weapon that men use to impose their power over women. The #MeToo movement exposed how women are expected to acquiesce to inappropriate touch as the cost of gaining access to certain kinds of opportunities. Meanwhile, doctors, nurses, teachers and salespeople are all guided against being too \u2018hands-on\u2019. Yet studies suggest that touch actually improves the quality of our encounters with any of these professionals, and makes us evaluate the experience more positively. For  example, we are likely to give a more generous tip to a waiter who absently touches our shoulder when taking the order than to those who keep their distance.\n What\u2019s unique about touch, when set against the other senses, is its mutuality. While we can look without being looked back at, we can\u2019t touch without being touched in return. During the pandemic, nurses and doctors have talked about how this unique characteristic of touch helped them communicate with patients. When they couldn\u2019t talk, smile or be seen properly because of their protective equipment, medical professionals could always rely on a pat on the shoulder, holding a hand or squeezing an arm to reassure patients and let them know that they were not alone. In a pandemic where touch is a proven vector, paradoxically it\u2019s also a part of the cure. Touch really is the ultimate tool for social connection, and the good news is that we were born fully accessorised to make the most of it.\n In the 1990s, there was a wave of research demonstrating the shocking consequences of touch deprivation on human development. Several studies  showed that children from Romanian orphanages, who were barely touched in the first years of life, had cognitive and behavioural deficits later on, as well as significant differences in brain development. In adulthood, people with reduced social contact have a  higher risk of dying earlier compared with people with strong social relationships. Touch is especially important as we age: for instance, gentle touch has been  shown to increase the amount of food intake in a group of institutionalised elderly adults. Even when we can\u2019t see, hear or speak as we used to, we can almost always rely on touch to explore the world around us, to communicate with others, and to allow them to communicate with us.\n Science is now beginning to provide an account of why touch matters so much. Touch on the skin can reduce heartrate, blood pressure and cortisol levels \u2013 all factors related to stress \u2013 in both adults and babies. It  facilitates the release of oxytocin, a hormone that provides sensations of calm, relaxation and being at peace with the world. Every time we hug a friend or snuggle a pet, oxytocin is released in our body, giving us that feel-good sensation. In this way, oxytocin appears to reinforce our motivation to seek and maintain contact with others, which assists in the development of humans\u2019 socially oriented brains. Oxytocin also plays a vital role in the relationship we have with ourselves.\n In our lab, we recently showed that oxytocin might promote processes of multisensory integration, the so called \u2018glue of the senses\u2019 \u2013 the way the world typically presents itself to us as a coherent picture, rather than as multiple distinct streams of sense data. Multisensory integration, in turn, is at the root of our sense of body ownership, the feeling that most take for granted, that our body is  ours. For our studies, we invited people to the lab, and induced the Rubber Hand Illusion, a well-established set-up where participants look at a lifelike rubber hand being touched while their own hand, hidden out of view, is touched at the same time. After a minute or so of synchronous tactile stimulation, the vast majority of participants experience the illusion that the rubber hand  is their own hand, that they embody the rubber hand. We found that applying the tactile stimulation at slow, caress-like velocities enhances the illusion of embodying the rubber hand. Furthermore, we also  found that giving participants one dose of intranasal oxytocin before the illusion enhanced the experience, compared with a placebo. In other words, affective touch and oxytocin might boost the process that keeps us grounded to a physical body.\n Touch is the first sense to develop, and is mediated by the skin, our largest organ. We are one of the few mammals to be born so premature in the trajectory of our development. Our motor system isn\u2019t fully developed, we can\u2019t feed ourselves, we can\u2019t regulate our own temperature beyond a certain threshold \u2013 all of which means that we rely on others to survive. As a child, being cared for depends primarily on tactile contact and \u2018being held\u2019. Any basic activity involves touch, such as changing nappies, having a bath, being fed, sleeping and, of course, cuddling. Even after we make it through the first few months of life, social tactile interactions are  crucial for our development. For example, postnatal depression is known to have negative consequences for infants, but maternal touch can also have a protective effect. So encouraging tactile interactions between mothers with depression and their babies can reduce negative outcomes for the children later on in life. Importantly, the benefit is reciprocal: skin-to-skin contact between infant and parent increases the levels of oxytocin in mothers, fathers and infants, providing a feel-good sensation, promoting the development of a healthy relationship, and enhancing synchrony in parent-infant interactions.\n  Many neuroscientists and psychologists  believe that we have a dedicated system just for the perception of social \u2013 affective \u2013 touch distinct from the one that we use to touch objects. This system seems to be able to selectively recognise caress-like touch; this is then processed in the insula, a brain area connected to maintaining our sense of self and an awareness of our body. Slow, caress-like touch is not only important for our survival, but also for our cognitive and social development: for example, it can influence the way we learn to identify and recognise other people from early in life. In a  study of four-month-old infants, when parents provided gentle stroking, children were able to learn to identify a previously seen face better than those who experienced non-tactile stimulation. It seems that slow, social touch might act as a cue to pay particular attention to social stimuli, such as faces.\n What\u2019s particularly important in infancy and childhood is not only the amount of touch we receive, but also its nature and quality. In a recent  study, my colleagues and I showed that infants as young as 12 months are able to detect the way that their mothers touch them during daily activities, such as during play time or while sharing a book together. In our study, the mothers didn\u2019t know that we were interested in touch, which allowed us to have a real insight into their spontaneous interactions. Importantly, we found that mothers\u2019 ability to understand their infants\u2019 needs translated into a kind of tactile language: for example, those mothers who were less aligned or responsive to their babies also tended to use more rough and restrictive touch. Infants also tended to reciprocate, in that they were more likely to use aggressive touch towards their mothers if this was the way that they were touched.\n It\u2019s not an exaggeration to talk of touch as a kind of language \u2013 one that we learn, like spoken language, through social interactions with our loved ones, from the earliest stages of our life. We use touch every day to communicate our emotions, and to tell someone that we are scared, happy, in love, sad, sexually aroused and much more. In turn, we are pretty good at reading other people\u2019s intentions and emotions based on the way that they touch us. In a recent  study, we invited people to the lab and asked them to detect the emotions and intentions that the experimenter was trying to convey to them via touch. The touch was delivered at different velocities: slower, as the touch typically occurring between parents and babies, or between lovers; or faster, a type of touch more common between strangers. We found that slow, caress-like touch was more likely to communicate love, even when the touch was delivered by a stranger. In contrast, participants didn\u2019t attribute any special meaning or emotions to touch delivered at fast velocities. Interestingly, in the case of brain damage involving the insula, people have difficulties in perceiving affective touch, as well as disturbances in the sense of body ownership. This suggests the existence of a specialised pathway that arrives from the skin to a specific part of the brain.\n We exchange tactile gestures as communicative tokens not only to build social bonds, but to establish power relationships. In professional Western contexts, people typically apply a certain amount of pressure in a handshake when meeting someone for the first time. A handshake stands as a proxy for competence and confidence; we feel the other person touching us, and ask ourselves: \u2018Do I trust them enough to offer them a job?\u2019 or \u2018Should I let them babysit my kids?\u2019 One  study showed how a firm handshake was a key indicator of success in a job interview, perhaps because the handshake is the very first way that we close the physical gap between us and the other. The handshake is also used to seal an agreement, with the force of a signature or contract. The danger and vulnerability that\u2019s intrinsic to touch is part of what allows it to serve this socially binding function; indeed, it\u2019s believed that the handshake arose as a way of ensuring that the two people involved weren\u2019t holding weapons.\n The language of touch also affects the way that we relate to ourselves and our bodies across the lifespan, with profound impacts on our psychological wellbeing. In another set of studies, we investigated the way in which people with anorexia nervosa perceive caress-like touch as compared with healthy people. Anorexia nervosa is a severe eating disorder characterised by a distorted sense of one\u2019s own body, but it can also lead to a reduction in social interactions. We wanted to understand whether the fact that sufferers report finding less pleasure in social interaction might be related to the disorder. Across  two  studies, we found that people with anorexia perceived slow touch delivered with a soft brush on their forearm to be less pleasant, compared with healthy participants. Importantly, we found the same pattern of results in people who have recovered from anorexia nervosa. This suggests that this reduced capacity to take pleasure in touch might be more of a stable characteristic rather than a temporary status, related to the severe malnutrition that we observe in anorexia nervosa. This finding, along with other studies, suggest that there is definitely a close link between social touch and mental health. Throughout our lives, we need touch to flourish.\n So, what happens to our tactile fluency when we make touch taboo? At the times in our lives that we are most fragile, we need touch more than ever. From everything we know about social touch, it needs to be promoted, not inhibited. We need the nuance to recognise its perils, but avoiding touch entirely would be a disaster. The pandemic has given us a glimpse of what life would look like without touch. The fear of the other, of contamination, of touch has allowed many of us to realise how much we miss those spontaneous hugs, handshakes and taps on the shoulder. Physical distancing leaves invisible scars on our skin. Tellingly, most people mention \u2018hugging my loved ones\u2019 as one of the first things they want to do once the pandemic is over.\n Touch is so vital that even the language of digital communication is saturated with touch metaphors. We \u2018keep in touch\u2019, and acknowledge that we are \u2018touched by your kind gesture\u2019. Some researchers have suggested that technology could enhance our physical connection with others, prompting new kinds of interpersonal tactile connections via hug blankets, kissing screens and caressing devices. For example, a project based at University College London is  exploring how digital practices such as \u2018Likes\u2019 and emojis \u2013 signals that communicate emotional states and social feedback \u2013 could extend to the remote manipulation of textures and materials. Two people at a distance could each have a device that detects and transmits tactile feedback: for  example, my sensor could become warm and soft when my partner on the other side of the world is available and wants to let me feel their presence, or conversely, it could turn cold and rough if my partner needs my presence.\n  There\u2019s a lot of potential for these devices, especially for touch-deprived people such as the elderly, people who live alone, or children in orphanages. Consider that  15 per cent of people worldwide live alone, often far away from loved ones, and that statistics are suggesting that more and more people die alone, too. What a difference it would make to have the possibility of being physically close, even when far apart.\n However, these devices should be complementary to the power of a skin-to-skin tactile exchange, rather than a substitute for it. Nothing can compare with the magic of a physically intimate moment with someone, in which touch is often accompanied by a cascade of other sensory signals such as smell, sound and body temperature. Touch is physically and temporally proximal, in that it means \u2018we are close to each other and we are here now, together\u2019. Unlike other senses that can be digitalised, such as seeing someone\u2019s face and talking to them over Zoom, touch requires you to be in the same place, at the same time, with another human being. A digitalised version of touch would be missing this rich sharing of a specific moment in space and time, allowing a more limited experience of what a hug could provide. If I could potentially pause or retract from someone sending me a digital caress, that aspect of touch in which we \u2018feel along with another person\u2019 would fail.\n In the current environment, is the idea of a \u2018renaissance of touch\u2019 just for the brave and the foolish? I don\u2019t believe so, and scientific evidence speaks loud and clear. We lose a lot by depriving ourselves of touch. We deprive ourselves of one of the most sophisticated languages we speak; we lose opportunities to build new relationships; we might even weaken existing ones. Through deteriorating social relationships, we also detach from ourselves. The need for people to be able to touch one another should be a priority in defining the post-pandemic \u2018new normal\u2019. A better world is often just a hug away. As a scientist, but also as a fellow human, I claim the right to touch, and to dream of a reality where no one will be touchless.\n To read more about the body and emotions, visit Aeon\u2019s sister site,   Psyche , a new digital magazine that illuminates the human condition through three prisms: mental health; the perennial question of \u2018how to live\u2019; and the artistic and transcendent facets of life.", "posttime": "2020-10-27 10:27:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u89e6\u63a7,touch,\u89e6\u6478", "title": "\u5bf9\u89e6\u63a7\u7684\u9700\u6c42", "title_en": "The Need for Touch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://aeon.co/essays/touch-is-a-language-we-cannot-afford-to-forget", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89e6\u63a7", "touch", "\u89e6\u6478"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d6e1db1688cdfe43918da8972511343.jpg", "infoid": 1031390, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u79c1\u8425\u7164\u70ad\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u9ed8\u91cc\u80fd\u6e90(Murray Energy)\u8463\u4e8b\u4f1a\u4e3b\u5e2d\u9c8d\u52c3\u00b7\u9ed8\u91cc(Bob Murray)\u4e8e\u5468\u65e5\u53bb\u4e16\uff0c\u4eab\u5e7480\u5c81\u3002\u9ed8\u91cc\u80fd\u6e90\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u79c1\u8425\u3001\u5df2\u7834\u4ea7\u7684\u7164\u70ad\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u3002\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5468\u524d\uff0c\u4ed6\u5ba3\u5e03\u9000\u4f11\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u6b63\u5f0f\u7ed9\u51fa\u6b7b\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u636eelectrek\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7a46\u96f7\u572810\u67081\u65e5\u7533\u8bf7\u4e86\u9ed1\u80ba\u798f\u5229-\u4ed6\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u65f6\u95f4\u90fd\u5728\u4e0e\u9ed1\u80ba\u4f5c\u6597\u4e89\u3002\u636e\u7f8e\u8054\u793e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u9ed1\u80ba\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ed8\u91cc\u8868\u793a\u4ed6\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u6c27\u6c14\uff0c\u201c\u6fd2\u4e34\u6b7b\u4ea1\u201d\u3002\n\u8fd9\u662f\u7279\u53d1\u6027\u80ba\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\uff0cIPF\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0e\u6211\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e0\u5173\u3002\nMurray Energy\u7684\u7834\u4ea7\u6b63\u5728\u6d88\u8017\u9ed1\u80ba\u6b8b\u75be\u4fe1\u6258\u57fa\u91d1\u3002\u622a\u81f3\u53bb\u5e7411\u6708\uff0c\u9ed8\u91cc\u80fd\u6e90(Murray Energy)\u53ea\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u6b20\u8be5\u57fa\u91d1\u76841.55\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u4e2d\u7684110\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ed8\u91cc\u80fd\u6e90\u516c\u53f8(Murray Energy)\u7684\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e00\u8d2f\u53cd\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7164\u70ad\u884c\u4e1a\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002\u6b63\u5982electrek\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff1a\n\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ed6\u4e3b\u6301\u4e86\u514b\u5170\u5fb7\u5c14\u5ce1\u8c37\u7164\u77ff\u574d\u584c\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u9020\u62106\u540d\u5de5\u4eba\u548c3\u540d\u6025\u6551\u4eba\u5458\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u6709\u53f2\u4ee5\u6765\u5bf9\u7164\u77ff\u5f81\u6536\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u7f5a\u91d1\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9ed8\u91cc\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fd9\u573a\u60b2\u5267\u3002\n\u4ed6\u5411\u5510\u7eb3\u5fb7\u00b7\u7279\u6717\u666e\u53d1\u9001\u4e86\u4e00\u4efd\u957f\u8fbe\u56db\u9875\u7684\u201c\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u201d\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u64a4\u9500\u73af\u5883\u548c\u77ff\u5c71\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002\u7a46\u96f7\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4ed6\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d\u5927\u7ea6\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u64a4\u9500\u6e05\u6d01\u7535\u529b\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u9000\u51fa\u5df4\u9ece\u534f\u5b9a\u3002\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7164\u70ad\u6b63\u5728\u6d88\u4ea1\uff0c\u9ed8\u91cc\u4e5f\u7ed9\u73af\u5883\u7559\u4e0b\u4e86\u7834\u574f\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\u3002\n\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb\u7684\u662felectrek\uff0c\u4e13\u5bb6\u4eec\u65e5\u590d\u4e00\u65e5\u5730\u53d1\u5e03\u5173\u4e8e\u7279\u65af\u62c9\u3001\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u7eff\u8272\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u3002\u4e00\u5b9a\u8981\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e3b\u9875\uff0c\u4e86\u89e3\u6240\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u65b0\u95fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Twitter\u3001Facebook\u548cLinkedIn\u4e0a\u5173\u6ce8electrek\uff0c\u968f\u65f6\u4e86\u89e3\u6700\u65b0\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4ece\u4f55\u8bf4\u8d77\uff1f\u8bf7\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684YouTube\u9891\u9053\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002", "note_en": "Bob Murray, the board chairman of Murray Energy, the largest privately owned \u2014 and bankrupt \u2014 US coal operator, died on Sunday at age 80. He had announced his retirement less than a week before.\n  Although no cause of death was officially given, Murray filed for  black lung benefits \u2014 which he spent most of his career fighting \u2014 on October 1, as   Electrek reported. In the black lung claim, Murray stated he was heavily dependent on oxygen and was \u201cnear death,\u201d  Associated Press reported.\n  It\u2019s idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, IPF. And it is not related to my work in the industry.\n Murray Energy\u2019s bankruptcy was\u00a0 a drain on the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. As of November, Murray Energy had only contributed $1.1 million of the $155 million it owed to the fund.\n As CEO of Murray Energy, he routinely opposed any sort of regulation of the coal industry. As  Electrek reported:\n Notably he presided over the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse, in which six workers and three emergency workers died, resulting in one of the largest fines ever levied by the US government against a coal mine due to Murray\u2019s failures that led to the tragedy.\n He sent Donald Trump a four-page \u201caction plan\u201d calling for environmental and mine safety regulation rollbacks. Murray was granted around half the items on his action plan, including  revoking the Clean Power Plan and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.\n So even as coal is in demise, Murray left a legacy of damage to the environment.\n  You\u2019re reading Electrek\u2014 experts who break news about  Tesla,  electric vehicles, and  green energy, day after day.

"note_en": "Antibodies are a key part of our immune defences and stop the virus from getting inside the body&#39;s cells.\n The Imperial College London team found the number of people testing positive for antibodies has fallen by 26% between June and September.\n They say immunity appears to be fading and there is a risk of catching the virus multiple times.\n More than 350,000 people in England have taken an antibody test as part of the REACT-2 study so far.\n In the first round of testing, at the end of June and the beginning of July, about 60 in 1,000 people had detectable antibodies.\n But in the latest set of tests, in September, only 44 per 1,000 people were positive.\n It suggests the number of people with antibodies fell by more than a quarter between summer and autumn.\n &#34;Immunity is waning quite rapidly, we&#39;re only three months after our first [round of tests] and we&#39;re already showing a 26% decline in antibodies,&#34; said Prof Helen Ward, one of the researchers.\n The fall was greater in those over 65, compared with younger age groups, and in those without symptoms compared with those with full-blown Covid-19.\n The number of healthcare workers with antibodies remained relatively high, which the researchers suggest may be due to regular exposure to the virus.\n  Antibodies stick to the surface of the coronavirus to stop it invading our body&#39;s cells, and attract the rest of the immune system.\n Exactly what the antibody drop means for immunity is still uncertain. There are other parts of the immune system, such as T-cells, which may also play a role.\n  Prof Wendy Barclay said: &#34;We can see the antibodies and we can see them declining and we know antibodies on their own are quite protective.\n &#34;On the balance of evidence, I would say it would look as if immunity declines away at the same rate as antibodies decline away, and that this is an indication of waning immunity.&#34;\n There are four other human coronaviruses, which we catch multiple times in our lives. They cause common cold symptoms and we can be reinfected every six to 12 months.\n There have been very few confirmed cases of people  getting Covid twice. However, the researchers warn this may be due to immunity only just starting to fade since the peak infection rates of March and April.\n The hope is the second infection will be milder than the first, even if immunity does decline, as the body should have an &#34;immune memory&#34; of the first encounter and know how to fight back.\n The researchers say their findings do not scupper hopes of a vaccine, which may prove more effective than a real infection.\n One of the researchers, Prof Graham Cooke, said: &#34;The big picture is after the first wave, the great majority of the country didn&#39;t have evidence of protective immunity.\n      Commenting on the findings, Prof Jonathan Ball from the University of Nottingham said: &#34;This study confirms suspicions that antibody responses - especially in vulnerable elderly populations - decrease over time.&#34;\n However, he said it was still important to get a better overall view of &#34;what protective immunity looks like&#34;.\n Prof Eleanor Riley, from the University of Edinburgh, said it would be &#34;premature&#34; to assume immunity did not last, but &#34;the data do lend weight to the concern that antibodies induced by natural infection may be short-lived, as is the case for other seasonal coronaviruses.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-10-27 10:26:53", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6297\u4f53,antibodies", "title": "Covid\uff1a\u6297\u4f53\u201c\u5728\u611f\u67d3\u540e\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\u201d", "title_en": "Covid: Antibodies 'fall rapidly after infection'", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54696873", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6297\u4f53"]}]
