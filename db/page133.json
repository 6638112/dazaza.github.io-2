"note_en": "Sales of new single family homes fell to an annualized rate of 676,000, 6.6% below May&#39;s rate of 724,000 and 19.4% below the June 2020 level of 839,000.\n The median price of a newly built home in June rose just 6% from June 2020\n The inventory of new homes for sale jumped from a 5.5-month supply in May to a 6.3-month supply in June. Last fall, it sat at a low of just 3.5 months.\n Sales of newly built homes dropped in June to the lowest level since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic in April 2020,  according to data released by the U.S. Census Bureau on Monday.\n Sales of new single family homes fell to an annualized rate of 676,000, 6.6% below May&#39;s rate of 724,000 and 19.4% below the June 2020 level of 839,000. Analysts were expecting new home sales to increase by 3.4% in June.\n  After a year of frenzied buying and price gains in the double digits, newly built homes are now out of reach for much of the demand that remains in the market.\n The median price of a newly built home in June rose just 6% from June 2020, and while that is a large gain historically, it is nothing compared with the 15%-20% annual gains seen in previous months.\n Most of the homebuying is on the higher end of the market, and builders cannot afford to put up affordable homes due to skyrocketing construction costs.\n Softwood lumber, in particular, spiked more than 300% during the pandemic, and while it has fallen back dramatically in the last month, it is still about 75% above its 2019 average. Other lumber products are still significantly more expensive.\n &#34;We also know there are shortages of appliances, labor and affordable lots,&#34; noted Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group. &#34;The moderation in home sales is likely a combination of sticker shock and the slowdown in the ability of builders to finish homes because of a variety of delays.&#34;\n  The inventory of new homes for sale jumped from a 5.5-month supply in May to a 6.3-month supply in June. Last fall, it sat at a low of just 3.5 months. In June, the number of homes for sale that had not yet been started hit an all-time high.\n &#34;Annual comparisons will get even more difficult in coming months, as it was this time last year that the market began to surge and reach highs not seen since before the Great Recession,&#34; wrote Zillow economist Matthew Speakman in a release.\n Buyers in June were also hit with higher mortgage rates, which spiked about a quarter of a percentage point during the month. While that may not sound like a lot, if buyers are already stretched by higher home prices, they have less of a financial cushion to absorb higher mortgage rates.\n Single family housing starts continue to gain, albeit slowly and not on the lowest end of the market. Permits, an indicator of future construction, are not as robust as the market needs.\n While there is unquestionably still strong demand from buyers, much of it is being squelched by affordability and supply issues. Those signs clearly showed up at builder home sites in June and have been a factor in weakening homebuilder sentiment for the past two months. Noted builder analyst Ivy Zelman wrote as much in a note last month.\n &#34;We are shifting our tone on the housing market based on our analysis of proprietary data showing early signs of a cool down,&#34; according to the note.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:47:17", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4f4e\u70b9,boom,\u623f\u5c4b", "title":

Motors, which has resulted in the resignation of its CEO and CTO, has put the company at risk of failing. This new agreement could allow Lordstown to continue by providing the much-needed capital required to produce its first electric vehicle. If approved by shareholders, hedge fund YA II PN will be able to purchase 35.1 million shares, or about 19.9% of outstanding shares.\n The capital provides a lifeline to Lordstown, which has struggled in recent months. The hedge fund, which is able to buy the shares at $7.48 a share, could also benefit financially if the stock price rises.\n  Lordstown Motors is an offshoot of former CEO Steve Burns\u2019 other company, Workhorse Group, a battery-electric transportation technology company that is also publicly traded. Workhorse holds a 10% stake in Lordstown Motors.\n The Ohio automaker was founded in 2019, and within a year  reached a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company DiamondPeak Holdings Corp., with a market value of $1.6 billion. The company had planned to begin production of its Endurance pickup truck starting in the second half of 2021 at the former GM Assembly Plant in Lordstown, Ohio.\n Those plans faltered and a series of missteps and allegations of fraud compounded the company\u2019s problems.\n In March 2021, Hindenburg Research, the short-seller firm whose report on Nikola Motor led to a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and the resignation of its founder, said it had taken a short position on Lordstown Motors. Hindenburg said at the time that its short position was based on a company that has \u201cno revenue and no sellable product, which we believe has misled investors on both its demand and production capabilities.\u201d\n Hindenburg disputed that the company booked 100,000 pre-orders for its electric pickup truck, a stat shared by Lordstown Motors in January. The short seller said that \u201cextensive research reveals that the company\u2019s orders appear largely fictitious and used as a prop to raise capital and confer legitimacy.\u201d\n Two months later, Lordstown reported in its first-quarter earnings that production volumes of the Endurance would likely be half \u2014 from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 \u2014 due to a lack of funding.\n Lordstown execs dug themselves into a deeper hole by  attempting to calm investors a day after its CEO and CTO resigned with statements that they had binding orders from customers that would fund limited production of its electric pickup truck through May 2022. The  company retracted those statements within days.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:08:28", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u80a1\u7968,\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66,sale", "title": "\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u516c\u53f8 Lordstown Motors \u5728\u80a1\u7968\u9500\u552e\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86 4 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u751f\u547d\u7ebf", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTroubled EV company Lordstown Motors gets $400M lifeline in stock-sale agreement\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u80a1\u7968", "\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66", "sale"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c0a063f0532337e04473c00cabf19d87.jpg", "infoid": 1069843, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u65d7\u8230\u8c6a\u534e\u7535\u52a8\u8f7f\u8f66 Lucid Air \u5df2\u83b7\u5f97 11,000 \u6b21\u4ed8\u8d39\u9884\u8ba2\u3002 Lucid \u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9 TechCrunch\uff0c\u6269\u5efa\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7 Project Gravity\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8be5\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u8c6a\u534e\u7535\u52a8 SUV \u7684\u795e\u79d8\u79f0\u53f7\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9 Gravity \u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5b83\u8ba1\u5212\u4e8e 2023 \u5e74\u4e0a\u5e02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0e Air \u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u63d0\u4ea4\u7ed9\u6b27\u76df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u5c40\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u56fe\u7eb8\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u88ab Lucid \u8bba\u575b\u7684\u4e00\u540d\u6210\u5458\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7684\u53ea\u662f Lucid \u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u56fe\u3002\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u8ba1\u5212\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u96f6\u90e8\u4ef6\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f66\u8eab\u9762\u677f\u51b2\u538b\u4ef6\u7b49\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u96f6\u4ef6\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5361\u8428\u683c\u5170\u5fb7\u5e02\u8bae\u4f1a\u4e8e 3 \u6708\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6269\u5927\u8fd1 100 \u4e07\u5e73\u65b9\u82f1\u5c3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5382\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u671f\u5de5\u7a0b\u8017\u8d44\u7ea6 7 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u7834\u571f\u52a8\u5de5\u540e\u7684 12 \u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u521b\u4e0b\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u65b0\u9ad8\u3002 Lucid \u66fe\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u4ece\u6bcf\u5e74\u7ea6 30,000 \u8f86\u6c7d\u8f66\u6269\u5927\u5230 400,000 \u8f86\u3002 Lucid \u901a\u5f80\u516c\u5f00\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9053\u8def\u6f2b\u957f\u800c\u66f2\u6298\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6700\u65e9\u4e8e 2018 \u5e74\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u76ee\u5149\u6295\u5411\u4e86\u5c06\u7535\u52a8\u8f7f\u8f66\u6295\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u8d44\u91d1\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u63a8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u8fdc\u3002 Lucid \u5728 2018 \u5e74\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u6c99\u7279\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u4e3b\u6743\u8d22\u5bcc\u57fa\u91d1\u7684 10 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5728 Lucid \u4e0e\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u7684\u6536\u8d2d\u516c\u53f8 Churchill Capital IV Corp \u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0cLucid \u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5176\u6700\u5927\u80a1\u4e1c\u3002\u8be5\u5408\u5e76\u5728\u4e0a\u5468\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u9ad8\u7ba1\u5728\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7535\u8bdd\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u672a\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u952e\u63d0\u6848\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u8db3\u591f\u591a\u7684\u9009\u7968\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u6563\u6237\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u548c\u5783\u573e\u90ae\u4ef6\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002 Lucid \u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u4ee5 Lucid Group \u7684\u540d\u4e49\u8fd0\u8425\uff0c\u5176\u80a1\u7968\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a LCID\u3002", "note_en": "The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.\n Part of the expansion will be used to accommodate the manufacturing of Project Gravity, the mysterious title given to the automaker\u2019s forthcoming luxury electric SUV, a Lucid spokesman told TechCrunch. Not much is known about Gravity at this point, other than that it\u2019s scheduled to be available from 2023 and that it will use the same battery platform as the Air. Patent drawings submitted to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, first noticed by a member of the  Lucid Forum, reveal little more than the renderings on Lucid\u2019s website.\n  The company is also planning on bringing more of the component production in-house, including major pieces such as the body panel stampings, the spokesman added. These parts were being handled by an external supplier.\n The Casa Grande City Council approved the plans to expand the nearly 1 million-square-foot space in March. The first phase of the factory, which cost around $700 million to construct, went up in a record 12 months after breaking ground. Lucid has said that it wants to expand production capacity from around 30,000 vehicles per year to up to 400,000.\n Lucid has had a long, sometimes tenuous road to the public market. The company first set its sights on bringing an electric sedan to production as early as 2018, but it quickly hit funding challenges that pushed this timeline further and further back. Lucid received major funding in 2018 with a $1 billion investment from Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which continued to be its largest shareholder throughout Lucid\u2019s \u00a0merger with special purpose acquisition company Churchill Capital IV Corp.\n That merger hit  a bit of a hiccup last week when the company failed to garner a sufficient number of votes on a key proposal \u2014 likely due to the rise of retail traders and malfunctioning spam filters, executives said in an investor call.\n Lucid, which will now operate under the name Lucid Group, is listed under the

Esponnette is the co-founder and executive chair of  unspun, a startup that makes custom-fit jeans from a body scan using machine learning and 3D weaving.\n  Sitting across from a venture partner, I wonder if they might feel more compelled by my words if I cut my hair short (really short), or grew a beard, or removed my pregnant belly. Would they take out their checkbook if I were more aggressive in what I promised? Would they be more interested in getting to know my business and me better if I passionately slammed the table?\n   Holmes  adopted a ridiculously low voice to get her startup off the ground in a world full of men. She promised impossible pinprick tests to detect hundreds of diseases and collected influential investors like Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Mattis and Betsy DeVos. She wore a Steve Jobs uniform \u2014 including the Issey Miyake turtleneck \u2014 and built a  team of 800 brilliant people. Did she go overboard with her lies? Yes. But she\u2019s not the only one. The Silicon Valley and venture landscape only exacerbated whatever beliefs she already had in her company and inclinations to promise the moon.\n Last week at a virtual hearing, she  pushed to keep a huge database of information protected from the government. Before that, she  claimed to have made $100 million in revenue in 2014, when it was really $100,000. These things, among others, are hands-down inexcusable. But I still believe that she thought she was doing the right thing taking the universal advice of Silicon Valley: \u201cFake it till you make it.\u201d\n She once  said,  borrowing from previous thought leaders: \u201cThis is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you\u2019re crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden you change the world.\u201d I wonder if she just thinks she\u2019s now on part two.\n Raising money to start a company is about two things: having connections and making an appearance. Connections are  difficult to make when you\u2019re a woman: \u201cOnly about 12% of decision-makers at VC firms are women, and most firms still don\u2019t have a single female partner.\u201d\n And even if you have connections, building relationships can be a bit weird: My cofounders end up being text buddies with our investors, while I hear news of things in passing. We hit a peak of 2.8% of funding going to women-led startups in 2019, but in 2020, that  dropped again to 2.3%, possibly because investors reverted to their standard habits of keeping their cards close during uncertain times. Furthermore, investors generally have expectations that are aligned with male tendencies. For example, identical slides and scripts that are read by men and women are judged very differently, with  men overwhelmingly rated higher. Holmes\u2019 deep voice, although off-putting,  probably made her more convincing.\n It\u2019s not easy to replicate the fundraising success that Holmes had, though. If other women tried to emulate this, they\u2019d likely be penalized: In general, forward men are viewed positively as assertive, while forward women are viewed as  emotionally unstable. This is confusing because, inversely, if women  retreat to stereotypically feminine behaviors, they are viewed as weak. Hillary Clinton got stuck in this during her presidential race \u2014 criticized for being aggressive and cold when stereotypically masculine traits and pegged as weak when showing stereotypically feminine traits.\n To make matters worse, it turns out that in pitches, women are  asked more preventative questions about potential loss and risk, while men are asked more promotional questions about upside and gains. Women can  work around this by answering any preventative question in the positive. Holmes knew this deep down and played into it. That was the only way for her to win.\n I am absolutely no  \u201cholmie,\u201d\u00a0but I do understand firsthand her need to role-play. I\u2019ve been overlooked; hell, I\u2019ve even been told to change my product line (bras) because venture capitalists won\u2019t get it. And they didn\u2019t. I gave in.\n I don\u2019t want to defend her, and I can\u2019t. It\u2019s so easy to drop a line at a party or a board meeting about how obnoxious she was in her venture, but what irks me is that we focus on her specifically as the problem, completely bypassing the environment that created her. I remember soaking up  John Carreyrou\u2019s tantalizing book thinking, \u201cWow, I\u2019ll never do that,\u201d as I started my company. But as I have seen the pressures and the biases, I can see how the system shaped Holmes.\n Why don\u2019t we judge the biased system we created as much as we judge the person it destroyed? She sticks out like a sore thumb because, well, how many Elizabeth Holmeses are there out there? These problems are so ingrained in the system itself, though, that as  David Foster Wallace alluded to in the water speech, we can\u2019t see them and we probably aren\u2019t ready to repair them.\n The next time someone jokes at a cocktail party about Holmes\u2019 baritone voice, just remind them how dumb is it that we give more money to people with deep voices.\n Former TechCrunch COO\u00a0 Ned\u00a0 Desmond is now Senior Operating Partner at SOSV, which has invested in unspun.", "posttime": "2021-07-27 02:07:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d,elizabeth,\u5973\u6027", "title": "\u6211\u660e\u767d\u4e86\uff0c\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d\u798f\u5c14\u6469\u65af", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tI get it, Elizabeth Holmes\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/i-get-it-elizabeth-holmes/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4f0a\u4e3d\u838e\u767d", "elizabeth", "\u5973\u6027"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "9eb81e5cdb745b0d00df6dc04dc7ad2f.jpg", "infoid": 1069840, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8def\u900f\u793e 7 \u6708 26 \u65e5 - \u4f01\u4e1a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u53f8 Medallia Inc (MDLA.N) \u5468\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u516c\u53f8 Thoma Bravo \u5c06\u4ee5 64 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u73b0\u91d1\u5c06\u516c\u53f8\u79c1\u6709\u5316\u3002 Medallia \u80a1\u4e1c\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u6bcf\u80a1 34 \u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u73b0\u91d1\uff0c\u8f83 6 \u6708 10 \u65e5\u8be5\u80a1\u7968\u7684\u6536\u76d8\u4ef7\u6ea2\u4ef7\u8fd1 20%\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\u8fd9\u5bb6\u603b\u90e8\u4f4d\u4e8e\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u8003\u8651\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u5728\u51fa\u552e\u63d0\u632f\u80a1\u4ef7\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u6613\u65e5\u3002\u4e24\u5e74\u524d\u4e0a\u5e02\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u8c03\u67e5\u8f6f\u4ef6\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546 Medallia \u4e0e Survey Monkey \u548c Qualtrics \u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u5c55\u5f00\u7ade\u4e89\u3002 Thoma Bravo \u662f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u79c1\u52df\u80a1\u6743\u516c\u53f8\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u7740\u8d85\u8fc7 780 \u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u3002\u5176\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u516c\u53f8\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u606f\u6280\u672f\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546 SolarWinds Corp (SWI.N) \u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u516c\u53f8 McAfee Corp (MCFE.O)\u3002 Medallia \u4e0e Thoma Bravo \u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u9884\u8ba1\u5c06\u4e8e\u4eca\u5e74\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5305\u62ec 40 \u5929\u7684\u201cgo-shop\u201d\u671f\uff0c\u516c\u53f8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\u8003\u8651\u5176\u4ed6\u4ea4\u6613\u3002 Blackstone Credit \u8fde\u540c Apollo Capital Management \u548c KKR Credit \u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u57fa\u91d1\u5c06\u4e3a\u8fd9\u7b14\u4ea4\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u503a\u52a1\u878d\u8d44\u3002 Morgan Stanley &amp; Co\u3001BoFA Securities \u548c Wells Fargo Securities \u62c5\u4efb Medallia \u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u987e\u95ee\u3002", "note_en": "July 26 (Reuters) - Enterprise software firm Medallia Inc  (MDLA.N) said on Monday private equity firm Thoma Bravo would take the company private for $6.4 billion in cash.\n Medallia shareholders will receive $34 per share in cash, a premium of nearly 20% to the stock&#39;s close on June 10, the last trading day before media reports that the San-Francisco based company was mulling a potential sale boosted the stock price.\n Medallia, the customer survey software provider, that went public over just two years ago, competes with the likes of Survey Monkey and Qualtrics.\n Thoma Bravo is one the largest software-focused private equity firms with more than $78 billion in assets under management.
