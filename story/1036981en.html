When  Krzysztof Biedalak and I made our first $3 investment in a corporate rubber stamp, which was a post-communist obligation for all companies in Poland in 1991, Microsoft was a multibillion-dollar company. How could we not have been blinded by inspiration? We wanted to write a universally useful piece of software and the world would be ours - we thought. Bill Gates&#39;s software philosophy, based on respect for backward compatibility, sheltered  SuperMemo on its path to its painfully slow adoption. Software and database compatibility have been preserved for 30 years now. My first pieces of knowledge in medical sciences, typed in on Dec 13, 1987, are still there in my collection, well-memorized and useful. Without Gates and his stance on compatibility, I would have lost all that knowledge to some upgrade hiccup long ago. When Gates moved to philanthropy, he has secured his place on my list of the greatest people who ever walked this planet. Perhaps as many as  30-120 million kids have been saved by Bill&#39;s foundation. This begs a vital question: Why is Gates so awfully wrong about education? Why does he fall for the same old myth that  investing in education will produce better outcomes? The education system is wrong and it must be redesigned.  Compulsory schooling must end. See:  Grand Education Reform</p><p>比尔·盖茨是早期的指导思想和我们的灵感。当我和Krzysztof Biedalak在公司橡皮戳上进行第一笔3美元投资时（这是1991年波兰所有公司的共产主义义务）时，微软是一家市值数十亿美元的公司。我们怎么能不被灵感蒙蔽？我们想编写一个通用的软件，而世界将是我们的-我们认为。 Bill Gates的软件理念基于对向后兼容性的尊重，使SuperMemo得以缓慢地缓慢采用。软件和数据库兼容性已保存了30年。我在1987年12月13日输入的第一批医学知识仍然保存在我的书集中，并且记忆深刻并且很有用。没有盖茨和他的兼容性立场，很久以前我就失去了所有这些知识。当盖茨转为慈善事业时，他已经在我的有史以来最伟大的人名单上名列前茅。比尔的基金会也许拯救了30-1.2亿个孩子。这提出了一个至关重要的问题：为什么盖茨在教育方面如此严重地错误？为什么他会误以为教育投资会产生更好的结果呢？教育系统是错误的，必须重新设计。义务教育必须结束。参见：盛大教育改革</p><p>  Everyone who disagrees with a great mind needs to pause and re-examine. Gates got sensational credentials. He sports a genius mind. He has seen more places that I could possibly ever manage to visit in Google Maps. He has spoken to more great people than I have had a chance to read about. He has visited more schools that I have seen on pictures. He started his forays into education in 1999. In contrast, I started thinking about &#34;the system&#34; only in 2016 when getting ready to write this  book. This makes me into a fledgling with an immature point of view. Gates himself is a great example of a brisk student who has turned his skills and talents into a monumental achievement. His credentials are so much better than mine!</p><p>  每个不同意伟大思想的人都需要暂停并重新检查。盖茨获得了轰动的证明。他具有天才的头脑。他在Google Maps中看到了更多我可能曾经设法访问过的地方。他与更多有才华的人交谈，比我有机会阅读的更多。他参观了我在照片上看到的更多学校。他于1999年开始涉足教育领域。相比之下，直到2016年，当我准备编写本书时，我才开始思考“系统”。这使我陷入了一个不成熟的观点。盖茨本人就是一个敏锐的学生的典范，他将自己的技能和才华转化为巨大的成就。他的资历比我的好得多！</p><p>   He looks at the education system like at the operating system. Measure the performance, look for bottlenecks in the system, fix the parameter here and there, videotape a great teacher, and make others copy the method, and manufacture greatness.</p><p>   他着眼于教育系统，就像操作系统一样。测量性能，寻找系统中的瓶颈，在这里和那里固定参数，录下一位优秀的老师，并让其他人复制该方法，从而制造出卓越的作品。</p><p> He looks at education like a philanthropic job. Like he treats health problems with mass vaccinations, he looks for a simple formula which could improve the education of the masses with some industrial move? He seems less focused on letting the brightest thrive, and more focused on preventing the weakest from dropping out. He wants to bring up the average using some  standardized testing approach.</p><p> 他将教育视为慈善工作。就像他通过大规模疫苗接种来治疗健康问题一样，他正在寻找一个简单的配方，可以通过一些工业举措来改善大众的教育水平？他似乎不太专注于让最聪明的人壮成长，而更专注于防止最弱的人辍学。他希望使用某种标准化的测试方法来提高平均值。</p><p> He looks at education like a big company that needs to be managed effectively with departments, and sub-departments. With a clear division of responsibility.  With an industrial goal in mind?</p><p> 他将教育视为一家大公司，需要通过部门和子部门进行有效管理。具有明确的责任分工。有工业目标吗？</p><p> Could this be that this great capitalist shows more socialist thinking than a little well-indoctrinated ex-communist like myself?</p><p> 难道这就是这位伟大的资本家比像我这样的受过良好教育的前共产主义者表现出更多的社会主义思想？</p><p> There is a different perspective of an employer and an employee, esp. in a creative position. Gates looks at the number of college graduates. I look for specific skills and creative powers. Actual degrees do not matter much if you take time to get into a particular brain.</p><p> 雇主和雇员有不同的看法，尤其是。处于创造性的位置。盖茨着眼于大学毕业生的数量。我在寻找特定的技能和创造力。如果您需要时间进入特定的大脑，那么实际的学位并不重要。</p><p> He looks at students like productive workers. The heretic idea of a longer school day must have come from the factory model thinking. Longer days, more production, more manufacturing.</p><p>他看着学生像生产工人。延长上课时间的异端想法一定来自工厂模型思维。更长的日子，更多的生产，更多的制造。</p><p> He looks at education from a societal point of view, while I look at the brain of an individual. He wants to move the masses to high achievement, while I want to produce more little Bill Gateses.</p><p> 他从社会的角度看待教育，而我从一个人的大脑看。他想使群众取得更高的成就，而我想生产更多的比尔·盖茨。</p><p> Unlike myself, Bill Gates does not focus on having more Bill Gateses. He focuses on helping the poor, in boosting qualifications of the middle class, and adds &#34; you can&#39;t run a society on top 5%&#34;. He is right, however, that top 5% can forge a path in education that would inspire all the rest. They cannot be run through a compulsory system set on pushing through the remaining 95%.</p><p> 与我不同，比尔·盖茨并不专注于拥有更多比尔·盖茨。他专注于帮助穷人，提高中产阶级的资格，并补充说：“你不能让一个社会的5％排名靠前。”他说得对，但是，前5％的人可以开辟一条教育道路，以激励其余所有人。它们不能通过强制执行剩余95％的强制性系统运行。</p><p> Gates&#39;s approach would be great for some poorer countries (e.g. in Africa). Where there are no schools, industrial approach and good management could quickly improve health, eliminate poverty, and provide basic education.</p><p> 盖茨的做法对某些较贫穷的国家（例如非洲）非常有用。在没有学校的地方，工业方法和良好的管理可以迅速改善健康，消除贫困并提供基础教育。</p><p> My approach is probably more suited to well-developed nations where the industrial approach makes people sick of schooling. With social awareness and education on the rise, we look for more little future Noble Prize winners and future Bill Gateses.</p><p> 我的方法可能更适合那些工业方法使人们讨厌上学的发达国家。随着社会意识的提高和教育程度的提高，我们期望将来的诺贝尔奖获得者和比尔·盖茨（Bill Gateses）人数更少。</p><p> His own kids get the best kind of learning. During his trips around the world, they get to visit places like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. This could spark a life-long passion that could turn them into future particle physicists or another incarnation of  Tim Berners-Lee.</p><p> 他自己的孩子得到最好的学习。在他环游世界期间，他们可以参观CERN的大型强子对撞机。这可能会激发终生的激情，使他们成为未来的粒子物理学家或蒂姆·伯纳斯·李的另一个化身。</p><p> Where Gates optimizes for improving the average, I am looking for the optimum of peak intellectual performance.</p><p> 盖茨针对提高平均水平进行优化的地方，我正在寻找最佳智力表现的最佳方案。</p><p> Last but not least, could Gates&#39;s approach be an afterglow of his dropping out from Harvard. I see that over and over again, dropouts seem to suffer from this life-long hangover about what could have been? They tend to over-appreciate the power of schooling or the power of college. In the same way, I might be under-appreciating my own degrees. Gates is  the opposite of Peter Thiel who studiously climbed the educational ladder until he stumbled to see the light. Thiel is now one of the staunchest critics of college.</p><p>最后但并非最不重要的一点是，盖茨的做法是否会成为他从哈佛退学的余辉。我一遍又一遍地看到，辍学者似乎遭受了终生的宿醉，可能会是什么？他们往往过分欣赏学校的力量或大学的力量。同样，我可能不太了解自己的学位。盖茨（Peter Gates）与彼得·泰尔（Peter Thiel）相反，彼得·泰尔（Robert Thiel）刻苦地爬上了教育梯子，直到偶然发现光明。蒂尔（Thiel）现在是大学最坚定的批评家之一。</p><p>  I see Gates&#39;s own life as a simple formula for success in science, engineering, or life in general:</p><p>  我认为盖茨自己的生活是在科学，工程或一般生活中取得成功的简单公式：</p><p> minor trajectory nudges within the  push zone by inspirational tutors. If tutors are not parents, this might be the most expensive part of the formula</p><p> 鼓舞人心的导师在推动区内轻微移动轨迹。如果导师不是父母，这可能是公式中最昂贵的部分</p><p>  healthy education, possibly interrupted by some breakthrough decision (e.g.  Let me drop out from Harvard to set up the greatest software company in the world)</p><p>  健康的教育，可能会因一些突破性的决定而中断（例如，让我从哈佛退学，创建世界上最大的软件公司）</p><p> Only Bill Gates truly knows it, but my understanding of his life story is that his future was determined by just one major factor: getting his hands on a computer. He was good at math and programming. So are dozens of kids in my neighborhood. My thinking comes from the fact that I was also strongly affected by my first contact with computers.</p><p> 只有比尔·盖茨真正了解这一点，但是我对他的生平的了解是，他的未来仅取决于一个主要因素：把手放在计算机上。他擅长数学和编程。我附近的几十个孩子也是如此。我的想法来自这样的事实，即我与计算机的第一次接触也极大地影响了我。</p><p>  When  I got my first computer in 1986, ZX Spectrum, I was 24 and experienced wild elation with computer&#39;s obedience in executing my commands. I told the computer what to do, and it did it perfectly without asking questions. That was wonderful. I started writing my  program for planning my day on paper long before I got the computer on my desk. I was eager to see it work! As ZX Spectrum would load programs from a cassette tape, I could not easily dream of having  SuperMemo. It needed access to some disk drive. I got my first PC with a 360 KB  floppy disk drive only  in 1987</p><p>  1986年，当我买到第一台计算机ZX Spectrum时，我24岁，并且在执行命令时经历了计算机服从的狂喜。我告诉计算机该怎么做，它完美地完成了工作，没有提出任何问题。太好了我早在将电脑拿到办公桌上之前就开始编写程序来计划我的纸本计划。我渴望看到它的运行！由于ZX Spectrum会从盒式磁带中加载程序，所以我不容易梦想拥有SuperMemo。它需要访问某些磁盘驱动器。我仅在1987年就获得了第一台装有360 KB软盘驱动器的PC</p><p> The above hypothetical formula for educational success is simple and effective. Only a few might ever dream to replicate the scope of Bill&#39;s success. If that formula does not bring serial Nobel Prize winners, it should at least bring up a great deal of happy and fulfilled individuals. Freedom to explore the world is essential and it is denied to a great deal of kids in the modern world. When Peter Thiel pays kids to drop out from college, he looks for this type of free thinking experience that can change one life and then can change the world.</p><p> 上述教育成功的假设公式简单有效。可能只有少数人梦想复制比尔成功的范围。如果该公式不能带来连续的诺贝尔奖获得者，那么它至少应该可以培养出很多快乐和充实的人。自由探索世界是至关重要的，现代世界中的许多孩子都没有这种自由。当彼得·泰尔（Peter Thiel）付钱给孩子辍学时，他寻求这种自由思考的经验，这种经验可以改变一种生活，然后可以改变世界。</p><p>   I am happy with  my achievements in life. I have followed the formula employed by Gates. However, there were some exceptions. Perhaps I could use them as an excuse for not being as wildly successful as Bill? I was sent to  daycare, and I am sure this slowed down my development. The time I spent with my brother was more intellectual and inspirational by two orders of magnitude. However, he was a student and could not babysit the little me for ever. In later years, I was forced into a degree of conformity by an ever-present threat of being enlisted by the army in service of the Warsaw Pact. In 1986, I was finally free of the army service, and could finally drop out, however, I was not ready. There was no market economics culture in Poland of the 1980s. I read about entrepreneurial science in Science in 1989 (Oct 31, 1989). This was the first time when it occurred to me that my research into memory might actually be a seed of a business. Initially, though, my passions led me in the direction of a PhD. Schooling told me that science done by entrepreneurs is inferior to science done in academia. I thought of  SuperMemo as an opportunity to earn money for a trip to America. It seems that while Gates was fast to mature as a little entrepreneur, I needed 28 long years to even start thinking of my  own business.</p><p>我为自己的生活成就感到高兴。我遵循了盖茨的公式。但是，也有一些例外。也许我可以以此为借口，而不像比尔那样疯狂地取得成功？我被送到托儿所，我相信这会减缓我的发展。我和哥哥一起度过的时间在两个数量级上更具智力和启发性。但是，他是一名学生，无法永远照顾小我。在后来的几年中，由于不断出现的被华沙条约组织的军队征召的威胁，我被迫达到某种程度的整合。 1986年，我终于脱离了军队，终于可以退学了，但是我还没有做好准备。 1980年代波兰没有市场经济学文化。我在1989年（1989年10月31日）阅读了有关科学中的创业科学的文章。这是我第一次想到对内存的研究实际上可能是企业的种子。不过，起初，我的激情使我朝着博士的方向发展。学校教育告诉我，企业家所做的科学不如学术界的科学。我将SuperMemo视为一次去美国旅行赚钱的机会。似乎盖茨作为一个小企业家很快就成熟了，但我需要28年的时间才能开始考虑自己的事业。</p><p>  Gates wants better teachers, better education, verification,  testing, measuring, carrot-and-stick for teachers, etc. In contrast, I stand with Steve Jobs. Jobs told the kids to  rebel!</p><p>  盖茨希望有更好的老师，更好的教育，验证，测试，衡量，为老师提供帮助，等等。相比之下，我支持史蒂夫·乔布斯。乔布斯告诉孩子们反抗！</p><p> Gates believes that the key to the  great future education system is the teacher. He is almost right. If we could populate present schools with great teachers, I wouldn&#39;t ever need to write  this book. The problem is that  a great teacher is simply a truly great man. Great teaching requires a degree of genius. We need millions of those great people. How can we possibly hope to produce hundreds of thousands of little Bill Gateses if this process is supposed to require another million of Bill Gateses in teaching positions? I know some of them, but we need the whole army. Without greatness, there is no great teaching! Bill&#39;s thinking is understandable: identify what a great teacher is, and reproduce. He noticed that a Master&#39;s degree does not make much difference in the formula. Nor does it determine a great programmer or a great artist. The same refers to seniority and experience. They do not help much. Teacher incentives may not work either. Things can get better with better pay, but the cost is astronomical. The pay may affect the selection but is less likely to affect individual quality. In the end, this might actually add to the race to put a tighter screw on kids! Moreover,  Holt and  Gatto can testify that great teachers are often first to be fired by the system. Gatto goes as far as saying:  We don’t need state-certified teachers to make education happen — certification probably guarantees it won’t.</p><p> 盖茨认为，伟大的未来教育体系的关键是老师。他几乎是正确的。如果我们可以在现有的学校中配备优秀的老师，那么我永远都不需要写这本书。问题在于，一个伟大的老师仅仅是一个真正的伟大人物。出色的教学需要一定的天才。我们需要数百万人。如果这个过程原本需要另外一百万比尔·盖茨任教，那么我们怎么可能希望生产成千上万的比尔·盖茨呢？我认识其中一些人，但我们需要整个部队。没有伟大，就没有伟大的教导！比尔的想法是可以理解的：确定一位优秀的老师是什么，然后再造。他注意到，硕士学位对公式没有太大影响。它也不能确定一个伟大的程序员或一个伟大的艺术家。同样是指资历和经验。他们没有太大帮助。教师激励措施也可能不起作用。薪水越高，事情就会越好，但是代价却是天文数字。工资可能会影响选择，但不太可能影响个人素质。最后，这实际上可能会加剧对孩子们施加更严格的要求！而且，Holt和Gatto可以证明，优秀的教师通常首先被该系统解雇。加托语甚至说：我们不需要国家认证的老师来进行教育-认证很可能会保证不会。</p><p> If reproducing a formula for a great teacher was that simple, we would identify what human genius is, in general, and try to reproduce. However, for that universal job, we need genius teachers, and the circle cannot be squared.</p><p> 如果为一位出色的老师复制公式是如此简单，那么我们通常会确定什么是天才，然后尝试复制。但是，对于这项通用工作，我们需要天才老师，而且圆圈不能平方。</p><p>  Gates admits that we do not know the reproducible formula for a great teacher. Perhaps he would then be interested in my reproducible formula for a great student, like himself. Gates says &#34; the private high school I attended, Lakeside in Seattle, made a huge difference in my life. The teachers fueled my interests and encouraged me to read and learn as much as I could&#34;. The keyword here is &#34; fueled&#34; (as opposed to &#34; tutored&#34;). In the millennial interview with Larry King (2000), Gates revealed what I see as the key element of his time at Lakeside high school: &#34; I got plenty of free time&#34;. What determined his greatness was his great passion rooted in the  learn drive. From a very young age, Bill always loved to learn and always showed great talents and skills for math, science, programming, etc. The best thing that teachers could do for Bill was to get off his back. In his own words: &#34; my math teacher let me go off and do independent study and computer stuff&#34;. That was also the trick that helped me determine my own life path.</p><p>  盖茨承认，我们不知道一位优秀老师的可重复配方。也许他会对我像他这样的优秀学生的可复制公式感兴趣。盖茨说：“我参加的私立高中，西雅图湖畔，对我的生活产生了巨大的影响。老师们激发了我的兴趣，并鼓励我尽可能多地阅读和学习。”此处的关键字是“加油”（与“辅导”相对）。在对拉里·金（Larry King）（2000）的千禧年采访中，盖茨透露了我认为他在湖滨高中学习的关键要素：“我有很多空闲时间”。决定他的伟大之处在于他对学习的热情。从很小的时候起，比尔就一直热爱学习，并且始终表现出在数学，科学，程序设计等方面的才华和技能。老师为比尔所能做的最好的事情就是退缩。用他自己的话说：“我的数学老师让我离开去做独立学习和计算机知识”。这也是帮助我确定自己人生道路的窍门。</p><p> This reminds me the great formula for helping kids get interested in science by  Neil deGrasse Tyson: &#34;  Get off their back!&#34;.</p><p> 这让我想起了尼尔·戴格拉斯·泰森（Neil deGrasse Tyson）帮助孩子们对科学感兴趣的伟大公式：“滚开背！”。</p><p> Gates keeps speaking of &#34; motivated students&#34;. However, he somehow perceives lack of motivation as an inherent inborn quality, while it is the family, society, or the school system that bear prime educational responsibility. We should remember that, health permitting, we are all highly motivated as toddlers!</p><p> 盖茨一直在谈论“积极进取的学生”。但是，他以某种方式将缺乏动力视为天生的天生素质，而承担主要教育责任的是家庭，社会或学校系统。我们应该记住，在健康允许的情况下，我们所有人都非常积极主动！</p><p> Bill says: &#34; If you’re a motivated student, it’s way better to be learning now than at any time in the past.&#34; - Bingo! Motivation is the key ingredient, and I wish Gates focused on that component! If you are a  well-motivated student, you do not even need a teacher!</p><p>比尔说：“如果您是一个积极进取的学生，现在学习比过去任何时候都更好。” - 答对了！动机是关键因素，我希望盖茨专注于这一部分！如果您是一个积极进取的学生，那么您甚至不需要老师！</p><p> Of many Gates&#39;s ideas about education, I like the grants for students to help them get to college most. Even if this is the exact opposite of what Thiel does. As long as the grant goes to kids to pursue their dreams, college or business, their specific pathway to great goals is secondary.</p><p> 在盖茨关于教育的许多想法中，我喜欢为学生提供助学金，以帮助他们最大程度地上大学。即使这与Thiel所做的事情完全相反。只要补助金用于孩子们追求自己的梦想，大学或企业，他们实现宏伟目标的特定途径就是次要的。</p><p> Gates liked an online lecture on crystallography, but bemourned the fact that confusion makes people drop out. He thinks &#34; social structure and support&#34; is what is needed to persist. I say we would better focus on  learntropy. Gates&#39;s is old-fashioned thinking. In future education, there will be crystallography for Bill, and crystallography for a 5-year-old. And the latter will be no worse, no less scientific, and no less fascinating. We do not want &#34; social structure&#34; to push the kid through. We want &#34;  knowledge structure&#34; that matches kid&#39;s cognitive capacity and her current status of knowledge in particular.</p><p> 盖茨喜欢在线讲授晶体学，但对混乱使人们退学这一事实感到很遗憾。他认为必须坚持“社会结构和支持”。我说我们最好专注于学习熵。盖茨的想法是老式的。在将来的教育中，比尔将有晶体学，而5岁的儿童将有晶体学。后者也不会更糟，不会更科学，也不会令人着迷。我们不希望“社会结构”推动孩子通过。我们希望“知识结构”特别适合孩子的认知能力和她当前的知识状态。</p><p> Only a natural learning process based on a powerful  learn drive, and a powerful  passion can produce great individuals. This is how we can produce great teachers, and future Bill Gateses.</p><p> 只有基于强大的学习动力和强烈的激情的自然学习过程才能产生出色的个人。这样我们才能培养出优秀的老师和未来的比尔·盖茨。</p><p> My formula is simpler. It is not multi-billion dollar investments, or great management. The key to great education is in the brain! All we need is a bit of freedom to unlock its potential!</p><p> 我的公式比较简单。这不是数十亿美元的投资，也不是出色的管理。接受良好教育的关键在于大脑！我们需要的只是一点自由，以释放其潜力！</p><p> Bill should get the biggest clue from an effort to teach his own kids. He says &#34;  Teaching’s hard! You need different skills: positive reinforcement, keeping students from getting bored, commanding their attention in a certain way. I’d be better at teaching the college-level stuff&#34;.</p><p> 比尔应该从教自己的孩子的努力中获得最大的启示。他说：“努力学习！您需要不同的技能：积极强化，防止学生感到无聊，以某种方式吸引他们的注意力。我会更好地教授大学水平的东西”。</p><p> Herein, he should recall an old maxim that applies to all healthy brains undamaged by schooling: &#34; I love to learn but I hate to be taught&#34;. It is easy to forget that truth at the stage when, for a broadly-read adult like Bill, no reading or no lecture seems difficult. Bill Gates&#39;s brain is well primed with knowledge and no &#34;learning material&#34; will cause discomfort, or fidgeting, or daydreaming. He loves the crystallography lecture and fails to see why others give up easily at first comprehension obstacle. In healthy learning, giving up, or rather deferring and re-focusing should be the norm. Kids should not bang their heads against brick walls of hard material. Any material that lets them make the next step is good and desirable. Bill expects this &#34; focused, goal-oriented, college mode&#34; to get transplanted to a young brain, while the  learn drive thrives on  prior knowledge that is fragmentary in youth. Nearly all adults want to see kids advance to &#34; college mode&#34; fast.</p><p> 在这里，他应该回忆起一个古老的格言，它适用于所有未受学校伤害的健康大脑：“我喜欢学习，但我讨厌被教”。对于像比尔这样的广泛阅读的成年人来说，阅读或听课似乎很困难，在这个阶段，人们很容易忘记这一真理。比尔·盖茨的大脑充斥着知识，没有“学习资料”会引起不适，烦躁或做白日梦。他热爱晶体学讲座，却不明白为什么其他人在初次理解障碍时会轻易放弃。在健康的学习中，应该放弃或宁愿推迟和重新集中精力。孩子们不应将头撞在硬质材料的砖墙上。任何能够使他们迈出下一步的材料都是好的，也是可取的。 Bill希望这种“专注，目标导向的大学模式”将被移植到年轻的大脑中，而学习的动力则源于青年中零碎的先验知识。几乎所有的成年人都希望看到孩子们快速进入“大学模式”。</p><p> Nearly all adults take an adult-centric point of view and this might be one of the greatest dramas of modern education.</p><p>几乎所有成年人都以成年人为中心，这可能是现代教育中最伟大的戏剧之一。</p><p> For the way the brain develops, we have no way of remembering how our own brains worked when we were kids! We need to rely on science to  explain this back to our adult selves!</p><p> 对于大脑的发育方式，我们无法记住自己小时候大脑的工作方式！我们需要依靠科学向成人自我解释！</p><p> Gates was surprisingly late in the internet revolution and seems to be surprisingly late in the education revolution. But his genius will help him mend his ways. He has the right to invest, over-invest, or mis-invest his resources. There are many long-term benefits to costly lessons. In addition, there has been a world of good accomplished until now.</p><p> 盖茨出人意料地晚于互联网革命，似乎出奇地晚于教育革命。但是他的天才将帮助他修补自己的方式。他有权投资，过度投资或错误投资他的资源。昂贵的课程有很多长期的好处。此外，迄今为止，世界上已有许多成就。</p><p> There is a place for Bill Gates in  my plan. Freedom and  learn drive are not a formula for everyone. We also need a management system for  factory model schooling for everyone who needs help. This is a great area for governments and philanthropists.</p><p> 我的计划中有比尔·盖茨的地方。自由和学习动力并不是每个人的公式。对于需要帮助的每个人，我们还需要一个用于工厂模型教育的管理系统。对于政府和慈善家来说，这是一个很大的领域。</p><p>  Do not invest in schooling in the industrialized world.
