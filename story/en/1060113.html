It was an auspicious start for Goodlatte, who more recently formed his first institutional fund,  Form Capital, with entrepreneur  Josh Williams, an outfit that offers up to 40 hours of design help with logos or packaging or whatever else a team might need, with each check that it writes.</p><p> 正如它所碰巧的那样，Goodlatte的第二次检查进入了冰库。对于Goodlatte的吉祥开始，最近形成了他的第一个机构基金，与企业家乔希·威廉姆斯（Entrepreneur Josh Williams），一个装备，提供最多40小时的设计帮助，标识或包装或者团队可能需要的任何东西可能需要检查它写道。</p><p>  We talked with Goodlatte this week about the venture firm and its $12 million debut fund, which is largely funded by Goodlatte (it also counts the fund of funds Cendana Capital  as a limited partner). He shared why he thinks the biggest returns in the coming years will flow to very small funds that feature a big financial commitment from the general partners. He talked about investing in other small funds to ensure strong deal flow. He also shared why three months ago he moved to Miami, where he believes a “movement” is afoot. Excerpts from that chat follow, edited lightly for length and clarity.</p><p>  我们本周谈到了谈论风险公司及其1200万美元的首次亮相基金，这主要由Goodlatte资助（它还符合Cendana资本作为有限伙伴的资金基金）。他分享了为什么他认为未来几年的最大回报将流向非常小的资金，这些资金具有普通伙伴的重要财务承诺。他谈到投资其他小型资金，以确保强劲的流动。他还分享了为什么三个月前他搬到迈阿密，他认为“运动”正在进行中。摘录从该聊天跟随，轻轻地编辑了长度和清晰度。</p><p>  TC: You were an early designer on Facebook’s user growth team, working with Chamath Palihapitiya, among others. It’s interesting that you stayed for just four years, leaving in 2012 when the company went public.</p><p>  TC：您是Facebook用户增长团队的早期设计师，与Chamath Palihapitiya一起工作。有趣的是，你只留了四年，2012年当公司公开时。</p><p> BG: I had given some thought to staying longer, and obviously many of my friends are still there and have risen in the ranks and done extremely well. I was just very eager to get started as an investor . . . and at the time, Facebook was saying, ‘Well, you can’t stay here and do angel investing.’ Little did I know that some people skirted the rules a bit and ended up angel investing [without leaving]. But I was very excited to dig in and quite glad that I got started when I did [because] my second-ever angel investment was in Coinbase and had I stayed longer, maybe I would have missed that one.</p><p> BG：我有一些想法留下来，很多朋友仍然在那里，并在排名中升起，并做得非常好。我非常渴望成为投资者。 。 。当时，Facebook说，'好吧，你不能留在这里，做天使投资。“有些人知道有些人介绍一下规则一点并结束天使投资[不离开]。但是，当我做[因为]时，我很高兴能够挖掘，而且很高兴我开始了我的第二次天使投资是在冰库中，我呆着更长时间，也许我会错过那个。</p><p> TC: You’ve mentioned in the past that you’d been a Bitcoin nerd and followed some of the discussion threads that others might have missed. What sparked that early interest?</p><p> TC：你在过去提到过你是比特币书呆子，并遵循其他一些可能错过的讨论线程。引起了早期兴趣的是什么？</p><p> BG: There’s that famous William Gibson  quote: “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed.” I think about that in quite literal terms in the sense that there are sort of pockets of the future, these bubble hiding all around. In 2012, think the  Bitcoin subreddit was this bubble where, within it, people were talking very excitedly about Bitcoin and if you weren’t in it, you would kind of scratch your head about it.  . . . I felt a similar feeling about Facebook back in the day. I was a college student when Facebook launched, and everyone who was in college at the time was kind of privy to this future that was quite obvious amongst college students. But if you weren’t in college, people would kind of scratch their heads and say, ‘I don’t really understand what’s going on.’</p><p> BG：有着名着名的威廉吉布森报价：“未来已经在这里 - 它只是没有均匀分布。”我认为这是在非常字面的术语中，有一种未来的口袋，这些泡沫掩藏了周围的泡沫。 2012年，认为比特币削弱是这个泡沫，在其中，人们在兴奋地对比特币说话，如果你不在它，那么你会有点抓住你的头。 。 。 。我在白天对Facebook感到类似的感觉。当Facebook推出时，我是一名大学生，当时在大学的每个人都有刺势大学生在大学生中非常明显的。但如果你没有在大学里，人们会抓住他们的头，说，“我真的不明白发生了什么。 </p><p> TC: Can you comment on your return from Coinbase? You were an investor in the A, C and E rounds. Is there anything you can say about the cash on cash return?</p><p>TC：你能评论你的返回乐队吗？你是A，C和E Rounds的投资者。有什么可以在现金返回的现金上说吗？</p><p> BG: A lot of this is fairly  public knowledge at this point, but the Series A cost basis was 20 cents, so folks can kind of do math based on that.</p><p> BG：很多这一点是公共知识在这一点上，但系列成本的基础是20美分，所以人们可以根据这做数学。</p><p> I think so much of startup investing is [that] you can kind of have a prepared mind about things, but there’s also an element of luck about it. I don’t think I had complete foresight when I made the investment that Coinbase was going to be an $80 billion-plus company. I thought it was going to be successful. But it has clearly eclipsed even my greatest expectations, and I feel very lucky and fortunate to have to realized that.</p><p> 我认为这么多的启动投资是[那]你可以有点准备关于事情的思想，但还有一个运气的元素。当我使投资币将为800亿美元的公司，我不认为我已经完全先见。我以为它会成功。但即使是我最大的期望也明显黯然失色，我觉得很幸运和幸运能够意识到这一点。</p><p> TC: There are various on-ramps to VC these days, including AngelList syndicates and rolling funds. Did you ever take advantage of these or did you keep writing checks from your own pocket before founding Form Capital?</p><p> TC：这些天有各种各样的斜坡越来越多，包括昂堡斯主义辛迪加斯和滚动资金。你有没有利用这些或在创始形式首都之前从自己的口袋里写出检查吗？</p><p> BG: I don’t know if I should should be embarrassed to say this or not, but when I first got my start as an angel, I got advice from financial advisors and who said, ‘When it comes to angel investing, only invest a tiny percentage of your overall net worth into this.’ And to be honest, I maybe foolishly ignored that advice. Obviously, it has netted out in the long term, [but] it was large risk I took. I did 40 deals out of my own pocket. I was sort of getting closer to the end of running out of tape.</p><p> BG：我不知道如果我应该尴尬地说这一点，但是当我第一次成为天使时，我得到了财务顾问的建议，谁说，“当谈到天使投资时，只投资你的整体净值的一个小百分比值。“诚实，我可能愚蠢地忽略了这一建议。显然，它已经长期净出了[但]我拿走了很大的风险。我做了40个易于自己的口袋。我有点越来越靠近磁带的结束。</p><p> [At that point] I wound up investing through a small scout-like fund for a few deals and hit some incredible deals through that [and] I was able to play around, investing at a larger check size. It also helped me sort of step-stone up to doing [Form Capital]. But yeah, I kind of ignored a lot of the advice and put a lot of my own personal net worth into seed-stage investing and thankfully, it all worked out. Otherwise, I could have been in trouble. I think the advice is well-considered.</p><p> [在那一点]我通过一个像小型童子军的基金一起投资，以获得一些优惠，并通过[和]我能够播放一些令人难以置信的交易，投资更大的校准尺寸。它还帮助了我做了[表格资本]的踏石石。但是，我有点忽略了很多建议，并将很多自己的个人净值投入了种子阶段的投资，庆幸，这一切都在努力。否则，我本来可能遇到了麻烦。我认为建议被思考。</p><p> TC: How might you advise someone just spinning out of, say, Coinbase and thinking about jumping into angel investing? Go it alone? Use one of these other products?</p><p> TC：你如何建议某人只是旋转，说，乐队和思考跳进天使投资？单打独斗？使用这些其他产品之一？ </p><p> BG: I think it depends on their risk profile and their own appetite and whether they truly enjoy this type of work, because it can become a lot of work. If you want to develop a real portfolio, you have to take a lot of meetings, you have to make yourself available and put yourself out there in a way that I think a lot of folks who wind up getting a very meaningful personal exit may not want.  For those folks who are trying to break into venture who haven’t had this sort of exit, I say go for it. I say welcome. Let’s go invest together. Honestly, there’s a lot of space for small check investors. I think the folks writing small collaborative checks have an incredible opportunity to post some insane multiples.</p><p>BG：我认为这取决于他们的风险简介和自己的胃口，以及他们是否真正享受这种类型的工作，因为它可以成为很多工作。如果你想开发一个真正的投资组合，你必须拿大量的会议，你必须让自己可以让自己放在那里，让自己在某种程度上让我想起了很多人来获得非常有意义的个人出口可能不是想。对于那些试图闯入没有这种退出的冒险的人，我说去吧。我说欢迎。让我们一起投资。老实说，小型检查投资者有很多空间。我认为那些写小的协作检查的人有一个令人难以置信的机会来发布一些疯狂的倍数。</p><p> TC: You stress collaboration. Are people more or less collaborative when you started in 2012? Seed-size checks are  getting bigger, which suggests things have grown more competitive.</p><p> TC：你强调合作。在2012年开始时，人们还有更多或更少的协作？种子大小检查越来越大，这表明事情已经增长了更具竞争力。</p><p> BG: There was a period where it was extremely competitive, and for some folks who are deploying out of a certain fund size, it might feel extremely competitive right now. To me, it feels at its most collaborative, including because I am personally an LP in a number of tiny funds [headed by] tremendously talented managers who are just getting their start . . .</p><p> BG：有一段时间是极具竞争力的，对于一些部署某个基金规模的人来说，它现在可能感到非常竞争。对我来说，它感到最合作，包括因为我个人在一些微小的基金中是一个巨大的基金，这是一个只是开始他们的初步经理。 。 。</p><p> I do think there are a number of funds that raised more than they should have; I think there’s a danger zone somewhere around $80 million where you’re forced to be a lead investor and you can’t be a collaborative investor and so it becomes this slug-it-out, duke-it-out [situation] with other other funds as to who’s going to be the lead writer on a given deal . . .</p><p> 我认为有许多资金筹集了比他们应该的更多;我认为某个危险区域约为8000万美元，在那里你被迫成为一个领先的投资者，你不能成为一个合作的投资者，所以它成为这个slug-it-out，duke-it-out [情况]其他其他资金至于谁将成为给定交易的主导作家。 。 。</p><p>  If you’re aiming to write a large check, let’s say $1.5 million, and the founder comes back to you and says, ‘We can’t do that, but we can give you a $150,000 allocation,’ that’s just absolutely fatal to somebody trying to deploy a very large seed fund, versus if my target check size is something like $250,000. If I get squeezed down to $150,000, I can actually make that work economically within the fund math.</p><p>  如果你的目标是写一张大型支票，让我们说150万美元，而且创始人回到你身边并说，“我们不能这样做，但我们可以给你15万美元的分配，”这对某人来说绝对致命试图部署一个非常大的种子基金，而不是如果我的目标检查大小是250,000美元的东西。如果我被挤压到150,000美元，我实际上可以在基金数学中经济地工作。</p><p> TC: So you’ll write a check as small as $150,000. What’s the upper boundary, and how much ownership are you targeting when you fund a startup?</p><p> TC：所以你会写一张小于150,000美元的支票。什么是上边界，你为初创公司提供了多少次来定位多少？</p><p> BG: It’s upwards of $500,000, give or take, and our target is 3%. But, again, part of the joy of being a small fund manager is more flexibility in terms of constructing a portfolio. In the cases where we may get squeezed down a little bit, or we want to invest at a slightly higher valuation than is typical, we can paint outside the lines a tiny bit more.</p><p> BG：向上为500,000美元，给予或采取，我们的目标是3％。但是，再次成为一个小型基金经理的一部分快乐在构建投资组合方面更具灵活性。在我们可能会被挤压一点点的情况下，或者我们希望投资略高于典型的估值，我们可以在线外面涂抹一点。 </p><p> TC: Meaning bigger checks? Do you typically raise special purpose vehicles, or SPVS, in order to take a bigger bite of certain companies?</p><p>Tc：意思是更大的检查？您通常培养专用车辆或SPV，以便采取更大的某些公司咬合吗？</p><p> BG: One pattern for that was my personal investment in Coinbase. By being close to the company, by helping on a few very minor things over the years in terms of design, in terms of making connections to design firms and helping recruit some designers, they gave me follow-on allocations. And then in the Series E, I was able to raise an SPV into the deal based on the idea of building a deep relationship with the company.</p><p> BG：一种模式为这是我对冰库的个人投资。通过靠近公司，通过在设计方面多年来，在设计公司的联系方面，通过帮助招聘一些设计师，他们给了我后续分配。然后在e系列中，我能够根据建立与公司建立深层关系的想法来提高SPV。</p><p> That’s essentially the model going forward. We may or may not continue to pursue SPVs. We may pick a different vehicle in the future for how to deploy that follow-on capital. But the idea is: wedge in early with a small check, put a lot of skin in the game on that check [with a bigger general partner commitment in the fund than is typical], and build a relationship and try to be disproportionately helpful relative to our check size.</p><p> 这基本上是模特前进的。我们可能会或可能不会继续追求SPV。我们可以在将来挑选不同的车辆，了解如何部署该后续资本。但是这个想法是：早期楔入小检查，在比赛中放置了很多皮肤，检查了基金的较大的普通合作伙伴承诺，而不是典型的]，并建立一个关系并试图对亲戚提供不成比例的帮助到我们的检查大小。</p><p> TC: You tweeted that for that SPV, you pitched 50 different parties, and only three said yes.</p><p> TC：你推文，为那个SPV，你投了50个不同的各方，只有三个说是的。</p><p> I invested a total of 3 times into Coinbase, including an SPV I raised into the last round.</p><p> 我共投入3次，进入冰纸，包括一个我在上一轮筹集的SPV。</p><p> I pitched the SPV to almost 50 different parties. Only three said yes. 🤷‍♂️</p><p> 我把SPV推到了近50个不同的各方。只有三个说的是的。 🤷♂️</p><p>  BG: Yeah, it was amazing in late 2018 how in the dumps the crypto market was, and people thought that the overall stock market was going to be heading that way, so this was a very, very difficult SPV to raise. I wasn’t the only person who had one, and so there was some amount of market competition. Then just the nature of SPVs is such that you get your allocation, and bang goes the starting gun, and you need to very quickly talk to a lot of people.</p><p>  BG：是的，2018年底令人惊叹了倾倒的加密市场，人们认为整体股市将以这种方式展望，所以这是一个非常非常艰难的SPV。我不是唯一一个拥有一个的人，所以有一定数量的市场竞争。然后只有SPV的性质就是你得到你的分配，砰的一声爆炸，你需要很快和很多人交谈。 </p><p> [Still] it is remarkable how quickly the perception of that company has changed over just two short years, give or take. I give a lot of credit to the investors who backed us on that SPV because they they took the risk with us. I’ve had a number of people [since] say, ‘Oh, you should have called me, I would have invested.’ And maybe they would, maybe they wouldn’t have.</p><p>[静止]这是卓越的，这一公司在短短两年内改变了这一公司的看法是多么迅速，给予或采取。我向投资者提供了很多信誉，因为他们冒了我们的风险。我有很多人[自从]说，'哦，你应该打电话给我，我会投资。'也许他们会，也许他们不会有。</p><p> TC: You talked at the outset about communities and bubbles and I can’t help but wonder if you think you are hearing about more interesting deals, having moved recently to Miami three months ago, than you would in the Bay Area.</p><p> TC：你在关于社区和泡沫的一开始就谈到了，但我不禁怀疑您是否认为您在三个月前向迈阿密移动的比较有趣的交易，比你在湾区。</p><p> BG: It does really feel like that’s the case, and I started seeing this maybe in late November, and then very quickly said, ‘Okay, why not? This feels fun, this feels exciting.’ And I’m glad I made the jump, because while I love San Francisco — I think San Francisco is a tremendous place [that] will always be one of the great tech epicenters of the world — I think a lot of folks moved here because they were looking to change things up. And the energy that comes from that, where everyone’s trying to make this work, is really quite exciting.</p><p> BG：它真的觉得就像这样的情况，我开始看到这可能在11月下旬，然后很快就说，'没关系，为什么不呢？这感觉有趣，这令人兴奋。我认为很多人在这里移动，因为他们正在寻求改变事情。和那种来自的能量，每个人都试图做出这项工作，真的很令人兴奋。</p><p> A lot of people said, ‘Oh, you’re going to miss out on things by moving to Miami, you’re going to take a step back in your career.’ And really, it’s been the opposite of that. It’s been a total accelerant of my career and investing.</p><p> 很多人说，'哦，你会通过搬到迈阿密来错过事物，你将在你的职业生涯中恢复一步。而且，真的，这与此相反。我的职业生涯和投资是完全加速。</p><p> We’re an interesting fit for Miami because Miami is known as being a design capital, and we’re a really design-driven fund, and there’s a lot of parallels there. [But I also realized that] I can be one of many thousands of new funds based in the Bay Area, or I can be one of a tiny handful based here in Miami and get all these tailwinds and have the mayor hype us up, and that sounds like a good deal to me.</p><p> 我们是迈阿密的一个有趣的契合，因为迈阿密被称为设计资本，我们是一个真正的设计驱动的基金，那里有很多平行。 [但我也意识到，我可以成为湾区的数千个新资金之一，或者我可以是迈阿密的一个小小的少数，并获得所有这些尾风，并让市长炒作我们这对我来说很好。</p><p> Pictured above, left to right: Goodlatte with Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, who more recently co-founded the cryptocurrency investment firm Paradigm.</p><p> 如图所示，左右到右：Goodlatte与Coinbase联合创始人Fred Ehrsam，他最近共同创立了加密货币投资公司范式。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/bobby-goodlatte-has-designs-on-how-to-succeed-in-venture-and-so-far-so-good/">https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/bobby-goodlatte-has-designs-on-how-to-succeed-in-venture-and-so-far-so-good/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/goodlatte/">#goodlatte</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/投资/">#投资</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
