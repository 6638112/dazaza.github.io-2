As new variants emerge, can they keep them at bay?</p><p>在去年年底，英国科学家的裂缝团队发现了一种新的冠状病毒压力，将遍布全球。随着新的变种出现，他们可以让他们保持在海湾吗？</p><p>    I n late November last year, the people of Swale in Kent were being lambasted for disobedience. They were being Covid-shamed. The district, home to a large number of apple orchards, as well as the historic towns of Faversham and Sittingbourne, had  the highest infection rates in the country. Close behind was nearby Thanet, the two areas totalling a little less than 500 sq km. The rules on wearing masks and social distancing were being “wilfully disregarded”, said Swale council leader Roger Truelove at an emergency meeting. Afterwards he told reporters: “We do get reports of crowding in supermarkets, and so we will be writing to supermarkets.” The council planned to “supercharge the messaging” that people should follow the rules. But they were not to know – how could they? – that the coronavirus had played a particularly nasty trick on their coastal borough.</p><p>    我去年十一月末去年，肯特的沼泽人民被因不服从而抨击。他们被羞辱了。该区，大量苹果园的家园以及Faversham和Seapbourne的历史悠久的城镇，在该国的感染率最高。近在咫尺附近，两个地区总计少于500平方公里。在紧急会议上，扫雷委员会领导人Roger Truelove表示，戴着面具和社会疏散的规则是“故意忽视”。之后他告诉记者：“我们确实在超市中获得了挤在超市的报道，所以我们将写信给超市。”安理会计划“加强消息传递”，人们应遵守规则。但他们不知道 - 他们怎么样？ -  Coronavirus在沿海自治市镇发挥了特别讨厌的技巧。</p><p> At least two months before anybody spotted that the UK had a problem, a new variant of the virus had emerged without any warning. The hunt for what would later be dubbed the Kent variant took over the lives of some of the UK’s leading scientists for many urgent weeks, leading to the cancellation of Christmas and the UK’s third lockdown. The variant spread so fast, it now accounts for most of the Covid cases in the UK.</p><p> 在任何人发现英国有问题之前，至少有两个月，没有任何警告的病毒的新变种。追捕后来将被称为肯特变体的东西，接管了一些英国领先的科学家的生活，这是许多迫切的几周，导致对圣诞节和英国的第三次锁定的取消。变体差价如此之快，现在占英国大部分Covid案件。</p><p>  But in late November, there was no clue as to what was behind the surge. Newspapers and TV showed images of people Christmas shopping in groups without masks all over England; Kent’s high streets looked no different. The country had been in lockdown for more than three weeks, and in most places cases were dropping. But in a few Kent boroughs they were still going up.</p><p>  但在11月下旬，没有关于浪涌背后的线索。报纸和电视显示了人们圣诞节购物的图像，没有面具在英格兰;肯特的高街看起来没有什么不同。该国一直在锁定超过三周，在大多数地方案件都在下降。但是，在一些肯特的自治市镇，他们还在上升。</p><p> The people who monitor the national pandemic at Public Health England (PHE) were puzzled. When outbreaks occur, regional and local public health teams investigate and take whatever action is needed. Mobile testing units are moved in. Sometimes it is workplaces that are hit, from  food markets such as that in Wuhan, to  chicken-packing factories or  textile workshops in the UK. Sometimes the surge occurs in low-income communities, living in overcrowded housing where social distancing is not easy. Swale and Thanet had their share of all these problems, but none explained why new cases continued to rise.</p><p> 监督公共卫生英国（PHE）的国家大流行的人令人困惑。当发生爆发时，区域和当地公共卫生团队调查并采取任何行动。移动测试单位搬进来。有时它是从武汉等食品市场击中的工作场所，到英国的鸡装工厂或纺织工厂。有时，浪涌发生在低收入社区，生活在过度拥挤的住房中，社会偏差并不容易。 Sweale和Thanet的份额所有这些问题，但没有解释为什么新案件继续上升。</p><p>  PHE sent in its flying squad.  Dr Christina Atchison, consultant epidemiologist, heads the rapid investigation unit, supporting overwhelmed regional teams. “Sometimes when you’re so bogged down in the detail, you can’t see the wood for the trees,” Atchison says. “You need a fresh pair of eyes.”</p><p>  Phe在飞行队中送了。 Christina Atchison博士，顾问流行病学家负责快速调查单位，支持不堪重负的区域团队。 “有时当你如此陷入细节时，你看不到树木的木材，”阿瑟米森说。 “你需要一双新鲜的眼睛。”</p><p> She talked to Kent’s regional director of public health and deputy director of health protection. She knew what they were up against; she used to work in this area herself. These are the people who evaluate and warn of health hazards, from lead in the water to the link between obesity and too many chip shops. “They had lots of hypotheses,” she recalls. One was that Kent commuters were bringing the infection back from London, though case numbers in the capital were not rising overall. Were there workplaces that were not Covid-safe? There was talk of parents not keeping their distance during school drop-offs. The local authority stepped up its warnings, but still the numbers rose.</p><p> 她谈到了肯特的公共卫生和卫生保护副主任的区域主任。她知道他们的反对;她曾经在这个地区工作过。这些是评估和警告健康危害的人，从水中的铅到肥胖和太多芯片商店之间的联系。 “他们有很多假设，”她回忆道。一个是肯特通勤者正在从伦敦带来感染，尽管资本的案件数量没有整体上升。有没有Covid-Safe的工作场所？谈论父母在学校下车时没有保持距离。地方当局加强了警告，但仍然是数字升级。 </p><p> What was special about Swale and Thanet? Both are on the east coast, either side of Canterbury. Thanet is famous for its beaches, for Margate, for being the home of  Tracey Emin, and for the port of Ramsgate, where cross-Channel ferries once ran and Van Gogh lived for a while. Swale is a mainly rural borough, home to orchards and hop gardens. Fewer than 150,000 people live in each area – but in common with other seaside resorts, there are high numbers of retirees and, as a result, large numbers of residential care homes. There has also been an influx of migrant labour working in agriculture, mainly from eastern Europe.</p><p>什么特别是Sweale和Thanet？两者都在坎特伯雷的任何一边都在东海岸。 Thanet以其海滩而闻名，以便成为Tracey Emin的家庭，以及Ramsgate港口，跨道渡轮曾经跑过的跨道渡轮，乘坐van gogh住了一会儿。 Sweer是一个主要是农村自治市镇，果园和霍普园的家园。每个地区的人少于150,000人 - 但与其他海滨度假村共同，退休人员有很多的退休人员，因此，大量的住宅护理家园。在农业中涌入农业劳动力，主要来自东欧。</p><p> But Atchison couldn’t find an obvious reason for the rising infection rate. “The health protection teams were doing everything right and it wasn’t going in the right direction. So I said, ‘I think it might be worth looking at the genomics.’”</p><p> 但阿斯基森无法找到感染率上升的明显原因。 “健康保护团队正在做正确的一切，它没有朝着正确的方向发展。所以我说，'我认为这可能值得看待基因组学。'“</p><p> Genomic sequencing and surveillance has transformed our understanding of the spread of disease. Epidemics of the past have had to be understood pretty much only by looking back: who got ill, and when, provided clues; whether someone was infected by their family, or in hospital, or at some sort of super-spreader event, such as a packed religious ceremony; whether the virus had hitched a ride on the 18.10 from Victoria to Sittingbourne. All of that still matters, but there are now other tools that allow us to track a virus’s progress in near real time: we can see its changes, know its strengths and weaknesses. And we do that by looking at its genetic fingerprint.</p><p> 基因组测序和监测改变了对疾病传播的理解。过去的流行病必须被回顾几乎才能理解：谁生病了，而且什么时候提供线索;无论有人感染家庭，还是在医院，或某种超级展位活动，如包装的宗教仪式;从维多利亚到塞巴顿，病毒是携带的18.10岁。所有这些仍然很重要，但现在有其他工具允许我们在接近实时跟踪病毒的进步：我们可以看到其变化，了解其优势和劣势。我们通过查看其遗传指纹来这样做。</p><p> Way before Covid-19 struck, the UK was world-beating at this. The British scientist  Francis Crick and his US colleague  James Watson, working at Cambridge University, discovered the double helix structure of DNA in 1953, and  Fred Sanger worked out how to sequence it soon after. The human genome – the body’s instruction manual, replicated in almost every cell –  was decoded in 2003 by an international collaboration. In 2012, the UK launched the  100,000 Genomes Project, to sequence data from NHS patients, providing clues as to how to treat cancers and rare diseases.  The goal was met in 2018.</p><p> 在Covid-19击中前的方式，英国是世界殴打。英国科学家弗朗西斯克里克和他的美国同事们在剑桥大学工作的詹姆斯·沃森发现了1953年DNA的双螺旋结构，弗雷德桑杰在何后努力解决。人类基因组 - 在几乎每个细胞中复制的身体指导手册 - 通过国际合作在2003年被解码。 2012年，英国推出了100,000个基因组项目，以从NHS患者序列数据，提供如何治疗癌症和罕见疾病的线索。目标是2018年举行会议。</p><p> Many of us were receiving 250 emails a day, together with a meetings schedule that spanned from dawn to dusk</p><p> 我们中的许多人每天收到250封电子邮件，以及从黎明到黄昏的会议时间表</p><p> So when the coronavirus first reached the UK, world-leading genomic scientists were ready to play their part. On 4 March 2020, they began a major collaborative effort to sequence samples from people who had fallen ill. The  Covid-19 Genomics UK (Cog-UK) consortium included the four public health agencies, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and more than a dozen universities.</p><p> 因此，当冠状病毒首先到达英国时，世界领先的基因组科学家准备好起来。于2020年3月4日，他们开始了一个重大的协作努力来序列的样本堕落。 Covid-19 Genomics UK（COG-UK）财团包括四个公共卫生机构，惠康桑格学院和十几所大学。</p><p> In a blog last December, head of Cog-UK Sharon Peacock recalled the intensity of those early days: “The urgency was underscored by a quickening drumbeat provided by recorded UK cases. Many of us were receiving as many as 250 emails a day, together with a meetings schedule that spanned from dawn to dusk.” Doubters said it was a waste of time, because coronaviruses do not mutate as fast as flu or HIV. “We took the view that waiting until the worst happens, only to realise that one is totally unprepared, is not where we collectively wanted to find ourselves.” Cog-UK was rapidly up and running, with the goal of sequencing as many genomes of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, as possible, from a random sample of Covid tests carried out in hospitals and the community. By late December,  the UK was responsible for about half of all the world’s genome sequencing of the coronavirus.</p><p> 在去年12月的博客中，COG-UK Sharon Peacock负责人回忆起初期的强度：“通过记录英国案件提供的加快Drumbeat强调紧迫性。我们中的许多人每天收到多达250封电子邮件，以及从黎明到黄昏的会议时间表。“怀疑说这是浪费时间，因为冠状病毒不像流感或艾滋病毒那样快速变异。 “我们认为，在最糟糕的情况下，只有意识到一个人完全没有准备，不是我们共同想到自己的地方。” COG-UK正在迅速上升和运行，目的是测序SARS-COV-2的许多基因组，这些病毒可以从医院和社区中进行的CoVID测试的随机样品中导致Covid-19。到12月底，英国负责冠状病毒全球全球基因组测序的一半。 </p><p> All viruses evolve and change over time; a virus with one or two mutations is called a variant. Genome sequencing aims to track those changes, which most of the time are insignificant. Changes to the genome of Sars-Cov-2 were seen within months of its first sequencing in January last year. But unless you sequence every sample collected for a Covid test, you may miss the beginnings of an important change – one that could enable the virus to cause more deaths. Last summer, the Cog-UK labs managed to sequence around half of all UK samples. But when cases are high, as they were last spring and again in November, the proportion dropped. The aim now is to sequence 10,000 every week, and the scientists would like to do even more.</p><p>所有病毒都会发展和随着时间的推移而变化;具有一个或两个突变的病毒称为变体。基因组测序旨在跟踪这些变化，大部分时间都是微不足道的。在去年1月的第一次测序中，在几个月内看到SARS-COV-2基因组的变化。但除非你排序，除了用于Covid测试的每个样本，否则您可能会错过一个重要变化的开始 - 一个可以使病毒能够引起更多死亡的开始。去年夏天，COG-UK实验室设法序列左右的英国样本。但是当病例很高时，因为他们是最后一次春天，再次在11月，比例掉了下降。现在的目的是每周排序10,000，科学家们希望做更多。</p><p>  W hen Atchison couldn’t find a reason for the Kent surge, she went to Meera Chand. Chand is an incident director at PHE, and a microbiologist and infectious diseases consultant. Since January last year, she has been on a rota with four or five others – half a week on, half off – ready to coordinate whatever PHE response is needed. She also runs a unit called the Genomics Cell, which brings together genome scientists from around the UK, as well as PHE experts, to monitor developments. She agreed with Atchison that they should take a closer look at Kent.</p><p>  When Atchison找不到肯特飙升的理由，她去了梅纳。 Chand是Phe的事件总监，以及微生物学家和传染病顾问。自去年1月以来，她一直在一个有四到五个其他人的rota  - 半星期半，一半 - 准备协调需要的任何Phe回应。她还经营一个名为基因组学细胞的单位，这些单元汇集了来自英国周围的基因组科学家，以及Phe专家来监测发展。她同意阿施蒂斯，他们应该仔细看看肯特。</p><p> “It was quite an unusual-looking situation,” Chand says, “and we saw that about half the genomes available for Kent belonged to this one huge cluster. They all looked really similar.”</p><p> “这是一个非常不寻常的情况，”Chand说，“我们看到大约有一半的基因组可用于肯特所属的这个巨大的集群。他们都看起来非常相似。“</p><p>  A “mind-boggling” 600,000 genomic sequences have been collected in the UK in the pandemic so far, says Nick Loman, professor of microbial genomics and bioinformatics at the University of Birmingham, where the data is stored.</p><p>  到目前为止，英国，英国北部大流行病的“令人难以置信”600,000个基因组序列是在伯明翰大学的微生物基因组学教授和伯明翰大学的生物信息学中收集的。</p><p> When scientists are looking at changes in a virus, they map it on to a phylogenetic tree – like a family tree, depicting the different paths the virus has taken as it mutates. “Over time, the virus diverges and goes off in different directions,” Loman says. Most of these changes have little effect. The cluster that became the Kent variant, B117, “were at the end of a long branch”, Chand says. In other words, there had been lots of mutations since the last time they had looked at that part of the tree. Not one or two, as they usually saw, but 23. Eight were on the spike protein, which enables the virus to attach to human cells, which was particularly alarming as nearly all the vaccines target the spike.</p><p> 当科学家正在寻找病毒的变化时，它们将其映射到一个像动物树一样，描绘了病毒已经突变的不同程度。 “随着时间的推移，病毒分歧并在不同的方向上脱落，”拉曼说。大多数这些变化效果不大。 Chand说，成为肯特变体，B117“的集群，B117”在长分支结束时“。换句话说，自上次看着树的那一部分以来，已经有很多突变。不是一两个，因为他们通常看到，但23.八个是在穗蛋白质上，使病毒能够附着于人体细胞，这对几乎所有疫苗瞄准尖峰时特别令人震惊。</p><p> Every Tuesday since last summer, Chand has met with a small group of genomics scientists from around the country by video link, to talk over anything unusual they have picked up. The first outbreak they looked at was in Leicester, in June. There, it wasn’t genomics that solved the puzzle; teams on the ground found the outbreak was centred in the east of the city, in streets of densely packed houses where generations lived together.</p><p> 自去年夏天以来每周二，Chand都会通过视频链接与全国各地的一小群基因组学科学家讨论，谈论他们已经拾起的任何异常。他们在六月莱斯特的第一次爆发。在那里，不是解决拼图的基因组学;地面上的团队发现爆发是以城市东部为中心的，在街头的街道上，经过一代人在一起。</p><p> I texted Patrick Vallance, saying it was something to watch. Any strain that transmissible would pose major problems</p><p> 我发了帕特里克乐器，说这是要看的。任何传播的压力都会带来主要问题 </p><p> But on Tuesday 8 December, they found themselves looking at pieces of a puzzle that in a few weeks would ruin everybody’s Christmas. Chand told the group about the big cluster of weird-looking genomes they had seen in Kent.  Andrew Rambaut, an evolutionary biologist at Edinburgh University and a member of the Tuesday group, had also noticed it. Just the day before, he had been looking for a mutation in the database held on the servers at Birmingham and Cardiff Universities. He had heard about mutation N501Y, later  nicknamed Nelly, from a closed meeting of the World Health Organization; this was a feature of a new and concerning variant in South Africa, although that would not be public knowledge for some weeks. Rambaut looked to see if Nelly had turned up in the UK – and found it in the Kent cluster.</p><p>但是在12月8日星期二，他们发现自己看着拼图的碎片，在几周内会破坏每个人的圣诞节。 Chand告诉小组关于他们在肯特上看到的奇怪看起来的大群。爱丁堡大学的进化生物学家和周二集团成员的进化生物学家亦注意到。就在前一天，他一直在寻找伯明翰和卡迪夫大学在服务器上举行的数据库中的突变。他听说过N501Y的突变，从世界卫生组织的封闭会议开始，后来尼尔利尼尔利。这是南非新的和有关南非的新的变种，尽管这不会是公众知识的几周。 Rambaut看着看看Nelly在英国出现了 - 并在肯塔基罗集群中发现它。</p><p>  It was an important moment, says Loman, also a member of the Tuesday group. “That meeting is legendary now, in our minds at least, because it was the start of an incredibly hectic week of analysis and report writing. We had found something that turned out to be very important.” Looking at the phylogenetic tree, Loman says, they would expect to see any Kent variants dotted across different branches, meaning they were mostly unrelated. “Instead, we found more than half the cases were in one cluster, which was like: ‘ Woah. Why has that happened? surely not all the people of Kent have gone to an illegal rave?’” The Tuesday group members agreed the branch looked “really wrong”, Chand says, “like something we hadn’t seen before.”</p><p>  Loman表示，这是一个重要时刻，也是周二集团的成员。 “现在，在我们的脑海中，这次会议至少是因为它是一个令人难以置信的分析和报告写作的一周开始。我们发现了一些结果非常重要。“洛曼说，看系统发育树，他们期望看到任何跨越不同分支的肯特变体，这​​意味着它们大多是不相关的。 “相反，我们发现超过一箱的群体是一个群集，这就像：'哇。为什么会发生这种情况？肯定并非所有的肯特人民都去了非法狂欢？“”星期二集团成员们同意该分支看起来“真的错”，Chand说，“喜欢我们以前没有看到的东西。”</p><p> On Friday, the new and emerging respiratory virus threats advisory group ( Nervtag) met. Chaired by global infectious diseases expert  Professor Peter Horby of Oxford University, the group is a key committee within Sage, the government’s scientific advisory group for emergencies. The Tuesday group presented a paper in which  Erik Volz from Imperial College London analysed the variant’s growth rate. It wasn’t the number of cases that was worrying, he said: it was the rate at which the numbers were growing.</p><p> 星期五，新的和新兴呼吸道病毒威胁咨询小组（神经创业）达成了。由全球传染病士专家Peter Horby的牛津大学担任主席，该集团是Sage的重点委员会，政府的紧急情况科学咨询小组。星期二小组提出了一篇论文，其中伦敦帝国学院的Erik Volz分析了变体的增长率。他说：这不是令人担忧的案件数量：这是数字增长的速度。</p><p> “The combination of having something genetically unusual and growing quickly was enough to raise alarm,” Volz says now. “And when we estimated the prevalence of the variant, it was exactly the places that had the highest incidence.” In other words, the areas where the new variant was concentrated were also the places with the highest rates of Covid.</p><p> “在遗爆的结合速溶和生长的组合足以提高警报，”沃兹现在说。 “当我们估计变种的普遍性时，它正是最突出的地方。”换句话说，新变异的浓缩的区域也是Covid速率最高的地方。</p><p> Professor Neil Ferguson, who leads the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, and is a member of Nervtag, read the paper, listened to what the group had to say and reached for his phone. “I texted  Patrick Vallance [the government’s chief scientific adviser], saying it was something to watch,” he tells me. Volz and Rambaut had estimated the variant could potentially be 50-70% more transmissible. “What concerned me was that any strain that is that much more transmissible would pose major problems in terms of control.”</p><p> 尼尔弗格森教授领导MRC全球传染病分析，是神经创业成员，阅读论文，听取了该群体不得不说过的手机。 “我发短信帕特里克沃斯[政府的首席科学顾问]，说这是看的，”他告诉我。 Volz和Rambaut估计该变体可能会更可传递50-70％。 “有关我的是，任何压力就是更可传播的压力会在控制方面构成重大问题。”</p><p> Those few weeks were really uphill. We knew we had to be really sure, really quickly, because the impact was so massive</p><p> 这几个星期真的很上坡。我们知道我们必须真的肯定，真的很快，因为影响是如此巨大</p><p> An intensive investigation began. With luck, a third piece of the jigsaw was about to be fitted into place. For a few months, the Wellcome Sanger Institute near Cambridge, part of Cog-UK and the country’s leading genomics research centre, had been carrying out the sequencing from people in the community, while the university labs took hospital samples. Sanger received a random selection of virus samples daily from the Lighthouse labs, the big test centres set up by the government. “We set up a process by which the waste residue of those PCR tests gets shipped to the Sanger in chilled vans,” says Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of the institute’s Covid-19 Genomics Initiative. “We were taking as many [samples] as we could. The idea was to look for undiscovered super-spreader events, or other changes in how the virus was spreading.”</p><p> 一个密集的调查开始了。幸运的是，第三片拼图即将被安装到位。几个月来，剑桥附近的康威桑格研究所，哥特 - 英国和该国领先的基因组学研究中心，一直在进行社区人民的排序，而大学实验室则采用医院样本。 Sanger每天从灯塔实验室进行随机选择病毒样品，由政府建立的大型测试中心。 “我们建立了一个过程，通过该过程，这些PCR试验的废物残留在冷藏的货车中将被运送到Sanger，”研究所的Covid-19基因组学倡议主任Jeffrey Barrett博士说。 “我们正在服用尽可能多的[样本]。这个想法是寻找未被发现的超级展位事件，或者病毒如何蔓延的其他变化。“ </p><p> The Sanger sees up to 5,000 samples a week, and usually there are only slight variations. In November, they spotted what was happening in Kent. “B117 appeared on the scene with 20 mutations compared with its closest relatives. And that was very weird,” Barrett says.</p><p>桑格每周看到最多5,000个样本，通常只有轻微的变化。 11月，他们发现了在肯特发生的事情。 “与其最接近的亲属相比，B117出现在20个突变的场景上。这是非常奇怪的，“巴雷特说。</p><p>  Then came the lucky break. The Lighthouse labs got in touch to say they had also noticed something strange. PCR tests detect parts of three different genes in the coronavirus, showing up “three green lights” – one for each, Barrett says. But the labs were getting increasing numbers of red, green, green tests. In other words, they were positive for two of the genes, but negative on one – the S-gene. They had seen this before, but only in 1% of cases. That percentage had suddenly risen, fast, to 5-10%. “We looked at all the tests that had this S-gene target failure,” Barrett says, “compared them with the analysis we were doing and said, oh gosh, these are all B117.” Volz and others could now work on a mathematical model to see how fast and where the variant was spreading.</p><p>  然后幸运的休息了。 Lighthouse Labs保持联系，说他们也注意到了一些奇怪的东西。 PCR检测冠状病毒中三种不同基因的部分，出现了“三个绿灯” - 每一个，Barrett说。但实验室正在越来越多的红色，绿色，绿色测试。换句话说，它们对于两个基因的两种基因呈阳性，但对S-基因产生阴性。他们以前见过这个，但只有1％的病例。百分比突然上升，速度迅速至5-10％。 “我们看着所有这一型基因目标失败的测试，”Barrett说，“与我们正在做的分析比较，说，哦，天哪，这些都是B117。”沃尔茨和其他人现在可以在数学模型上工作，看看变体蔓延的速度和位置。</p><p> The middle two weeks of December were intense, Ferguson remembers . Ministers had to be given the bad news; the evidence had to be incontrovertible. Chand’s Tuesday group spoke every day. “Those two, three weeks were really uphill,” she says. Above all, they needed to establish whether the Kent variant really did spread twice as fast as the original virus. “We knew that we had to be really sure, really quickly – because the impact was so massive.”</p><p> 十二月两周的中间被激烈，弗格森记得。部长必须得到坏消息;证据不得不是责任的。 Chand的星期二小组每天发言。 “这两个人，三个星期真的很上坡，”她说。最重要的是，他们需要确定肯特变体是否真的确实蔓延的两倍于原始病毒。 “我们知道我们必须真正肯定，真的很快 - 因为影响是如此大的。”</p><p> The Kent variant is now a big factor in Europe’s third wave. A race is on between its spread and the rollout of vaccines</p><p> 肯特变体现在是欧洲第三波的重要因素。竞争与疫苗的蔓延和卷展览之间的比赛</p><p> On 14 December,  Matt Hancock told the House of Commons that there had been an exponential rise in cases of a new variant in Kent, London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshire. Four days later, Nervtag met again to discuss the variant and noted its “exponential growth”. Vallance, chief medical officer  Chris Whitty and the prime minister were briefed. On Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson announced that London, the south-east and east  would enter tier 4, with non-essential shops closed. And Christmas, for most, was cancelled.</p><p> 12月14日，Matt Hancock告诉公约，肯特，伦敦和埃塞克斯和赫特福德郡的一部分，在肯特，伦敦和赫特福德郡的一部分发生了指数上升。四天后，神经纪念再次见面讨论变种并注意到其“指数增长”。简要介绍了克里斯·惠特和总理的首席医学官员的档案。 12月19日星期六，鲍里斯约翰逊宣布伦敦，东南和东部将进入第4级，不必要的商店关闭。和圣诞节，大多数人被取消。</p><p> For the scientists, there would be no holiday at all. “I was intending to take 10 days off over Christmas,” Ferguson says. “I took Christmas Day off. That is true, I think, for everybody who is working on this variant.”</p><p> 对于科学家来说，将没有假期。 “我打算在圣诞节休息10天，”弗格森说。 “我休息了圣诞节。这是真的，我认为，对于正在努力解决这种变体的人。“</p><p> On  4 January, Johnson announced a full national lockdown. “There is no doubt that in fighting the old variant of the virus, our collective efforts were working,” he said. “But we now have a new variant.”</p><p> 1月4日，约翰逊宣布全国锁定。 “毫无疑问，在争夺病毒的旧变种方面，我们的集体努力正在运作，”他说。 “但我们现在有一个新的变体。” </p><p>  W hile sequencing helped identify and track the variant’s spread, it couldn’t explain where it had come from. Atchison and her team went looking for patient zero, contacting the 20 first cases they knew about. “We wanted to know, has it been imported? Is it from an animal?” They had been watching for any virus arriving from Denmark’s mink farms, where an outbreak had led to  the cull of 17m animals in November. “We were nervous there may be an animal reservoir. And most other countries don’t do genomic surveillance as well as we do.”</p><p>W HILE测序有助于识别并跟踪变体的传播，它无法解释它来自哪里。 Atchison和她的团队去寻找患者零，联系了他们知道的第一个案件。 “我们想知道，已经进口了吗？是来自动物吗？“他们一直在观看抵达丹麦的貂皮场处的病毒，在那里爆发的爆发导致了11月的17米动物。 “我们很紧张，可能有动物水库。大多数国家都没有基因组监测和我们这样做。“</p><p> The first sequences in the database were from two people who were tested on 20 September in Kent, and 21 September in London. But neither was the first person to have it. “They hadn’t had links to immunocompromised people, hadn’t travelled anywhere unusual or had contact with someone who had,” Atchison says. “They weren’t farmers or vets.”</p><p> 数据库中的第一个序列来自两个人在肯特9月20日测试，并于9月21日在伦敦。但是第一个拥有它的人也不是。 “他们没有与免疫表明的人的联系，没有任何不寻常的地方旅行或与曾经有过的人一起旅行，”阿瑟森说。 “他们不是农民或兽医。”</p><p> Tracking back beyond the sequenced cases was impossible with any certainty; virus samples were destroyed after a few days. (The discovery of the Kent variant has changed that; labs are now asked to keep them for a month.) “My best guess was the first patient might have been somewhere in London, because it’s just a big city with lots of people,” Barrett says. It might have been someone who flew in from another country; but as it spread rapidly in the UK before taking hold anywhere else, he thinks this unlikely.</p><p> 跟踪超越测序的案例是不可能的任何确定性都是不可能的;几天后病毒样品被破坏。 （肯特变体的发现已经改变了这一点;现在，实验室被要求保持一个月。）“我最好的猜测是第一个患者可能是伦敦的某个地方，因为它只是一个有很多人的大城市，”巴雷特说。这可能是一个从另一个国家飞越的人;但由于它在持有其他地方之前在英国迅速传播，但他认为这不太可能。</p><p>  Most scientists now think it emerged in someone who was ill with Covid for a long time, and whose immune system was compromised.  Ravi Gupta, professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge University, saw this when the  virus mutated in a Covid patient he was treating in hospital. The man in his 70s had a damaged immune system because of lymphoma and chemotherapy. Two months after contracting Covid, he was given convalescent plasma, full of antibodies from patients who had recovered. But sequencing the virus in him, they found it had changed in a way that appeared to confer resistance to the antibodies. It was not the first case of the Kent variant; but many scientists think  it is the most plausible explanation of how it might have emerged.</p><p>  大多数科学家现在认为它有很长一段时间生病的人，并且其免疫系统受到损害。剑桥大学临床微生物学教授Ravi Gupta看到了这一点，当在咖啡患者中突变的病毒时，他在医院治疗。由于淋巴瘤和化疗，他70年代的男子受损了受损的免疫系统。合约康复后两个月后，他给予康复血浆，充满了康复的患者的抗体。但在他身上测序病毒，他们发现它以一种似乎赋予抗体抵抗的方式改变了。这不是肯特变体的第一种情况;但许多科学家认为，最合理的解释是如何出现的。</p><p>  T he B117 variant is now the dominant form of the virus in the UK. Its stealthy, rapid spread over two critical months made it impossible to contain. Other countries closed their borders to the UK in December, but were unable to keep it out; the Kent variant is now a big factor in  Europe’s third wave. In every country it has reached, a race is on between the spread of B117 and the rollout of vaccines. Its discovery has confounded the doubters who thought Cog-UK a waste of time and money, and will ensure genomic sequencing becomes central to the way the UK deals with Covid. “It validates an approach I really want us to have for the future,” Chand says, “where genomics is entirely integrated into the rest of the health service. You can perceive it as a specialist research thing, out on a limb – but it needs to be embedded there.”</p><p>  B117变体现在是英国病毒的主要形式。它的隐秘，在两个关键月份的迅速蔓延使其无法遏制。其他国家在12月份关闭了对英国的边界，但无法妥善保留;肯特变体现在是欧洲第三波的重要因素。在所有国家达成的国家，一场比赛就在B117的传播和疫苗的推出之间。它的发现已经混淆了思考齿轮 - 英国浪费时间和金钱的乳膏，并确保基因组测序成为英国涉及科迪德的方式。 “它验证了一种我真正希望我们为未来拥有的方法，”Chand说：“基因组学完全融入了卫生服务的其余部分。您可以将其视为一个专业研究的研究，但在肢体上 - 但它需要嵌入那里。“</p><p> While they watch for homegrown changes in the virus, the Tuesday group – and many other UK scientists – are also on red alert for variants from abroad, such as B1351 from South Africa and  P1 from Brazil. Alarmingly – and in contrast to the Kent variant – the vaccines we have may not work as well against them. Trials of the newer  Janssen and  Novavax vaccines showed efficacy in South Africa was up to 60% against the variant – substantially lower than against the original virus. A small trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine showed it did not stop pe</p><p> 虽然他们表在病毒中观察到本土变化，周二集团 - 以及许多其他英国科学家 - 也是来自国外的变体的红色警报，例如来自南非和巴西的P1的B1351。令人惊讶的是 - 与肯特变体相比 - 我们可能无法与他们一起工作的疫苗。较新的Janssen和NovaVavax疫苗的试验表明，南非的疗效达到60％，反对变异 - 基本上低于原始病毒。 Astrazeneca疫苗的小型试验表明它没有停止PE</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/03/has-everyone-in-kent-gone-to-illegal-rave-on-variant-trail-with-covid-detectives">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/03/has-everyone-in-kent-gone-to-illegal-rave-on-variant-trail-with-covid-detectives</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/covid/">#covid</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/illegal/">#illegal</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/英国/">#英国</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
