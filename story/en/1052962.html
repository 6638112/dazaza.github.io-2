Part of her work meant training other doctors, many of whom went on to far more lucrative practices on their own. Anuncia was left to make ends meet on far lower wages as a single mother.</p><p> 来自关岛北部的一个岛屿的土着Chamorro妇女，anuncia曾担任不孕症专家，研究体外施肥和干细胞技术。她的工作中的一部分意味着培训其他医生，其中许多人自己就越来越有利可图。安静亚被留下来到远期会议，作为一个单身母亲。</p><p> “Pay inequity hurts families,” Moussouris says, “And in my case, I really do feel like my mom should have been able to retire and take it a lot easier earlier in her life, and she might still be with us.”</p><p> “支付不平等伤害家庭，”穆斯乌斯说，“在我的情况下，我真的觉得我的妈妈应该能够退休并在她的生命中早些时候更容易地取得很多，而且她可能仍然和我们在一起。”</p><p> “We are trying to achieve pay equity across all genders and races in the world in our lifetime.”</p><p> “我们正在努力在我们一生中实现全体的所有性别和比赛的薪酬。”</p><p> Moussouris has carved a better path for herself, climbing the ranks at Symantec, Microsoft, and HackerOne, establishing herself as a pioneer of the bug bounty model and founding her own company, Luta Security. But while she’s risen in the cybersecurity world, she’s never forgotten her mother’s experience — and she’s now using her hard-won power to do something about it. After a bruising five-year lawsuit against Microsoft, Moussouris is now taking on the pay equity problem, starting with  a nonprofit foundation and  a new center at Penn State Law. The goal of the foundation is to urge companies into conducting audits and taking action on their own. If they don’t, the law center will push for new laws and legal precedents that will make it easier for employees to hold them accountable in court.</p><p> Moussouris已经为自己雕刻了一个更好的道路，攀登赛门铁克，微软和赫卡托纳的行列，将自己建立为Bug Bounty模型的先驱，并创造自己的公司Luta安全。但是，虽然她在网络安全世界上升了，但她从来没有忘记过母亲的经历 - 她现在正在利用她的辛勤力量来做一些事情。在对微软造成五年诉讼之后，穆斯诺斯现在正在接受薪酬权益问题，从非营利基金会和宾夕法尼亚州法律的新中心开始。基础的目标是敦促公司进行审核并自己采取行动。如果他们没有，法律中心将推动新的法律和法律先例，这将使员工更容易在法庭上持有其负责任。</p><p> “We are trying to achieve pay equity across all genders and races in the world in our lifetime,” she says. “As in right now.”</p><p> “我们正在努力实现我们一生中所有的家庭和比赛的薪酬股权，”她说。 “现在就在。” </p><p> The problem is much bigger than a single woman or a single job.  An Economic Policy Institute study from 2016 estimated that women are paid 83 cents for every dollar men make, comparing over hours worked. For Black women, the number falls to  63 cents on the dollar. The disparity gets worse for older workers and more skilled jobs, deepening over time. As pay equity activists see it, the change is gradual, beginning with a slightly lower salary on hiring, a slightly tougher path to promotion, until it’s broad enough to make a visible dent in the way a society’s wealth is distributed.</p><p>问题比单身女性或一份工作要大得多。 2016年的经济政策研究所研究据估计，每款月经都有83美分，比较工作时间。对于黑人女性，该数字落在美元上涨至63美分。对于老年工人和更熟练的工作而言，差异变得更糟，随着时间的推移深化。由于薪资股权活动家看到它，改变是渐进的，从招聘薪水略有较低，促销稍微艰难的道路，直到它足够广泛，以便在社会的财富的方式中制作可见的凹痕。</p><p> That pay gap has been a growing source of tension in tech companies. Women continue to be hugely outnumbered on engineering teams and face  a particularly steep pay gap early in their careers, even as executives tout commitments to diversity. In some instances, the disparity has cohered into specific legal claims. In 2018, Uber  agreed to pay $10 million to women and people of color working for the company after a state-level pay equity suit. Google is  currently litigating a similar case, filed in the wake of the Google walkout.</p><p> 薪酬差距是科技公司的持续巨大来源。妇女继续在工程队上大肆突出，在他们的职业生涯早期面临特别陡峭的薪酬差距，即使是对多样性的承诺。在某些情况下，差异已成为特定的法律索赔。 2018年，优雅同意在国家级薪酬股权诉讼后为本公司支付1000万美元的妇女和色彩的人员。谷歌目前正在诉讼类似的案例，在谷歌罢工之后提交。</p><p>  Moussouris’ lawsuit against Microsoft was filed years before those cases, and while it failed, she sees it as a kind of test case for pay equity claims in the industry. Not everyone sees it that way: reached for comment, a Microsoft representative said the lawsuit was groundless, while emphasizing the company’s commitment to pay equity. “Ms. Moussouris chose to drop her case, which we have always believed to be without merit, after the trial court and the Ninth Circuit rejected her attempts to frame it as a class action,” the representative said.</p><p>  穆斯鲁斯对微软的诉讼是在这些案件之前提出的几年，而在它失败的同时，她认为它是在行业中缴纳股权索赔的一种测试案例。不是每个人都认为这一点：达成了评论，微软代表说诉讼是毫无根据的，同时强调公司承诺支付股权。 “小姐。代表们在审判法院和第九巡回巡回赛后，穆斯鲁斯选择放弃她的案例，我们一直认为没有优点，并在初审巡回赛后拒绝将其框架作为一名班级行动。“</p><p> Free of any nondisclosure agreement, Moussouris is unusually candid about her experiences at Microsoft, which she sees as a kind of test case for how big employers can keep women’s salaries low. She arrived at the height of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as CEO, before Satya Nadella pushed the company toward a more humane workplace culture. For Moussouris, the issues began even before she took the job. Her hiring manager asked her previous salary during the interview, a practice that has since been outlawed in Washington state for perpetuating pay disparities. More damaging, he convinced her to take a lower job title; she had been a principal at Symantec, but her entry title at Microsoft would be “security strategist,” a significantly lower rank.</p><p> 穆斯诺里斯没有任何不合适的协议，对微软的经历非常坦诚，她认为这是一种考验案例，了解大型雇主如何让女性的工资低得多。在Satya Nadella将公司推向更人性化的工作场所文化之前，她抵达史蒂夫鲍尔默的任期高度。对于穆斯尿，甚至在她参加工作之前开始的问题。她的招聘经理在面试期间向她询问了她以前的薪水，这是在华盛顿州被禁止的薪酬差距之后的实践。更加损害，他说服她占职称较低;她是赛门铁克的校长，但她在微软的入境名称将是“安全战略家”，一个明显较低的等级。</p><p> “Their justification at the time was, ‘Microsoft is different, our bar is so much higher, we don’t want you to get a mediocre review out of the gate,’” Moussouris says. “It didn’t occur to me that it was going to be several years before I could even approach principal again.”</p><p> “他们当时的理由是，”微软是不同的，我们的酒吧越来越高，我们不希望你从门口得到平庸的评论，“”穆斯鲁斯说。 “我并不对我来说，在我甚至可以再次接近校长之前将是几年。”</p><p> Moussouris did well at Microsoft, pioneering the company’s bug bounty program and building a reputation as a leading voice in corporate cybersecurity. She got good scores on her performance reviews and was promoted twice over her seven years at the company — but she found it a difficult place for women to work. She remembers a senior director in her division, who had a habit of acting inappropriately with female co-workers, giving unwanted back massages or sending emails about his tantric number. In one incident, she remembers him announcing to her team’s open office that it was “steak-and-a-blow-job day.”</p><p> Moussouris在微软上做得很好，开创了公司的错误赏金计划，并在企业网络安全的领先声音中建立声誉。她对她的绩效评估得到了良好的分数，并在公司七年后被推广了两次 - 但她发现这是妇女工作的困难地方。她在她的部门中记得一名高级总监，他习惯于与女性同事行动，给予不需要的背部按摩或发送关于他的标记号码的电子邮件。在一个事件中，她记得他宣布向她的团队的开放办公室是“牛排和吹出工作日”。</p><p> “I think he got the memo that he’d better not try anything like that with me,” she says, “but he was doing it to my staff.”</p><p> “我觉得他得到了备忘录，他最好不要和我一起尝试任何东西，”她说，“但他正在为我的员工这样做。” </p><p> “Plaintiff was chastised at Microsoft for being too pushy, direct, ‘prickly,’ harsh, or aggressive”</p><p>“原告在微软私下，因为太咄咄逼人，直接，'刺，'苛刻或侵略性”</p><p> She put in for a transfer and confronted him about his behavior in a formal interview as she left. Later, the company’s HR team got involved, although it’s unclear how the investigation resolved. As she recalls it, the investigation didn’t slow him down. Moussouris kept scoring high on her performance reviews, but in the next round of annual bonuses, her award was less than she expected. She began to think the senior director might have lowered it.</p><p> 她在正式面试中投入转移并面对他的行为。后来，公司的人力资源团队参与其中，虽然尚不清楚调查如何解决。当她回忆起它时，调查并没有让他失望。穆斯鲁斯在她的绩效评价中保持得分高，但在下一轮的年度奖金中，她的奖项少于她预期的。她开始认为高级总监可能会降低它。</p><p> The events of that last year at Microsoft have been chewed over endlessly in the lawsuit, and many of the allegations were later filtered through the language of the courts. “Plaintiff observed that her performance evaluation scores suffered due to the stack ranking process due to her gender,” one declaration from Moussouris’ side reads. “Plaintiff was chastised at Microsoft for being too pushy, direct, ‘prickly,’ harsh, or aggressive.”</p><p> 去年微软的事件已经在诉讼中无休止地咀嚼，许多指控后来通过法院的语言过滤。 “原告观察到，由于她的性别，她的绩效评估得分因堆栈排名过程而受到困境，”穆斯乌斯的一份宣言读。 “原告在微软私下，因为过于咄咄逼人，直接，'刺，'苛刻或侵略性。”</p><p> For its part, Microsoft maintains that Moussouris was well compensated for her work, saying that in two of her last three years at the company, she was paid more than the men in her group, including one year in which she was paid more than her male manager. Without more details, it’s hard to say if that was a result of an unusually big paycheck or an unusually low job title, and it doesn’t speak to the broader concerns about the work environment. Regardless, Moussouris began to feel she had no future at Microsoft.</p><p> 就其部分而言，微软认为，穆斯梅里斯为她的工作得到了很好的补偿，称，在她们过去三年的两个人在公司中，她的成长超过了她的小组的男人，其中一年中她得到的一年是多年的男经理。没有更多细节，很难说，如果这是一个异常大的薪水或异常低的职称，它就不会与对工作环境的更广泛的关切。无论如何，Mousouris开始觉得她在微软没有未来。</p><p>  In the years that followed, she worked hard to establish her cybersecurity career. She moved to a lead role at the pioneering bug bounty firm HackerOne, eventually starting her own shop called Luta Security and finding more success there than she ever had at Microsoft. She returns to these details now because she finds them typical of the compounding issues that keep women from rising at tech companies. As Moussouris sees it, women are steered away from engineering roles in dozens of different ways. The women that break through come into the industry underpaid and stay that way, thanks to institutional sexism and favoritism among managers. Those who rise run into harassment, retaliation, or outright assault.</p><p>  在随后的几年里，她努力建立网络安全事业。她在开创性的Bug Bounty公司Hackerone致敬，最终开始自己的商店叫做LUTA安全，并在微软中找到更多的成功。她现在回到这些细节，因为她发现他们典型的复杂问题，让妇女在科技公司崛起。正如穆斯尿所看到的那样，女性以数十种不同的方式远离工程角色。通过体制性别和经理之间的机构性别和偏袒来，突破行业的女性来突破。那些崛起的人遇到骚扰，报复或彻底攻击。</p><p> Remembering her mother’s experience, she decided to do something. Having already raised the alarm internally at Microsoft, she filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission, and when that process stalled, she went looking for a lawyer. Together, they decided on a plan — a class action seeking to represent all the female engineering employees at Microsoft, arguing they were being systematically underpaid.</p><p> 记住她母亲的经历，她决定做点什么。在微软内部已经在内部提出了闹钟，她向平等机会就业委员会提出了投诉，当那个过程停滞不前，她去寻找律师。他们决定了一个计划 - 寻求代表微软的所有女性工程员工的课程行动，争论他们正在系统地削弱。</p><p> To bring that case, she joined with Anne Shaver, a Bay Area lawyer who specializes in pay equity class actions. “Our theory of the case was simple — that Microsoft has a promotion practice that applies to all employees and results in pay disparities,” says Shaver. “The data at Microsoft spoke for itself.”</p><p> 要带来这种情况，她加入了一个湾区律师安妮·剃须刀，他们专门从事薪酬股票阶级行动。 “我们的案子理论很简单 - 微软有一个促进练习，适用于所有员工，并导致支付差距，”剃须刀说。 “Microsoft在Microsoft的数据本身就讲话。” </p><p> Then the 31st largest company in the world, Microsoft was still  60 percent white and 75 percent male. Those numbers got worse when you focused on “professional” employees, a legal category including the engineering team and most other technical workers. The company’s diversity report from 2015 showed just 22 percent of those workers identified as female.</p><p>然后是世界上31个最大的公司，微软仍然是60％的白色和75％的男性。当您专注于“专业”员工，法律类别，包括工程团队和大多数其他技术人员，这些数字变得更糟。该公司从2015年的多样性报告显示只有22％的工作人员被确定为女性。</p><p> Still, Microsoft was well-prepared for such a lawsuit, having prepared a range of personnel reports showing it was already closing the gender gap, no matter what the hiring numbers might suggest. Years earlier, the company’s diversity and inclusion team had produced a report showing women made more than 95 cents for every dollar earned by men.  A more recent report on Microsoft’s website raises that number to $1; by its own measure, Microsoft has closed the gender pay gap.</p><p> 仍然，微软对这种诉讼做得很好，制定了一系列人事报告，显示出现在招聘人数可能表明的是什么已经结束了性别差距。年前，公司的多样性和包容团队已经制作了一份报告，显示妇女为男性所获得的每一美元制作了95美分。关于微软网站的最新报告将该数字提高到1美元;通过自己的衡量标准，微软已关闭性别薪水差距。</p><p> But Shaver argues that, like many corporate pay equity studies, that analysis doesn’t address the way bias really works in these pay structures. Microsoft’s studies focus on pay within levels — essentially finding that women and men at the same place in Microsoft’s pay-band system are being paid roughly the same amount. But the study doesn’t address how they got placed in that pay level to begin with and whether women are being systematically placed at lower pay levels. Moussouris’ complaints were all about under-leveling, from the initial hire that she believes placed her at a pay disadvantage to the corporate culture that she says made it too easy for senior men to keep difficult women from getting raises.</p><p> 但剃须刀认为，与许多企业支付股权研究一样，分析并不解决偏见在这些薪酬结构中的偏见方式。微软的研究重点关注级别的薪水 - 基本上发现，微软薪资系统在同一位置的女性和男性正在支付大致相同的数量。但该研究并没有解决他们在该薪水水平开始以及妇女是否被系统地置于较低的工资水平。莫斯乌斯的投诉均来自初步雇佣，从最初的雇用中，她认为她对企业文化的倾向于她所说，她说这对高级男性来说太容易让困难的女性升起了筹集。</p><p> This bait-and-switch is much larger than Microsoft. While advocates focus on the gap in wages-per-hour,  skeptics can point to the “controlled pay gap,” which levels for seniority and finds almost no difference between the men and women at the same rank.</p><p> 此诱饵和交换机远大于微软。虽然倡导者关注每小时工资的差距，但怀疑论者可以指向“受控支付差距”，这为资历的水平，在同一等级中的男女之间几乎没有区别。</p><p>  In the Microsoft case, litigating that difference meant years of work, with much of the court time spent pinning down exactly how much information Microsoft would release. Microsoft’s lawyers were able to confine the discovery to female engineering employees — but the discovery still unearthed 201 complaints over just the few years covered by the lawsuit.</p><p>  在Microsoft案例中，诉讼差异意味着多年的工作，大部分法庭时间都花费了微软将释放多少信息。微软的律师能够将发现的发现局限于女性工程员工 - 但发现仍然出土的201次投诉仅在诉讼所涵盖的几年内。</p><p> Some were alarming in their detail:  in one case, a Microsoft intern reported being raped by a young man in her program, filing a police report and receiving a medical exam before contacting Microsoft HR. She was told that a restraining order would result in her reassignment, so she didn’t press the issue. At the end of the term, both she and the alleged rapist were hired by Microsoft.</p><p> 有些人详细令人震惊：在一个案例中，一例是由她的计划中的一个年轻人强奸的Microsoft实习生，在联系微软人力资源之前提交警察报告并接受体检。她被告知，抑制秩序会导致她的重新分配，所以她没有按下这个问题。在术语结束时，她和涉嫌强奸者都被微软聘用。</p><p> In the end, the judge in Moussouris’s case wasn’t moved by the volume of complaints. As the court saw it, there was no basis for concluding that the 201 reports were particularly high for a company of Microsoft’s size or otherwise indicative of a hostile environment for female employees.</p><p> 最终，穆斯乌斯的案件中的法官没有被投诉的数量搬迁。正如法院所看到的那样，没有依据结论是，201次报告特别高的是微软规模或以其他方式对女性员工进行敌对环境的贡献。 </p><p> “That was really shocking, because it’s so divorced from any sort of understanding of what it means for a woman to come forward and complain,” Shaver says. “They risked their careers to do that.”</p><p>“那真的很令人震惊，因为它从任何关于一个女人对一个女人出现并抱怨的意味着什么，”这是如此离婚，“莎莱默说。 “他们冒着职业生涯。”</p><p> While the case dragged on, a bigger shift was happening outside the courtroom. By the time discovery finished in Moussouris’ lawsuit, charges had been brought against Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein and a new awareness of high-profile predators was sweeping across every industry. In February 2017, Susan Fowler, a site reliability engineer at Uber, came forward with  her experiences of sexual harassment and discrimination — provoking a reckoning for the company that ultimately resulted in the ousting of the CEO. The next year,  a  New York Times report revealed that Android founder Andy Rubin had left Google in response to a sexual harassment claim — but still received a generous $90 million exit package. A few days after the news broke, 20,000 Google employees  walked out of work in protest, the largest mass labor action the industry has ever seen. The Google and Uber stories were taken as harassment problems, but they were just as much about equity — showing how bad behavior is rewarded while retaliation keeps marginalized workers underpaid.</p><p> 虽然案件拖延，但在法庭外发生了更大的班次。在发现穆斯尿的诉讼中完成的时候，已经对比尔Cosby和Harvey Weinstein带来了收费，并对高调掠食者的新意识在每个行业中都彻底席卷。 2017年2月，优步现场可靠性工程师Susan Fowler出现了她对性骚扰和歧视的经验，激发了最终导致首席执行官追踪的公司。明年，纽约时报报告显示，Android创始人Andy Rubin留下了谷歌以响应性骚扰索赔 - 但仍然收到慷慨的9000万美元出口包。新闻爆发后几天，20,000名谷歌员工走出抗议工作，该行业曾经见过的大规模劳动力行动。谷歌和优步的故事被视为骚扰问题，但它们对股权同时 - 展示了报复后期的奖励行为如何奖励。</p><p> In the end, what sank Moussouris’ case was a 2011 Supreme Court ruling in a case called  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, which is cited in both the district court ruling and the appeals court’s decision to let it stand. A landmark victory for conservative jurists, the Dukes case was another gender pay gap lawsuit, hoping to represent more than 1.6 million women who had worked for Walmart. But the Supreme Court ultimately found it didn’t matter if there was evidence that women were being paid less across the company.  Writing the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia denied that systematic sexism could be assumed to be the motive force behind a pay gap.</p><p> 最终，沉没的穆斯诺里斯的案件是2011年最高法院裁决，称为沃尔玛商店，公司诉副院，其中在地区法院裁决和上诉法院决定让它成为稳定。保守法学家的地标胜利，公爵案例是另一个性别薪水缺陷诉讼，希望代表沃尔玛工作的超过160万妇女。但最高法院最终发现有证据表明妇女在本公司较少支付的证据表明并不重要。撰写大多数意见，正义安源素Scalia否认，可以假设系统性别歧视成为薪酬差距背后的动力。</p><p>  “Left to their own devices most managers in any corporation,” Scalia wrote, “would select sex-neutral performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact… still others may be guilty of intentional discrimination.” But crucially, “demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s.” As long as each manager was inflicting independent harms, there was no basis for class action status.</p><p>  “留给自己的设备大多数公司的任何公司，”Scalia写道，“将选择性中立性能的基于性能的标准，以便招聘和促销产生任何可操作的差异。其他人可以选择奖励产生不同影响的各种属性......还有其他可能是有意歧视的罪。“但至关重要的是，“展示一个经理的无效自行决定将无关，无法展示另一个人的无效。”只要每个经理都造成独立伤害，就没有课程行动地位的基础。</p><p> It’s a baffling ruling for lawyers like Shaver, who take the structural nature of sexism as a tangible and unavoidable fact. Pay imbalances are connected to harassment, just as harassment is connected to sexual assault. They’re bound together like links in a chain, with each offense dragging the others behind it. But for federal courts, the Dukes ruling broke that chain, recasting the thousand single incidents of discrimination as isolated points that could only be addressed one at a time. In practice, it meant they could barely be addressed in federal courts at all.</p><p> 这是剃须刀这样的律师令人困惑的裁决，他将性别主义的结构性视为有形和不可避免的事实。薪酬不平衡与骚扰相连，就像骚扰与性侵犯一样。它们与链中的链接相连，每个罪行都拖着它背后的其他罪行。但对于联邦法院而言，公爵统治破坏了这一链条，重新征收千单一的歧视事件，因为孤立的分数只能在一次征收。在实践中，它意味着他们根本几乎无法在联邦法院解决。</p><p> “This is what the conservative agenda has done to this area of jurisprudence,” Shaver says. “They are trying to decouple the two, and say what they call anecdotal evidence of harassment is irrelevant to pay equity.”</p><p> “这是保守派议程为这一判例领域做了什么，”莎瑟尔说。 “他们正试图解耦这两场，并说出他们称之为骚扰的骚扰证据是无关紧要的。”</p><p> Faced with the Dukes ruling, pay equity lawsuits have mostly moved to the state level, where more specific state laws can give workers a way around the federal precedent. The  Ellis lawsuit against Google (also brought by Shaver’s firm) alleges that Google violated the  California Equal Pay Act, which mandates equal pay for employees who perform “substantially similar work.” The law doesn’t require further evidence of systematic discrimination, which was Scalia’s sticking point in the Dukes ruling. It also lets workers sidestep corporate studies showing equity within pay bands. As long as women in different pay bands or ladders are performing the same work, the company can be forced to pay up.</p><p> 面对公爵裁决，支付股权诉讼主要迁至国家级，更具体的州法律可以在联邦先例围绕联邦之前的方式给予工人。 Ellis对谷歌（剃须刀公司带来的诉讼）声称谷歌违反了加利福尼亚平等的薪酬法案，该法案授权履行“基本相似的工作”的员工平等薪酬。法律不需要进一步的系统歧视证据，这是Scalia在Dukes Ruling中的粘附点。它还让工人索德斯特步骤企业研究显示薪酬乐队中的公平。只要妇女在不同的薪酬乐队或梯子正在执行相同的工作，公司就可以被迫支付。 </p><p> Still, not every state has an equal pay act, and lawsuits alone haven’t been enough to make a dent in the bigger problem. After 50 years of slow progress, recent studies have found the pay gap holding steady or  even getting wider.</p><p>尽管如此，并非每个州都有平等的薪酬行为，而且单独的诉讼在更大的问题中没有足够的态度。经过50年的进步缓慢，最近的研究发现，薪酬差距持平甚至越来越宽。</p><p> “I will not live to see pay equity at the current trajectory,” Moussouris says, “and I found that to be unacceptable.”</p><p> “我不会在目前的轨迹中看到薪酬权益，”Moussouris说，“我发现这是不可接受的。”</p><p> So she decided to do something. Moussouris’ first step is  the Pay Equity Now Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness and pressuring companies to take action. The foundation’s central focus is  the Pay Equity Now pledge, a three-part commitment to acknowledge pervasive bias, audit for it, and take action to correct it. Moussouris hoped that Microsoft would sign the pledge as a way of healing the rift left by the lawsuit. So far, the company has declined.</p><p> 所以她决定做点什么。 Moussouris'第一步是现在的薪酬股权，这是一个非营利性，致力于提高意识和施加公司采取行动。基金会的中央焦点是薪酬权益现在承诺，为承认普遍偏见，审计而审计，采取行动纠正它的三分承诺。 Moussouris希望微软将签署承诺作为诉讼留下裂缝的一种方式。到目前为止，公司已拒绝。</p><p> In February, Moussouris donated $1 million to establish a new center for pay equity policy at Penn State Law, the largest donation in the law school’s history. The money will go to fund active litigation, both bringing specific cases against specific companies and pressing appeals to chip away at the precedent set by Dukes. It’s an activist litigation project in the model of the American Civil Liberties Union — the slow, careful work of peeling back bad law. The hope is that when the next generation of plaintiffs tries to take on their employers, 10 or 20 years from now, the lab can make sure they face a friendlier legal system than the one that doomed the Microsoft case.</p><p> 2月份，穆斯纽斯捐赠了100万美元，为宾州州法律规定了宾夕法尼亚州法律规定的薪酬股权政策中心，是法学院的历史上最大的捐赠。这笔资金将用于基金积极诉讼，两者都将对特定公司带来特定案件，并按下Dukes套餐的先例筹集筹码。它是美国公民自由联盟模型的活动家诉讼项目 - 削减不良法律的缓慢，仔细工作。希望如下，当下一代原告试图从现在开始的10或20年，实验室可以确保他们面临比注定微软案件的友好的法律制度。</p><p> That work isn’t cheap, and none of it is likely to benefit Moussouris personally — but unlike the internal complaints of the lawsuits, it feels ambitious enough to change the odds that she and other women are facing.
