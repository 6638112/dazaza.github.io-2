It has killed or endangered wildlife in freshwater ecosystems, with high chloride levels toxic to fish, bugs and amphibians, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that requires attention now,\u201d said Bill Hintz, an assistant professor in the environmental sciences department at the University of Toledo and the lead author of a recent research review published in the journal  Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of scientific evidence to suggest that freshwater ecosystems are being contaminated by salt from the use of things like road salt beyond the concentration which is safe for freshwater organisms and for human consumption,\u201d Dr. Hintz said.\n  Salt has been used to de-ice roads in the United States since the 1930s, and its use across the country has tripled in the past 50 years, Dr. Hintz said. More than 20 million metric tons of salt are poured on U.S. roads each winter, according to an estimate by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in New York, and the environmental costs are growing.\n  Still, little has been done to address the environmental impact of road salt because it is cheap and effective, said Victoria Kelly, the environmental programming manager at the Cary Institute. By lowering the freezing temperature of water, salt prevents snow from turning to ice and melts ice that is already there.\n Road salt is made from sodium chloride, the same chemical found in table salt. Of all salt consumed in the United States, about 43 percent is used for highway de-icing, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in 2020.\n  The consequences of insufficiently salting roads were seen this week, when hundreds of drivers were stranded by  a snowstorm on Interstate 95 in Virginia. Officials said the storm began with rain, which washed away road salt and made it difficult to keep roads clear.  More snow fell in the Mid-Atlantic States and the Northeast on Friday.\n But environmentalists say the problems associated with road salt are getting harder to ignore. Ms. Kelly said the accumulation of salt in drinking water reservoirs in some places was harming people on low-sodium diets.\n  A 2018 study of wells in Dutchess County, N.Y., found that sodium concentration in wells reached levels as high as 860 milligrams per liter \u2014 much higher than the  federal and state recommendation that levels not exceed 20 milligrams per liter for people on very low-sodium diets and 270 milligrams per liter for people on moderately restricted sodium diets.\n A separate 2018 study in the journal Environmental Science and Technology showed that 24 percent of private drinking wells in New York were contaminated with salt that had been used on roads. About 15 percent of people in the United States get their water from private ground wells, while the rest rely on community water systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n More counties and states are rethinking the amount of salt they use because of the associated costs. Last month, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced appointments to the Adirondack Road Salt Reduction Task Force, established to review road-salt contamination.\n \u201cI have no doubt that this group of individuals will work tirelessly to protect our state from the adverse effects of road salt,\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \u201cWe look forward to seeing this group finally convene and make progress in preventing further pollution to our waterways and our environment.\u201d\n  There are consequences for wildlife, too. Dr. Hintz said his review showed that elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs.\n Card 1 of 3 Biden\u2019s climate agenda in peril.  President Biden is facing an  increasingly narrow path\u00a0to fulfill his ambitious environmental goals with the\u00a0Build Back Better Act \u2014 which contains $555 billion in proposed climate action \u2014  in limbo on Capitol Hill.\n How some cities are reducing emissions.  A district in London has developed an innovative way to  divert subway heat for buildings to lower carbon emissions. Stockholm and Vancouver are turning to waste heat from sewage instead.\n Sounding the alarm.  A report on the state of the Arctic  highlights troubling and consistent trends\u00a0in the region that are linked to global warming. Researchers are  also growing increasingly concerned about Antarctica, where ice shelves are melting and wilder winds are altering crucial currents.\n Road salt also corrodes vehicles and bridges, causing $5 billion in annual repairs in the United States, according to an estimate by the Environmental Protection Agency. AAA suggests drivers wash and clean their vehicles regularly during winter to help offset the effects of road salt and to limit driving when salt and other de-icing chemicals are at their highest concentrations.\n In Britain, the Salt Association said that salt was the cheapest form of de-icing material and that it had a low environmental impact when used responsibly. \u201cAs with all highway maintenance activities, there are environmental implications from winter road maintenance,\u201d the organization said in a statement. \u201cHighways depots, spreading vehicles and the de-icing agent all contribute, but with good management, this burden can be minimized.\u201d\n  While there is not a perfect solution to the issue, there are alternatives that can significantly reduce salt usage without compromising driver safety.\n One method involves treating roads before storms with a salt brine solution, which can lead to a 75 percent reduction in the amount of salt used while keeping roads just as safe, according to the Cary Institute. Building better salt storage sites can also minimize waste.\n Some counties, like Jefferson County, Wis., have already made changes. Bill Kern, the county\u2019s highway commissioner, said switching to a brine solution had enabled the county to cut its salt use by up to 60 percent since 2018 without an increase in the number of accidents. By using less salt, the county has reduced its overall cost for winter maintenance of state and county highways by 20 percent since 2018, saving about $1.6 million, Mr. Kern said.\n Over the past decade, some states, including Rhode Island, have passed legislation aimed to reduce their use of road salt and have increasingly applied a brine solution to roads in winter, but environmentalists say more needs to be done.\n  While engineers have developed better alternatives, they have not been widely implemented in part because they require upfront costs for purchasing equipment, Ms. Kelly said.\n \u201cIt\u2019ll save us money, and it\u2019ll help to save our freshwater,\u201d she said, while adding that \u201cbecause of that legacy effect, it\u2019s going to take a really long time to see the impact of the steps we take.\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:32:20", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9053\u8def,salt", "title": "\u9053\u8def\u76d0\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u4e5f\u5f88\u7cdf\u7cd5\u3002", "title_en": "Road Salt Works.

Bitcoin offers protection against rampant government spending, says Kasparov, \u201cbecause you\u2019re protected by math\u201d \u2013 by the logic of the code itself.\n  Kasparov also sees merit in  non-fungible tokens. In December, in partnership with  1Kind, he dropped a series of 32 NFTs that showcase iconic moments from his life: the 1985 match that crowned him as the youngest world chess champion, the epic battle against International Business Machines\u2019 artificial intelligence-powered \u201cDeep Blue\u201d and speeches against totalitarian governments.\n It\u2019s this battle against totalitarianism that has defined the current chapter of his life, and Kasparov sees crypto as part of that struggle. Or as the grandmaster puts it, \u201cI believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity.\u201d\n   Kasparov: If you followed my career and read about my early interest in computers and technology, you should not be surprised that I was very excited when I recognized the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs.\n This goes all the way back to the \u201880s; I always tried to be at the cutting edge. It started with chess. But I also saw an opportunity to use computers and new tools to advance individual freedoms. It\u2019s my belief that technology should help people fight back against the power of the state.\n  Cryptocurrencies become an inseparable part of or progress, because the whole world is moving digital. And if the economy becomes more digital, so does the money. Another philosophical reason is that \u2026 governments [have] unlimited opportunities to print money. And printing money is the most exquisite form of borrowing from us and from future generations.\n And I believe that cryptocurrencies \u2013 with bitcoin as a standard \u2013 offer a protection against this onslaught of the government, because you\u2019re protected by math. You\u2019re protected by the limited number of any code behind the respective currency. Cryptocurrencies, and all the products related to cryptocurrencies, are absolutely vital for the future development of our world.\n   My first indirect involvement was through the Human Rights Foundation. Because in the Human Rights Foundation, we had a few experts that have been advocating cryptocurrencies at a very early stage. And as an organization, we offer support to the dissidents around the world.\n We thought about using crypto as a way to help them to get material help, because in many countries it was impossible \u2013 and it\u2019s still impossible \u2013 to actually get proper funding. So crypto offered an opportunity to support these activists indirectly. And the more I learned about it, the more interested I got in the whole mechanism.\n  Look, crypto is a controversial thing. Because you hear a lot of people say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s money laundering. That helps bad guys.\u201d True. I mean, no technology is uniquely good, because it\u2019s technology. Humans still have a monopoly for evil.\n So, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of talks about it, and I\u2019ll say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s not the magic wand or the terminator. It\u2019s not a harbinger of utopia or dystopia. It\u2019s a tool.\u201d Crypto is a tool. And of course it could benefit some bad guys with maligned intentions. But it\u2019s about the balance, it\u2019s about trade-offs. And I think the balance is so much in favor of progress.\n  You mentioned crypto\u2019s ability to help protect human rights in undemocratic countries. What do you see as the benefits in democratic countries?\n In the democratic countries in America and Europe, trillions of dollars will be printed. I\u2019m an American taxpayer. And I understand that you need to build new infrastructure. But I\u2019m not happy to see that the government has a free hand to use my taxes, basically to devalue [the dollar].\n So I think it\u2019s very important that technology would offer me an opportunity to fight back, to protect my hard-earned fortune. And I think that bitcoin \u2013 which I believe is online gold \u2013 and other cryptocurrencies are the way to the future. I\u2019m not a financial expert, but I would not be surprised if, I would not be surprised if, in 10 years\u2019 time, the dollar will be replaced by the basket of coins as a standard.\n   I suppose if you believe that, then it would almost be foolish not to be buying Bitcoin?\n   Well, I think bitcoin will remain as a standard. But of course it cannot stay alone. So that\u2019s why you have more coins coming in. It\u2019s a natural process. Now we have thousands and thousands of coins. It\u2019s like the dot-com bubble. Ninety-nine point nine percent will be gone. But those that survive will become the Googles of the world. I\u2019m not here to judge which one, but there will be few that will survive \u2013 that\u2019s why I said basket of coins.\n In the past, your championing of human rights has gotten you in trouble with the Russian authorities. Given that background, are you concerned that your support for cryptocurrency can get you in hot water?\n Well, this is definitely a no. [In the past,] I was in hot water. To give you an idea, one of the NFTs is a picture of my first arrest in Russia. So it\u2019s all reflected in my NFT. Look, this is much less perilous than to attack Putin directly.\n I grew up in the Soviet Union, and learned from my mother and my teacher the motto of Soviet dissidents, \u201cDo what you must, and so be it.\u201d And I believe that supporting crypto is an important part of my contribution to the future of humanity. And, again, I [view it] as a much less risky endeavor than speaking publicly about Putin or other dictators.\n   I don\u2019t pretend to be a great expert in NFTs, but I\u2019m not aware of anything similar that exists. It\u2019s a collection of 30-plus NFTs that are related to special events in my life and special people in my life. This is a story that connects you to very personal moments. Every NFT has a video message.\n It\u2019s all connected to the physical assets, like my notebooks from the \u201870s. Thanks to my late mother, who preserved this archive, you can actually look at me scribbling in 1973.\n The NFTs all reflect the moments of me growing up, learning from my mother, and from my teachers, and then fighting for the title, and then shifting my life and moving into human rights and computers.\n Interesting. This feels almost like a memoir, in a sense. I\u2019ve worked with CEOs before to collaborate on their memoirs, and one thing I\u2019ve found is that the process can almost be emotional, or even a bit therapeutic. Did you have any sense of that?\n The whole story starts from a very emotional moment, though it\u2019s a tragic one. My mother died on Christmas day last year, from COVID. And I couldn\u2019t be next to her, and that was a really big blow because we were so close.\n While she was alive, I didn\u2019t even know that she preserved all these archives. She was not happy to talk about the past. That\u2019s why I [held off] on any major publication that would highlight [the past]. I wrote two books, but not the one that could tell everything.\n After she died, I thought it would be right for me [to honor] her memory to actually start doing things. I\u2019m doing a documentary now; it\u2019s in Russian. The first segment will be ready early next year. And I hope I can cover my entire chess career, and it\u2019s for her. It\u2019s dedicated for her. And this [NFT] project was inspired by this tragedy. I thought it was very important to show my personal life and her connection, and why she was so important.\n And so I spoke to 1Kind, and 10% of the sales will go to Kasparov Chess Foundation, and this will be a scholarship under her name for all the great talents raised by single mothers.\n  The leader in news and information on cryptocurrency, digital assets and the future of money, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a  strict set of editorial policies.

The protests began in the west of the country over the weekend, after a sharp rise in fuel prices, and quickly spread through cities across the nation.\n The internet was shut down nationwide on Wednesday. And though the intent appeared to be to disrupt the protesters\u2019 communications, the effects of the blackout have spread further.\n Kazakhstan is a power player in the bitcoin world. Last year, the nation became the world\u2019s second-largest center for bitcoin mining after the United States, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, after China, a major hub, clamped down on crypto mining activity. As of August, Kazakhstan was hosting 18% of global bitcoin mining, according to  Fortune.\n  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or \u201cmined\u201d by high-powered computers, usually at data centers in different parts of the world that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in a highly energy-intensive process.\n The more miners on the network, the greater the amount of computer power is needed to mine new bitcoin. The hashrate falls if miners drop off the network, in theory making it easier for the remaining miners to produce new coin.\n The hashrate at major crypto mining pools \u2013 groups of miners in different locations that team up to produce bitcoin \u2013 was down 14% from Tuesday to Thursday, according to data from mining firm BTC.com.\n Bitcoin\u2019s price, too, took a plunge \u2013 a drop in hashrate doesn\u2019t necessarily boost price. The cryptocurrency fell below $43,000 on Thursday, testing multi-month lows.\n  Economics aside, bitcoin\u2019s negative  environmental impact has been an ongoing issue. Blockchain-based currencies require large amounts of power, which is mostly derived from fossil fuels. And in Kazakhstan, specifically, the power behind bitcoin is cause for concern.\n Coal is the main source of regional power. Kazakhstan\u2019s crypto mining farms are mostly powered by ageing coal plants which themselves \u2013 along with coalmines and whole towns built around them \u2013 are a headache for authorities as they seek to decarbonize the economy. Since the old plants are inefficient and carbon-heavy, they generate an outsize amount of pollution.\n According to the  International Energy Agency, Kazakhstan\u2019s emissions per energy unit are higher than what China\u2019s used to be. The agency estimates that China\u2019s coal emitted about 1,000g of CO 2 a kilowatt hour, while Kazakhstan\u2019s emits close to 1,500g.\n The Kazakh government said last year it planned to crack down first on unregistered \u201cgrey\u201d miners who it estimates might be consuming twice as much power as the \u201cwhite\u201d or officially registered ones.\n Last year, its energy ministry said that \u201cgrey\u201d mining may consume up to 1.2GW of power, which together with \u201cwhite\u201d miners\u2019 600MW comes up to about 8% of Kazakhstan\u2019s total generation capacity.", "posttime": "2022-01-09 22:28:40", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,\u4f18\u60e0,internet,\u6316\u6398", "title": "\u54c8\u8428\u514b\u65af\u5766\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u5173\u95ed\u4f18\u60e0\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u91c7\u77ff\u4e1a\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u6253\u51fb", "title_en": "Kazakhstan Internet Shutdown Deals Blow To Global Bitcoin Mining Operation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/kazakhstan-bitcoin-internet-shutdown", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "\u4f18\u60e0", "internet", "\u6316\u6398"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d1df198affec6555963c51dcc78b00a1.jpg", "infoid": 1072499, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5728\u5468\u56db\u76d1\u7763Firefox\u6d4f\u89c8\u5668\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5468\u56db\u627f\u8ba4\u4e86\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u6f5c\u5728\u5730\u6784\u6210\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u793a\u6b63\u5728\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u76ee\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u52a0\u5bc6\u6350\u8d60\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u201c\u9002\u5408\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u6c14\u5019\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u201d\n\u56f4\u7ed5\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u73af\u5883\u8db3\u8ff9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5df2\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002 Bitcoin\u548cEthereum\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8584\u8377\u7684\u6bcf\u79cd\u8d27\u5e01\u7684\u65b0\u5757\u4f9b\u7535\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u7f51\u7edc\u589e\u957f\u5e76\u751f\u4e0b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56f4\u7ed5\u65f6\u949f\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u6570\u5343\u4e2aGPU\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u751f\u80b2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53c2\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u96be\u9898\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u3002", "note_en": "The foundation, which oversees the development of the Firefox browser, on Thursday acknowledged conversations around the environmental impact that cryptocurrencies potentially pose and said it is reviewing whether its current policy on crypto donations \u201c fits with our climate goals.\u201d\n \u201cDecentralized web technology continues to be an important area for us to explore, but a lot has changed since we started accepting crypto donations,\u201d the foundation said in a tweet thread, pledging to be forthcoming about the updates of its review.\n  The foundation started to face backlash after it invited people to donate to the American nonprofit firm via using a variety of crypto tokens, including bitcoin.\n In response to its tweet, Jamie Zawinski (a founder of Mozilla)\u00a0 expressed dismay at the foundation\u2019s move. \u201cEveryone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision to partner with planet-incinerating Ponzi grifters,\u201d he said, adding an expletive.\n Peter Linss, the founder of Gecko, the engine that powered the browser,  joined the conversation in telling Mozilla that it was \u201cmeant to be better than this.\u201d\n This isn\u2019t the first time a major firm has faced backlash \u2014 or distanced itself from Bitcoin \u2014 because of environmental concerns. In May last year, Tesla suspended accepting bitcoin as payment for its vehicles, just  months after introducing the option.\n  Musk said the firm was \u201cconcerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions, especially coal.\u201d Weeks later, he said the company will \u201cmost likely\u201d  accept bitcoin again once the mining rate for the cryptocurrency reaches 50% renewables.\n Questions around the environmental footprint of Bitcoin have been linked to how various tokens are created. Bitcoin and Ethereum use a mechanism called proof-of-work to power their networks and mint new blocks of each currency. This calculation, by design, has become more complex over the years as the networks grew and gave birth to an industry of firms that run thousands of GPUs around the clock to participate in solving the puzzle.\n Bitcoin mining consumes about 148 terawatt-hours of energy annually, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance estimates. Many cryptocurrency proponents have, however, either\u00a0 disputed such findings or have made a case for why it is worth it.\n In recent months, a broader divide has started to emerge in the industry. The critics have challenged some of the fundamental value proposition of web3. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who supports Bitcoin, has  dismissed the assertion that VCs aren\u2019t reaping most profits from web3 projects.\n Amid the ongoing discourse, many firms have\u00a0scaled back their web3 ambitions. Discord  pushed pause on exploring crypto and NFTs in November following outcry from many who opposed the idea.
