For some people it’s a big house in the suburbs. For others it’s a cabin in the woods. Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>每个人都有一个自然栖息地。对于某些人来说，这是郊区的一所大房子。对于其他人来说，这是树林中的小屋。有些人在中央商务区的高层塔中壮成长。我的是大街小巷，大约一个世纪前就达到了顶峰。但是，还有一个更难以定义的模糊环境，因为它更多地是关于文化命令而不是物理结构或位置。</p><p> A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I&#39;m forever looking for where Henry Miller&#39;s Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don&#39;t want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p> 一位读者向我查询。他和他的妻子及三个女儿正在寻找“一种缓慢，更多的自然环境和社区束缚的生活，但又不抛弃那些读书等的人。”我永远在寻找亨利·米勒（Henry Miller）的《大苏尔》今天在哪里，或者是普罗温斯敦，甚至是1960年的上西区，或者是90年代初期的旧金山。我们有一些钱，但我们不想和受钱驱动的人在一起。”</p><p> First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p> 首先，请注意，所需位置并非专门针对城市或乡村。曼哈顿和崎Sur不平的加州大瑟尔（Big Sur）海岸之间分布着巨大的土地。 Provincetown和San Francisco是Main Street城镇之间的不同规模。而且我也没有在声明中发现优质郊区的内在排斥。追求是关于一个地方可能提供的无形资产。</p><p> I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p> 我必须承认报价中固有的张力。渴望有高文化，与邻居有有意义的互动以及迷人的风景。这些东西往往要花额外的钱，而且可能是稀缺的。但是，人们也反对粗俗的唯物主义。</p><p> Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p><p> 在一切都仍然是超级真实，价格合理，同时又独特而未被发现的情况下，在正确的时间，恰到好处的地方生活，这不是很好吗？整个过程都是有问题的，老实说，就阶级等而言，这听起来有点聋。我了解冲动。我会承认自己也有同样的愿望。那么，如何将这些浪漫的观念与外部现实混为一谈呢？我将从戳破怀旧开始。</p><p>   I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn&#39;t a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>   我回想起了我最好的朋友约安（Joann），大约在1985年。她被曼哈顿的一所著名艺术学校录取，我帮助她安顿到了她第一个租来的房间。它是在高级绅士化时代广场之前的一个牙医办公室，里面装有油毡地板，人造木板，橙色玻璃纤维椅子和荧光灯。感觉就像一辆公共巴士。纽约夏天闷热难耐，没有空调。简易小厨房配有电热板和老式微波炉。从技术上讲，这不是合法住所，但当局和房东似乎都不在乎。几年后，与迪士尼一起实施了代码强制执行。</p><p> She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple&#39;s three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p> 她从一对已婚夫妇那里租下了房间，这些夫妇为他们的艺术家朋友在城市上画并制作了纪录片。琼（Joann）减租以换取这对三岁儿子的保姆。她的卧室正好是床垫的大小，因为已经安装了隔断墙以实现最大效率。卧室的门朝着走廊向外打开，她只是掉在床上，把自己的财产挂在船上的钩子上。这是城市阁楼生活的一种形式，从未出现在《建筑文摘》上。 </p><p> They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn&#39;t strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>他们都住在那儿，因为那里的价格相对便宜，而且位置使他们可以与他们关心的人和活动保持亲近。他们对酒精性精神分裂症邻居的耐受性极高。这些住宿本来可以正常运作。他们并没有努力将这个地方变成任何其他东西。公寓里摆满了他们的艺术和电影制作设备以及与他们合作的许多访客。这个城市是他们的客厅，厨房和后花园。</p><p> While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn&#39;t in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p> 乔安（Joann）住在那里时，夫妻俩花了好车的价钱在宾夕法尼亚州郊区买了一套适中的第二套房子。他们的目标很简单-提供一个平衡城市生活和与孩子一起享受乡村生活的场所，而无需花费大量金钱。这房子绝对没什么特别的，除了基本的机械修理外，他们没有做出任何翻新的努力。那不是在布吉镇上的餐馆或主题精品店。他们没有在好的学区中寻找细分。它只是农田中的一个随机点，附近没有特别之处。</p><p> What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren&#39;t interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p><p> 对他们而言最重要的是开销少的自由。他们的城市朋友会在暑假和寒假期间与他们一起迁移出去，他们创造了自己的美食，艺术和对话方式。他们读了很多书。他们只是对自己忙于创造自己的内心世界不感兴趣。他们不需要从时髦的邮政编码中购买文化。他们创造了自己的。我从那个家庭和他们的榜样中学到了很多东西。</p><p>   Some years later I had a friend who worked at the  Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist  Jackson Pollock and his wife, fellow artist  Lee Krasner, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron  Peggy Guggenheim provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>   几年后，我有一个朋友在长岛最远端的波洛克-克拉斯纳故居和学习中心工作，该岛现已由石溪大学管理。 1945年，现代艺术家杰克逊·波洛克（Jackson Pollock）和他的妻子，同伴艺术家李·克拉斯纳（Lee Krasner）以5,000美元的价格在占地半英亩的小房子上购得水景。根据当前的通胀调整后，今天的价格为$ 73,000。他们的赞助人佩吉·古根海姆（Peggy Guggenheim）提供了2,000美元的首付。当时，普通家庭每年的收入为2595美元，因此可以用两年的薪水购买房屋。</p><p> This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p><p> 当时汉普顿人仍在昏昏欲睡的乡村中，而国民经济只是刚刚从战时配给中崛起。他们的邻居是农民和渔民，而不是金融家或电影明星。他们可以使用当地杂货店出售的东西，但没有其他东西。他们距市区三个小时。保洛克（Pollock）与他的内部恶魔作斗争，直到1956年与一位情妇一起在醉酒的汽车残骸中丧生。艺术家的生活并不总是那么美丽。</p><p>     The Big Sur of  Henry Miller&#39;s day in the 1940s and 50s was a remote stretch of rocky woods with none of the bells and whistles that came later.  Esalen hadn&#39;t yet been established. The organic locavore caterers and spa treatments were still decades away. So were the exquisite country estates that now populate the forest. Miller and the oddball collection of pre-hippie touchy feely types were there because it was beautiful and cheap.</p><p>     亨利·米勒（Henry Miller）在1940年代和50年代的大苏尔是遥远的岩石树林，后来没有钟声和口哨声。 Esalen尚未成立。有机Locavore餐饮和水疗护理距离酒店还有数十年的路程。现在遍布森林的精致乡村庄园也是如此。米勒（Giller）和嬉皮前的触觉感觉类型的奇怪球集合在那里，因为它既美观又便宜。</p><p>  Miller’s first few books were banned in the United States because they were too racy for American culture at that time. He was on his third wife when he settled in at Big Sur and that marriage ended in divorce as well. Once his two children were grown he was an older man living in a small cottage in the forest alone much of the time. Miller helped establish the mystique of Big Sur, but the wealth that followed made his lifestyle difficult for others to replicate on a normal budget.</p><p>  米勒的前几本书在美国被禁，因为当时它们对于美国文化而言太过流行。当他定居在大苏尔（Big Sur）时，他是他的第三任妻子，婚姻也以离婚而告终。他的两个孩子长大后，他是一个年长的男人，大部分时间他独自生活在森林里的一间小木屋里。米勒帮助建立了大苏尔（Big Sur）的奥秘，但随之而来的财富使他的生活方式很难被其他人以正常预算复制。 </p><p>   The Provincetown of Eugene O&#39;Neill, Mark Rothko, and Edward Hopper in the early 20th century wasn&#39;t at all the same as it is now. Artists first colonized the New England town because it had a generous supply of old semi-abandoned buildings. The fishing industry had been devastated by a huge storm in 1898 that destroyed much of the waterfront infrastructure. The place was pretty, cheap, a bit rough, and unpleasant to inhabit during the cold windy winters without mod cons. Perhaps that&#39;s why the local Portuguese families were willing to welcome the bohemian arrivals. They were desperate for revenue.</p><p>二十世纪初的尤金·尼尔，马克·罗斯科和爱德华·霍珀的普罗温斯敦与现在完全不同。艺术家首先殖民了新英格兰小镇，因为那里有大量的旧的半废弃建筑。 1898年的一场大风暴摧毁了许多滨水基础设施，使渔业遭受了极大的破坏。这个地方很漂亮，便宜，有点粗糙，在寒冷的冬天没有mod的缺点，不适合居住。也许这就是为什么当地的葡萄牙家庭愿意欢迎波西米亚人的到来。他们渴望获得收入。</p><p>   It was possible back in the teens and 1920s to write and perform plays, paint, and otherwise rub shoulders with similarly inclined artsy folks when the rent was ridiculously low. People just had to be prepared to muddle through without creature comforts like central heat or indoor plumbing. The literati were there to generate culture, not merely to consume it.</p><p>   在十几岁的时候，当租金低得可笑时，就有可能写剧本，表演剧本，画画，或者用类似的手艺吸引那些人。人们只需要准备在没有像中央供暖或室内管道这样的生物舒适的情况下就可以穿行。文人在那里产生文化，而不仅仅是消费文化。</p><p> I lived in Provincetown for a year in the late 1980s and the dynamic that had emerged by then was characterized by extremely high property prices and mass commercial tourism. I managed by working as a cleaner and gardener at a guest house and lived in the attic. It was a great place to be for people who brought money with them, but lower income creatives were almost entirely squeezed out unless they were attached to a larger institution and grant funding.</p><p> 我在普罗温斯敦（Provincetown）住了一年，在1980年代后期，当时出现的活力以极高的房地产价格和大众商业旅游为特征。我在一家旅馆担任清洁工和园丁，然后住在阁楼上。对于那些随身带钱的人来说，这是一个好地方，但是低收入的创意者几乎被完全挤出，除非他们隶属于更大的机构并提供资金。</p><p>     In 1968  Donald Judd bought an entire five story cast iron warehouse on Spring Street in New York for $70,000. Inflation adjusted that&#39;s $524,000 today. That’s not a small amount of money, but it’s an immense building. Pound for pound it was ridiculously cheap. That building became Judd’s home, art studio, and exhibition gallery for the rest of his life as he incrementally renovated the place room by room.</p><p>     1968年，唐纳德·贾德（Donald Judd）以70,000美元的价格在纽约春天街（Spring Street）上购买了整个五层楼高的铸铁仓库。通货膨胀调整了今天的524,000美元。这不是一笔小数目，但它是一栋巨大的建筑。一磅一磅的价格便宜得可笑。贾德一生都在逐步改建这个地方，后来成了贾德的住所，艺术工作室和展览馆。</p><p> Industrial buildings in New York had been emptied out and left for dead by the 1960s. The middle class had decanted to suburbia and New York declined like most older city centers. That left a great deal of vacant property behind at a deep discount. There was a reason the place was cheap. The city was falling apart and these old buildings were in terrible condition. Lofts of that era were cold water walk ups with leaking roofs and none of the designer touches or investment banker fueled renovations. That all came much later. Judd was willing to live there during the dirty, neglected, crime ridden version of New York, not the fully fluffed New York that gradually surfaced over the decades. But his activities contributed to the transformation that eventually lured in the big money.</p><p> 纽约的工业建筑已被清空，并在1960年代留给人死亡。中产阶级倾泻到郊区，而纽约则像大多数较老的市中心一样衰落。这留下了大量的空置财产，折价很大。这个地方便宜是有原因的。这座城市正在瓦解，这些古老的建筑状况恶劣。那个时代的阁楼是屋顶漏水的冷水走道，设计师的接触或投资银行家都没有推动装修。一切都晚了。贾德愿意在肮脏，被忽视，犯罪缠身的纽约生活，而不是几十年来逐渐浮出水面的蓬松纽约。但是他的活动促进了转型，最终吸引了大笔资金。</p><p>      In 1971 Judd began buying old buildings and extensive ranch land in the remote desert of Marfa, Texas. The region has what might be described as a subtle beauty. Marfa isn’t close to anything and it’s not on the way to anywhere else either. You have to really want to go there because it isn’t easy. That’s exactly why Judd was drawn to the place. He didn’t select Marfa because it came ready made with hand crafted espresso shops or upscale hotels. He picked one of the least likely locations in the entire country and meticulously cultivated his own art venue out of thin air. Over the last fifty years Marfa has emerged as an international destination and has become rather expensive in spite of its endless supply of surrounding desert scrub land.</p><p>      1971年，贾德（Judd）开始在得克萨斯州玛法（Marfa）偏远的沙漠中购买旧建筑物和广阔的牧场。该地区可谓微妙的美丽。 Marfa并没有接近任何事物，也没有通往其他任何地方的道路。您真的要去那里，因为那并不容易。这就是贾德被吸引到这个地方的原因。他之所以选择Marfa，是因为它已经准备就绪，可以用手工制作的意式特浓咖啡店或高档酒店制作。他挑选了整个国家最不可能的地点之一，并凭空精心培育了自己的艺术场所。在过去的五十年中，尽管Marfa不断供应周围的沙漠灌丛土地，但它已成为国际目的地，并变得相当昂贵。</p><p>       So… here&#39;s my reply to this reader. Drop the romantic yearnings for some lost Golden Age.  These are the good old days. I’ll paraphrase my friend John Anderson from the  Incremental Development Alliance.  Brooklyn, Carmel, and Santa Fe don’t need your sorry Hipster ass. There’s a whole big continent out there full of places that could use some love and they’re dirt cheap. Many of them are gorgeous even though they may not get much publicity. Others are seriously ugly, but have their own gritty appeal. And quite a few of these amazing undervalued spots have at least a few charming and engaged people knocking around doing cool shit. Go find one that speaks to you and create your own  intellektuelle Kunstgemeinschaft. The world you want is one you make yourself from spare parts, not one you discover and purchase.</p><p>       所以...这是我对这位读者的回覆。放弃浪漫的向往，寻找一些失落的黄金时代。这些是过去的美好时光。我将解释一下增量开发联盟的朋友约翰·安德森（John Anderson）。布鲁克林，卡梅尔和圣达菲不需要您抱歉的时髦驴子。整个大洲到处都是可以使用爱情的地方，而且价格便宜。他们中的许多人都是华丽的，即使他们可能没有得到太多的宣传。其他人则非常丑陋，但具有自己的坚韧吸引力。在这些惊人的被低估的地方中，有不少至少有一些迷人而有魅力的人四处逛逛，做些很烂的事。去找一个可以和您说话的人，并创建您自己的知识库。您想要的世界是您用零配件打造自己的世界，而不是您发现和购买的世界。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.granolashotgun.com/granolashotguncom/2mvygaw3y67fx5bqrvno2lp452zifc">https://www.granolashotgun.com/granolashotguncom/2mvygaw3y67fx5bqrvno2lp452zifc</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/怀旧/">#怀旧</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/nostalgia/">#nostalgia</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
