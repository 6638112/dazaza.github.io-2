The word “manuscript” comes from the Latin  manu scriptus, “written by hand,” but any manuscript was the product of much more work than simply the writing of a single hand. It was a months-or even years-long, multistep process calling for the expertise of a series of tradesmen and specialist craftsmen, from parchment makers to scribes, miniaturists, goldbeaters, and even apothecaries, carpenters, and blacksmiths.</p><p>在15世纪中期生产西塞罗的着作的新手稿显然是一个比梳理Franciscan图书馆的沉睡的书架更加艰苦，涉及忽视的代言。 “手稿”一词来自拉丁文脚本，“用手写的”，但任何手稿都是更加工作的产品，而不是简单地写一只手。这是几个月甚至年长的多年来，呼吁一系列商人和专业工匠的专业知识，从羊皮纸制造商到划线，小型家，金街，甚至是药剂师，木匠和铁匠。</p><p> The essential first step was finding the exemplar: the text, as reliable as possible, from which the scribe would work. It is no coincidence that on his excursion to Lucca in 1445 Vespasiano da Bisticci—known at the height of the Renaissance in Florence as “the king of the world’s booksellers”—purchased two copies of Cicero from Michele Guinigi. His sharp eyes no doubt spotted that these manuscripts would be excellent texts to compare with those volumes he was preparing for Grey.</p><p> 基本的第一步是找到示例：文本，尽可能可靠，从中抄写员会起作用。在佛罗伦萨的文艺复兴的高度为“世界书籍国王”，这是毫无疑问的卢卡斯的游览卢卡斯，这是毫无巧合的。他的敏锐眼睛毫无疑问发现这些手稿是与他准备灰色的卷相比的优秀文本。</p><p> Vespasiano occasionally produced works on paper, of which, like all  cartolai, he carried ready supplies. For the most part, though, his clients expected him to use parchment.  Cartolai carried stocks of parchment, which was made from the skin of sheep or goats, and sometimes also from donkeys. The most beautiful and expensive material on which to write was calfskin, or vellum, the word “vellum” coming (like the word “veal”) from  vitulus, Latin for “calf” ( vitello in Italian). The younger the calf, the finer and whiter the skin; uterine vellum, from aborted or stillborn calves, was the finest and whitest of all—but also, because of its rarity, infrequently used.</p><p> Vespasiano偶尔在纸上生产的作品，其中，与所有Cartolai一样，他携带准备就绪。尽管如此，他的客户希望他使用羊皮纸。 Castolai带有羊皮纸的股票，这是由绵羊或山羊的皮肤制成的，有时也来自驴子。写入最美丽昂贵的材料是小牛皮，或瓦尔姆，“vellum”这个词（如“小牛肉”）从Vitu属，拉丁语为“小牛”（意大利Vitello）。小腿年轻，细节和白皙;子宫血管，中产阶级或失败的小牛，是最优秀的，也是最白，但由于其罕见，不经常使用。</p><p>  The supply of hides for parchment was always dependent on the dietary preferences of the local population. The appetite in Italy for goats (one recipe book offered advice on how to spit-roast, boil, or stew them, how to cook their eyes, ears, lungs, and testicles, and how to make pies from their heads) meant that manuscripts in Italy were often made from goatskin. This reliance of the book industry on the palate of the locals is reflected in the lament by a 13th-century Patriarch of Cyprus, Gregory II, that not until after Lent, when people began eating meat again, would he be able to get the hides required for a manuscript of Demosthenes. For hundreds of years, the transmission of knowledge had depended on carnivorous appetites and good animal husbandry. Large volumes with hundreds of pages required the skins of many animals. One goat was often needed for each page of parchment in a large liturgical book such as an antiphonary, while a Bible might take the skins of more than two hundred animals—an entire herd of goats or flock of sheep.</p><p>  羊皮纸供应总是依赖于当地人口的饮食偏好。意大利山羊的胃口（一个食谱书提供了有关如何吐烤，煮沸或炖它们的建议，如何烹饪眼睛，耳朵，肺和睾丸，以及如何从头部中制作馅饼）意味着手稿在意大利常常由山羊酸制成。这本书行业对当地人口感的依赖体现在侦探塞浦路斯的13世纪族长，格雷戈里二世，直到借出，当人们开始再次吃肉时，他能够得到隐藏Demosthenes的稿件所需。百年多年来，知识传播依赖于食肉胃肠和良好的畜牧业。有数百页的大卷需要许多动物的皮肤。一只山羊经常需要一只羊肉在一个大型礼仪书中，如抗飞波，而圣经可能拿出超过两百只动物的皮肤 - 整个山羊或羊群。</p><p>   Parchment makers in Florence were, like the  cartolai, clustered around the Badia in the Street of Booksellers. To purchase their hides they needed to visit the butchers on the Ponte Vecchio. In 1422, for reasons of hygiene, the government ordered the city’s butchers to move their operations into the shops on the bridge, already occupied by tanners, fish sellers, and beltmakers. From here the butchers could happily pour blood and other slops straight into the Arno, rather than, as before, befouling the city’s streets. The parchment makers, in competition with the tanners, would try to get the best hides from the butchers, those with the fewest nicks, cuts, and scars, and the least number of bites from ticks and flies.</p><p>   佛罗伦萨的羊皮纸制造商像Cartolai一样，在书商街道的Badia聚集。购买他们隐藏，他们需要访问Ponte Vecchio上的屠夫。在1422年，出于卫生的原因，政府命令这个城市的屠夫将他们的行动转移到桥梁上的商店，已经被裁工，鱼卖方和皮带制造商占据。从这里，屠夫可以快乐地倒入血液和其他剧烈的雪人进入阿诺，而不是如前所述，露出城市的街道。在与制革商的竞争中，羊皮纸制造商将尽力从屠夫中获得最好的隐藏，其中缺少缺口，削减和伤疤的最少，以及蜱和苍蝇的叮咬最少。</p><p>   The process of making parchment was scarcely less foul-smelling than the work of the tanners, who used both urine and dung to cure their hides. The parchment makers would cart their heap of skins back to their premises, smear them with a corrosive quicklime, fold them lengthwise, then put them into a vat to ferment. After a week or two, the hides would be fished from the vat, bathed in limewater, and then attached with pegs to wooden frames and stretched tight as the remaining hair and flesh was scraped away with a crescent-shaped knife. Still taut on the frame, they would be rubbed with chalk or bone dust and scrubbed with a pumice stone, or perhaps the bone of a cuttlefish. Then they were rubbed and scrubbed again and again, until the surface of both sides was smooth and pale, though sheepskin always yielded a yellowish cast and goatskin a slightly gray one. The skin was then cut from the frame in a neat rectangle.</p><p>   制造羊皮纸的过程几乎不那么臭味，而不是横幅的工作，他们使用尿液和粪便治愈他们的隐藏。羊皮纸制造商将其堆的皮肤堆回到他们的场所，用腐蚀性的鞋链涂抹它们，纵向折叠它们，然后将它们放入桶中进行发酵。经过一两周或两两周，隐藏将从增值税中捕食，沐浴在LimeWater中，然后用钉子与木制框架连接并随着剩余的头发和肉体用新月形的刀子刮去，伸缩。仍然在框架上绷紧，它们会用粉笔或骨尘揉搓，用浮石擦洗，或者也许是墨鱼的骨头。然后再一次又一次地擦拭并再次擦洗，直到两侧的表面光滑苍白，尽管羊皮总是产生一个黄色的铸造和山羊果略微灰色。然后将皮肤从框架中切割成一个整洁的矩形。</p><p>  The rectangular shape of books (through the Middle Ages codices generally had a width-to-height ratio of 2:3) was in many respects determined by the shape of the animal skins once they had been trimmed of their extremities. These outer scraps served to make glues, while other offcuts, such as the skin from the shoulders, neck, and flanks, with their coarser grain and more awkward shape, might be used as cheap parchment for children’s books such as the  Santacroce.</p><p>  书籍的矩形形状（通过中等年龄代码通常具有2：3的宽度为高度比）在许多方面，通过动物皮肤的形状确定它们的末端。这些外碎屑用于制造胶水，而其他脱塞（例如来自肩部，颈部和侧面）的其他脱机，伴有粗糙的晶粒和更尴尬的形状，可能用作儿童书籍，例如桑克罗奇的廉价羊皮纸。 </p><p>  The next operation involved paring away the skin with another sharp tool, reducing it to roughly half of its original thickness. The parchment maker had to be careful neither to tear the skin nor to create an uneven thickness. Parchment for large, luxurious manuscripts was scraped less so it remained robust enough to carry the decorations. Even so, these pages were reduced to a thickness of 0.1 millimeter, or 1⁄250 of an inch. At this point any flaws in the skin, from the bites of insects or the gashes of old wounds, could leave the surface with small oval perforations around which the scribe would have to work. The defective quality of the parchment—if it was too rough, greasy, or brittle—was one of the many things about which scribes complained in their manuscripts. “The parchment is hairy,” griped one medieval scribe.</p><p>下一个操作涉及使用另一个锋利的工具脱离皮肤，将其减少到其原始厚度的大约一半。羊皮纸制造商既不要小心撕裂皮肤，也不要造成不均匀的厚度。对于大型豪华手稿的羊皮纸较少，所以它仍然足够强大，可以携带装饰品。即便如此，这些页面也减少到0.1毫米的厚度，或1/250英寸。此时，皮肤中的任何缺陷，从昆虫的叮咬或旧伤口的伤口，都可以将表面留下小椭圆形穿孔，划线将不得不工作。羊皮纸的质量有缺陷 - 如果它太粗糙，油腻或脆弱 - 是许多文章抱怨在手稿中的许多事情之一。 “羊皮纸是毛茸茸的，”一个中世纪的抄写员抓住了。</p><p>  The large rectangle of parchment was then cut into four or eight pieces. Parchment was sold in various sizes according to the type of book for which it was destined. One of the largest sizes was used for antiphonaries, which needed to be read simultaneously from a distance by many pairs of eyes—those of choir members. Their pages were often two feet high by more than a foot wide, with the staves (the horizontal lines on which the musical notes appear) drawn almost two inches high. The pages of parchment used by Vespasiano for his edition of Cicero for William Grey were fourteen inches high by ten inches wide, the size known as  foglio comune, or common sheet.</p><p>  然后切成四个或八个羊皮纸的大矩形。根据它注定的书的类型，羊皮纸以各种规模出售。最大尺寸之一用于抗双向性，这需要从多对眼睛的距离同时读取 - 合唱团成员。他们的页面往往高于一英尺高，宽阔，用笛腰（音符出现的水平线）绘制近两英寸高。 Vespasiano用于他的威廉·灰色的西罗的羊皮纸页面为十四英寸，宽十英寸，尺寸为福音剧院，或公共纸张。</p><p> Parchment in Florence was usually sold in quires made up of five sheets folded in half to make ten leaves, which, inscribed on both sides, gave twenty pages of text. One of these quires of  foglio commune could cost as much as ten soldi. Given that his manuscript of Cicero’s rhetorical writings required 125 leaves, or more than a dozen quires, the parchment for this volume alone must have cost Vespasiano roughly one and a half florins. This sum was a significant outlay—roughly a month’s rent on the shop in the Street of Booksellers.</p><p> 佛罗伦萨的羊皮纸通常以5张折叠成分的Quires销售，以制作十个叶子，在两侧铭刻，给出了20页的文字。其中一个击败福音公社可能会花费多达十个焊接。鉴于他的西塞罗的原稿需要125个叶子，或十几次Quires，单独为这一体积的羊皮纸大致有一个半弗洛林斯的成本vespasiano。这笔款项在书商街道上的商店是一个重要的支出 - 大约一个月的租金。</p><p>   Having supplied himself with parchment, Vespasiano was ready to hire a scribe. Monks in the Badia, across from Vespasiano’s shop, still worked as scribes. So too did the Franciscan nuns at the convent of Santa Brigida del Paradiso, the Benedictine nuns in Santissima Annunziata della Murate, and indeed the nuns at some five other convents scattered in and around Florence. However, the manuscripts they produced were liturgical in nature—breviaries, lectionaries, missals, and so forth. In Florence, as in much of the rest of Europe, the scribes who copied secular works such as the Latin classics were not found in the scriptoria of abbeys and convents but rather in the shops of notaries and the studies of assorted scholars who might otherwise work as secretaries to wealthy men or tutors to their sons. Notaries made ideal scribes because their profession called on them to prepare contracts and other documents in Latin, on parchment, in a legible handwriting. There was no shortage of them either, because notaries were the most numerous profession in Florence in the first half of the 15th century—and many of their shops lined the Street of Booksellers and Via del Palagio.</p><p>   用羊皮纸向自己提供，Vespasiano准备雇用抄写员。僧侣在巴西州的僧侣，从Vespasiano的店铺中，仍然是划线。 Sya Santa Brigida del Paradiso的修道院在Santissima Anunziata Della Murate的Convent of Santa Brigida del Paradiso的修道院，确实在佛罗伦萨及其周围地区散落的其他五个会议中的修女。然而，他们生产的手稿是在自然 - 比赛，选拔，怪异等方面的宗旨。在佛罗伦萨，如欧洲其他大部分地区，在教育道和机构的抄本器和对象的抄写师中没有找到诸如拉丁经纪这样的世俗作品的划线，而是在公证店的商店以及可能工作的什锦学者的研究作为富裕的男人或辅导员对他们的儿子的秘书。公证人成为理想的划线，因为他们的专业呼吁他们在一个清晰的笔迹中呼吁他们在拉丁语的拉丁文规定合同和其他文件。他们也没有短缺，因为公证人在15世纪上半叶的公证人是佛罗伦萨最多的职业 - 他们的许多商店都排列了商业商和潜水帕拉塔街的街道。</p><p> Most of the scribes employed over the years by Vespasiano, such as Ser Antonio di Mario, were indeed notaries (all of whom used the honorific “ser,” rather as “Esq.” is added after a lawyer’s name). Many notaries topped up their incomes by copying manuscripts part-time in their shops or homes, but others, such as Ser Antonio, abandoned the notarial profession altogether and worked full-time as scribes, often quite lucratively. Indeed, the scribe represented a bookseller’s greatest expense, taking up as much as two-thirds of a manuscript’s production cost, at least twice as much as the parchment. They were generally paid by the quire, earning a fixed sum for every ten leaves of parchment, or twenty pages copied front and back. The average fee was around thirty or forty soldi per quire, at which rate Ser Antonio would have been paid more than five florins for his work on the Cicero manuscript for William Grey. Copying ten or twelve such manuscripts per year would allow a scribe to bask in more than tolerable comfort.</p><p> 多年来聘请的大部分划线都是vespasiano，如Ser Antonio di Mario，确实是公证人（所有人都使用议中语“Ser”，而是作为“ESQ”。在律师的名义之后增加了）。许多公证人通过在他们的商店或家庭中兼职汇编兼职，但其他公证队在他们的商店或房屋中兼职，例如Ser Antonio，完全放弃了公证职业并全职工作，通常是划线，通常是相当的。事实上，抄写员代表了书商最大的费用，占据了三分之二的手稿的生产成本，至少是羊皮纸的两倍。他们通常由Quire支付，为每十个羊皮纸的固定金额进行固定金额，或者在前后复制二十页。平均费用是每次Quire的三十或四十次葡萄酒，速率Ser Antonio将为他的威廉·灰色稿件上的福林撰写超过五个弗洛林斯。每年复制十或十二个手稿将使抄写员以令人忍受的舒适性。</p><p>  Scribes often needed to work quickly and prolifically due to the demands of the patron, the time limit imposed by whoever lent the exemplar, and their own financial needs. One of the most impressive scribal feats in Florence was that of a copyist in the middle of the 1300s who produced—over the course of some twenty years—what became known to legend as the  gruppo del Cento, or “the Group of One Hundred”: one hundred manuscripts of Dante’s  Divine Comedy, the proceeds of which provided dowries for the scribe’s numerous daughters.</p><p>  由于赞助人的需求，通常需要快速而且繁琐地划线，借助于示范的人，以及他们自己的财务需求所施加的时限。佛罗伦萨最令人印象深刻的血统剧目之一是1300年代中间的复印师，在大约二十年内制作 - 传说是Gruppo del Cento的，或“一百名” ：丁迪神圣喜剧的一百个稿件，该收益为抄写员提供了宗旨的宗旨。</p><p>  The offspring of his daughters’ marriages called themselves  dei Centi, “of the Hundred,” proudly taking their surname from the pen-pushing efforts of their grandfather.</p><p>  他的女儿婚姻的后代称为自己dei centi，“百年，”自豪地从他们的祖父的笔推动努力中占据了他们的姓氏。 </p><p> Many other remarkable scribal feats are on record. One copyist working in Florence managed to complete a quire (that is, twenty pages front and back) every two days. Poggio worked at double that speed when he produced his complete Quintilian in thirty-two days, turning out a quire each day. He once copied out 152 pages of a work in twelve days, and in 1425 he promised to provide Niccolò Niccoli with a new manuscript of Lucretius’s  On the Nature of Things in only two weeks, although in the end the job took a month. One of the quickest quills belonged to a scribe named Giovanmarco Cinico, who once copied 1,270 pages of Pliny’s  Natural  History in 120 days, and in a beautiful and legible hand. He signed himself, appropriately enough, as Velex—“Speedy.”</p><p>许多其他非凡的血糖壮举是在记录的。在佛罗伦萨工作的一个复印师设法每两天完成一次Quire（即前后二十页）。当他在三十二天生产他的完整奇利莲时，Poggio在加倍的加速时工作，每天都会出现一个Quire。他曾经在十二天内复制了152页的工作，在1425年，他承诺提供Niccolōniccoli，并在只有两周内为Lucretius的新手稿提供了新的稿件，尽管最终工作了一个月。其中一个最快的Quills属于一个名叫Giovanmarco Cinico的抄写员，在120天内经过一旦复制了1,270页的Pliny的自然历史，并且在一个美丽而清晰易读的手中。他适当地签署了自己，就像Velex-“快速”一样。</p><p> We have no record of how long Ser Antonio took to copy the 250 pages of the manuscript for William Grey. But he generally worked both swiftly and prolifically. He completed a manuscript of Virgil in April 1445, only seven months before signing the Cicero for Vespasiano. In the previous twelve months he had copied out two manuscripts of Leonardo Bruni’s  History of Florence, a massive tome that stretched to 300 leaves of parchment, or 600 pages. * In one year he managed to copy at least seven manuscripts, including one of Bruni’s translations of a Platonic dialogue.</p><p> 我们没有记录Ser Antonio如何复制威廉·灰色的稿件250页。但他通常迅速繁殖。他于4月1445日完成了Virgil的手稿，只有七个月才签署西塞罗以为vespasiano。在上一个十二个月中，他已经复制了莱昂纳多·布鲁尼历史的两个手稿，这是一个巨大的羊皮纸叶子或600页的巨大圆顶。 *在一年内，他设法复制了至少七个稿件，包括布鲁尼的柏拉图式对话的翻译之一。</p><p>   In selecting Ser Antonio, Vespasiano had wisely chosen for this important early commission a talented and capable veteran with almost thirty years of experience. His beautiful handwriting graced the manuscripts of many important and cherished works: Gellius’s  Attic  Nights, Plutarch’s  Lives, Varro’s  On the Latin Language, Bruni’s translations of both Plato and Aristotle, along with many others. He copied manuscripts for the finest collections in Florence. He was, in fact, Cosimo de’ Medici’s favorite scribe, including at the end of his transcriptions affectionate salutations such as “Happy reading, sweetest Cosimo.”</p><p>   在选择Ser Antonio时，Vespasiano明智地为这一重要的早期佣金选择了一个有才华和有力的老兵，具有近三十年的经验。他美丽的笔迹造成了许多重要和珍惜作品的手稿：Gellius的阁楼夜晚，Plutarch的生活，Varro在拉丁语上，Bruni的柏拉图和亚里士多德的翻译以及许多其他人。他复制了佛罗伦萨最好的收藏品。事实上，他是Cosimo de'Micedi的最受欢迎的抄写员，包括在他的转录的浓郁伴侣的结束时，如“愉快的阅读，最甜蜜的宇宙”。</p><p>  Such comments Ser Antonio always placed at the end, in what has come to be known as the colophon. The word “colophon” derives from the Greek κορυφή, meaning hilltop or summit, but at some point it took on a metaphorical sense of a finishing touch or crowing stroke: ancient Greek philosophers spoke of “putting a colophon” on an argument.</p><p>  此类评论Ser Antonio始终放置在最后，以其被称为Colophon。 “联邦罗尔”这个词源于希腊κορνφή，意思是山顶或峰会，但在某些时候，它采用了一点精加工触摸或漫游中风的隐喻感：古希腊哲学家讲述了“在争论中放置了一个联邦罗斯”。</p><p>  We can appreciate how a scribe, having copied hundreds of pages of a manuscript, may well have felt he had scaled a summit, and the term was adopted for the designs, flourishes, and slogans often added by scribes to the ends of their manuscripts. The scribe who copied part of Aquinas’s massive  Summa Theologica ended with a cry of exhausted triumph: “Here ends the second part of the work of Brother Thomas Aquinas of the Dominican Order, incredibly long, verbose and tedious for the scribe. Thank God, thank God, and again thank God!”</p><p>  我们可以欣赏抄写员如何复制数百页的稿件，可能会觉得他已经缩放了峰会，而是为设计，繁荣和口号采用了这个术语，他们通过抄写来到他们手稿的目的。复制了阿奎那大规模夏天的划分的抄写员结束了一阵疲惫的胜利呐喊：“这里结束了多米尼加人秩序哥哥托马斯·阿奎那的第二部分，对抄写员令人难以置信的，冗长，繁琐。感谢上帝，感谢上帝，再次感谢上帝！“</p><p> At other times scribes addressed future readers, cautioning them to be careful with the manuscript: “I beseech you, my friend, when you are reading my book, to keep your hands behind your back, for fear you should do mischief to the text by some sudden movement.” Scribes often asked readers to pray for their souls. A humorous variation on this convention appeared in a manuscript copied by a Florentine nun named Sara. “Let whoever reads this devout life pray God for me, poor Sister Sara,” she began, before adding, “And if you don’t I’ll strangle you when I’m dead.”</p><p> 在其他时候抄写了未来的读者，警告他们要小心稿件：“我恳求你，我的朋友，当你正在读书时，让你的手在你的背后，因为害怕你应该用文本做恶作剧一些突然的运动。“抄写们经常要求读者为他们的灵魂祈祷。这款公约的幽默变异出现在由名叫萨​​拉的佛罗伦萨尼姑复制的稿件中。 “让谁读这个虔诚的生活为我祈祷上帝，姐姐萨拉，”她开始，在加入之前，“如果你没有，我会在我死的时候扼杀你。”</p><p> For his colophons, Ser Antonio used a compass to draw a circle around whose 360 degrees he would put his name and the date, sometimes also recording an ongoing event. He began his long career in the summer of 1417, when he ended a manuscript with the observation that he had been “laboring during the plague in Tuscany.” One of his other manuscripts, signed in May 1426, states that Florence was bravely fighting the “tyranny of the duke of Milan, who was waging an unlawful and unjust war.”</p><p> 对于他的联邦罗斯，Ser Antonio使用了指南针绘制围绕其围绕其姓名的圆圈，他将汇集他的名字和日期，有时还记录正在进行的事件。他在1417年夏天开始了他的长期职业生涯，当时他结束了一个手稿，观察到他在托斯卡纳的瘟疫中曾经“劳动”。他在5月14日5月签署了他的其他一个手稿，说明佛罗伦萨勇敢地与米兰公爵的暴政争辩，他正在发动非法和不公正的战争。“ </p><p>   Vespasiano prepared the parchment for Ser Antonio by ruling it with lines, both horizontally and, to justify the text, vertically at the margins. This task would have been among the first he learned from Michele Guarducci.  Cartolai pricked the margins with a needle or a pinwheel, often pushing the point through as much as a quire at a time. The operation required a certain amount of physical strength (and no doubt sometimes resulted in minor injuries). The small perforations indicated where exactly the horizontal lines should be drawn or, less often, scored with a stylus.</p><p>Vespasiano通过用水平统治，垂直地将文本统治，垂直地为Ser Antonio准备了Ser Antonio的羊皮纸。这项任务将是他从米歇尔Guarducci学到的第一个。 Cartolai用针或风车刺破了边缘，通常一次将点推到Quire。该操作需要一定量的体力（毫无疑问，有时会导致轻微伤害）。小穿孔表明，究竟应该绘制水平线或更少，以较少，用手写笔得分。</p><p> The point of pricking a quire at a time was to make sure the spacing was uniform on all of the pages. Ser Antonio’s Cicero manuscript features 36 lines of text on each page, with the guidelines in pale ink still faintly visible. The job of ruling the parchment was a tediously repetitive one, but it had the obvious importance of ensuring evenly spaced lines and a text that ran undeviatingly across the pages. As in Florentine architecture, so in Florentine manuscripts, beauty lay in simplicity, regularity, and symmetry.</p><p> 一次刺破Quire的程度是确保所有页面都统一。 Ser Antonio的Cicero Manuscript在每页上有36行文本，浅色墨水的指南仍然可见。统治羊皮纸的工作是一种艰难的重复之一，但它具有确保均匀间隔的线条和文本持不明跨越页面的文本具有明显的重要性。如在佛罗伦萨建筑，所以在佛罗伦萨手稿中，美容躺在简单，规律性和对称性。</p><p> With his parchment awaiting him, Ser Antonio takes a seat at his desk. His writing surface, sloped at an angle of around thirty degrees, holds the exemplar, the blank quire, and two inkhorns fitted into holes. To remove any grease from the page, he sprinkles it with chalk or bone dust, the latter made (as one manual advised) by incinerating the leg or shoulder of a sheep and then grinding the ashes on a porphyry slab. Then, to remove the excess dust, he brushes the surface with a hare’s foot.</p><p> 随着他的羊皮纸等待着他，Ser Antonio在他的桌子上座位。他的书写表面以大约三十度的角度倾斜，占据了一个安装在孔中的示例性，空白quire和两个墨水锤。要从页面中取出任何润滑脂，他用粉笔或骨尘洒，后者通过焚烧绵羊的腿或肩部而制作（作为一只手动建议），然后在斑岩板上研磨灰烬。然后，去除多余的灰尘，他用野兔的脚刷了表面。</p><p>  Next comes the preparation of the vital instrument of his labors: his quill, made from one of the flight feathers of a goose (the word pen derives from the Latin  penna, “feather”). He has already carefully trimmed the barbs from the shaft, which is seasoned to the right hardness, but still supple. He cuts its tip to a point and then, to make the nib more pliable and help the flow of ink, makes a short incision along its length. These procedures he will repeat numerous times a day, his quill slowly growing shorter as he pares it away.</p><p>  接下来是制定他的劳动力的重要工具：他的羽毛笔，由一只鹅的飞行羽毛制成（单词笔从拉丁语的Penna，“羽毛”）。他已经仔细修剪了轴的倒钩，这是对良好的硬度调味，但仍然柔软。他将尖端切成一点，然后使笔尖更柔韧并帮助油墨流动，沿其长度进行短切口。这些程序他每天都会重复多次，他的羽毛慢慢地越来越短，因为他将它分开。</p><p>   Next Ser Antonio dips the quill into one of the two inkhorns. One holds black ink, the other red. The main ingredients for the former are wine and the barks and saps from various trees, including oak galls, the small, tannin-rich lumps that grow on the twigs of oak trees where gallflies lay their eggs. One Italian recipe for black ink advised taking four ounces of crushed galls and mixing them with a bottle of strong white wine, pomegranate rinds, bark from a mountain ash, the root of a walnut tree, and gum arabic—the sap from an acacia tree.</p><p>   下一个Ser Antonio将羽脚浸入两个墨水山脉中的一个。一个拿着黑色墨水，另一个红色。前者的主要成分是各种树木的葡萄酒和树皮，包括橡树胆，小型单宁丰富的肿块，这些浓郁的疙瘩在橡木树的树枝上生长，在橡皮树的树枝上，在那里乱扔鸡蛋。黑色墨水的一个意大利食谱建议服用四盎司碎胆，并将它们与一瓶强烈的白葡萄酒，石榴外皮，从山灰，核桃树根和牙龈阿拉伯树 - 来自金合欢树的树皮。</p><p> These ingredients were left in the sun and stirred every few hours. Into this concoction were added, after a week, a few ounces of “Roman vitriol,” or copper sulphate. The mixture then sat a few days longer and was regularly stirred. Then it was placed over the fire and boiled “for the space of one  miserere ”—as long as it took to recite the nineteen verses of Psalm 51. Next the bubbling black liquor was cooled, strained through linen, and left to sit in the sun for two more days. “If you then put in it a little rock alum it will make it much brighter,” the recipe claimed, “and it will be good and perfect writing ink.”</p><p> 将这些成分留在阳光下并每隔几个小时搅拌。在一周后，加入了这种混合物，几盎司的“罗马硫酸”或硫酸铜。然后将混合物饱和时间长，经常搅拌。然后它被放置在火上，煮“一个误导的空间” - 只要考虑一下诗篇51，就要留下了一九九岁的诗篇51.接下来将鼓泡的黑液冷却，通过亚麻调节，留在太阳两天。 “如果你然后把它放入一个小岩石明矾，它将使它变得更加光明，”食谱声称，“这将是良好而完美的写入墨水。”</p><p>  Ser Antonio bought his supply of black ink from either a  cartolaio (who also sold goosequill pens) or one of Florence’s monasteries. On a scrap of paper or parchment, making a short doodle, he tests out both the nib and his red ink. He can make red ink himself by mixing egg white and gum arabic with cinnabar, a reddish stone found in Tuscany and purchased, already ground, from the local apothecary. Another dip in the inkhorn and he hovers over the blank page, its buoyant surface pressed down with the knife he holds in his left hand. His middle finger is farther down the shaft than his index: the better to control the nib. He holds his quill at a right angle to the surface of the parchment: the better for the ink to flow from nib to page.</p><p>  Ser Antonio从Bastolaio（也卖掉了Goosequill Pens）或佛罗伦萨的修道院之一买了他的黑墨水。在纸张或羊皮纸的废料上，制作短暂的涂鸦，他测试了一下笔尖和红墨水。他可以通过将蛋白和牙龈阿拉伯语混合，在托斯卡纳发现的红石，并从当地的药剂师购买了一块红色的石头来制作红色的墨水。另一个浸入墨水倾角，他徘徊在空白页面上，它的浮力表面用刀子压在左手中。他的中指比他的指数更远了井下：控制笔尖更好。他以直角握住羊皮纸的羽毛：墨水的墨水越好，从笔尖到页面。 </p><p> After a quick check of the exemplar, Ser Antonio brings the nib down to the surface—he is writing on the smoother, flesh side—and makes his first stroke. Three short movements, three quick changes of angle and pressure. Without lifting the pen he makes a swift feint to the right, a slower and heavier downward stroke, then a slight release of pressure and another feathery, horizontal feint before the nib is lifted clear: the letter  I, its downstroke topped and tailed by tiny serifs.</p><p>在快速检查示例后，Ser Antonio将尖端带到表面 - 他正在写入更平滑，肉体侧 - 并制作他的第一笔画。三个短暂的运动，角度和压力的三个快速变化。如果没有抬起笔，他就会向右施加迅速，较慢，较重的下行，然后轻微释放压力和另一个羽毛，横向的羽毛，在笔尖上抬起清晰：字母I，它的下游旋转和尾尾的小Serifs。</p><p>  Ser Antonio continues in block capitals, still in red: IN HOC CODICE CONTINENTUR. “This book contains . . .” He is pronouncing the words aloud as he writes, the better to remember them as his eyes move back and forth from the copy text to his parchment. “Three fingers hold the pen,” wrote one scribe, “two eyes see the words, one tongue speaks them, and the whole body labors.”</p><p>  Ser Antonio继续在块首府，仍然是红色：在Hoc Codice Continentur。 “本书包含。 。 。“当他写道时，他会宣扬宣传文字，因为他的眼睛从复制文本来回移动到他的羊皮纸时更好地记住它们。 “三个手指拿着笔，”写了一个抄写员，“两只眼睛看到了这些话，一条舌头说话，而整个身体劳动力。”</p><p>  Ser Antonio works his way down the page, providing the table of contents in red ink. It is a roll call of some of Cicero’s most famous and influential works, such as  Letters to Atticus, rediscovered by Petrarch in Verona in 1345, and the  Orator and  Brutus, both rediscovered more recently in Lodi. Vespasiano probably acquired the exemplars for Ser Antonio from Cosimo de’ Medici, who had copies made for himself in the 1420s. He may also have found them in the library of San Marco, for in 1423 Niccoli copied out both the  Orator and  Brutus in his distinctive script.</p><p>  Ser Antonio在页面下工作，提供红色墨水的目录。这是一个Cicero最着名和有影响力的作品的召唤呼吁，例如到atticus的信件，在1345年在维罗纳的Petrarch重新发现，以及Orator和Brutus，都在洛迪重新发现。 Vespasiano可能收购了来自Cosimo de'Micedi的Ser Antonio的平方例，他在1420年代为自己制作的副本。他也可能在圣马可图书馆找到它们，在1423年，Niccoli在他独特的剧本中复制了演说者和布鲁图斯。</p><p> Ser Antonio completes the contents page and moves on to the next. The quire has been arranged by Vespasiano such that this facing page, the first of the text proper, is also the smoother, flesh side. Flesh sides always face flesh; hair sides always face hair (these are slightly rougher, often lightly stippled from the follicles). Ser Antonio trims a new quill, this time cutting a finer point, then dips the nib into the black ink. After another pen trial he begins writing. The first text is the  Rhetorica ad Herennium, in which Cicero gives his friend Gaius Herennius lessons on how to make a speech</p><p> Ser Antonio完成内容页面并继续下一个。 Quire已经安排了Vespasiano，使这个面对页，第一个文本正确，也是更顺畅，肉体。肉体两侧总是面部肉体;头发侧总是面向毛发（这些稍微粗糙，通常从卵泡上轻轻跳水）。 Ser Antonio修剪一个新的羽毛，这次切割更好的点，然后将笔尖浸入黑色墨水中。在另一支笔审判之后，他开始写作。第一个文字是rhetorica广告牧女，西塞罗给了他的朋友gaius herennius的课程如何发表演讲</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://lithub.com/goatskin-tree-bark-and-one-expensive-scribe-how-the-king-of-the-worlds-booksellers-produced-manuscripts/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Lit%20Hub%20Daily:%20April%2013%2C%202021&utm_term=lithub_master_list">https://lithub.com/goatskin-tree-bark-and-one-expensive-scribe-how-the-king-of-the-worlds-booksellers-produced-manuscripts/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Lit%20Hub%20Daily:%20April%2013%2C%202021&utm_term=lithub_master_list</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/书籍/">#书籍</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/world/">#world</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/羊皮纸/">#羊皮纸</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
