Welcome to PressClub. Today we’ll be discussing the Creator Economy with some incredible guests. We’re joined by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek, and Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke. We’ll be talking about how people can turn their passion into their profession, why platforms are adding more monetization features, and why creators are important to the economy. Let’s jump right in</p><p>    Josh Constine：[00:00:00]大家好，我是你的主持人Josh Constantine。欢迎光临。今天我们将与一些令人难以置信的客人讨论创作者经济。我们加入Facebook首席执行官Mark Zuckerberg，Spotify Ceo Daniel Ek，并购物Ceo TobiLütke。我们将谈论人们如何将激情转变为他们的职业，为什么平台正在增加更多的货币化功能，以及为什么创造者对经济很重要。让我们跳进吧</p><p>   [00:00:07] Josh Constine: [00:00:07] Have you guys ever actually been in the same room together? Cause I feel like it&#39;s special that we can do this on Clubhouse and wrangle everyone&#39;s travel and schedules.</p><p>   [00:00:07] Josh Constine：[00:00:07]你们曾经在同一个房间一起吗？因为我觉得它是＆＃39;我们可以在俱乐部休息和争吵中完成这个问题和＃39;旅行和时间表。 </p><p> [00:00:14] I know Daniel&#39;s in Europe and we can bring everybody together here on this platform when it would probably be pretty difficult to get you all on a physical stage somewhere.</p><p>[00:00:14]我知道丹尼尔＆＃39;在欧洲，我们可以在这个平台上把每个人带到这里，当它可能很难在某个地方的物理舞台上都很困难。</p><p>  [00:00:24]  Tobi Lutke: [00:00:24] I don&#39;t think so. Not all three of us. Yeah, totally agreed. Spontaneous mini conferences are awesome!</p><p>  [00:00:24] Tobi Lutke：[00:00:24]我不这么认为。不是我们三个人。是的，完全同意。自发迷你会议很棒！</p><p> [00:00:32] Josh Constine: [00:00:32] Yeah. I think the last time I saw Mark and Daniel together was at the Spotify 2011 launch party where it was you guys on stage with Snoop Dogg.</p><p> [00:00:32] Josh Constine：[00:00:32]是的。我想我最后一次看到马克和丹尼尔在一起在Spotify 2011发布会上，在那里你是洞穴Dogg的舞台上的人。</p><p> [00:00:40] Mark Zuckerberg: [00:00:40] I think we&#39;ve gotten together a few times since then. I have had the pleasure of getting to work with both of you and your amazing companies and partner with you on a bunch of different things. So over time, so that&#39;s been fun, but this is good. I think there&#39;s so much happening in the creator economy right now. And I think it&#39;ll be awesome to just get a chance to hear how you&#39;re all thinking about it.</p><p> [00:00:40] Mark Zuckerberg：[00:00:40]我觉得从那时起我们举起了几次。我很高兴与您和您的令人惊叹的公司和伴侣一起工作，并在一堆不同的事情上与您合作。所以随着时间的推移，所以它一直很有趣，但这很好。我觉得现在在创造者经济中发生了如此多的事情。而且我认为它＆＃39; ll真棒只是有机会听到你的想法。</p><p> [00:01:02]Daniel, I saw your announcement this morning. I thought it was really neat, the $5 billion in payouts to musicians and all the transparency work that you&#39;re doing. I think it&#39;s really impressive.</p><p> [00:01:02]丹尼尔今天早上看了你的宣布。我以为它真的很整洁，发给音乐家的50亿美元和你的所有透明度工作，你＆＃39;再做。我认为它＆＃39非常令人印象深刻。</p><p> [00:01:15]  Daniel Ek: [00:01:15] Yeah. Thanks. It was a long time coming, but I think it was the time to unveil this to the world and show the progress and also show the depth of the creator community that exists on Spotify.</p><p> [00:01:15]丹尼尔ek：[00:01:15]是的。谢谢。这是很长一段时间来的，但我认为现在是时候向世界推出这一点，并展示了在Spotify上存在的创造者社区的深度。</p><p> [00:01:27]I was super excited to share that and it&#39;s been fun to see over the course of the day, all the reactions from the community and everyone else around it.</p><p> [00:01:27]我非常兴奋地分享它，它一直很有趣，在一天的过程中，所有来自社区和其他人的反应。 </p><p> [00:01:38]  Josh Constine: [00:01:38] So one thing I love about the creator economy is remix culture and the fact that everybody can weigh in, they don&#39;t need to have all the creativity, they can just add a caption or a new spin on a joke.</p><p>[00:01:38] Josh Constine：[00:01:38]所以我喜欢创造者经济的一件事是混合文化，事实上，每个人都可以体重，他们不需要拥有所有的创造力，他们只能在笑话上添加标题或新旋转。</p><p> [00:01:49] And I feel like you guys have actually been the subject of a fair amount of memes. Maybe you in particular Mark, between your Capitol Hill appearances and e-foiling on that cool surf board of yours. Mark, do you have any sort of response to the memes that you see about you or is there a favorite one of yours?</p><p> [00:01:49]我觉得你们实际上是一个相当数量的模因的主题。也许你特别是标记，你的国会山在你的那个凉爽的冲浪板上的山顶上的出场和电子发泡。 Mark，你对你看到你的模因有什么样的回应，还是有一个你最喜欢的东西？</p><p> [00:02:04] Mark Zuckerberg: [00:02:04] I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t take it too seriously. I think probably if I had to go with a favorite and I think it&#39;s got to be “ smoking meats”. I do love grilling and cooking and that was silly and I appreciate that everyone enjoys it.</p><p> [00:02:04] Mark Zuckerberg：[00:02:04]我不知道。我不太认真对待它。我想如果我不得不带着一个喜欢的话，我认为它＆＃39必须是“吸烟”。我喜欢烧烤和烹饪，那很傻，我很欣赏每个人都喜欢它。</p><p>  [00:02:23] And you and your Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s hot sauce. I feel like if you ever quit your job as Facebook CEO, you have a great sponsorship deal lined up for them.</p><p>  [00:02:23]你和你的甜蜜宝贝射线＆＃39;辣酱。我觉得如果你辞去了你的工作作为Facebook首席执行官，你就有一个伟大的赞助交易为他们排队。</p><p> [00:02:31] Okay. So one thing that I wanted to bring into the discussion of the creator economy is the NFT culture, which is on the massive rise right now. And for that, we did something a little bit special today.</p><p> [00:02:31]好的。所以我想进入创造者经济的讨论的一件事是NFT文化，现在正在大幅上升。为此，我们今天做了一点点特别。</p><p> [00:02:41]I had this idea of that wanting to do live portraits of the speakers that come on our show, PressClub. And so I want to present you guys with a portrait that I&#39;ve worked on with my incredible friend  fnnch, an absolutely amazing painter. And if you click on Fnnch who&#39;s on the screen right now, you&#39;ll see  this portrait that he has made especially for you guys right now featuring you in his iconic honey bear style.</p><p> [00:02:41]我有这个想法想要做我们的节目中的扬声器的现场肖像，按CLUB。所以我想向你带着一个＆＃39;在我令人难以置信的朋友FNNCH工作，这是一个绝对惊人的画家的肖像。如果你点击屏幕上的fnnch＆＃39; s＆＃39; ll看到这个肖像，他特别为你们为你们提供了他的标志性蜂蜜熊风格。</p><p> [00:03:03]We&#39;d love to have fnnch to say hi and talk about it for one second.</p><p> [00:03:03]我们＆＃39;喜欢有FNNCH说嗨并谈谈一秒钟。 </p><p> [00:03:07]  fnnch: [00:03:07] Hi there. Thank you so much. So yeah, I&#39;m a street artist in San Francisco and I focus mainly on public art. But I  also do fine arts. This collab is the first NFT that I&#39;m gonna do. Josh has invited me to do an artwork for this event and I don&#39;t do human portraiture, but I paint a lot of honey bears.</p><p>[00:03:07] FNNCH：[00:03:07]你好。太感谢了。所以是的，我是旧金山的街道艺术家，我主要专注于公共艺术。但我也做美术。这位同伴是我＆＃39; m的第一个nft。乔什邀请我为这次活动做艺术品，我不做人类的肖像画，但我画了很多蜂蜜熊。</p><p> [00:03:23] And so I made a honey bear for Mark, Daniel, and Toby, and you see the digital version in my profile, and then I&#39;m actually gonna live paint an actual canvas that will come with the NFT, throughout the event. I really wanted to thank all three of you for your work. I am a creator, obviously.</p><p> [00:03:23]所以我制作了一个蜂蜜熊的标记，丹尼尔和托比，你看到了我的个人资料中的数字版本，然后在我的个人资料中看到了数字版本，然后我＆＃39; m实际上会涂上一个实际的画布整个事件中的nft。我真的想感谢你们三个人的工作。我是一个明显的创造者。</p><p> [00:03:38]I run my entire business through Shopify, everything from inventory to shipping it&#39;s really all centered there. And then I use Instagram really extensively it&#39;s where all the visual artists hang out and share their work. And then I love music, like a lot of people. So thank you all so much.</p><p> [00:03:38]我通过Shopify来运行我的整个业务，从库存到运送它，所有人都以其为中心。然后我使用Instagram非常广泛地＆＃39;所有视觉艺术家闲逛并分享他们的工作。然后我喜欢音乐，就像很多人一样。所以谢谢你们这么多。</p><p>   [00:03:56]  Mark Zuckerberg: [00:03:56] Yeah, I&#39;ve followed your work for a while and I just love the style of what you&#39;re doing. Daniel, do you actually play guitar?</p><p>   [00:03:56] Mark Zuckerberg：[00:03:56]是的，我举行了一段时间，我只是喜欢你和＃39的样式。丹尼尔，你真的弹吉他吗？</p><p> [00:04:04]  Daniel Ek: [00:04:04] Yeah, I do. So this was pretty fitting. I love the work too, so this is great. I&#39;m going to try to see if I can get get the NFT version of this one, for sure.</p><p> [00:04:04]丹尼尔ek：[00:04:04]是的，我这样做。所以这是非常适合的。我也喜欢这项工作，所以这很棒。我会试着看看我是否可以获得这一个的NFT版本，肯定。</p><p> [00:04:15]  Tobi Lutke: [00:04:15] Yeah. Is this a reference to the Silicon Valley? Honey bear scene.</p><p> [00:04:15] Tobi Lutke：[00:04:15]是的。这是对硅谷的参考吗？蜂蜜熊场面。</p><p> [00:04:21]  Josh Constine: [00:04:21] I actually haven&#39;t watched the show. I found that it hit too close to home.</p><p> [00:04:21] Josh Constine：[00:04:21]我实际上没有看过节目。我发现它达到了太近的家。 </p><p> [00:04:28]  Tobi Lutke: [00:04:28] I might have wanted to be in Canada. I can look at it from a distance.</p><p>[00:04:28] Tobi Lutke：[00:04:28]我可能希望在加拿大。我可以从远处看看它。</p><p> [00:04:33]  Josh Constine: [00:04:33] Amazing. Thank you so much for doing this work. If you guys are interested in this work, we just put the  NFT up for auction on foundation.app.</p><p> [00:04:33] Josh Constine：[00:04:33]惊人。非常感谢你做这项工作。如果你们对这项工作感兴趣，我们就把nft拿出来拍卖.App.app。</p><p> [00:04:41]The links in my profile and fnnch’s profile, and we&#39;re giving 20% to the  US COVID relief fund from GiveDirectly, which is one of our favorite charities that really does incredible work on making sure that money makes an impact. So check that out. We&#39;ll be talking about it a little bit later at the end of the show, but thanks.</p><p> [00:04:41]我的个人资料和FNNCH的个人资料中的链接，以及我们＆＃39;从Givedirectent授予美国Covid救济基金，这是我们最喜欢的慈善机构之一，真正做出令人难以置信的工作金钱产生了影响。所以检查出来。我们＆＃39; LL在演出结束后稍后会谈论它，但谢谢。</p><p> [00:04:55] I want to get into our first real topic: the creator economy. You guys are powering these platforms where so many creators have built their audience and are starting to monetize their audience. I would love to just get like a quick overview, that big picture vision of why you think the creator economy is blowing up right now and what this means for culture.</p><p> [00:04:55]我想进入我们的第一个真实主题：创造者经济。你们在那里为这些平台推动了这么多创造者建立了他们的观众，并开始将他们的受众批准。我很想像快速概述一样，这是你认为创造者经济的为什么要吹掉的大局愿景，以及这对文化意味着什么。</p><p> [00:05:15] Mark Zuckerberg: [00:05:15] Yeah, sure. Yeah I think we all hope that in the future the economy is one where everyone can pursue their interests and their creativity and can have jobs that are more exciting for them. So the question is just how do you build out the economic models to basically support all of that?</p><p> [00:05:15] Mark Zuckerberg：[00:05:15]是的，肯定。是的，我认为我们都希望将来，经济是每个人都能追求他们的兴趣和创造力的人，并且可以拥有对他们更令人兴奋的工作。所以问题只是你如何建立经济模式，基本上支持所有这些？</p><p> [00:05:37] And, I&#39;m really excited to hear what Daniel and Toby have to say too, but, a lot of this is, there are gonna be a lot of tools that need to get built. The creator economy goes across, all of these different types of content, right? So it&#39;s not just musicians and people are creating videos and online content.</p><p> [00:05:37]而且，我真的很高兴听到丹尼尔和托比不得不说的话，但是，很多这很多，都有很多工具需要建造。创作者经济跨越，所有这些不同类型的内容，对吗？所以它＆＃39;不仅仅是音乐家和人们正在创造视频和在线内容。</p><p> [00:05:55]I think a lot of journalism and long-form writing fits into this. A lot of gaming I think increasingly fits into this to some extent. There&#39;s a lot of physical goods and creativity that people are able to enable and start businesses around.</p><p> [00:05:55]我觉得很多新闻业和长形的写作都适合这个。很多游戏，我认为在一定程度上越来越适合这一点。有很多物理和创造力，人们能够启用和启动业务。 </p><p> [00:06:10]One of my favorite little kind of stories from throughout the pandemic is, there&#39;s this restaurant that, that I loved in San Francisco, and during COVID they basically transitioned their business model to a dumpling subscription service. And it&#39;s like, all right, it&#39;s super creative.</p><p>[00:06:10]我在整个大流行中最喜欢的小型故事是，在那里，这家餐厅在旧金山和科威特期间，他们基本上将他们的商业模式转变为饺子订阅服务。它和＃39; s喜欢，好的，它的超级创意。</p><p> [00:06:30] And the tools for being able to supply this were basically being built on top on of the internet by a bunch of these platforms. And I think it&#39;s just really exciting. And, Daniel, inyour keynote recently, you talked about this goal.</p><p> [00:06:30]并且可以通过一堆这些平台基本上建立在互联网上的顶部。我认为它真的很令人兴奋。而且，丹尼尔最近，你谈了这个目标。</p><p> [00:06:46] To basically be able to get support a million people who are creators as full-time jobs on Spotify. And, I think if we can all do that together, musicians can do that, but you also have small business creators coming up with creative different ideas to create new business models around journalism and long-form writing videos, people doing all kinds of different entertainment.</p><p> [00:06:46]基本上能够得到一百万人，他们是创造者作为Spotify的全职工作。而且，我认为如果我们能够在一起，音乐家可以做到这一点，但你也有小企业创造者，迎来了创造性的不同想法，以创造新的商业模式，并在新闻和长形写入视频中创造新的商业模式，人们做各种不同的人娱乐。</p><p> [00:07:10]I just think that this is so important for having a broad-based and stable economy. That&#39;s inspiring over time. And that&#39;s a lot of what we&#39;ve been excited about.  I talk a lot about small businesses and Facebook and we have about 200 million businesses that use our products.</p><p> [00:07:10]我认为这对于拥有广泛和稳定的经济来说这是如此重要。随着时间的推移，＆＃39;那个＆＃39;我们很兴奋的东西。我对小型企业和Facebook谈了很多，我们拥有大约200万业务，使用我们的产品。</p><p> [00:07:25] The vast majority of them are small businesses who use our products for free. And we don&#39;t have an exact accounting yet of how many creators. In addition to the small businesses that are on the platforms, we think it&#39;s probably around a similar amount that&#39;s people who are basically using their personality as their brand and they&#39;re using these services in order to either grow their influence or monetize their community and as a job.</p><p> [00:07:25]绝大多数是自由用产品的小企业。我们没有精确的会计尚未有多少创作者。除了在平台上的小企业，我们认为它可能是at＆＃39; s的at＆＃39;基本上使用他们的个性作为他们的品牌和他们＆＃39;重新使用这些服务要么使他们的影响或货币化，要么是他们的社区，要么是一份工作。</p><p> [00:07:49] And, I think over the coming years it will have to evolve. So that way a large percent of these folks can basically make a full-time living through this. And I think that&#39;s just going to be super inspiring.</p><p> [00:07:49]而且，我想到了未来几年它必须发展。这样，这些人中的大量百分之一是基本上可以通过这个完成全职的生活。我认为这只是超级鼓舞人心。</p><p> [00:07:59] Josh Constine: [00:07:59] That&#39;s awesome. Yeah. I think the idea of helping people turn their passion into their profession is so critical because there&#39;s a lot of people that don&#39;t want to have a traditional office job anymore.</p><p> [00:07:59] Josh Constine：[00:07:59]那＆＃39;太棒了。是的。我认为帮助人们对他们的职业激情的想法是如此批评，因为有很多人不再想要传统的办公室工作了。 </p><p> [00:08:08] And when you ask, I think it&#39;s 30% of elementary school kids, they want to be influencers. It&#39;s beaten out being an astronaut or a fireman. And I think that&#39;s a really important and pretty sizable shift in not just popular culture, but where we see ourselves in terms of occupations.</p><p>[00:08:08]当你问，我觉得它＆＃39;他们是小学生的30％，他们希望成为影响者。它＆＃39;被遗弃为宇航员或消防员。而且我认为这是一个非常重要，也是一个非常重要的，并且不仅仅是流行的文化，而是我们在职业方面看到自己。</p><p> [00:08:26]Daniel, I would love to hear your sort of bigger picture thoughts on the creator economy right now.</p><p> [00:08:26]丹尼尔，我很想听到你对创造者经济的更大的画面思想。</p><p> [00:08:31]  Daniel Ek: [00:08:31] Yeah. This is something we talked about just very recently, like Mark spoke about too. And our view just in the space of audio just a few years ago, we had about 3 million creators on our platform.</p><p> [00:08:31]丹尼尔ek：[00:08:31]是的。这是我们最近谈过的东西，就像马克也谈到了这一点。而我们的观点在几年前就在音频的空间中，我们的平台上有了大约300万的创作者。</p><p> [00:08:45] And today that number&#39;s over 8 million and we&#39;ve said by 2025, we think of will grow to about 50 million creators. So just the explosion of the people who want to be creative and who are expressing themselves through music, through podcasting, through audio, it&#39;s just staggering. And what&#39;s fascinating to me as we spoke about, is this notion about making it so that more of these people can live off of their passion and live off of their art that they&#39;re creating.</p><p> [00:08:45]今天在2025年之前说了超过800万元的数字，我们认为将增加到大约5000万的创造者。所以只是爆炸的人，他们想要创造性，谁通过音乐表达自己，通过播客，通过音频，它＆＃39;只是惊人的。当我们发言时，令我迷人的是，这是关于使它的概念，使其更多这些人可以从他们的艺术中实现他们的艺术，他们创造。</p><p> [00:09:17] And what&#39;s interesting, I feel is that it&#39;s very much of an omni-channel expression by these creators. So it used to be before that, if you were a musician, as an example, you just put out music. That was the thing that you were doing. But almost every successful creator now is omni-talented and in omni-channels.</p><p> [00:09:17]和什么＆＃39;很有趣，我觉得是它的那种创造者非常频道的全部通道表达。所以它曾经在那之前，如果你是一名音乐家，就像一个例子一样，你刚抛出音乐。那是你在做的事情。但几乎每个成功的创造者现在都是全天性的和全渠道。</p><p> [00:09:42] That means that they are on YouTube putting up videos. They are on Instagram. They are perhaps putting together brands and putting it on Shopify, but they&#39;re also putting out music and merchandise on Shopify and music on Spotify, of course, and touring. And so they&#39;re really just doing a multitude of different things and connecting with their fan bases across many different platforms.</p><p> [00:09:42]这意味着它们是在youtube上投入视频。他们在Instagram上。他们也许是汇集品牌并将其放在购物中，但他们在Spotify的Shopify和Music上放出音乐和商品，当然和旅行。因此，他们真的只是在许多不同的平台上做了多种不同的东西并与他们的风扇基础连接。</p><p> [00:10:05] And so I think it&#39;s a super, super interesting early stage, but there&#39;s a lot of friction still of being a creator and managing your fan base across all of these different platforms that I think will be considerably easier in the coming years. And even this distinction between what a casual fan is and what a super fan is, I think will dramatically change in the coming years.</p><p> [00:10:05]所以我认为它＆＃39; SA超级，超级有趣的早期阶段，但是在那里＆＃39; SA很多摩擦仍然是一个创造者，并管理你的粉丝围绕所有这些不同的平台。我想象在未来几年将相当容易。甚至这种休闲风扇是什么区别，以及超级粉丝是什么，我认为未来几年会发生巨大的变化。 </p><p> [00:10:27]  Josh Constine: [00:10:27] I think musicians have historically made a lot of their money from those biggest fans, the ones willing to buy those front row ticket packages, those collectors items like signed guitars. We&#39;d love to hear maybe just quickly, how you think about Spotify letting creators and musicians drive that deeper monetization because a fraction of a cent per stream, it adds up at a big volume, but every creator has some super loyal, hardcore fans that would love to get behind them in an even bigger way.</p><p>[00:10:27] Josh Constine：[00:10:27]我认为音乐家历来从那些最大的粉丝们历史上赚了很多钱，愿意购买那些前排票套餐的那些收藏品如签名吉他这样的收藏品。我们＆＃39; D很快听到了很快，你如何考虑Spotify让创造者和音乐家驾驶那种更深层次的货币化，因为每条流的一小部分，它以大量增加，但每个创造者都有一些超级忠诚，顽固的粉丝们喜欢以更大的方式落后于它们。</p><p> [00:10:54] I know you guys have started to sell merch and concert tickets, but any thoughts on going deeper there around, meet and greets, live events or anything like that?</p><p> [00:10:54]我知道你们已经开始卖Merch和音乐会门票，但有任何关于在周围更深入的想法，见面和迎接，活事件或那样的东西？</p><p> [00:11:02] Daniel Ek: [00:11:02] Yeah. I think we&#39;re still in the early days of creating deeper fan engagement between creators and fans.</p><p> [00:11:02]丹尼尔ek：[00:11:02]是的。我认为我们仍然在创造创造者和粉丝之间创造更深层次的粉丝参与的早期。</p><p> [00:11:10] And it&#39;s definitely a sort of big theme that we&#39;re investing behind. And as you said, I think when I look at streaming, the early innings were all about just access and just having access to the content and moving more and more of these minutes that was being spent in traditional offline radio or broadcast radio on to online on demand.</p><p> [00:11:10]和它＆＃39;肯定是我们投资的一种大主题。正如你所说，我认为当我看着流媒体时，早期的局都是关于只获取的，只是访问内容并移动越来越多的这些分钟​​，这些分钟是在传统的离线无线电或广播收音机上在线度过的一经请求。</p><p> [00:11:31] And as, as more and more people now have started doing that. And we have hundreds of millions of people around the world that are streaming music every single day. The engagement profile means that we are creating a lot of fans and we&#39;re creating a lot of super fans too. So far music has been a one size fits all where we&#39;ve just monetized it through the streaming revenues in itself.</p><p> [00:11:31]如越来越多的人现在已经开始这样做了。我们在世界各地的数亿人中每天都有媒体音乐。订婚档案意味着我们正在创造大量的粉丝和我们＆＃39;重新创造了很多超级粉丝。到目前为止，音乐一直是一种尺寸适合我们的所有＆＃39; ve刚刚将其货币化通过流媒体收入本身。</p><p> [00:11:56] And you had to, as a creator, figure out how to monetize that fan base off of other platforms. But I think the future is that we will become a lot better at monetizing your fans and your super fans, even on Spotify. And I like to think and hope that platforms like Shopify and others can then interact with Spotify.</p><p> [00:11:56]你必须是一个创造者，弄清楚如何将粉丝归咎于其他平台。但我认为未来的是，即使在Spotify也会在货币化粉丝和超级粉丝时变得更好。我喜欢思考，并希望像Shopify和其他人一样的平台可以与Spotify进行互动。</p><p> [00:12:18]And likewise, you can have Spotify content beyond Instagram or Facebook in order to drive that 360 experience.</p><p> [00:12:18]而且同样，您可以通过Instagram或Facebook的Spotify内容来推动360体验。 </p><p> [00:12:27]  Josh Constine: [00:12:27] Yeah, I think that mirrors exactly what  SignalFire, the venture fund, where I work, we did this  big research project on the creator economy. And what we found was that over 50 million people are now starting to make money off of their creations.</p><p>[00:12:27] Josh Constine：[00:12:27]是的，我认为这恰好镜子究竟是什么信号，我们工作的风险基金，我们在创造商经济上做了这一大型研究项目。我们发现的是，超过5000万人现在开始赚钱。</p><p> [00:12:37] But one of the biggest trends there is people moving their fans off of the biggest social platforms and onto things like Shopify. Tobi, would love to hear your opinion on how that trend is playing out now as creators don&#39;t just want likes or clicks, they want actual profits and to be able to support themselves with their passion.</p><p> [00:12:37]但是最大的趋势之一是人们将粉丝摆脱最大的社交平台，以及商店等事情。托比，很想听到你对现在趋势如何扮演的意见，因为创造者不要只想要喜欢或点击，他们希望实际利润并能够支持自己的激情。</p><p> [00:12:58]  Tobi Lutke: [00:12:58] Yeah. Yeah. I think the I think it&#39;s overstated that people make like a choice or want to move people from one place to another. Look, I think I&#39;ve been really inspired by Kevin Kelly, who wrote an essay about  one thousand true fans maybe 15 years ago or something like that.</p><p> [00:12:58] Tobi Lutke：[00:12:58]是的。是的。我认为我认为它夸大了人们，人们像一个选择或想要将人从一个地方移到另一个地方。看，我觉得我真的受到了凯文凯利的灵感，他在15年前或类似的东西写了一篇关于一千个真实球迷的文章。</p><p> [00:13:16] And I find it&#39;s really, it&#39;s such a wonderful vision for the internet. I tend to think of the internet as the biggest city in the world, right? Now billions of people are on it. And I think what Daniel is doing so successfully and other websites are doing is that they&#39;re doing well on Instagram, and then all of a sudden, it allows people to find the thousand fans, and do so directly. And I think that&#39;s a very different environment than what it was before. In retail, we&#39;ve always had a lot of gatekeeping. There were limited chances. Which meant that the kinds of products that were created had to be very sanitized and have very broad appeal for just logistical reasons. And so I think what&#39;s been so amazing is now that just a lot more people can participate and much, much more specific products are being created because it&#39;s so efficient to find the people who really, really like the things that you have to offer.</p><p> [00:13:16]我发现它真的，它真的，＆＃39;这是互联网这样一个美妙的愿景。我倾向于认为互联网成为世界上最大的城市，对吧？现在数十亿人在上面。我认为丹尼尔正在做的事情如此成功，其他网站正在做的是他们在Instagram上做得很好，然后突然，它允许人们找到千球迷，直接这样做。而且我认为这个＆＃39;是一个非常不同的环境，而不是之前的环境。在零售业中，我们总是有很多看法。有限的机会。这意味着创造的产品的种类必须非常消毒，并且仅适用于后勤原因非常广泛的吸引力。所以我认为这是什么令人惊叹的是，现在只有很多人可以参加和更多，更有特定的产品是创造的，因为它如此高效地找到真正的人，真的很喜欢您必须提供的事情。</p><p> [00:14:28] And what&#39;s interesting in this way is that almost all the people that I&#39;m talking to you&#39;re right there, they are doing this multi-channel. But they, again, they&#39;re going direct for each of these channels. They managed to figure out where the people will want the particular thing that they are making.</p><p> [00:14:28]以及以这种方式有趣的是，几乎所有的人都和你说话的人和＃39;在那里说话，他们正在做这个多频道。但是，他们再次，他们会为每个渠道进行指导。他们设法弄清楚人们希望他们正在制作的特定事物。</p><p> [00:14:48]And this is such a positive situation. It creates these businesses. It creates employment, especially people who have managed to find more than a thousand true fans. And it&#39;s a huge factor for the economy. It&#39;s super exciting. And it&#39;s a lot more participatory than I think what&#39;s come before.</p><p> [00:14:48]这是如此积极的情况。它创造了这些业务。它创造了就业，尤其是已经设法找到了超过一千名真实球迷的人。它和＃39;经济的一个巨大因素。它＆＃39; s超级令人兴奋。和它＆＃39;比我想到的更多参与性。</p><p>  [00:15:10]  Mark Zuckerberg: [00:15:10] And one thing that I’d like to add is, I think that people want a lot of different ways that they can monetize and support themselves off of their art or whatever the work is that they&#39;re doing. So it&#39;s important that people have all of these tools.</p><p>  [00:15:10] Mark Zuckerberg：或者任何工作是他们＆＃39;重新做。所以它＆＃39;人们拥有所有这些工具。 </p><p> [00:15:25]Artists are gonna want to directly monetize their art through things like Spotify. They&#39;ll want tools to be able to give fans more specific access. They&#39;ll want to sell merchandise and different goods that either that they create or that they curate.</p><p>[00:15:25]艺术家会想直接通过Spotify这样的事情将他们的艺术批准。它们＆＃39; ll希望工具能够为粉丝提供更具体的访问。他们想要出售商品和不同的商品，他们创造或纠正它们。</p><p> [00:15:41]And that&#39;s where all the commerce stuff comes in. And that’s not only on Shopify, but also on the commerce work that we&#39;re doing a lot of that we&#39;re doing in partnership with Shopify. But you&#39;re also seeing stuff like tipping online. We have this product “Stars” that basically just allows people to tip game streamers on Facebook who they like, and that&#39;s contributed to Facebook having much more effective monetization for game streamers than I think any of the other leading platforms out there.</p><p> [00:15:41]而且所有商务的东西都进来了。这不仅是在购物，而且在商业工作中，我们＆＃39;重新做了很多我们＆＃39;重新与Shopify做伙伴关系。但是你也看到了在线提示的东西。我们拥有这个产品“明星”，基本上只允许人们在他们喜欢的Facebook上提示游戏流乐者，而且＆＃39;这对Facebook贡献了比游戏流杂志更有效的货币化，而不是我认为任何其他领先的平台。</p><p> [00:16:12]So a lot of game streamers are coming over to our tools for that. And it&#39;s just interesting because I think overall it&#39;s not like one model is going to work. It&#39;s not just like everyone is going to be able to make enough money off of an ads revenue share or something like that. But I think the 360 view of having all of these things really is going to support.</p><p> [00:16:12]所以很多游戏垃圾圈都会到达我们的工具。而且它只是有趣的，因为我认为整体＆＃39;不像一个模特将要上班。它不仅仅像每个人都将能够从广告收入份额或类似的东西中赚取足够的钱。但我认为拥有所有这些事情的360观点真的要支持。</p><p> [00:16:31] tens of millions of people in order to be able to do these kinds of creative pursuits and just do amazing stuff. Yeah. I can wrap there.</p><p> [00:16:31]数百万人，以便能够做这些创造性的追求，只是做惊人的东西。是的。我可以包裹在那里。</p><p> [00:16:39]  Josh Constine: [00:16:39] Mark, I want to rewind. So you guys have been around for 15 years now. if you go back in time 10 years and think about how you were working with creators then, is there anything that you would change?</p><p> [00:16:39] Josh Constine：[00:16:39]标记，我想倒带。所以你们现在已经过了15年了。如果你回到10年，并考虑你是如何与创造者合作的话，那么你会改变什么吗？</p><p> [00:17:04] Mark Zuckerberg: [00:17:04] I think it&#39;s that we have a somewhat different kind of heritage of how we got here, right? If you take a co</p><p> [00:17:04] Mark Zuckerberg：[00:17:04]我认为我们有点不同的遗产我们在这里如何，对吗？如果你拿一个co</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel">https://constine.substack.com/p/pressclub-with-mark-zuckerberg-daniel</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/facebook/">#facebook</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ceo/">#ceo</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/创造者/">#创造者</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
