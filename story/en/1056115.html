The  SF Bay Area and  Silicon Valley are two of the most polluted regions in the entire country, yet the paperwork often appears to be rushed through to build residences on toxic soil and groundwater.</p><p>今天旁边发生了另一种流行病 - 它是一个爆发毒性陆地和洛杉矶童话的新住房发展爆发。 SF湾区和硅谷是整个国家最受污染的两个地区，但文书工作常常急于通过建造有毒土壤和地下水的住宅。</p><p> In some cases, there are claims the data was manipulated or ignored to reduce expenses and shorten project timelines. Some of these approvals and subsequent lawsuits include  Hunters Point,  Treasure Island,  Point Isabel and the  Richmond Zeneca site.</p><p> 在某些情况下，有声称数据被操纵或忽略以减少费用和缩短项目时间表。其中一些批准和随后的诉讼包括猎人点，金银岛，点伊莎贝尔和里士满Zeneca网站。</p><p> While much recent media coverage has focused on the development of these future residential sites, one looming question remains open: What happens if these sites are approved with inadequate remediation plans and the residents experience health issues due to the hazardous materials?</p><p> 虽然最近的媒体覆盖范围都集中于这些未来住宅地点的发展，但一个迫在眉睫的问题仍然开放：如果这些网站被批准，居民因危险物质而经历卫生问题，则会发生这种情况会发生什么？</p><p> I moved into a new apartment complex, the  Santa Clara Square Apartments, in February 2020. I was living on a remediation site but didn’t know it until I was so sick that I thought I could be dying. Over the next seven months, I proceeded to live out the nightmare many feared following the bare-bones clean-up plans for sites like Hunters Point and Zeneca.</p><p> 我搬进了一家新的公寓大楼，Santa Clara Square Apartments，于2020年2月。我生活在一个修复网站上，但直到我觉得如此恶心，我以为我可能会死亡。在接下来的七个月里，我前往噩梦中的噩梦，许多人担心的噩梦，在猎人点和Zeneca等网站上的裸露清理计划。</p><p> After I realized the site could be causing my mystery illness, I hit brick wall after brick wall trying to get help. I expect none of the current residents actually know what they’re sitting on or what happened to me. I want to change that. I also want to shed light on the systemic failures I discovered and the extent that financial interests appear to be prioritized over public health by those in charge of these sites.</p><p> 在我意识到该网站可能会导致我的神秘疾病，我在砖墙试图得到帮助后击中砖墙。我期待目前的居民都不知道他们坐在什么或发生在我身上。我想改变这个。我还想在我发现的系统失败中阐明光线，以及负责这些网站负责人在公共卫生方面优先考虑的程度。</p><p>   This apartment complex had no physical or written appearance of danger from chemicals, other than a brief and vague note about the presence of “agricultural chemicals” buried towards the end of the “Resident Handbook.” Though I was in good health, I began experiencing chest pain, dizzy spells, palpitations and weakness within days of moving into my new apartment.</p><p>   这间公寓综合体没有从化学品的危险的身体或书面外观，除了关于“农业化学品”埋在“居民手册”结束的情况下的简短和含糊不清。虽然我身体健康，但我开始在进入我的新公寓时经历胸痛，头晕，心悸和虚弱。</p><p> I feared the worst and headed to the emergency room. Over the next few weeks, my condition only worsened, with bizarre muscle numbness and spasms and the onset of daily near-fainting spells where I would get so dizzy that I would have to immediately lie down, sometimes for hours, before I could regain balance.</p><p> 我担心最糟糕的是，前往急诊室。在接下来的几周内，我的病情只会恶化，伴有奇异的肌肉麻木和痉挛，每日接近昏厥的咒语，我会得到如此晕眩的咒语，我必须立即躺下，有时候几个小时，在我恢复平衡之前。 </p><p> I spoke with dozens of doctors who performed extensive testing to try to identify the cause of my sudden and worsening cardiac and neurological issues. The doctors were perplexed. While the tests showed my blood pressure, heart rate and other vitals were abnormal, no tests or imaging could identify why.</p><p>我与数十名医生交谈过，他们进行了广泛的测试，试图确定我突然和恶化的心脏病和神经问题的原因。医生很困惑。虽然测试表明我的血压，心率和其他生命值异常，但没有测试或成像可以识别原因。</p><p>  My doctors screened me for all sorts of severe, permanent and often fatal illnesses. The symptoms were so debilitating and unpredictable that I felt I had no control over my body. I really thought I could be dying.</p><p>  我的医生筛选了我的各种严重，永久性，往往致命的疾病。症状是如此衰弱，不可预测，我觉得我没有控制我的身体。我真的以为我可以垂死。</p><p> I bought books on coping with terminal illness; notified friends of the location of my will and power of attorney documentation. I slept with my phone by my bed in case I had to call 911 in the middle of the night. I was utterly terrified.</p><p> 我在应对终端疾病时购买了书籍;通知了我的意志和律师文件力量的朋友。我的床上用手机睡了，以防我在半夜拨打911。我完全吓坏了。</p><p> I spent the next six months on medical leave and disability, contemplating what my future would hold. I work full time as a program manager while attending law school to become a public interest attorney. But faced with an apparent severe long-term disability or even a fatal illness, I had to consider if I needed to quit my job and drop out of school – and what that would mean for my future.</p><p> 我花了未来六个月的医疗休假和残疾，考虑到我的未来将持有什么。我在参加法学院成为一个计划经理的全职工作，成为一个公共利益律师。但面对明显的严重长期残疾甚至致命的疾病，如果我需要辞掉工作并从学校辍学 - 以及我的未来意味着什么。</p><p> In September 2020 I stumbled upon the first hint of what was actually happening to me. At that time, the wildfires were burning and smoky air covered the Bay Area. I have asthma, so I tried to weatherproof my apartment, blocking all outside air from entering and running air purifiers.</p><p> 2020年9月，我偶然发现了第一次暗示我在我身上实际发生的事情。那时，野火燃烧，烟雾弥漫的空气覆盖了湾区。我有哮喘，所以我试图防晒公寓，阻挡所有外部空气进入和运行空气净化器。</p><p> My indoor air quality monitors showed low particulate levels and everything looked great. However, shortly after, I started getting nosebleeds and hallucinations. I’d wake up almost every night thinking there were massive earthquakes shaking my bed.</p><p> 我的室内空气质量监测器显示出低的颗粒水平，一切看起来很棒。但是，不久之后，我开始获得流鼻血和幻觉。我几乎每天晚上都醒来，思考有巨大的地震摇晃我的床。</p><p> A friend suggested I check if carbon monoxide might be causing hallucinations. I checked a new, more advanced air quality monitor and, to my surprise, the monitor showed very high levels of something called “tVOCs.” I didn’t know what that meant, but I noticed something compelling.</p><p> 一位朋友建议我检查一氧化碳可能导致幻觉是否会导致幻觉。我检查了一个新的更先进的空气质量监视器，并令我惊讶的是，监视器显示出很高的含量称为“TVOC”。我不知道这意味着什么，但我注意到了一些引人注目的事情。 </p><p>  One of my most bizarre symptoms since moving in was waking up every few weeks exactly at 3 a.m. and feeling like I was choking and going to vomit. When I looked, the “tVOCs” on my monitor spiked exactly at 3 a.m. I also noticed the tVOCs seemed to rise and fall at different times of the day when I was having the worst symptoms. I began to think that there was an important correlation between this data and my symptoms.</p><p>我最奇怪的症状之一，自上午3点凌晨3点醒来，感觉我正在窒息并呕吐。当我看时，我的显示器上的“TVOCS”完全凌晨3点飙升。我也注意到触控者似乎在我有最糟糕的症状时在一天的不同时间上升和下降。我开始认为这种数据与我的症状之间存在重要的相关性。</p><p>  I spent the next few days buying more air quality monitors for additional data points, all of which showed high levels of tVOCs, rising and falling. I contacted my property manager, Irvine Company, about my concerns. Irvine Company knew I had been sick and was also helping me investigate the “earthquakes.”</p><p>  我花了接下来的几天购买了更多的空气质量监视器，以获得更多数据点，所有这些都显示出高水平的TVOC，上升和跌倒。我联系了我的财产经理Irvine公司，了解我的担忧。 Irvine公司知道我生病了，也有助于我调查“地震”。</p><p> I told them about the high tVOCs and that I thought it could be causing my health issues and the earthquake hallucinations. I asked them to investigate, but they refused to help.</p><p> 我告诉他们高TVOC，我认为它可能会导致我的健康问题和地震幻觉。我要求他们调查，但他们拒绝提供帮助。</p><p> Within a few days, I learned that  Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are high vapor pressure compounds emitted as gases, and “tVOCs” are the total amount of VOCs present in a certain location. I learned from reading government documentation that unexpectedly high levels of tVOCs, especially when their emissions fluctuate, can be caused by something called “ vapor intrusion,” which is when solvents and other hazardous materials are in the ground – soil or water – and as they evaporate, the vapors rise up and “intrude” into buildings.</p><p> 在几天之内，我了解到，挥发性有机化合物（VOC）是作为气体发射的高蒸汽压力化合物，“TVOCS”是某个位置存在的VOC的总量。我从阅读政府文件中学到的，即意外的高级TVOC，特别是当他们的排放量波动时，可能是由称为“蒸汽侵入”的东西引起的，这是溶剂和其他有害物质在地面或水中时 - 以及它们蒸发，蒸气升起并“侵入”到建筑物中。</p><p> I was vaguely aware of the EPA Superfund program and knew there were sites all over Silicon Valley, so I started searching online to see the details of the sites closest to me. I found the environmental impact report for the property where I was living, which is when things really got eerie.</p><p> 我含糊地意识到EPA超级计划，并了解硅谷的网站，所以我开始在线搜索，查看最接近我的网站的细节。我找到了我所生活的财产的环境影响报告，这是事情真的有怪异的时候。</p><p> Apparently, the 1,800-unit Santa Clara Square apartment complex was built on  industrially zoned land that required a clean-up – remediation – plan authorized by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC). The site development  notice stated, “Environmental investigations at the site have shown the presence of arsenic, lead and pesticides in shallow soils related to historical agricultural use.”</p><p> 显然，1,800单位的Santa Clara Square Apartment Complex建立在工业划船的土地上，要求加州有毒物质控制（DTSC）授权的清理 - 修复计划。该网站开发通知规定，“该遗址的环境调查显示出与历史农业用途相关的浅层砷，铅和农药的存在。”</p><p> The  clean-up activities seemed to focus only on these specific contaminants. Per the  report submitted to DTSC, most of the contaminants were apparently not removed as part of clean-up, but instead kept on-site. Thousands of cubic yards of hazardous soil were buried under the parking garages in “containment cells.” They also wrote that they left toxic soil around certain trees for “1.5 times the tree canopy width” and simply put fabric on top of the toxic soil with “3 inches of clean soil or mulch.”</p><p> 清理活动似乎只关注这些特定的污染物。根据提交给DTSC的报告，大多数污染物显然不会作为清理的一部分删除，而是保持现场。在“遏制细胞”的停车车库下埋藏成千上万的危险土壤。他们还写道，它们围绕某些树木留下有毒土壤，以“树冠宽度的1.5倍”，并简单地将织物放在有毒土壤上，并用“3英寸的清洁土壤或覆盖物”。 </p><p> There were also  land use restrictions required by the government for the garages which were now the ceiling of the “containment cells” and the trees with toxic soil, which they called “TPZs.” These areas, just yards away from me, were not to be used for “residential human habitation,” hospitals, schools or day cares.</p><p>政府为车库提供的土地利用限制，现在是“遏制细胞”的天花板和有毒土壤的树木，它们称为“TPZ”。这些领域只是远离我的院子，不可用于“住宅人类居住”，医院，学校或日子。</p><p>  I was horrified to learn all of these facts and then see maps of the site with my apartment unit right above areas with the bright red “Class 1 hazardous waste” shading and to know the redwood trees outside my window were surrounded by hazardous soil. My beautiful view became haunting.</p><p>  我被吓坏了解所有这些事实，然后通过我的公寓单位看到现场的地图，上面具有明亮的红色“1级危险废物”阴影，并了解我窗外的红木树被危险的土壤包围。我美丽的景色变得令人难以理解。</p><p> At that point, I started calling lawyers and doctors and reporting my concerns to government agencies. I knew the situation was likely going to be complicated and that the tVOC readings on my personal monitors were not going to be conclusive on their own, but my gut told me something was terribly wrong.</p><p> 此时，我开始致电律师和医生并向政府机构报告我的担忧。我知道情况很可能会复杂，而TVOC读取我的个人监视器的读数并没有完全是完全的，但我的肠道告诉我一些非常错误的事情。</p><p> I’ll spoil the surprise – if there is any – and tell you now: I never got an answer to what happened to me, nor was I able to get anyone in charge to earnestly investigate. I only have more questions. Let my situation illustrate all the ways the system is currently set up to support financial interests instead of public health.</p><p> 我会破坏这个惊喜 - 如果有的话 - 然后告诉你：我从来没有答案发生在我身上，也没有能够让任何人负责认真调查。我只有更多的问题。让我的情况说明系统目前建立的所有方式，以支持经济利益而不是公共卫生。</p><p>  I sent Irvine Company numerous emails and phone calls pleading for help. The day I found the high tVOCs I wrote, “I think my apartment might be poisoning me” and sent a description of “ sick building syndrome,” pointing out that I’ve been experiencing almost all of those symptoms since moving in.</p><p>  我发送了Irvine公司众多电子邮件和电话恳求帮助。我发现的那一天我写的高TVOCS，“我认为我的公寓可能会毒害我”并派出了“病态建筑综合征”的描述，指出，自从进入以来，我几乎遇到了几乎所有这些症状。</p><p> That day, I asked Irvine to investigate and test to identify which VOCs were causing the issues and provide guidance on how to mitigate the exposure. I talked to the service manager on the phone and stressed the same message.</p><p> 那天，我要求Irvine调查和测试，以确定哪些VOC导致该问题并提供有关如何减轻曝光的指导。我在手机上与服务经理交谈并强调了相同的信息。</p><p> “The chemicals are still pouring out full blast. I felt so terribly sick, I’ve ended up sitting in the outdoor courtyard with [my dog] waiting for it to hopefully stop tonight … [We] need a better plan than [me] sleeping outdoors.”</p><p> “化学品仍然浇注完全爆炸。我觉得如此恶心，我最终坐在户外院子里用[我的狗]等待它，希望今晚能够停止...... [我们]需要一个比[我]睡觉的更好的计划。“ </p><p> Two days later after no response I wrote, “I’m sitting by an open window right now trying to catch my breath. I feel like I’m choking.” I sent them screenshots and photos of the air monitor readings, again asking for help. More days passed with no response.</p><p>两天后没有回复我写道，“我现在坐在一个开阔的窗户，现在试图喘不过气来。我觉得我正在窒息。“我送他们截图和空气监控读数的照片，再次要求帮助。更多的日子没有任何回应。</p><p> One night was so bad I ended up sleeping outside on a community lounge chair out of desperation. At 2 a.m., I wrote them again: “The chemicals are still pouring out full blast. I felt so terribly sick, I’ve ended up sitting in the outdoor courtyard with [my dog] waiting for it to hopefully stop tonight … [We] need a better plan than [me] sleeping outdoors.”</p><p> 一天晚上这么糟糕，我最终睡在社区躺椅外面的绝望。在上午2点钟，我再写：“化学品仍然倒出全爆炸。我觉得如此恶心，我最终坐在户外院子里用[我的狗]等待它，希望今晚能够停止...... [我们]需要一个比[我]睡觉的更好的计划。“</p><p> The general manager for the complex finally responded: “We had PGE out on Friday and they tested the surrounding stairwells, the area of your apartment home on the [exteriors as] well [as your] building, and there are no gas leaks or chemical spills. As of now, there is no evidence suggesting that your apartment home is unsafe. What are you wanting to do at this point? If you feel that your health and safety are in jeopardy you need to call 9-1-1 or emergency service.”</p><p> 该综合体的总经理终于回应了：“我们星期五突然出来，他们在[作为你]的[作为你]的建筑物的[外墙]上的公寓里的周围的楼梯间，以及漏气或化学物质溢出。截至目前，没有证据表明您的公寓家是不安全的。在这一点上你想做什么？如果您觉得您的健康和安全处于危险状态，您需要拨打9-1-1或紧急服务。“</p><p> I read her message and was like, “You have to be kidding me.” However, a few days after I found the environmental impact report and started notifying agencies of my concerns, Irvine Company did make a suspiciously unsolicited offer to let me break my lease – with nearly a year remaining – and move out without penalty. It seemed bizarre that they would email me out of nowhere offering to let me leave without paying the $7,500 penalty to break my lease.</p><p> 我读了她的信息，就像，“你必须开玩笑吧。”但是，我发现环境影响报告并开始通知通知我的担忧，欧文公司确实发出了一个可疑的未经请求的要约，让我打破我的租约 - 几年剩下 - 并没有罚款。它似乎奇怪的是，他们会把我的电子邮件给我无处可去，没有向我休假，而不支付7,500美元的罚款来打破我的租约。</p><p> Irvine Company then rented out my unit with only eight days of turn-around, despite my protests demanding an investigation. They also hired a hazardous waste public relations consultant, presumably to try to get me to let the issue go.</p><p> 欧文公司随后租用了我的单位，只有八天的扭转，尽管我的抗议要求调查。他们还聘请了危险的废物公共关系顾问，大概试图让我让问题走。</p><p> The consultant promoted herself as “one of the state’s leading public affairs strategists for redevelopment of property in the Bay Area,” but within a couple of days, she seemed convinced something bad was going on in my apartment and started requesting the company to investigate as well.</p><p> 顾问促进自己是“国家领导公共事务战略家之一，即在海湾地区重建财产”，但在几天内，她似乎相信我的公寓里的一些坏事并开始要求公司调查好吧。</p><p> After her attempts, she said they stopped giving her updates. She said twice, in writing, “It sure seems something is going on [in your apartment].”</p><p> 在她尝试之后，她说他们停止了她的更新。她写作两次，以书面形式说：“肯定似乎有所作为，[你的公寓]。” </p><p>    The consultant introduced herself to me saying,  “I would be happy to talk with you about the steps that were taken to ready the site for the community and residential land use.” And I was like, “How on earth did you know I was looking into that?”</p><p>顾问向我介绍了自己说，“我很乐意与你交谈，了解为社区和住宅用地准备就绪的步骤。”而且我就像，“你在地球上你知道我正在调查这一点吗？”</p><p> I also found it strange that I had not told Irvine Company that I discovered the environmental impact report, yet Irvine Company seemed to have found out I knew and proactively reached out to me about it via the consultant.</p><p> 我也发现我没有告诉Irvine公司，我发现了环境影响报告，但欧文公司似乎发现了我知道并积极通过顾问对我联系。</p><p> At one point, Irvine Company communicated through the consultant that they may do some testing, but only after they found out I was bringing in an industrial hygienist of my own. Both the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) and the consultant told me they never heard if Irvine Company actually did any testing or not.</p><p> 在一点时，Irvine公司通过顾问沟通，他们可以做一些测试，但只有在他们发现我被自己带来了自己的工业卫生师之后。加州有毒物质控制（DTSC）和顾问告诉我，如果Irvine公司实际上没有任何测试，他们从未听过。</p><p> I did try to do my own testing, but it was incredibly expensive and turned out to be insufficient. I wanted to get some formal data in the brief time before I moved out, so I hired an industrial hygienist to sample the indoor air and some of the topsoil. Despite the $1,555 I had to pay for it, the results were inconclusive. Apparently a different test – a “summa canister” – over a longer period of time would have been better.</p><p> 我确实尝试做自己的测试，但它非常昂贵，结果不足。在我搬出去之前，我想在短时间内获得一些正式的数据，所以我聘请了一个工业卫生主义者来抽样室内空气和一些表土。尽管我必须支付1,555美元，但结果不确定。显然是一个不同的考验 - 一个“summa罐” - 在更长的时间内将更好。</p><p> Then, through searching and public records requests, I found a number of reported issues at Irvine Company sites in the area. First, a  report from 2019, where one of my neighbors at the same complex complained about blue tap water and paid for a private lab test showing “very high” levels of lead, copper and other contaminants in the water.</p><p> 然后，通过搜索和公共记录请求，我在该地区的Irvine公司网站上发现了一些报告的问题。首先，2019年的一份报告，我的邻居之一在同一综合体中抱怨蓝色自来水，并支付私人实验室测试，显示水中的“非常高”的铅，铜和其他污染物。</p><p> I found no records of any actions taken by Irvine Company to address that report. Next, I found  an article from 2014 stating Irvine Company appeared to offer a quid pro quo to the Santa Clara city government as part of another development agreement for a site nearby, stating, “If the city would approve the … project” and “resolve litigation challenges,” then “Irvine would donate one million dollars” to an unrelated city project.</p><p> 我找不到Irvine公司采取任何行动的记录来解决该报告。接下来，我发现2014年的一篇文章似乎为欧文公司似乎向圣克拉拉市政府提供了一个Quid Pro，作为附近的网站的另一个发展协议的一部分，陈述，“如果该城市批准...项目”和“解决......诉讼挑战，“然后”欧文将捐赠100万美元“到一个无关的城市项目。</p><p> Then, I  found an article about another nearby Irvine Company site under litigation against the city of Sunnyvale over an incomplete environmental assessment report. So, my situation didn’t sound like a one-off, even with this specific company.</p><p> 然后，我发现了一篇关于另一个附近的Irvine Company网站的诉讼，并在不完整的环境评估报告中诉讼。所以，即使与这个特定的公司，我的情况也不像是一次性的。 </p><p> In 2014 Irvine Company appeared to offer a quid pro quo to the Santa Clara city government as part of another development agreement for a site nearby, stating, “If the city would approve the … project” and “resolve litigation challenges,” then “Irvine would donate one million dollars” to an unrelated city project.</p><p>2014年，欧文公司似乎向圣克拉拉市政府提供了Quid Pro Quid Pro，作为附近的网站的另一个发展协议的一部分，陈述，“如果该城市批准...项目”和“解决诉讼挑战”那么“欧文将捐赠100万美元“到一个无关的城市项目。</p><p> It’s so broken that it’s up to the property owner to test and confirm there’s an issue in these situations – if they suspect the property could be making a tenant sick, it does not seem to be in their financial interest to actually confirm that suspicion. I also realized how intimidating, if not impossible, it is for an individual to go up against these big, powerful companies.</p><p> 它被破坏了，它取决于财产所有者在这些情况下测试并确认存在问题 - 如果他们怀疑该物业可能会使一个租户生病，它似乎并不符合实际证实怀疑的财务兴趣。我也意识到了如何恐吓，如果不是不可能的话，它是一个个人对抗这些大型强大的公司。</p><p>  When I complained to DTSC about the VOCs in my apartment, the site manager initially offered to look into it. She admitted it sounded like my health issues were the result of VOC fumes in my unit, even putting in writing, “It seems like something is happening in your unit.”</p><p>  当我向DTSC抱怨我的公寓中的VOC时，最初提供的网站经理将其调查。她承认它听起来像我的健康问题是我的单位中的VOC烟雾的结果，即使在写作，“似乎是你的单位发生的事情。”</p><p> She said she contacted the Irvine Company’s environmental attorneys to suggest testing, but quickly retreated, saying there was actually nothing she could do to help me. She wrote, “I’m not trying to shut down on you. We’ve been working collaboratively with our contacts at the Irvine Company. And they’ve started to push back that if the problem isn’t related to the soil or groundwater contamination, that we [DTSC] don’t have authority.”</p><p> 她说她联系了Irvine公司的环境律师建议测试，但迅速撤退，说实际上她无法做到帮助我。她写道，“我不是想关闭你。我们一直在与Irvine公司的联系人协作工作。他们已经开始推回，如果问题与土壤或地下水污染没有关系，我们[DTSC]没有权威。“</p><p> It was my understanding from our phone calls that DTSC only had authority over the chemicals that were listed as “contaminants of concern” in the Environmental Assessment Report, none of which were VOCs.</p><p> 这是我从我们的电话呼叫的理解，DTSC只有在环境评估报告中被列为“污染物”的化学物质，其中没有任何一个VOC。</p><p> Then the DTSC manager tried to tell me that she suspected the VOCs were “coming from an indoor source, such as construction materials or [industrial] cleaning products.” I kept asking if that was true, then who had authority over that type of issue. I never got a clear answer, other than DTSC saying “not us.”</p><p> 然后，DTSC经理试图告诉我，她怀疑VOCS是“来自室内源，如建筑材料或[工业]清洁产品。”我一直在问这是真的，那么谁有权威的问题。除了DTSC之外，我从未有过一个清晰的答案说“不是我们”。</p><p> I tried asking local indoor air and public health agencies, but they said the same: “Not us.” This was just the beginning of the story with DTSC.</p><p> 我试过询问当地的室内空气和公共卫生机构，但他们说同样的话：“不是我们。”这只是DTSC故事的开始。 </p><p> The developer, Roux, Inc., claimed in their second clean-up  completion report that “no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil vapor were identified as COCs at the Site” and that “several different VOCs were detected in soil vapor samples [but well] below their respective [screening levels].” That wasn’t even accurate according to the other reports!</p><p>Developer Roux，Inc。在其第二种清理完成报告中声称，“土壤蒸汽中不挥发性有机化合物（VOC）被鉴定为位点的COC”，并且在土壤蒸汽样品中检测到几种不同的VOC [但井]以下各自的[筛选水平]。“根据其他报告甚至不准确！</p><p> Then they said, “Several VOCs were detected in groundwater beneath the site, but they were all below their applicable screening levels for risk to indoor air.” The  EIR states no VOCs pose a “significant risk with respect to potential vapor intrusions issues.” Based on what I discovered next, this all appeared to be some expert wordsmithing and spin, possibly to avoid addressing data about onsite chemicals that would have made the clean-up much more costly.</p><p> 然后他们说，“在网站下面的地下水中检测到几个VOC，但它们均低于适用的筛选水平，以风险为室内空气。” EIR说没有VOC对于潜在的蒸汽入侵问题没有任何影响。“基于我的发现，这一切似乎是一些专家的词语和旋转，可能避免寻求关于现场化学品的数据，这些化学品将更昂贵更昂贵。</p><p> In an environmental impact report conducted on the SCSA site by Impact Sciences, a firm hired by property manager Irvine Company, the report claims that no VOCs pose a “significant risk with respect to potential vapor intrusions issues.” Impact Sciences also makes it clear the development and testing of the site were done on an “expedited schedule.” What kind of costs were cut and timeframes shortened at this toxic site in the name of developer dollars?</p><p> 在SCSA网站对SCSA网站的环境影响报告中，由财产经理Irvine公司雇用的公司，该报告说明没有VOC对潜在的蒸汽入侵问题产生了“重大风险”。影响科学还使得清楚的是对“加快计划”的开发和测试。在开发人员的名称中削减了什么样的成本和计时框架？</p><p>  In reading the  EIR (Environmental Impact Report)  response plan and thousands of pages of reports, I quickly noticed there seemed to be many VOCs found on site. The reports even said the VOCs were above residential limits and, in some cases, even above vapor intrusion risk levels.</p><p>  在阅读EIR（环境影响报告）响应计划和数千页的报告中，我很快注意到现场发现了许多VOC。报告甚至表示，VOC上高于住宅限制，在某些情况下，甚至高于蒸汽侵入风险水平。</p><p> When I first presented this to the DTSC manager, she acknowledged it is unusual to have chemicals above residential limits not considered contaminants of concern, saying, “In general, if the chemicals are present at the subsurface at concentrations exceeding residential levels, they would typically be considered contaminants of concern.”</p><p> 当我第一次向DTSC经理提交给DTSC经理时，她承认在居住限额上面的化学物质不被认为是令人关注的污染物，说，“一般来说，如果化学品以超过住宅水平的浓度存在，则它们通常被视为关注的污染物。“</p><p> A few of the reports tried to explain why several specific VOCs weren’t part of the clean-up plan, saying samples were only found in a couple spots or just a general statement that they do not believe the chemical will create a risk to public health. However, I couldn’t find any explanations for some of the chemicals.</p><p> 一些报告试图解释为什么若干特定的VOC不是清理计划的一部分，说样本只在几个斑点或只是一般声明中发现，他们不相信化学物质会对公众产生风险健康。但是，我找不到一些化学品的任何解释。</p><p> I was thinking: “If you don’t want me to be worried about this chemical’s impact to my health, you should tell me exactly why it wasn’t included in the clean-up despite being above residential limits.” All I heard was crickets and I got more suspicious.</p><p> 我在想：“如果你不希望让我担心这种化学化学物质对我的健康的影响，你应该告诉我，尽管在住宅限制之上，但是尽管在清理中，但是尽管上面的住宅限制，但是它确实不包括在清理中。”我所听到的只是蟋蟀，我变得更加可疑。 </p><p> One of the chemicals, vinyl chloride,  was found above vapor intrusion risk levels, with no explanation that I could find as to why it was not included in the remediation plan. In fact, vinyl chloride is a breakdown product of the contaminants at one of the Superfund sites uphill from my apartment.</p><p>其中一种化学物质氯乙烯氯乙烯，发现蒸汽侵入风险水平上方，没有解释，我可以找到它为什么不包括在修复计划中。事实上，氯化氯乙烯是从我的公寓上山上坡上坡的一个超级垃圾场的污染物的分解产物。</p><p> When I asked DTSC for reasoning as to why the VOCs weren’t part of the clean-up plan, I never got a straight response. I began to get very worried about the integrity of everything that was approved. I raised additional questions to DTSC.</p><p> 当我问DTSC的推理时，VOCS不属于清理计划的原因，我从未得到直接的回应。我开始非常担心一切被批准的一切诚信。我向DTSC提出了额外的问题。</p><p> It appeared the least amount of pre-excavation testing, if any, was done on the property directly under my apartment building. Further, after excavation, Roux  said they did no post-excavation testing on the remaining soil. I kept asking why so little testing was done there. I asked why conclusive statements were being made about my apartment unit based on what appeared to be very little data. I never got a straight answer.</p><p> 它似乎在我的公寓大楼下的物业上完成了最少的预挖掘测试测试。此外，在挖掘后，Roux表示，它们在剩余的土壤上没有挖掘后测试。我一直询问为什么这么少的测试在那里完成了。我问为什么基于似乎是非常少的数据，我的公寓单位正在进行决定性陈述。我从来没有直接回答。</p><p> I asked about a  rogue “500-gallon underground storage tank”  filled or previously filled with an unknown chemical. Apparently, no one knows where it is under the property, though it was expected to be slightly uphill from my unit. I asked if that could be under my unit or leaking under my unit. No answer.</p><p> 我询问了一个盗贼“500加仑地下储罐”，填充或以前充满了未知的化学品。显然，没有人知道它在财产下的地方，尽管预计从我的单位略微上坡。我问这是否可以在我的单位下或在我的单位下泄漏。没有答案。</p><p> I asked why Roux and Irvine Company apparently planned to install a vapor intrusion mitigation system beneath one of the buildings, and why they originally planned for four buildings though the rest were cancelled mid-way.</p><p> 我问为什么Roux和Irvine公司显然计划在其中一个建筑物下安装蒸汽入侵缓解系统，为什么他们最初计划为四座建筑物，虽然其余部分被取消了中途。</p><p> The completion report said, “While not an environmental remedy, because there are no significant risks, a VIMS consisting of a vapor barrier and a sub-slab venting system has been designed and installed.”  Installing these  apparently could cost millions of dollars. It’s curious to me that Roux would plan to build four VIMS, or even build one, if they really thought VOCs were not an issue.</p><p> 完成报告说：“虽然不是环境补救措施，因为没有显着的风险，所以设计和安装了由蒸汽屏障和子板通风系统组成的Vim。”安装这些显然可能花费数百万美元。这对我来说很好奇，Roux将计划建立四个Vims，甚至建立一个，如果他们真的认为VOC不是一个问题。</p><p> I argu</p><p> 我争辩 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://sfbayview.com/2021/03/i-thought-i-was-dying-my-apartment-was-built-on-toxic-waste/">https://sfbayview.com/2021/03/i-thought-i-was-dying-my-apartment-was-built-on-toxic-waste/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/垂死/">#垂死</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/dying/">#dying</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
