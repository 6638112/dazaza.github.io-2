Not much, at any rate. Not even whether Homer really existed, or the identity of that author whom we for the sake of convenience have dubbed “Pseudo-Longinus,” who quotes Sappho’s verses on the power of Eros in the surviving fragments of his work on the sublime, thereby preserving her lines for future generations, namely us.</p><p>我们什么都不知道。不多，无论如何。甚至不是荷马是否真的存在，还是我们为方便起见而将其称为“伪浪琴”的作者的身份，他在崇高的作品中尚存的片段中引用了萨普的关于爱神之力的经文，从而得以保存。她为子孙后代（即我们）的台词。</p><p> We know that Sappho came from Lesbos, an island in the eastern Aegean situated so close to the mainland of Asia Minor that, on a clear day, you might think you could swim across—to the coast of the immeasurably rich Lydia of those days, and from there, in what is now Turkey, to that of the immeasurably rich Europe of today.</p><p> 我们知道，萨福（Sappho）来自爱琴海东部的莱斯博斯岛（Lesbos），该岛离小亚细亚大陆如此之近，以至于在晴朗的日子里，您可能会以为自己可以游过–到达那段无数富饶的Lydia的海岸，从那里，到现在的土耳其，再到今天无比丰富的欧洲。</p><p> Somewhere there, in the lost kingdom of the Hittites, must lie the origins of her unusual name, which either means “numinous,” “clean,” or “pure source,” or—if you trace its history back by a different route—is a corruption of the ancient Greek word for sapphire and lapis lazuli.</p><p> 在赫梯人失落的王国中的某个地方，必须找到她不寻常的名字的来历，这个名字的意思是“众多”，“干净”或“纯净的来源”，或者-如果您通过不同的路线追溯其历史，是古希腊语中对蓝宝石和青金石的破坏。</p><p> She is said to have been born in Eresus, or perhaps in Mytilene, in about the year 617 before our calendar began, or possibly thirteen years earlier or five years later. Her father was called Scamander or Scamandronymus, or otherwise possibly Simon, Eumenus, Eerigyius, Ecrytus, Semus, Camon, or Etarchus, according to the Suda, a highly eloquent but not very reliable Byzantine encyclopedia from the tenth century.</p><p> 据说她大约在我们的日历开始之前的617年，或者大概十三年前或五年之后，出生在埃雷索斯或米蒂利尼。根据苏达的说法，她的父亲被称为斯卡曼德（Scamander）或斯卡曼德鲁尼（Scamandronymus），或者另外的名字叫西蒙（Simen），欧曼纽斯（Eumenus），埃里吉乌斯（Eerigyius），埃克利图斯（Ecrytus），塞木斯（Semus），卡蒙（Camon）或伊塔丘斯（Etarchus）。</p><p> We know she had two brothers named Charaxus and Larichus, and perhaps a third named Eurygius, and that she was of noble birth, since her youngest brother, Larichus, was a cupbearer in the Prytaneion in Mytilene, a post reserved only for the sons of aristocratic families.</p><p> 我们知道她有两个兄弟，分别是Charaxus和Larichus，也许还有第三个兄弟，分别是Eurygius，而且她出生高贵，因为她的最小弟弟Larichus是Mytilene的Prytaneion的酒杯店老板，这个职位只为贵族家庭。</p><p> We believe her mother was called Cleïs and that Sappho had a daughter of the same name, even though the word, which she uses when addressing the beloved girl in a poem, can also mean slave.</p><p> 我们相信她的母亲叫克莱斯（Cleïs），而萨福（Sappho）有一个同名的女儿，尽管她在用诗来称呼她心爱的女孩时使用的这个词也可能意味着奴隶。</p><p> Nowhere does Sappho refer to a husband. The name “Kerkylas of Andros Island” mentioned in this connection in the Suda has to be a smutty joke by the Attic comic poets, who undoubtedly took pleasure in ascribing to her, of all women, a husband with a name sometimes rendered as “Dick Allcock from the Isle of Man.” The legend of her unhappy, even self-destructive love for a young ferryman named Phaeon, later embellished by Ovid in his  Letters of Heroines, must date from the same time.</p><p> 萨福在任何地方都没有提到丈夫。在苏达语中与此有关的“安德罗斯岛的柯基拉斯岛”这个名字一定是阁楼漫画诗人的mut谐的笑话，毫无疑问，这是所有女性中的一位女性，丈夫的丈夫有时被冠以“迪克”的名字。来自马恩岛的Allcock。”她对年轻的渡轮船长Phaeon的不满甚至是自我毁灭的爱，必须由奥维德（Ovid）在他的《女主人公书信》中加以点缀，这一传说必须追溯到同一时期。 </p><p> We know from an inscribed chronicle dating from the third century before Christ that at some point—when exactly is not recorded on the Parian marble tablet—she fled by ship to Syracuse. We can conclude from another source that it was in around 596  , when Lesbos’s fortunes were in the hands of the Cleanactidai clan.</p><p>从可追溯到公元前三世纪的铭文编年史中我们知道，在某个时候（确切地没有记录在Parian大理石碑板上），她乘船逃往锡拉丘兹。我们可以从另一个来源得出的结论是，大约在596年，Lesbos的命运掌握在Cleanactidai家族手中。</p><p> Seven or eight years later, when the island was under the rule of the tyrant Pittacus, Sappho must have returned from exile and founded a women’s circle in Mytilene, which may have been a cultish community set up to honor Aphrodite, a symposium of fellow females bearing an erotic attachment to one another, or a marriage preparation school for daughters of noble birth: no one knows for sure.</p><p> 七八年后，当该岛在暴君皮塔库斯（Pittacus）统治下时，萨福一定从流放中返回家园，并在米蒂利尼（Mytilene）建立了一个女权圈子，这可能是一个为纪念阿芙罗狄蒂（Aphrodite）而成立的文化社区，相互依恋，或者为高贵的女儿准备一所婚姻准备学校：没人能确定。</p><p> No other woman from early antiquity has been so talked about, and in such conflicting terms. The sources are as sparse as the legends are manifold, and any attempt to distinguish between the two virtually hopeless.</p><p> 没有其他人谈论过这么早的古代女性，而且没有如此矛盾的说法。来源稀疏，就像传说中的传说一样，任何试图区分两者的尝试几乎都是无望的。</p><p> Every age has created its own Sappho. Some even invented a second in order to sidestep the contradictions of the stories: she was variously described as a priestess in the service of Aphrodite or the Muses, a hetaera, a man-crazed woman, a love-crazed virago, a kindly teacher, a gallant lady; by turns shameless and corrupt, or prim and pure.</p><p> 每个时代都有自己的蓝宝石。有些人甚至发明了第二个方法来避免故事中的矛盾：她被形容为阿芙罗狄蒂或缪斯女神的女祭司，hetaera，男人疯狂的女人，疯狂的处女座，和a的老师，一位英勇的女士；轮流无耻和腐败，或者原始和纯洁。</p><p> Her countryman and contemporary Alcaeus described her as “violet-haired, pure, honey-smiling,” Socrates as “beautiful,” Plato as “wise,” Philodemus of Gadara as “the tenth Muse,” Strabo as “a marvelous phenomenon,” and Horace as “masculine,” but there is now no way of knowing what exactly he meant by that.</p><p> 她的同胞和当代的阿尔卡乌斯（Alcaeus）将她描述为“紫罗兰色的头发，纯洁，微笑着”，苏格拉底描述为“美丽”，柏拉图描述为“明智”，加达拉的菲洛德莫斯描述为“第十个缪斯”，斯特拉波描述为“奇妙的现象”。和霍拉斯（Horace）是“男性”，但现在没有办法知道他的确切含义。</p><p> A papyrus from the late second or early third century for its part claims that Sappho was “ugly, being dark in complexion and of very small stature,” “contemptible,” and “a woman-lover.”</p><p> 从第二世纪末到第三世纪初的纸莎草纸声称，萨福是“丑陋，肤色黝黑，身材矮小的人”，“可鄙”和“女人爱人”。</p><p> At one time bronze statues of her were common; even today, silver coins still bear her laurel-crowned profile, a water jug from the school of Polygnotos portrays her as a slim figure reading a scroll, and a gleaming black vase from the fifth century before Christ shows her as tall in stature, holding an eight-stringed lyre in her hand as if she had just finished playing or were just about to start. We do not know how Sappho’s verses sounded in Aeolic—the most archaic and tricky of the extinct ancient Greek dialects, in which the initial aspiration was omitted from words—when they were sung at a wedding ceremony, at a banquet, or in the women’s circle, accompanied by a stringed instrument: the hushed sound of a plucked phorminx or the festive ring of the cithara, the deep tones of the barbitos or the harp-like strains of the pectis, the high tones of a magadis or the dull resonance of a tortoiseshell lyre.</p><p> 有一次她的青铜雕像很常见。即使在今天，银币仍然保持着她的月桂冠状轮廓，波利尼多斯学校的水壶将她描绘成一个苗条的人物，阅读卷轴，还有一个闪闪发光的黑色花瓶，那是从五世纪开始的，基督向她展示了她的身材，高高举起她手里拿着八弦琴，好像她刚玩完游戏或即将开始演奏。我们不知道Sappho的经文在Aeolic（在已灭绝的古希腊方言中最古老和最棘手的声音）的发音，当它们在婚礼，宴会或女性歌唱中时，最初的愿望被忽略了。圆，并伴以弦乐器：摘去的佛手柑或柑桔的喜庆铃声，巴比托的深沉音调或果肉的竖琴般的张力，洋溢的高音或沉闷的共鸣里拉琴。 </p><p> All we know is that the word  lyric derives from one of these instruments, the lyre, and was coined by Alexandrian scholars some three hundred years after Sappho’s death. It was they who dedicated to her an entire edition in eight or nine books, many thousands of lines on several rolls of papyrus, arranged according to meter, several hundred poems, of which only a single one has come to us intact, because the rhetorician Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who lived in Rome during the reign of Augustus, quotes it in full in his treatise  On Literary Composition as an example worthy of admiration. Other than that, four consecutive stanzas were recorded by the scholar known as Pseudo-Longinus; five stanzas of another poem were successfully reassembled from three different papyrus fragments; four stanzas of another were discovered in 1937 carelessly scrawled on a palm-size potsherd by an Egyptian schoolboy in the second century before Christ; fragments of a fifth and a sixth poem were preserved on a tattered early medieval parchment, and large portions of a seventh and eighth were recently discovered on strips of papyrus forming part of the cartonnages used for the preservation of Egyptian mummies or as book covers, although the deciphering of one of the two poems still divides the throng of experts to this day.</p><p>我们所知道的是，歌词这个词源于其中一种乐器，即里拉琴，是萨福人死后约三百年由亚历山大学者创造的。正是他们把她的一本完整的书献给了她的八，九本书，在几卷纸莎草纸上成千上万行，按米排列，写了几百首诗，其中只有一首完整地寄给我们，因为修辞家奥古斯都统治时期住在罗马的哈利卡纳苏斯的狄奥尼修斯在其《论文学作品》一文中充分引用了这一观点，值得钦佩。除此之外，这位名叫Pseudo-Longinus的学者记录了四个连续的节。另一首诗的五个节从三个不同的纸莎草纸片段成功地重新组合而成； 1937年，在基督降世之前的第二世纪，埃及小学生在一个棕榈大小的陶器上草草乱写地发现了另外四个节。第五和第六首诗的片段保存在一个破烂的中世纪早期羊皮纸上，最近在纸莎草纸条上发现了第七和第八首诗的大部分，这些纸莎草纸是用于保存埃及木乃伊或用作书皮的笛卡尔的一部分，尽管这两首诗之一的解密至今仍使专家们蜂拥而至。</p><p> A handful of words or isolated lines cited by grammarians like Athenaeus and Apollonius Dyscolus, the philosopher Chrysippus of Soli, or the lexicographer Julius Pollux to illustrate a certain style, a particular item of vocabulary or the meter named after her, were provided by the large-format codices of medieval scribes—the rest is nothing more than scraps: a scattering of stanzas one or two lines long, fragmentary verses, words plucked from their context, single syllables and letters, the beginning or end of a word, or a line, nowhere near a sentence, let alone a meaning.</p><p> 语法学家如雅典娜（Athenaeuus）和阿波罗尼乌斯·迪斯库洛斯（Apollonius Dyscolus），索利（Soli）的哲学家克里斯蒂普斯（Chrysippus）或词汇学家朱利叶斯·波勒克斯（Julius Pollux）所引用的少数单词或孤立的线条是由大型律师提供的格式的抄写员抄袭，剩下的不过是碎片：散布的节长一两行，零散的经文，从其上下文中摘录的单词，单个音节和字母，单词的开头或结尾或一行，靠近句子，更不用说意思了。</p><p> ……… and I go … … … immediately … …… … for … … of harmony … … the chorus, … … clear-sounding … … to all … …</p><p> …………而我…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</p><p> It is as if, in the places where the singing has faded away and the words are missing, where the papyrus scrolls are rotten and torn, dots had appeared, first singly, then in pairs, and soon in the vague pattern of a rhythmic triad—the notation of a silent lament.</p><p> 好像在歌声消失，单词消失的地方，纸莎草纸卷腐烂撕裂的地方，先出现了点，首先是成对出现，然后成对出现，很快就出现了模糊的三重奏-默哀的表示法。</p><p> These songs have fallen silent, turned to writing, Greek characters borrowed from the Phoenician: dark majuscules, carved into clayey earthenware in a clumsy schoolboy hand or copied onto the pith of the woody wetland grass by a diligent professional using a reed pen; and delicate minuscules, written on the pumice-smoothed, chalk-bleached skins of young sheep and stillborn goats: papyrus and parchment, organic materials that, once exposed to the elements, eventually decompose like any cadaver.</p><p> 这些歌曲沉寂了下来，变成了从腓尼基人那里借来的希腊字符：深色粗麻布，用笨拙的男生手雕刻成黏土陶器，或者由勤奋的专业人员用芦苇笔复制到木质湿地草的髓上；细腻的细微之处，写在幼羊和死胎山羊的浮石般光滑，用粉笔漂白的皮肤上：纸莎草纸和羊皮纸，一旦暴露于这些有机元素，最终会像尸体一样分解。</p><p> … … nor … … desire … … but all at once … … blossom … … desire … … took delight …</p><p> ……也…………欲望…………却一次全部……开花……欲望……使喜悦……</p><p> Like forms to be filled in, these mutilated poems demand to be completed—by interpretation and imagination, or by the deciphering of more of the loose papyrus remnants from the garbage dumps of Oxyrhynchus, that sunken town in central Egypt where a meter-thick layer of dry sand preserved these rock-hard, worm-eaten fragments—fragile, creased, and tattered from being rolled and unrolled—for nearly a thousand years.</p><p> 就像要填写的表格一样，这些残缺不全的诗歌需要完成-通过解释和想象，或者通过从奥克西林丘斯（Oxyrhynchus）的垃圾堆中破译更多的纸莎草残余物，奥克西林丘斯位于埃及中部沉没的小镇，那里有一米厚干砂将这些坚硬，被蠕虫吃掉的碎片保存了近一千年，这些碎片易碎，易折，破烂不堪。 </p><p> We know that people wrote on papyrus scrolls in tightly packed columns without spaces between words, punctuation, or guidelines, making even well-preserved items hard to decipher.  Divinatio, in the ancient art of the oracle, was the gift of prophesying the future by observing bird migrations and interpreting dreams. Nowadays, in papyrology, it refers to the ability to read a line where all that is visible are faded fragments of ancient Greek letters.</p><p>我们知道，人们在纸莎草纸上用紧密排列的列书写，单词，标点符号或准则之间没有空格，即使保存完好的项目也难以解读。在神谕的古老艺术中，占卜是通过观察鸟类的迁徙和解释梦想来预示未来的礼物。如今，在纸张学中，它是指能够读取所有可见的都是古希腊字母的褪色碎片的线的能力。</p><p> The fragment, we know, is the infinite promise of Romanticism, the enduringly potent ideal of the modern age, and poetry, more than any other literary form, has come to be associated with the pregnant void, the blank space that breeds conjecture. The dots, like phantom limbs, seem intertwined with the words, testify to a lost whole. Intact, Sappho’s poems would be as alien to us as the once gaudily painted classical sculptures.</p><p> 我们知道，碎片是浪漫主义的无限希望，浪漫主义是现代持久的理想，诗歌比任何其他文学形式都多，与孕育的虚空联系在一起，虚空孕育了猜想。像幻肢一样的圆点似乎与文字缠绕在一起，证明了整体的迷失。完整地来说，萨福的诗歌对我们来说就像一度曾经被绘画精美的古典雕塑一样陌生。</p><p> In total, all the poems and fragments that have reached us, as brief, mutilated, and devoid of context as they are, add up to no more than six hundred lines. It has been calculated that around 7 percent of Sappho’s work has survived.</p><p> 总体而言，到达我们这里的所有诗句和片段，如简短，残缺且没有上下文的内容，总计不超过六百行。据计算，约有7％的Sappho工作得以幸存。</p><p> It has also been calculated that around 7 percent of all women feel attracted solely or predominantly to women, but no calculation will ever be able to establish whether there is any correlation here.</p><p> 还据计算，约有7％的女性感到被女性独占或主要吸引，但没有任何计算方法能够确定这里是否存在任何相关性。</p><p> The history of symbols contains a number of markers of the unknown and indeterminate, of the absent and lost, of the void and the blank: the zero on the corn lists of the ancient Babylonians, the letter  x in an algebraic equation, the dash used when someone’s words are abruptly interrupted.</p><p> 符号的历史包含许多未知，不确定，缺失和丢失，空白和空白的标记：古代巴比伦人的玉米表上的零，代数方程中的字母x，所用的破折号当某人的话突然被打断时。</p><p> …  …………………….…  ………………….… goatherd  ………….longing  ………….sweat …  …………………….…  ………………….… … roses … …</p><p> ……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………… ……..……玫瑰……</p><p> Aposiopesis—the technique of suddenly breaking off midsentence—we know is a rhetorical device that Pseudo-Longinus, too, will certainly have written about in that part of his treatise  On the Sublime that has been lost owing to the carelessness of librarians and bookbinders. If someone stops speaking, starts stuttering and stammering or even falls silent, it suggests he is overcome by feelings of such magnitude that inevitably words fail him. Ellipses open up any text to that vast obscure realm of sentiments that cannot be verbalized or that capitulate in the face of the words available.</p><p> 异位症-一种突然中断句法的技巧-我们知道伪造的Longongus也将在他的《论崇高论》的那部分中写过一种修辞手法，由于图书管理员和装订者的粗心而使它失去了。如果某人停止说话，开始结结巴巴，甚至结结巴巴，甚至变得沉默，这表明他被如此巨大的感觉所克服，以至于不可避免的单词会使他失望。省略号将所有文本打开到那种无法表达或在可用字眼前屈服的广阔情感领域。 </p><p>  We know that the letters Emily Dickinson wrote to her friend and future sister-in-law Susan Gilbert had a series of passionate passages deleted from them, prior to publication, by her niece Martha, Gilbert’s daughter, who omitted to indicate these deletions. One of these censored sentences, from June 11, 1852, reads: “If you were here—and Oh that you were here, my Susie, we need not talk at all, our eyes would whisper for us, and your hand fast in mine, we would not ask for language.”</p><p>我们知道，艾米莉·狄金森（Emily Dickinson）给她的朋友和未来的sister子苏珊·吉尔伯特（Susan Gilbert）写的信中有一系列热情洋溢的段落，在出版之前，吉尔伯特的侄女玛莎（Martha）侄女玛莎（Martha）便删除了这些段落，以示删除。从1852年6月11日起，这些被删节的句子之一写着：“如果你在这里-哦，那你在这里，我的苏茜，我们根本不需要说话，我们的眼睛会窃窃私语，而你的手紧紧抓住我，我们不会要求使用语言。”</p><p> Wordless, blind understanding is as much a firm topos of love poetry as is the wordy evocation of unfathomable feeling.</p><p> 无言的盲目理解和对爱情诗歌的冗长唤起一样，是爱情诗的坚定立场。</p><p> Sappho’s words, where decipherable, are as unambiguous and clear as words possibly can be. At once sober and passionate, they tell, in an extinct language that has to be resurrected with each translation, of a heavenly power that, twenty-six centuries on, has lost none of its might: the sudden transformation, as wondrous as it is merciless, of a person into an object of desire, rendering you defenseless and causing you to leave your parents, spouse, and even children.</p><p> Sappho的单词在可以理解的情况下尽可能清晰，清晰。他们用一种必须在每种译本中复活的绝种语言立刻清醒而热情，告诉我们一种天国的力量，二十六个世纪以来，它没有失去任何力量：突然的转变，真是奇妙无比。一个人变得残酷无情，成为一个欲望的对象，使你变得毫无防备，并导致你离开父母，配偶甚至子女。</p><p> Eros the melter of limbs (now again) stirs me— sweetbitter unmanageable creature who steals in</p><p> 爱神的四肢融化者（现在又一次）激起了我-偷东西的甜食苦涩者</p><p> We know that the categorization of desire according to whether its protagonists were of the same or different genders was a concept foreign to the ancient Greeks. Rather, what mattered to them was that, in sexual relations, the role of each of the persons involved mirrored their social one, with adult men taking an active sexual role, while youths, slaves, and women remained passive. The dividing line in this act of control and submission ran not between the sexes, but between those who penetrate and possess, and those who are penetrated and possessed.</p><p> 我们知道，根据欲望的主人公是相同还是不同的性别来分类是古希腊人不熟悉的概念。相反，对他们而言重要的是，在性关系中，每个参与人员的角色都反映出他们的社交角色，成年男子扮演积极的性角色，而青年，奴隶和妇女则保持被动。这种控制和屈服行为的分界线不是在性别之间，而是在渗透和拥有者与渗透和拥有者之间。</p><p> Men are not mentioned by name in the surviving poetry of Sappho, whereas many women are: Abanthis, Agallis, Anagora, Anactoria, Archeanassa, Arignota, Atthis, Cleïs, Cleanthis, Dica, Doricha, Eirana, Euneica, Gongyla, Gorgo, Gyrinna, Megara, Mica, Mnasis, Mnasidica, Pleistodica, Telesippa. It is they whom Sappho sings about, with tender devotion or flaming desire, with burning jealousy or icy contempt.</p><p> 在萨福尚存的诗歌中没有提到男人的名字，而许多女人是：阿班特斯，阿加利斯，安那加拉，阿纳克多利亚，阿奇安那萨，阿里尼塔，阿特西斯，克莱伊斯，Cleanthis，Dica，Doricha，Eirana，Euneica，Gongyla，戈尔戈，吉林纳Megara，云母，Mnasis，Mnasidica，Pleistodica，Telesippa。 Sappho歌唱的是他们，他们带着温柔的奉献或炽烈的欲望，带着嫉妒或冰冷的鄙视。</p><p>  We think we know that Sappho was a teacher, even though the first source to refer to her as such is a papyrus fragment dating from the second century  , which reports, seven hundred years after her death, that she had taught girls from the best families in Ionia and Lydia.</p><p>  我们认为我们知道Sappho是一名老师，尽管第一个提到她的人是第二世纪的纸莎草纸碎片，该纸莎草碎片报告说，在她去世七百年后，她教过最好的家庭的女孩在爱奥尼亚州和利迪亚。 </p><p> There is nothing in any of Sappho’s surviving poetry to suggest an educational setting, although the fragments contain descriptions of a world in which women come and go, and there is often mention of farewells. The place seems to be one of transition, which led some to interpret it as hosting the female equivalent of the more widely attested Greek practice of pederasty. This reading also conveniently enabled the undeniable presence of female eroticism in poetry to be accounted for as a form of preparation for the main focus, the undisputed culmination of that teaching, namely marriage.</p><p>萨福（Sappho）尚存的诗歌中没有任何内容可以暗示一种教育背景，尽管这些片段包含了对女性来往的世界的描述，并且经常提到告别。这个地方似乎是过渡的地方，这导致一些人将其解释为接纳了女性，代表了希腊更为广泛的女权实践。这种读法还方便地使诗歌中女性色情的不可否认的存在被解释为主要焦点的预备形式，即该教义的无可争议的高潮，即婚姻。</p><p> We do not know the exact nature of the relationship between Hannah Wright and Anne Gaskill, whose marriage was recorded without comment in the register of marriages of the parish of Taxal in northern England on September 4, 1707, though we do know that the expression “where you go I will go,” commonly used in Christian marriage ceremonies, is borrowed from the words spoken by the widowed Ruth to her mother-in-law, Naomi, in the Old Testament.</p><p> 我们不知道汉娜·赖特（Hannah Wright）和安妮·加斯基尔（Anne Gaskill）之间的关系的确切性质，他们的婚姻在1707年9月4日于英格兰北部的萨克斯（Taxal）教区的婚姻登记册中没有作任何记录，尽管我们确实知道“基督教婚姻仪式中常用的“我要去哪里”是从寡妇露丝对旧约中婆婆内奥米所说的话中借来的。</p><p> We also know that in 1819, in the court case involving the two headmistresses of a Scottish girls’ boarding school who—a pupil had alleged—had engaged in improper and criminal acts on one another, Lucian’s  Dialogues of the Hetaerae was quoted to show that sex between women was actually possible. In it the hetaera Clonarion asks the cithara player Leaina about her sexual experience with “a rich woman from Lesbos” and in particular presses her to reveal what exactly she had done with her and “using what method.” But Leaina counters: “Don’t question me too closely about these things, they’re shameful; so, by Aphrodite, I won’t tell you!”</p><p> 我们还知道，在1819年，涉及一所苏格兰女子寄宿学校的两名女校长的法庭案件中，一名女学生声称他们相互进行了不正当的犯罪行为，据引述卢西安的《九牛座对话》表明：女人之间的性生活实际上是可能的。 hetaera Clonarion在其中询问了柑桔玩家Leaina与“来自Lesbos的有钱女人”的性经历，并特别敦促她透露自己对她做了什么，以及“使用了什么方法”。但是Leaina反驳说：“不要对这些事情问我太近，他们很可耻；所以，阿芙罗狄蒂，我不会告诉你！”</p><p> The chapter ends at this point, the question goes unanswered, and so what women do with one another remains both unuttered and unutterable. At any rate the two teachers were acquitted of the charge, as the judge came to the conclusion that the transgression of which they were accused was not actually possible: where there is no instrument there can be no act, where there is no weapon there can be no crime.</p><p> 本章到此结束，这个问题没有得到回答，因此，女性之间的相处既没有说也没有说。无论如何，两位老师都被无罪释放，因为法官得出的结论是，他们被指控的犯罪实际上是不可能的：没有文书就没有行动，没有武器就可以不犯罪。</p><p> For a long time, what women do with one another could only be regarded as sex and therefore an offense if it mimicked sexual intercourse between a man and a woman. The phallus marked the sexual act, and where it was absent there was nothing but an unmarked blank, a blind spot, a gap, a hole to be filled like the female sexual organ.</p><p> 长期以来，妇女彼此之间的行为只能被视为性行为，因此，如果它模仿了男人与女人之间的性行为，则是犯罪。阴茎标志着性行为，而没有阴茎的地方，只剩下一个未标记的空白，一个盲点，一个缝隙，一个像女性性器官一样的洞。</p><p> For a long time, this empty place was occupied by the concept of the “tribade,” that specter that haunts the writings of men, namely a masculine-acting woman who has sex with other women with the help of a monstrously enlarged clitoris or a phallic aid. As far as we know, no woman has ever described herself as a tribade.</p><p> 长期以来，这个空旷的地方被“部落”的概念所占据，这个幽灵困扰着男人的作品，即一个阳刚的女人，在巨大的阴蒂或巨大的阴蒂的帮助下与其他女人发生性关系。阳具。据我们所知，没有一个女人将自己描述成一个部落。</p><p> We know that words and symbols change their meaning. For a long time, three dots in a row along the writing baseline designated something lost and unknown, then at some point also something unuttered and unutterable; no longer only something omitted or left out, but also something left open. Hence the three dots became a symbol that invites one to think the allusion to its conclusion, imagine that which is missing, a proxy for the inexpressible and the hushed-up, for the offensive and obscene, for the incriminating and speculative, for a particular version of the omitted: the truth.</p><p> 我们知道单词和符号会改变其含义。长期以来，沿着写作基线连续三个点表示某些丢失和未知的东西，然后在某些时候还有些说不出来的东西。不再只是遗漏或遗漏的东西，而是遗留的东西。因此，这三个点成为一个符号，邀请人们去思考其结论的寓意，想象一下缺失的事物，它代表了无法表达的和安静的，攻击性的和淫秽的，暗示性的和投机性的，特定的版本省略：真相。 </p><p> We also know that in ancient times the symbol for omissions was the asterisk—the little star that only in medieval times took on the task of linking a place in a text to its associated margin note. As Isidore of Seville writes in the seventh century in his  Etymologies: “The asterisk is placed next to omissions, so that things which appear to be missing may be clarified through this mark.” Nowadays the asterisk is sometimes used as a means of including as many people as possible and their sexual identities. The omission becomes an inclusion, the absence a presence, and the empty place a profusion of meaning.</p><p>我们还知道，在远古时代，省略的符号是星号-仅在中世纪才承担将文本中的位置链接到与其相关的边注的任务。正如塞维利亚的伊西多尔（Isidore）在七世纪在《词源》一书中写道：“星号紧挨着遗漏，因此可以通过此标记来澄清似乎缺失的事物。”如今，星号有时被用作包括尽可能多的人及其性身份的手段。省略成为包容，不存在成为空虚，空虚成为意义的混杂。</p><p> And we know that in ancient times the verb  lesbiazein, “to do it like women from Lesbos,” was used to mean “to violate or corrupt somebody” and to refer to the sexual practice of fellatio, which was assumed to have been invented by the women of the island of Lesbos. Even Erasmus of Rotterdam, in his collection of ancient sayings and expressions, renders the Greek word as the Latin  fellare, meaning “to suck,” and concludes the entry with the comment: “The term remains, but I think the practice has been eliminated.”</p><p> 我们知道，在远古时代，动词“莱斯比亚泽因”“像来自莱斯博斯岛的妇女一样”被用来表示“侵犯或腐败某人”，并指的是口交的性行为。莱斯博斯岛上的妇女。甚至鹿特丹的伊拉斯mus（Erasmus）在他的古代谚语和表达中都将希腊语称为拉丁语，意思是“吮吸”，并在评论中总结道：“该词仍然存在，但我认为这种做法已被消除。”</p><p> Not long after that, at the end of the sixteenth century, Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme, comments in his pornographic novel  The Lives of the Gallant Ladies: “’Tis said how that Sappho the Lesbian was a very high mistress in this art, and that in after times the Lesbian dames have copied her therein, and continued the practice to the present day.” From then on the empty space had not only a geographical but also a linguistic home, although the term  amour lesbien remained in common use until the modern age as a term describing the unrequited love of a woman for a younger man.</p><p> 此后不久，十六世纪末，布兰妮姆（Seranteur deBrantôme）的皮埃尔·德·布尔迪耶（Pierre de Bourdeille）在他的色情小说《英勇的女士们的生活》中说道： ，后来女同性恋者将她复制到其中，并将这种习俗延续到了今天。”从那时起，空旷的地方不仅拥有地理上的空间，还拥有语言上的家，尽管“恋爱中的恋人”一词在现代之前一直被广泛使用，该词描述了一个女人对年轻男人的单恋。</p><p> We know that the two young poetesses Natalie Clifford Barney and Renée Vivien were disappointed when, in late summer 1904, they fulfilled a long-che</p><p> 我们知道，两位年轻的女诗人娜塔莉·克利福德·巴尼（Natalie Clifford Barney）和蕾妮·薇薇恩（RenéeVivien）在1904年夏末履行了长期</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/萨福/">#萨福</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/sappho/">#sappho</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
