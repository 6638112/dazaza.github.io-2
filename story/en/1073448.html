There, he has his blood drained, and a hydrating solution is pumped into his veins, a process that leaves him tired and cold.</p><p>小恩里克·罗梅罗（Enrique Romero Jr.）在华盛顿州贝灵厄姆的弗雷德·迈耶（Fred Meyer）杂货店完成轮班工作，完成网上订单时。，他经常步行去附近的血浆捐献中心。在那里，他将血液排干，并将补水溶液泵入静脉，这一过程让他感到疲惫和寒冷。</p><p> Mr. Romero, 30, said selling his plasma made him feel “like cattle.” But the income he earns from it — roughly $500 a month — is more reliable than his wages at Fred Meyer, which is owned by the grocery giant Kroger. His part-time hours often fluctuate, and he struggles to find enough money to cover his rent, his groceries and the regular repairs required to keep his 2007 Chevy Aveo on the road.</p><p>30岁的罗梅罗说，出售血浆让他感觉“像牛一样”但他从中获得的收入——大约每月500美元——比他在弗雷德·迈耶的工资更可靠。弗雷德·迈耶是食品杂货巨头克罗格（Kroger）的老板。他的兼职时间经常波动，他很难找到足够的钱来支付租金、杂货和定期维修，以维持2007年雪佛兰Aveo的行驶。</p><p>  Business has boomed during the pandemic for Kroger, the biggest supermarket chain in the United States and the fourth-largest employer in the Fortune 500. It owns more than 2,700 locations, and its brands include Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer, Ralphs, Smith’s, Pick ’n Save and even Murray’s Cheese in New York City. The company, which is based in Cincinnati,  said in December that it was expecting sales growth of at least 13.7 percent over two years. The company’s stock has risen about 36 percent over the past year.</p><p>克罗格是美国最大的连锁超市，也是《财富》500强企业中的第四大雇主。在疫情期间，克罗格的生意蓬勃发展。它拥有2700多家门店，旗下品牌包括哈里斯·蒂特、弗雷德·迈耶、拉尔夫、史密斯、匹克·n·萨弗，甚至纽约市的默里奶酪。该公司总部位于辛辛那提，去年12月表示，预计两年内销售增长至少13.7%。该公司的股票在过去一年中上涨了约36%。</p><p>  But that success has not trickled down to its vast work force of nearly 500,000 employees, a number of whom have reported being homeless, receiving government food stamps or relying on food banks to feed their families. A brief strike in Colorado last month by workers, represented by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, at dozens of Kroger-owned King Soopers locations brought renewed scrutiny to the issues of pay and working conditions for grocery workers, who have been on the front lines throughout the pandemic.</p><p>但这一成功并没有渗透到拥有近50万名员工的庞大劳动力队伍中，其中一些人报告称无家可归、领取政府食品券或依靠食品银行养活家人。上个月，以美国食品和商业工人联合会（United Food and Commercial workers Union）为代表的工人在科罗拉多州的几十家克罗格（Kroger）旗下的King Soopers工厂举行了一次短暂的罢工，重新审视了食品杂货工人的工资和工作条件问题，他们在疫情期间一直站在第一线。</p><p>  The Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group that surveyed more than 10,000 Kroger workers in Washington, Colorado and Southern California about their working conditions  for a report commissioned by four units of the food workers union, found that about 75 percent of Kroger workers said they were food insecure, meaning they lacked consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. About 14 percent said they were homeless or had been homeless in the previous year, and 63 percent said they did not earn enough money to pay for basic expenses every month.</p><p>经济圆桌会议是一个非营利性研究组织，它调查了华盛顿、科罗拉多和南加州的1万多名克罗格工人的工作条件，为食品工人工会四个单位委托编写的一份报告发现，大约75%的克罗格工人说他们没有食品安全保障，这意味着他们缺乏足够的食物来维持积极健康的生活。大约14%的人说他们无家可归或在前一年无家可归，63%的人说他们没有挣足够的钱来支付每个月的基本费用。</p><p> “There is a race to the bottom that’s been going on for a while with Walmart and other large retail stores, and also restaurants, and to reverse that trend is not easy,” said Daniel Flaming, president of the Economic Roundtable.</p><p>经济圆桌会议主席丹尼尔·弗拉明（Daniel Flaming）表示：“沃尔玛（Walmart）和其他大型零售店，以及餐馆，都在一段时间内竞相触底，扭转这一趋势并不容易。”。</p><p> Kroger was the sole employer for 86 percent of those surveyed, partly because more than half had schedules that changed at least every week, making it difficult to commit to another employer. About two-thirds said they were part-time workers, even though they wanted more hours. Keeping workers part time is  a strategy employers use to encourage turnover and reduce costs.</p><p>在86%的受访者中，克罗格是唯一的雇主，部分原因是超过一半的人的工作日程至少每周都有变化，这使得他们很难与另一位雇主合作。大约三分之二的人说他们是兼职工人，尽管他们想要更多的工作时间。让工人做兼职是雇主用来鼓励员工流动和降低成本的一种策略。</p><p> Kristal Howard, a spokeswoman for Kroger, said the report was “one-dimensional and does not tell the complete story.”</p><p>Kroger的女发言人克里斯塔尔·霍华德（Kristal Howard）表示，这份报告“是一维的，没有讲述全部情况”</p><p>  “Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first job, second chances and lifelong careers, and we’re proud to play this role in our communities,” she said. Ms. Howard added that the company had raised its national average hourly rate of pay to $16.68 from $13.66 in 2017, a 22 percent increase, and that its benefits package included health care, retirement savings, tuition assistance and on-demand access to mental health assistance.</p><p>她说：“克罗格为无数人提供了第一份工作、第二次机会和终身职业，我们为在我们的社区中发挥这一作用感到自豪。”。霍华德补充说，该公司已将全国平均时薪从2017年的13.66美元提高到16.68美元，增幅为22%，其福利包括医疗保健、退休储蓄、学费补助和按需获得精神健康援助。</p><p>  Some of the workers said that even though other retailers and fast food restaurants had started offering higher starting wages than Kroger, the company’s health insurance and retirement benefits, which the union negotiated, were more generous than what other employers offered. Other part-time Kroger workers say they stay on the job because they don’t want to lose their seniority and the chance for a full-time role.</p><p>一些员工表示，尽管其他零售商和快餐店开始提供比克罗格更高的起薪，但工会协商的该公司健康保险和退休福利比其他雇主提供的更慷慨。其他兼职克罗格员工表示，他们留在工作岗位是因为他们不想失去资历和全职工作的机会。</p><p> Despite some of the wage increases and benefits, working at a grocery store no longer provides the stable income and middle-class lifestyle that it did 30 years ago, workers say. The Economic Roundtable report studied contracts dating back to 1990 and said the most experienced clerks — known as journeymen — in Southern California made roughly $28 per hour in today’s dollars while working full-time schedules. Wages for top-paid clerks today are 22 percent lower, and those workers are far more likely to be working part-time hours.</p><p>工人们说，尽管工资和福利有所增加，但在杂货店工作已不再像30年前那样提供稳定的收入和中产阶级的生活方式。经济圆桌会议报告研究了可追溯到1990年的合同，并表示南加州最有经验的职员——被称为熟练工——在全职工作时，以今天的美元计算，大约每小时挣28美元。如今，高薪职员的工资降低了22%，而且这些工人更有可能从事兼职工作。</p><p> Ashley Manning, a 32-year-old floral manager at a Ralphs in San Pedro, Calif., works full time but is regularly strapped for cash. Ms. Manning, the single mother of a 12-year-old, said she had worked at Ralphs for nine years and earned $18.25 an hour. It took her four years to reach full-time status, which guarantees 40 hours per week and comes with an annual bonus ranging from $500 to $3,000.</p><p>32岁的阿什莉·曼宁（Ashley Manning）是加利福尼亚州圣佩德罗（San Pedro）一家拉尔夫（Ralphs）公司的花卉经理，她全职工作，但经常缺钱。曼宁是一个12岁孩子的单身母亲，她说自己在拉尔夫工作了九年，每小时挣18.25美元。她花了四年时间才成为全职员工，保证每周工作40小时，并获得500至3000美元不等的年度奖金。</p><p>  She said she struggled to pay rent and moved into her grandmother’s house after being evicted last spring. She has needed help from her family to help pay for a car. She has tried to make extra money through a party planning and decorating business, but demand for those services dried up in the pandemic.</p><p>她说，去年春天被驱逐后，她挣扎着付房租，搬进了祖母的房子。她需要家人帮忙买车。她曾试图通过派对策划和装饰业务赚取额外收入，但在疫情中，对这些服务的需求枯竭。</p><p> “I would think, ‘I have a good job and make decent money,’ and I don’t,” Ms. Manning said. “I’m still on the poverty level.”</p><p>曼宁说：“我会想，‘我有一份好工作，赚了不少钱’，但我没有。”。“我还处在贫困线上。”</p><p>  During the pandemic, grocery store workers have been recognized as essential to keeping society going, but they have also faced health risks. At least 50,600 grocery workers around the country have been infected with or exposed to the coronavirus, and at least 213 have died from the virus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.</p><p>在疫情期间，杂货店工作人员被认为是维持社会运转的关键，但他们也面临着健康风险。据联合食品和商业工人国际联盟（United Food and Commercial workers International Union）称，全国至少有5.06万名食品杂货工人感染或暴露于冠状病毒，至少有213人死于该病毒。</p><p> Ms. Manning was hospitalized for Covid-19 last summer. She blames herself for her grandmother’s subsequent death from the virus in August.</p><p>去年夏天，Manning 2019冠状病毒疾病住院。她为祖母随后在8月份死于该病毒而自责。</p><p>  “She was one of the people that would help me the most, if I was short on a bill or needed help, to pick my daughter up from school,” she said. But when her grandmother was in critical condition, Ms. Manning said, she was told that she couldn’t take more time off after being sick with Covid-19.</p><p>她说：“如果我缺钱或需要帮助，她是帮助我接女儿放学的最大的人之一。”。但当她的祖母2019冠状病毒疾病严重时，Manning女士说，她被告知在COVID-19患病后，她不能再休息。</p><p> The illness and the company’s response were jarring, given that corporate workers had the flexibility to work from home, she said, adding that she ultimately took disability leave for a stretch.</p><p>她说，鉴于企业员工有在家工作的灵活性，疾病和公司的反应令人不安。她补充说，她最终休了一段残疾假。</p><p> Kroger has one of the country’s  starkest gaps between a chief executive’s compensation and that of the median employee. Rodney McMullen, Kroger’s chief executive since 2014, earned $22.4 million in 2020, while the median employee earned $24,617 — a ratio of 909 to 1. The average C.E.O.-to-worker pay ratio in the S&amp;P 500 is 299 to 1, with grocery chains like Costco (193 to 1) and Publix (153 to 1) lower than that.</p><p>克罗格在首席执行官的薪酬和雇员中位数之间有着全国最明显的差距之一。自2014年起担任克罗格首席执行官的罗德尼·麦克马伦（Rodney McMullen）在2020年的收入为2240万美元，而中位员工的收入为24617美元，比例为909:1。S&amp；P500指数为299比1，好市多（Costco，193比1）和Publix（153比1）等食品连锁店的价格低于这一水平。</p><p> These disparities have fomented outrage among employees, who are also  dealing with issues like  fights over masks and theft and violence in stores.</p><p>这些差异在员工中激起了愤怒，他们也在处理口罩打架、商店盗窃和暴力等问题。</p><p>   In Colorado, more than 8,000 workers at the Kroger-owned King Soopers chain walked off the job last month when union contract negotiations broke down over wages, employee safety issues and scheduling.</p><p>在科罗拉多州，上个月，当工会合同谈判因工资、员工安全问题和日程安排而破裂时，Kroger旗下King Soopers连锁店的8000多名员工离职。</p><p> Around the time of the strike, a nonprofit publication, A More Perfect Union, published an  internal Kroger document in which the company acknowledged that one in five of its employees received government assistance in 2017. The document also included research showing that employee turnover was lower in places where it raised wages.</p><p>罢工发生前后，一份非营利出版物《更完美的工会》发表了一份内部克罗格文件，该公司在文件中承认，其五分之一的员工在2017年获得了政府援助。该文件还包括一项研究，表明在提高工资的地方，员工流动率较低。</p><p> In response, Kroger said it had developed an improvement plan after the analysis, which included the wage increase and steps to improve tuition assistance and retirement benefits. The company  commissioned its own study that stated last month that Kroger’s average pay and benefits in Colorado and three other Western states were higher than those of other retailers.</p><p>作为回应，克罗格表示，在分析之后，它已经制定了一个改进计划，其中包括提高工资以及改善学费补助和退休福利的措施。该公司委托进行了自己的研究，该研究上个月表示，克罗格在科罗拉多州和其他三个西部州的平均工资和福利高于其他零售商。</p><p> After more than a week of picketing, the union — Local 7 of the U.F.C.W. — won large concessions, including wage increases and a plan to move at least 500 part-time workers into full-time roles within a few months.</p><p>经过一周多的纠察，工会——联合会工会的第七个成员——赢得了巨大的让步，包括提高工资，并计划在几个月内将至少500名兼职工人转移到全职岗位。</p><p> As successful as the strike was for workers in Colorado, Larry Cohen, former president of the Communications Workers of America, said the contracts covered only employees at specific Kroger chains, making it difficult for unions to gain broader leverage.</p><p>美国通信工人协会（Communications workers of America）前主席拉里·科恩（Larry Cohen）说，尽管罢工对科罗拉多州的工人来说是成功的，但这些合同只涉及特定克罗格连锁店的员工，这使得工会很难获得更广泛的影响力。</p><p> “When all contracts are local, how do you deal with a giant national company?” Mr. Cohen said. “Not very well.”</p><p>“当所有合同都是本地合同时，你如何与一家大型国有公司打交道？”科恩说。“不太好。”</p><p> Kroger has tightly controlled labor expenses during the pandemic. The company offered hero pay and thank-you bonuses to workers in the early months of the pandemic but ended those well before vaccinations were available. (Grocery workers were also  not given priority for vaccinations in many states.) While some municipalities like Los Angeles and Seattle sought to institute hazard pay mandates, Kroger and grocery lobbying associations fought such efforts.</p><p>克罗格在大流行期间严格控制了劳动力开支。在大流行的最初几个月，该公司向员工提供英雄薪酬和感谢奖金，但在疫苗接种之前就结束了。（在许多州，食品杂货工人也没有优先接种疫苗。）虽然洛杉矶和西雅图等市政府试图制定危险津贴规定，但克罗格和食品杂货游说协会反对这种做法。</p><p>   Kroger’s resistance to wage increases peaked last year when the Los Angeles City Council approved a hazard pay mandate requiring large grocers and pharmacies to pay employees an additional $5 an hour for four months. In response, Kroger said it would close three stores in the area in May — two Ralphs locations and a Food 4 Less — blaming increased costs. The company pointed to a release at the time that said the stores were underperforming. But City Council members were left with the sense that the closures were retaliatory.</p><p>去年，洛杉矶市议会批准了一项危险津贴授权，要求大型杂货店和药店在四个月内每小时向员工额外支付5美元，克罗格对加薪的抵制达到顶峰。作为回应，克罗格表示，将于5月关闭该地区的三家门店——两家拉尔夫门店和一家Food 4门店，原因是成本增加。该公司指出，当时发布的一份公告称，这些门店表现不佳。但是，市议会成员感到关闭是报复性的。</p><p> Paul Koretz, a member of the Council, said he had dealt with backlash from some constituents about the impending closing of a Ralphs in his district, a go-to for the local Orthodox Jewish community. He said Ralphs representatives had warned him that they would close the store if the mandate was instituted.</p><p>该委员会成员保罗·科雷茨（Paul Koretz）表示，他已经处理了一些选民对他所在地区的拉尔夫教堂即将关闭的强烈反对，这是当地东正教犹太社区的一次尝试。他说，拉尔夫的代表警告他，如果授权成立，他们将关闭商店。</p><p> “I’m not sure I really believed that Ralphs would do it,” he said. “It just seemed so counterintuitive that you would mess with your very loyal customers.”</p><p>“我不确定我是否真的相信拉尔夫会这么做，”他说。“你会和非常忠诚的客户打交道，这似乎太违反直觉了。”</p><p> Shoppers in his district have adapted since the store closed. But he said he believed that the impact of the closings on employees and Council members’ fear of angering constituents probably had a chilling effect on other municipalities that were considering similar measures.</p><p>商店关门后，他所在地区的购物者已经适应了。但他说，他认为，关闭对雇员和委员会成员担心激怒选民的影响，可能对正在考虑采取类似措施的其他市政当局产生了寒蝉效应。</p><p> The mandated hazard pay gave many Kroger workers a glimpse of how their day-to-day lives could improve with more money. Areli Rivas, a part-time cashier at a Ralphs in Van Nuys, Calif., who is married to a full-time worker at the store, said the extra pay gave her “peace of mind.”</p><p>强制发放的危险津贴让许多克罗格工人看到，如果有更多的钱，他们的日常生活将如何改善。阿雷利·里瓦斯（Areli Rivas）是加利福尼亚州范纽斯（Van Nuys）一家拉尔夫百货公司的兼职出纳员，她与该店的一名全职员工结婚。她说，额外的工资让她“安心”</p><p>   The mother of two said it was hard to justify purchases like a new backpack for her son, even though his current one is fraying. More pay would also allow her to get her daughter a new glasses prescription.</p><p>这位两个孩子的母亲说，很难为儿子购买像新背包这样的东西辩护，尽管他现在的背包已经磨损了。更高的工资还可以让她给女儿开一张新的眼镜处方。</p><p> Some workers like Ms. Manning said that they couldn’t afford to shop at their store and that the employee discount of 10 percent applied only to Kroger-branded goods and did not always include produce and other essentials.</p><p>像曼宁这样的一些员工说，他们负担不起在商店购物的费用，10%的员工折扣只适用于克罗格品牌的商品，并不总是包括农产品和其他必需品。</p><p> Kroger said that the discount covered 19,000 private-label food products and that it did include dairy, proteins and produce.</p><p>克罗格说，这一折扣涵盖了19000种自有品牌食品，其中包括乳制品、蛋白质和农产品。</p><p> Pio Figueroa, 25, who has been working at a Ralphs in Laguna Beach, Calif., for about six years, said he was able to manage his monthly expenses now that he was among the highest earners in his store, making about $22.50 an hour. But at one point, he was making $15 or $16 per hour at the chain and struggled mightily.</p><p>25岁的皮奥·菲格罗亚（Pio Figueroa）在加利福尼亚州拉古纳海滩（Laguna Beach）的一家拉尔夫百货公司工作了大约六年。他说，现在他是店里收入最高的人之一，每小时的收入约为22.50美元，他能够管理好自己的每月开支。但有一次，他在这家连锁店每小时挣15或16美元，而且挣扎得很厉害。</p><p> “There were times I could only budget to spend $100 on food and everything a week,” he said. “So there were times I would go without a meal or definitely think, ‘What am I going to eat tonight?’”</p><p>他说：“有时候我一周只能花100美元买食物和其他东西。”。“所以有时候我会不吃饭，或者肯定会想，‘今晚我要吃什么？’”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/杂货店/">#杂货店</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/booms/">#booms</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/员工/">#员工</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
