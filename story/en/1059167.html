As a result I have accumulated a depth of water-heating knowledge as specifically relates to cooking stoves, at a time when it really does seem that this practical knowledge is in decline, and the average plumber appears to be getting less confident in this field.</p><p>       在过去十年中，我帮助解决了以奇怪的方式设置的似乎越来越多的热水系统，这些热水系统导致了令人满意的结果。因此，我积累了一种水加热知识的深度，具体涉及烹饪炉，当似乎这种实际知识在下降时，平均水管工似乎在这一领域似乎变得不那么自信。 </p><p> I have become increasingly frustrated to see people rely on tradesmen in good faith (and for good reason!) only to ultimately be left disappointed with a lacklustre system that, for want of just a few small changes, could and should have been great.

This simple principle is foundational to understanding everything that follows. Your system must be set up in such a way that allows the heated water to rise up to where it needs to go, and for the cooler water to be able to drop down to replace it – all without impedance.</p><p>  第一点：热量升起！这种简单的原则是了解所遵循的一切。您的系统必须以这样的方式设置，使加热的水升起到需要去的地方，以及冷却水能够下拉以更换它 - 所有没有阻抗。</p><p> Second point: when things heat up, they expand to occupy a larger volume. If there’s no space for this extra volume, pressure increases. If pressure increases enough,  things explode!   When water boils and turns to steam,  it expands dramatically; suddenly needing to occupy a  much greater volume of space as the liquid turns to gas. Understanding this is extremely important for managing the safety of the system. Your system must always have ways to safely deal with this potentially-rapid expansion.</p><p> 第二点：当事情升温时，它们会扩张以占据更大的体积。如果此额外的体积没有空间，则压力增加。如果压力足够增加，事情会爆炸！当水煮沸并转向蒸汽时，它会急剧扩张;突然需要占据更大的空间，因为液体转向气体。理解这对于管理系统的安全性非常重要。您的系统必须始终有方法安全地处理这种潜在的快速扩张。 </p><p> Third point: when it comes to heating water, fire that is generated by the burning of a solid fuel (like wood or coal) is known as an  ‘uncontrolled heat source’. This just means that it is not something you can quickly turn on or off; not even if you were to learn that your system was about to boil. This is the major difference between what we’re dealing with here with woodfire, and the more conventional methods of heating water that use a  controlled heat source (such as electricity or gas). Those types of controlled heat sources would simply switch off (automatically-via-thermostat) as soon as the water was sufficiently heated. We operate under different constraints; we cannot simply switch off our fire at will.</p><p>第三点：当谈到加热水时，通过燃烧固体燃料（如木材或煤）产生的火焰被称为“不受控制的热源”。这只是意味着它不是你可以快速打开或关闭的东西;即使您要了解您的系统即将煮沸。这是我们在这里与Woodfire处理的内容之间的主要区别，以及使用受控热源（例如电力或气体）的更传统的加热水方法。一旦水被充分加热，就可以简单地关闭（自动通过-VIR-ThermoStAt）的那些类型的受控热源。我们在不同的限制下运作;我们无法简单地关闭我们的火力。</p><p> The reality of not being able to simply ‘turn off’ a fire on demand makes the second point about rapid expansion all the more important to safely manage, and also means that things must be plumbed in a way that makes it impossible to have water come out your sanitary fixtures (bath, shower head or hand basins) at unsafe temperatures (no more than 55 ° C for sanitary fixtures here in New Zealand – kitchens or laundries are allowed to be hotter). This is achieved by the appropriate locating of temperature-reducing valves (a clever valve that mixes cold water into the hot if needed; thermostatic control automatically changes the amount of cold being introduced depending on the heat, in order to always deliver hot water that has been reduced to a predetermined temperature).</p><p> 无法简单地“关闭”火灾的现实使得第二个点是快速扩张的速度，更重要的是安全管理，也意味着事情必须以一种使得不可能有水来的方式被遏制在不安全温度下的卫生夹具（浴室，淋浴头或手盆）（在新西兰的卫生夹具中不超过55°C  - 厨房或洗衣店被允许更热）。这是通过适当定位的温度降低阀（一个巧妙的阀门将冷水混合到热处理中的巧妙的阀门来实现;恒温控制自动改变根据热量引入的冷却量，以便始终提供具有的热水被降低到预定温度）。</p><p>  Water jacket: this is the thing inside your wood burner that is heating the hot water. Here in New Zealand they are commonly called ‘wetbacks’ due to their (usual) location on the back wall of the firebox and the fact that they contain water. They come in different configurations (snaking or laddered pipe, or just simple containers) and materials, but whatever form these take, they will  always have the heated water exiting from the top (this is called the  flow  line) and cold water coming in at the base to be heated (this is called the  return  line). The water jacket is the lowest point of your system, and because heat rises, the heated water wants to escape from there to get higher.</p><p>  水夹克：这是你的木材燃烧器里面的东西，即加热热水。在新西兰，他们通常被称为“湿背”，因为它们的后壁在火箱的后壁上以及它们含水的事实。它们采用不同的配置（摇动或梯形管，或仅限简单的容器）和材料，但无论这些形式采取，它们都将始终使热水从顶部退出（这被称为流线）和冷水进入要加热的基础（这被称为返回线）。水夹克是你系统的最低点，因为热升高，加热的水想要从那里逃脱以获得更高。</p><p> Hot water cylinder: this is the tank that holds your reservoir of heated water. You have varying possible sizes, pressure configurations and connection types, but for now it is just important to understand that this is a large vessel (measured in the hundreds of litres) that will hold your heated water, ready for you to use it throughout the home. The water inside this will  stratify, thanks to the first point about heat rising, meaning that the higher parts of the cylinder will hold the hottest water, with the coolest water settling to the lowest part. With what we’re doing, the hot water cylinder will be located well  above your water jacket, allowing the heated water to leave the water jacket, travel up the flow line into the cylinder, displacing the cooler water which drops down the return line into the water jacket to be heated by our fire, in a continuous cycle of…</p><p> 热水缸：这是罐子握住储水箱的水箱。您有可能的尺寸，压力配置和连接类型，但现在明白这是一个很重要的是，这是一个大容器（在数百升中测量的），这将持有加热的水，准备好在整个过程中使用它家。这将在热上升的第一点进行分层，这意味着气缸的较高部分将保持最热的水，沉降到最低部分。随着我们所做的，热水缸将位于水夹克上方，允许加热的水离开水夹克，向圆柱进入圆柱体，使较冷的水置于返回管道中在我们的火中，我们的火夹在连续的循环中</p><p> Thermosyphoning: due to the principle of heated water rising, and the configuration of the water jacket that sees cold water entering at the base and hot water able to exit at the top, thermosyphoning is what we call the natural circulation that results. This all happens  without any pumps: it is  passive circulation. Cold water enters at the base of the water jacket, is heated by the fire, leaves the top of the water jacket, travels up along the flow line, enters your hot water cylinder, displaces water cooler than it, which then gets pushed down and out of the cylinder through the return line, enters the water jacket at the base, and so on. Circulation continues in this cycle for as long as we have a heat source warming the water to create heat differentials.</p><p> 热源性：由于加热的水上升原理，以及看到冷水进入底座和热水的水夹克，热水能够退出顶部，热源性是我们称之为的自然循环。这一切都会发生没有任何泵：它是被动循环。冷水进入水夹克的底座，被火加热，留下水夹克的顶部，沿着流量行进，进入你的热水缸，取代水冷却器比它更冷，然后被推下来通过返回线从气缸中出来，进入底座的水护套，等等。只要我们有一个热源将水加热以产生热差异，循环继续循环。</p><p> This is probably all we need for now. I’ll explain any new terms as they get introduced.</p><p> 这可能是我们现在所需要的。我会在介绍时解释任何新条款。</p><p>        The water jacket connects directly to a low pressure hot water cylinder, via the flow and return lines. We see the water being heated by the fire, leaving the water jacket and travelling upwards through the flow line to the cylinder. We see the water stratified in layers of heat. We see the coolest water dropping out the bottom of the cylinder, travelling through the return line to our water jacket.</p><p>        防水套直接通过流动和返回线连接到低压热水缸。我们看到火灾加热的水，留下水护套并通过流线向上行驶到气缸。我们看到水层层的水分层。我们看到最酷的水掉下了圆柱体的底部，穿过返回线到我们的水夹克。 </p><p> All the required elements to enable thermosyphoning are here: water jacket being heated by fire, hot water cylinder acting as storage vessel well above, flow and return line pipes communicating in a circuit between.</p><p>所有所需的元素都在此处：通过火，热水缸加热作为储存容器的水套，流量和返回管线在电路之间进行通信。</p><p> This is a completely  passive system with no pumps of any kind required to make this process happen. This is possible thanks to the fact that the hot water cylinder is located  above the water jacket, and the flow line pipe is constantly sloping  upwards. The greater the height difference and the steeper this flow line, the more positive the circulation. In this example, good circulation is further aided by the presence of an  internal riser pipe inside the cylinder, carrying the heated water up at least 2/3rds the height of the cylinder (less desirable, but also less common these days, would be the flow line directly entering up into the side of the cylinder).</p><p> 这是一个完全被动的系统，没有任何类型的泵，可以使这个过程发生。由于热水缸位于水套上方，这是可能的，流量管管道不断向上倾斜。高度差和陡峭的这条流线越大，循环越大。在该示例中，通过在气缸内部存在内部立管管的情况进一步辅助良好的循环，将加热的水携带至少2/3，圆柱体的高度（如此不太理想，也不常见，这将是流线直接进入圆筒侧面）。</p><p> If your plumber is already talking about the need for a circulating pump at this point,  stop. You do not want a circulating pump pushing water between your water jacket and your hot water cylinder – you want it to thermosyphon. Natural circulation through passive thermosyphoning happens at a  fluctuating rate that is perfectly matched to the stage of your fire: it circulates more slowly when the fire is getting established or dying down and speeds up when the fire is hotter. A circulating pump can (at best!) only ever approximate this. Set too aggressively, and a circulating pump can be cycling more cold water through the firebox than you want during the startup phase of your fire – excessively cooling things at a time when what you’re wanting is to be establishing good hot combustion temperatures in the thermal mass of the stove. Set too languidly, and a circulating pump will push water too slowly in the hotter stages of a fire, allowing the water in the jacket to overheat, or even boil. A circulating pump could do both – fire temperatures fluctuate, so a pump trying to take the middle road in order to average out the rate of flow is liable to do a poor job at both ends. You have no such concerns with a system that has been correctly set up to passively thermosyphon – the heat of the fire drives the rate of circulation, so flow rates  always match what your fire is doing.</p><p> 如果您的水管工已经谈到此时对循环泵的需求，请停止。您不希望循环泵推水在水夹克和热水缸之间 - 您希望它到热旋流器。通过被动热旋流的自然循环发生在波动的速度下，与火灾阶段完全匹配：当火灾成立或消亡时，它会更慢地循环并在火灾时速度加速。循环泵可以（充其量！）只有近似这个。太积极地设置，循环泵可以通过火箱循环比你想要的火箱更冷 - 在你的火灾阶段 - 过度冷却你想要的东西是建立良好的热燃烧温度炉子的热质量。设置得太粗糙，循环泵将在火的较热阶段推动水，允许夹克中的水过热，甚至煮沸。循环泵可以做两次 - 火温度波动，因此试图采取中间道路的泵，以平均出来的流动率在两端都有糟糕的工作。您没有与已被正确设置为被动热循环的系统的担忧 - 火灾的热量推动循环速度，因此流速总是符合您的火灾在线。</p><p> Moreover, this kind of circulating pump (now that you’ve made it integral to managing the flow passing through an uncontrolled heat source) introduces excessive complications and multiple points of possible failure: the pump itself, the electrical supply, and the vital thermostat(s) that control it all.  Just don’t do it.</p><p> 此外，这种循环泵（现在您已经使其成为管理通过不受控制的热源的流量而成的）引入了过度的并发症和可能的失效点：泵本身，电源和重要的恒温器（ S）控制它。只是不这样做。</p><p> A pump will likely be getting suggested due to your hot water cylinder being in  a poor location (eg: lower than the water jacket; or in a place where some sections of the hot flow line has to travel horizontally or even downwards; or a long distance from the water jacket; or all of this at once!). My strong advice is to  not proceed if this is the case. Sort out  a better location for your cylinder that will enable thermosyphoning, or where that’s not possible, reluctantly skip on water jacket heating altogether (sticking with standard  electric/gas/solar alternatives instead – we can always supply any of our stove models without a water jacket). You want the circuit between your water jacket and hot water cylinder to be passive – it is simply best, and I’ve seen enough convoluted systems relying on artificial circulation go wrong that I will never recommend the compromise. You do not want to be pumping anything through the water jacket in a Homewood. They are designed for passive circulation.</p><p> 由于您的热水缸处于差的位置（例如：低于水夹克的地方，可能会提出泵;或者在热流线的某些部分的地方水平或甚至向下行进;或者长距离水夹克的距离;或者所有这一切！）。如果是这种情况，我的强烈建议是不进行。为圆筒整理更好的位置，使热源性能够实现热源性，或者在那里不可能地跳过水夹克加热（用标准电/天然气/太阳能替代品粘贴 - 我们可以随时提供任何水夹克）。您希望水夹克和热水缸之间的电路是被动的 - 它是最好的，我看到足够的复杂系统依赖人工语流通犯错误，我永远不会推荐妥协。您不想在惠窗中通过水夹克抽水。它们专为被动循环而设计。</p><p>   You are heating water which is getting stored in your hot water cylinder, and you’re drawing this heated water off the  upper part of the cylinder any time you turn on a hot water tap (faucet) throughout your home. This leaves out the indicated domestic hot water line, and everything ‘downstream’ of this just follows standard household plumbing, irrespective of how the water has been heated (excepting the already-mentioned need for temperature-reducing valves to regulate the water down to safe temperatures, due to our dealing with an uncontrolled heat source).</p><p>   您是在热水缸中储存的加热水，随时随地在整个家中打开热水水龙头（水龙头），您可以将这个加热的水从气缸的上部汲取。这留出了所示的国内热水管线，而且其它一切都是“下游”的情况只是遵循标准的家用管道，无论水如何被加热（除了已经提到的温度降低阀门的需要将水调节到安全温度，由于我们处理不受控制的热源）。</p><p> Whenever you open a tap to draw off hot water, cold water enters in (cold supply) at the base of the cylinder to replace the volume you just drew off. This main supply line is at full pressure (‘mains pressure’): coming either direct from your street in town-supply situations, or from a header tank or a water pump/pressure tank. Because we are running a low pressure system here, this cold water has to come through a pressure-reducing valve (normally called an ‘ Ajax valve‘ here in NZ) which reduces the pressure of the incoming water down to match the system.</p><p> 每当您打开水龙头以绘制热水时，冷水在气缸底部进入（冷电源），以更换您刚刚汲取的音量。该主要供应管线处于全压（“主动压力”）：直接从街道供应情况，或从头箱或水泵/压力箱。由于我们在此运行低压系统，因此这种冷水必须通过减压阀（通常在NZ中称为“Ajax阀”），这将进入的排水的压力降低以匹配系统。 </p><p> Finally, we have our open vent: that thing sticking up out the top – the highest point of the system. This is tall enough that no water is spilling out the top of it, but low enough that if the Ajax valve was  not present (and so water was coming in to the system at full pressure), water would be spilling out this vent onto your roof. Most importantly: this open vent is low enough that in the event of your system boiling (and if you are consuming less hot water than your system is producing, temperatures within the cylinder  will continue to rise until it inevitably boils) steam will erupt out this vent in a dramatic geyser. This pressure determined by the height of your vent is known as the ‘head’ and your Ajax valve is set to match.</p><p>最后，我们有开放的通风口：那东西伸出顶部 - 系统的最高点。这足够高，没有水溢出它的顶部，但如果没有出现Ajax阀（并且水在全压力进入系统），那么水就会将此通风口洒到您的屋顶。最重要的是：这种打开的通风口足够低，在您的系统沸腾的情况下（如果您的耗材少于您的系统生产，那么气缸内的温度将继续上升，直到它不可避免地沸腾）蒸汽会爆发出来在戏剧间歇泉发泄。由通风口高度确定的压力被称为“头”，并且您的AJAX阀设置为匹配。</p><p> Were this open vent  not there, and your temperatures reached boiling point, the resulting pressure would cause an explosion. Either your water jacket, the plumbing in between, or your hot water cylinder itself would rupture. No matter the location of failure, this would be dangerous (and extremely messy), so everything we do plumbing-wise must ensure that any potential steam being produced by our uncontrolled heat source can  always escape out an open vent.</p><p> 这个通风口不在那里，你的温度达到沸点，所产生的压力会导致爆炸。无论是你的水套，介于两者之间的管道，或者你的热水缸本身都会破裂。无论发生故障的位置，这将是危险的（和极为凌乱的），所以我们做的一切都必须确保我们的不受控制的热源产生的任何潜在的蒸汽可以始终逃脱打开通风口。</p><p> So:  your water jacket must always be connected to an open-vented system. An open vent means low pressure – you must never circulate mains pressure water through the jacket.</p><p> 所以：你的水夹克必须始终连接到开放式系统。开放式通风口意味着低压 - 您必须永远不会通过夹克循环电源压力。</p><p> This is simple to achieve in a low pressure system like I’ve outlined, as the hot water cylinder  itself is open vented and we are connecting directly to it. Here in New Zealand, the pressure of the water coming in (set by the Ajax valve) to a low pressure system cannot exceed (but will likely be lower) 120 kPa, with an appropriately-sized head (cannot exceed 12.0 m) on the open vent to match.</p><p> 在我概述的低压系统中实现这很简单，因为热水缸本身打开，我们直接连接到它。在这里，在新西兰，进入的水的压力（由Ajax阀设定）到低压系统不能超过（但可能会降低）120kPa，具有适当尺寸的头部（不能超过12.0米）打开通风口匹配。</p><p> Boiling aside, that open vent also takes care of the differences in volume that water occupies at various temperatures; so you may sometimes hear a little water spilling out on to your roof as it heats up and expands, even when not yet up at boiling temperatures.</p><p> 抛弃，开放式通风口也负责水在各种温度下占用的体积差异;所以你有时可能会听到一点点水溢出到你的屋檐下，因为它加热并扩张，即使在沸腾的温度下也是如此。</p><p> Did you know? An interesting side-phenomenon I’ve observed: in a low pressure system you might sometimes notice the cylinder making tell-tale rumblings – that she’s about to boil! Thinking to prevent this from happening, you rush to turn on a hot tap (the cold replacement water entering the cylinder will cool things off so it doesn’t boil, right?) only to have the cylinder boil right at the very moment you turned the tap. A dramatic fountain of steam erupts out your open vent up on your roof! If only you’d been just a second sooner you could have prevented it.  Actually, no. What has happened is that the water inside the cylinder was already above 100 degrees C (the normal boiling point of water, if at atmospheric pressure). Because the system is under pressure from the head of the open vent, it takes higher temperatures in order for the water to vaporise. But by opening a tap, you relieved the pressure in the cylinder, and before the cold water ever had an opportunity to rush in and replace what you drew off, the already-above-boiling-temperature water instead expanded and turned to steam. It was going to boil anyway, but your pressure-release accelerated it! If you’re trying to prevent a rumbling cylinder from boiling, you are likely already too late.</p><p> 你知道吗？我观察到的一个有趣的一方现象：在低压系统中，您有时可能会注意到圆筒制作讲述的隆隆声 - 她即将煮沸！思考防止这种情况发生，你急于打开一个热点龙头（进入圆筒的冷替换水会凉爽的东西，所以它不会沸腾，对吧？）只有在你转动的那一刻起来右转水龙头。蒸汽的戏剧性喷泉爆发了你的屋顶上的打孔！如果你只有一秒钟就迟早只能阻止它。实际上，没有。发生了什么，汽缸内的水已经超过100摄氏度（水的正常沸点，如果在大气压下）。因为系统处于从开放式通风口的头部的压力下，所以它需要较高的温度，以便水蒸发。但是，通过打开一个水龙头，你可以减轻气缸中的压力，在冷水中有机会赶紧赶上并更换你的投掷，而不是沸腾的水，而是膨胀并转向蒸汽。无论如何，它会煮沸，但你的压力释放加速了！如果您试图防止沸腾的隆隆声，则可能已经太晚了。</p><p> So far, this hopefully has been pretty easy and straightforward to follow. This is the simplest (and usually the cheapest) option, and once-upon-a-time almost every home in this country was set up in this way (complete with coal range). But it does have a major downside that an increasing number of people find intolerable in this day-and-age (and the clue is in the name): low hot water pressure; namely  poor shower pressure.</p><p> 到目前为止，这有望一直非常容易和直截了当。这是最简单（通常是最便宜的）选项，并以这种方式设置了这个国家几乎每个房屋的一切时间（用煤层齐全）。但它确实有一个主要的缺点，即越来越多的人在这个日龄（和线索所在的名字）中发现越来越多的人：低热水压力;即淋浴压力不佳。 </p><p> If you’re used to this, or like the fact that low shower pressure means low water usage, great. You can stop here (or jump down to sections on  location,  size,  supplementing,  radiators and so on).</p><p>如果你已经习惯了，或者像低淋浴压力意味着低水分的事实一样。您可以在此处停止（或跳到位置，尺寸，补充，散热器等的部分）。</p><p> Upsides: simplest plumbing. Conserves the most water. Cheapest to install.  Downsides: poor water pressure! Unsatisfying showers. Struggles to push hot water long distances.</p><p> upsides：最简单的管道。保护最多的水。最便宜的安装。缺点：水压差！不满意的淋浴。努力推动热水长距离。</p><p> If you want stronger hot water pressure though, let’s complicate things a little and look at…</p><p> 如果你想要更强大的热水压力，让我们一点地复杂化东西，看看......</p><p>      In this type of system, your hot water is held at mains pressure (anything above 120 kPa here in NZ, but  usually 350 – 700 kPA) inside the cylinder, meaning that when you open a hot tap or turn on your shower, it forcefully comes gushing out at the same pressure you are used to from your cold water taps.</p><p>      在这种类型的系统中，您的热水在气缸内部的电源压力（在120 kPa以上120 kPa以上，但通常为350-700 kPa），这意味着当您打开热龙头或打开淋浴时，它有力地在相同的压力下涌出，你习惯了你的冷水水龙头。</p><p>   It’s pretty similar to what we’ve already seen: the water jacket remains the lowest point of the system, the hot water cylinder is raised well above. The flow and return lines are doing the same basic thing. We’re still drawing our domestic hot water off the top of the cylinder where the most heat stratifies, and introducing our cold supply in at the bottom.</p><p>   它非常类似于我们已经看到的：水护套仍然是系统的最低点，热水缸上面升高。流量和返回线正在做同样的基本事物。我们仍然将国内热水从最热烈分层的圆柱体上汲取，并在底部引入我们的冷供应。</p><p> But no longer is the water jacket connecting to the cylinder directly; now we have it forming a circuit with a  coil within the cylinder. And our open vent has shifted from the hot water cylinder over to this coil / water jacket circuit instead (remember: the water jacket must always be connected to an open vented system!). There’s no longer an Ajax valve reducing the pressure of the cold supply coming in to the cylinder; the water within is at mains pressure (hence the name again) – so it is unable to be open vented (or it would just all keep pouring out). The hot water cylinder instead has a relief valve (we’ve covered the risk of explosion, so this is a double failure valve: this relief valve opens on  either pressure or temperature and is known as a  TPR valve –   T emperature/  P ressure   R elief valve).</p><p> 但是，不再是直接连接到气缸的水夹克;现在我们已经形成了一个带有线圈内的电路。我们的打孔通风口从热水缸转移到该线圈/水夹克电路（记住：外夹克必须始终连接到开放式排放系统！）。不再有一个Ajax阀减少了进入圆柱体的冷电量的压力;内部的水在电源压力下（因此再次名称） - 所以它无法打开（或者它只是所有人都倒出）。热水圆筒代替具有浮雕阀（我们涵盖了爆炸的风险，因此这是一个双重故障阀：这种救济阀在压力或温度下打开，称为TPR阀门 -  T型阀/ P轨道R.灯管）。</p><p> This system is still passive – all my  objections to pumping through the jacket are still there</p><p> 这个系统仍然被动 - 我对通过夹克抽水的所有反对都仍然存在 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.homewoodstoves.co.nz/resources/heating-water-with-fire/">https://www.homewoodstoves.co.nz/resources/heating-water-with-fire/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/加热/">#加热</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/water/">#water</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/系统/">#系统</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
