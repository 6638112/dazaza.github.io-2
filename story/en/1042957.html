It was an inspiration to the first of the molecular biologists, and has been, along with Delbrück himself, credited for directing the research during the next decade that solved the mystery of how “like begat like.”</p><p>在1944年，马克斯·德尔布吕克（MaxDelbrück）明智地激发了欧文·施罗丁格（Erwin Schroedinger），出版了一本名为《什么是生命？这是第一个分子生物学家的灵感来源，并且与德尔布吕克本人一起被认为是在接下来的十年中指导研究工作的结果，解决了“像乞g一样”的谜团。</p><p> Max was awarded this Prize in 1969, and rejoicing in it, he also lamented that the work for which he was honored before all the peoples of the world was not something which he felt he could share with more than a handful.  Samuel Beckett‘s contributions in literature, being honored at the same time, seemed to Max somehow universally accessible to anyone. But not his. In his lecture here Max imagined his imprisonment in an ivory tower of science.</p><p> 麦克斯（Max）于1969年获得了该奖项，并为此感到欣喜，他也感叹他在世界上所有人民面前所获得的荣誉并不是他能与少数人分享的东西。塞缪尔·贝克特（Samuel Beckett）在文学方面的贡献同时受到了嘉奖，这似乎使马克斯（Max）以某种方式可以被所有人普遍使用。但不是他的。马克斯在这里的演讲中想象着他被囚禁在一座象牙科学塔中。</p><p> “The books of the great scientists,” he said, “are gathering dust on the shelves of learned libraries. And rightly so. The scientist addresses an infinitesimal audience of fellow composers. His message is not devoid of universality but it’s universality is disembodied and anonymous. While the artist’s communication is linked forever with it’s original form, that of the scientist is modified, amplified, fused with the ideas and results of others, and melts into the stream of knowledge and ideas which forms our culture. The scientist has in common with the artist only this: that he can find no better retreat from the world than his work and also no stronger link with his world than his work.”</p><p> 他说：“伟大科学家的著作正在学术图书馆的书架上积聚灰尘。是的。这位科学家向作曲家的无数观众致辞。他的信息并非没有普遍性，而是普遍性的体现和匿名。当艺术家的交流与原始形式永远联系在一起时，科学家的交流就被修改，放大，与他人的思想和成果融合在一起，并融合到形成我们文化的知识和思想流中。科学家与艺术家的共同点仅在于：他找不到比他的作品更好的世界退缩，也找不到比他的作品更牢固的与世界的联系。”</p><p> Well, I like to listen to the wisdom of Max Delbrück. Like my other historical hero,  Richard Feynman, who also passed through here, Max had a way of seeing directly into the core of things and clarifying it for the rest of us.</p><p> 好吧，我喜欢听听马克斯·德尔布吕克（MaxDelbrück）的智慧。就像我的另一位历史英雄理查德·费曼（Richard Feynman）一样，马克斯也有办法直接了解事物的核心，并为我们其他人阐明这一点。</p><p> But I am not convinced with Max that the joy of scientific creation must remain completely mysterious and unexplainable, locked away from all but a few esoterically informed colleagues. I lean toward Feynman in this matter. I think Feynman would have said, if you can understand it, you can explain it.</p><p> 但是我对麦克斯不相信，科学创造的乐趣必须保持完全神秘和无法解释，与除少数具有深奥知识的同僚之外的所有人保持隔离。在这件事上，我倾向于费曼。我想费曼会说，如果您能理解它，就可以解释它。</p><p> So I’m going to try to explain how it was that I invented the polymerase chain reaction. There’s a bit of it that will not easily translate into normal language. If that part weren’t of some interest to more than a handful of people here, I would just leave it out. What I will do instead is let you know when we get to that and also when we are done with it. Don’t trouble yourself over it. It’s esoteric and not crucial. I think you can understand what it felt like to invent PCR without following the details.</p><p> 因此，我将尝试解释我发明聚合酶链反应的方式。其中有些内容无法轻松翻译成普通语言。如果对这部分人感兴趣的只是少数几个人，那么我就省去了。相反，我要做的是让您知道何时达到目标以及何时完成目标。不要为此烦恼。这是深奥的，而不是至关重要的。我认为您无需了解细节即可了解发明PCR的感觉。</p><p> In 1953, when  Jim Watson and Francis Crick published the structure of DNA, Schroedinger’s little book and I were eight years old. I was too young to notice that mankind had finally understood how it might be that “like begat like.” The book had been reprinted three times. I was living in Columbia S.C., where no one noticed that we didn’t have a copy. But my home was a few blocks away from an undeveloped wooded area with a creek, possums, racoons, poisonous snakes, dragons, and a railroad track. We didn’t need a copy. It was a wilderness for me and my brothers, an unknown and unregimented place to grow up. And if we got bored of the earth, we could descend into the network of storm drains under the city. We learned our way around that dark, subterranean labyrinth. It always frightened us. And we always loved it.</p><p> 1953年，当吉姆·沃森（Jim Watson）和弗朗西斯·克里克（Francis Crick）发表DNA结构时，施罗丁格的小书和我八岁。我还太年轻，没有注意到人类终于了解了“像乞g一样”的样子。这本书被重印了三遍。我住在哥伦比亚特区哥伦比亚，那里没人注意到我们没有副本。但是我的家距未开发的林地只有几步之遥，那里有小河，负鼠，浣熊，毒蛇，龙和铁轨。我们不需要副本。对于我和我的兄弟们来说，这是一个旷野，一个未知而又毫无戒备的地方成长。如果我们对地球感到无聊，就可以进入城市下方的雨水渠网络。我们学习了如何绕过黑暗的地下迷宫。它总是使我们感到恐惧。我们一直都喜欢它。 </p><p> By the time Watson and Crick were being honored here in Stockholm in 1962, I had been designing rockets with my adolescent companions for three years. For fuel, we discovered that a mixture of potassium nitrate and sugar could be very carefully melted over a charcoal stove and poured into a metal tube in a particular way with remarkable results. The tube grew larger with our successive experiments until it was about four feet long. My mother grew more cautious and often her head would appear out of an upstairs window and she would say things that were not encouraging. The sugar was reluctantly furnished from her own kitchen, and the potassium nitrate we purchased from the local druggist.</p><p>沃森（Watson）和克里克（Crick）于1962年在斯德哥尔摩被授予荣誉时，我已经与青少年同伴设计了三年的火箭。对于燃料，我们发现硝酸钾和糖的混合物可以在木炭炉上非常小心地融化，然后以特殊的方式倒入金属管中，效果显着。随着我们的连续实验，试管变得更大，直到大约四英尺长。我母亲变得越来越谨慎，她的头常常会出现在楼上的窗户外面，她会说一些令人不快的事情。糖是从她自己的厨房里勉强提供的，硝酸钾是我们从当地的药剂师那里购买的。</p><p> Back then in South Carolina young boys seeking chemicals were not immediately suspect. We could even buy dynamite fuse from the hardware with no questions asked. This was good, because we were spared from early extinction on one occasion when our rocket exploded on the launch pad, by the very reliable, slowly burning dynamite fuses we could employ, coupled with our ability to run like the wind once the fuse had been lit. Our fuses were in fact much improved over those which Alfred Nobel must have used when he was frightening his own mother. In one of our last experiments before we became so interested in the maturing young women around us that we would not think deeply about rocket fuels for another ten years, we blasted a frog a mile into the air and got him back alive. In another, we inadvertently frightened an airline pilot, who was preparing to land a DC-3 at Columbia airport. Our mistake.</p><p> 当时在南卡罗来纳州，寻找化学物质的年轻男孩并没有立即受到怀疑。我们甚至可以毫无疑问地从硬件购买炸药保险丝。这很好，因为有一次我们可以使用非常可靠的，缓慢燃烧的炸药保险丝，再加上一旦保险丝被击穿，我们就可以像风一样运转，这使我们避免了火箭在发射台上爆炸时的早期灭绝。点燃。实际上，与Alfred Nobel吓own自己的母亲时必须使用的保险丝相比，我们的保险丝得到了很大的改进。在我们对周围成熟的年轻女人变得如此感兴趣以至于我们再也不想十年思考火箭燃料之前，我们的最后一项实验是，我们将一只青蛙抛向空中，让他复活了。在另一个案例中，我们无意中吓到了一位准备在哥伦比亚机场降落DC-3的航空公司飞行员。我们的错误。</p><p> At Dreher High School, we were allowed free, unsupervised access to the chemistry lab. We spent many an afternoon there tinkering. No one got hurt and no lawsuits resulted. They wouldn’t let us in there now. Today, we would be thought of as a menace to society. If I’m not mistaken, Alfred Nobel for a time was not allowed to practice his black art on Swedish soil. Sweden, of course, was then and still is a bit ahead of the United States in these matters.</p><p> 在Dreher高中，我们被允许免费，无监督地访问化学实验室。我们在那里度过了一个下午的时间。没有人受伤，也没有诉讼。他们不会让我们现在在那里。今天，我们被认为是对社会的威胁。如果我没记错的话，阿尔弗雷德·诺贝尔（Alfred Nobel）曾一度被禁止在瑞典的土地上练习他的妖术。当然，瑞典在当时和现在在这些问题上仍领先于美国。</p><p> I never tired of tinkering in labs. During the summer breaks from Georgia Tech, Al Montgomery and I built an organic synthesis lab in an old chicken house on the edge of town where we made research chemicals to sell. Most of them were noxious or either explosive. No one else wanted to make them, somebody wanted them, and so their production became our domain. We suffered no boredom and no boss. We made enough money to buy new equipment. Max Gergel, who ran Columbia Organic Chemicals Company, and who was an unusually nice man, encouraged us and bought most of our products, which he resold. There were no government regulators to stifle our fledgling efforts, and it was a golden age, but we didn’t notice it. We learned a lot of organic chemistry.</p><p> 我从不厌倦在实验室里摆弄东西。在佐治亚理工学院的暑假期间，我和Al Montgomery在小镇边缘的一栋旧鸡舍里建立了一个有机合成实验室，在那儿我们制造了研究用化学药品出售。他们大多数是有害的或具有爆炸性。没有人想要制造它们，有人想要它们，因此它们的生产成为我们的领域。我们没有感到无聊，也没有老板。我们赚了足够的钱来购买新设备。马克·格格尔（Max Gergel）是哥伦比亚有机化学公司的负责人，他是一个非常好人，他鼓励我们并购买了我们的大部分产品，然后转售。没有政府监管机构扼杀我们的雏形，这是一个黄金时代，但我们没有注意到。我们学到了很多有机化学。</p><p> By the time I left Georgia Tech for graduate school in biochemistry at the University of California at Berkeley, the genetic code had been solved. DNA did not yet interest me. I was excited by molecules. DNA before PCR was long and stringy, not really molecular at all. Six years in the biochemistry department didn’t change my mind about DNA, but six years of Berkeley changed my mind about almost everything else.</p><p> 当我离开佐治亚理工大学去加州大学伯克利分校的生物化学研究生院时，遗传密码已经解决了。 DNA尚未引起我的兴趣。我对分子感到兴奋。 PCR之前的DNA很长而且很严格，根本不是分子。在生物化学系工作的六年没有改变我对DNA的看法，但是伯克利大学的六年却改变了我对几乎所有其他一切的看法。</p><p> I was in the laboratory of Joe Neilands who provided his graduate students with a place to work and very few rules. I’m not even sure that Joe knew any rules except the high moral ground of social responsibility and tolerance. Not knowing that the department did have rules, I took astrophysics courses instead of molecular biology, which I figured I could learn from my molecular biologist friends. I published my first scientific paper in  Nature, in 1968. It was a sophomoric astrophysical hypothesis called “The Cosmological Significance of Time Reversal.” I think  Nature is still embarrassed about publishing it, but it was immensely useful to me when it came time for my qualifying examination. The committee would decide whether or not I would be allowed to take a Ph. D, without having taken molecular biology. And my paper in  Nature, helped them to justify a “yes.” In retrospect, the membership of that committee is intriguing.</p><p> 我当时在乔·尼兰兹（Joe Neilands）的实验室中，他为他的研究生提供了一个工作的地方，几乎没有规则。我什至不确定乔除了社会责任感和宽容的崇高道德基础外，是否知道其他任何规则。我不知道该部门确实有规定，所以我上了天体物理学课程，而不是分子生物学课程。我认为我可以向我的分子生物学家朋友学习。我于1968年在《自然》杂志上发表了我的第一篇科学论文。这是一种名为“时间逆转的宇宙学意义”的天体物理学天体假说。我认为《自然》杂志对于出版它仍然感到尴尬，但是当我参加资格考试时，这对我非常有用。该委员会将决定是否允许我在没有分子生物学的前提下获得博士学位。我在《自然》杂志上发表的论文帮助他们证明了“是”。回想起来，该委员会的成员很吸引人。</p><p> Don Glaser, who received this Prize in physics in 1960 at age 34, would later be one of the founders of Cetus Corporation, where I was working when I invented PCR. Henry Rapaport, who discovered psoralens would be the scientific advisor to my department at Cetus, and would co-author two patents with me. Alan Wilson, now sadly passed away, would be the first researcher outside of Cetus to employ PCR. And Dan Koshland would be the editor of Science when my first PCR paper was rejected from that journal and also the editor when PCR was three years later proclaimed Molecule of the Year. I passed. None of us, I think, as we walked out of that room, had any conscious inkling of the way things would turn out among us.</p><p> 唐·格拉瑟（Don Glaser）于1960年在34岁时获得物理学奖。后来，他成为Cetus Corporation的创始人之一，当我发明PCR时，我就在那里工作。亨利·拉帕波特（Henry Rapaport）发现补骨脂素将是我在Cetus部门的科学顾问，并将与我共同撰写两项专利。现在不幸去世的艾伦·威尔逊（Alan Wilson）将成为Cetus之外第一个使用PCR的研究人员。当我的第一篇PCR论文被该杂志拒绝时，丹·科什兰（Dan Koshland）将担任《科学》杂志的编辑；三年后，PCR被《年度分子》评为“年度分子”时，他将担任《科学》杂志的编辑。我通过了。我认为，当我们走出那个房间时，没有人意识到事情在我们中间发生的方式。 </p><p> In Berkeley it was a time of social upheaval and Joe Neilands was the perfect mentor to see his people through it with grace. We laughed a lot over tea at four every afternoon around a teakwood table that Joe had brought from home and oiled once a month. Our lab had an ambience that was special. I decided to become a neurochemist. Joe was the master of microbial iron transport molecules. It wasn’t done like that in most labs, where the head of the lab would prefer that you help advance his career by elaborating on some of his work. Not so with Neilands. As long as I wrote a thesis and got a degree, he didn’t care what else I did, and I stayed in his lab happily, following my own curiosity even if it carried me into music courses, for as long as Joe thought we could get away with it. The department was paying me a monthly stipend from the NIH, and eventually, Joe knew, I would have to leave.</p><p>在伯克利，那是一个社会动荡的时期，乔·尼兰兹（Joe Neilands）是一个优雅的导师，可以看到他的人民度过优雅的时光。每天下午四点，我们在乔从家里带来的柚木桌子旁喝茶，每个月都笑了很多。我们实验室的氛围很特别。我决定成为一名神经化学家。乔是微生物铁转运分子的大师。在大多数实验室中，情况并非如此，在实验室中，实验室负责人宁愿您通过阐述他的一些工作来帮助他发展事业。 Neilands并非如此。只要我写了论文并获得学位，他就不在乎我做了什么，我一直很高兴地呆在他的实验室里，尽管我一直怀着好奇心，即使这使我进入了音乐课程，只要乔认为我们可以摆脱它。该部门每月向我收取NIH的津贴，乔终于知道，我必须离开。</p><p> After six years I headed east with a Ph. D. and confidence in my education. My wife of a few months went to Kansas to go to medical school and I followed her there. That was 1972.</p><p> 六年后，我带着博士学位和对自己的学业充满信心向东方进发。我几个月的妻子去堪萨斯州读医学院，然后我跟随她去了那里。那是1972年。</p><p> I had made no professional plans that would work in Kansas, so I decided to become a writer. I discovered pretty quickly that I was far too young. I didn’t know anything yet about tragedy, and my characters were flat. I didn’t know how to describe a mean spririt in terms someone else could believe.</p><p> 我没有制定在堪萨斯州可行的专业计划，所以我决定成为一名作家。我很快发现我还太年轻。我对悲剧一无所知，我的角色平淡无奇。我不知道如何用别人可能会相信的术语来描述平均水平。</p><p> So I had to get a job as a scientist. I found one at the medical school working with two pediatric cardiologists and a pathologist. It was a very fortunate accident. For one thing pediatricians are always the nicest doctors, and for another thing these doctors were very special: Leone Mattioli, whose wife could cook, Agostino Molteni and Richard Zakheim. For two years I did medical research, learned how to appreciate Old World values from two Italians and a New York Jew, and learned human biology for the first time.</p><p> 所以我必须找到一份科学家的工作。我在医学院找到了一名与两名小儿心脏病专家和一名病理学家一起工作的人。这是一次非常幸运的事故。一方面，儿科医生一直是最好的医生，另一方面，这些医生也很特别：利昂·马蒂奥利（Leone Mattioli）可以做饭，他的妻子是Agostino Molteni和Richard Zakheim。两年来，我进行了医学研究，从两个意大利人和一个纽约犹太人那里学会了如何欣赏旧世界的价值观，并且第一次学习了人类生物学。</p><p> Marriage over, I returned to Berkeley, working for a time in a restaurant and then at the University of California at San Francisco killing rats for their brains. I saw Max Delbrück talk, but I don’t think I understood the significance of who he was, nor was I influenced to go into molecular biology by him. I was working on the enkephalins.</p><p> 结婚后，我回到伯克利，在一家餐馆工作了一段时间，然后在旧金山的加利福尼亚大学工作，杀死了老鼠的大脑。我看到了马克斯·德尔布吕克（MaxDelbrück）的演讲，但我认为我不了解他是谁的重要性，也没有受到他影响进入分子生物学的影响。我正在研究脑啡肽。</p><p> But then there was a seminar describing the synthesis and cloning of a gene for somatostatin. That impressed me. For the first time I realized that significant pieces of DNA could be synthesized chemically and that they were likely to be very exciting. I started studying DNA synthesis in the library. And I started looking for a job making DNA molecules.</p><p> 但是随后有一个研讨会描述了生长抑素基因的合成和克隆。那让我印象深刻。我第一次意识到，重要的DNA片段可以化学合成，而且很可能令人兴奋。我开始在该库中研究DNA合成。我开始寻找一份工作来制造DNA分子。</p><p> Cetus hired me in the fall of 1979. I worked long hours and enjoyed it immensely. DNA synthesis was much more fun than killing rats, and the San Francisco Bay Area was a good place to be doing it. There were a number of biotechnology companies and several academic groups working on improving the synthesis methods for DNA. Within two years, there was a machine in my lab from Biosearch of San Rafael, California, turning out oligonucleotides much faster than the molecular biologists at Cetus could use them. I started playing with the oligonucleotides to find out what they could do.</p><p> 塞图斯（Centus）在1979年秋天雇用了我。我工作了很长时间，非常享受。 DNA合成比杀死老鼠要有趣得多，旧金山湾区是这样做的好地方。有许多生物技术公司和几个学术团体致力于改善DNA的合成方法。在两年之内，我的实验室里有一台来自加利福尼亚州圣拉斐尔市的Biosearch公司的机器，它所产生的寡核苷酸比Cetus的分子生物学家使用它们的速度快得多。我开始研究寡核苷酸，以发现它们可以做什么。 </p><p> The lab next door to me was run by Henry Erlich and was working on methods for detecting point mutations. We had made a number of oligonucleotides for them. I started thinking about their problem and proposed an idea of my own which they ended up calling oligomer restriction. It worked as long as the target sequence was fairly concentrated, like a site on a purified plasmid, but it didn’t work if the site was relatively rare, like a single copy gene in human DNA.</p><p>我隔壁的实验室是由亨利·埃利希（Henry Erlich）经营的，并且正在研究检测点突变的方法。我们为它们制作了许多寡核苷酸。我开始考虑他们的问题，并提出了自己的想法，他们最终称其为低聚物限制。只要目标序列相当集中（如纯化质粒上的一个位点），它就起作用，但如果该位点相对稀少（如人类DNA中的单拷贝基因），则该序列不起作用。</p><p> I apologize to those of you who just got lost, but I do have to say a few things now that are going to be difficult. I will get back to the story in a few minutes.</p><p> 我对那些迷路的人表示歉意，但是现在我不得不说几件事将变得很困难。我将在几分钟后回到这个故事。</p><p> The oligomer restriction method also relied on the fact that the target of interest contained a restriction site polymorphism, which kept it from being universally applicable to just any point mutation. I started thinking about doing some experiments wherein an oligonucleotide hybridized to a specific site could be extended by DNA polymerase in the presence of only dideoxynucleoside triphosphates. I reasoned that if one of the dideoxynucleoside triphosphates in each of four aliquots of a reaction was radioactive then a analysis of the aliquots on a gel could indicate which of the dideozynucleoside triphosphates had added to the hybridized oligonucleotide and therefore which base was adjacent to the three prime end of the oligonucleotide. It would be like doing Sanger sequencing at a single base pair.</p><p> 低聚物限制方法还依赖于这样的事实，即感兴趣的靶标含有限制性位点多态性，这使其不能普遍适用于任何点突变。我开始考虑做一些实验，其中仅在双脱氧核苷三磷酸存在下，可通过DNA聚合酶延伸与特定位点杂交的寡核苷酸。我认为，如果反应的四个等分试样中的每一个的双脱氧核苷三磷酸之一都具有放射性，那么对凝胶上的等分试样进行分析可以表明哪一个双脱氧核苷三磷酸已添加到杂交的寡核苷酸中，因此哪个碱基与三个寡核苷酸相邻寡核苷酸的引物末端。就像在单个碱基对上进行Sanger测序一样。</p><p> On human DNA, it would not have worked because the oligonucleotide would not have specifically bound to a single site. On a DNA as complex as human DNA it would have bound to hundreds or thousands of sites depending on the sequence involved and the conditions used. What I needed to make this work was some method of raising the relative concentration of the specific site of interest. What I needed was PCR, but I had not considered that possibility. I knew the difference numerically between five thousand base pairs as in a plasmid and three billion base pairs as in the human genome, but somehow it didn’t strike me as sharply as it should have. My ignorance served me well. I kept on thinking about my experiment without realizing that it would never work. And it turned into PCR.</p><p> 在人类DNA上，它不会起作用，因为寡核苷酸不会特异性结合到单个位点。在与人类DNA一样复杂的DNA上，它会结合成百上千个位点，具体取决于所涉及的序列和所用条件。我需要做的是某种提高感兴趣的特定位点的相对浓度的方法。我需要的是PCR，但我没有考虑过这种可能性。我知道一个质粒中的5000个碱基对与人类基因组中的30亿个碱基对之间的数值差异，但是不知何故，它并没有像我应该的那样对我产生太大的影响。我的无知使我受益匪浅。我一直在思考我的实验，却没有意识到它永远都行不通。然后变成了PCR。</p><p> One Friday night I was driving, as was my custom, from Berkeley up to Mendocino where I had a cabin far away from everything off in the woods. My girlfriend, Jennifer Barnett, was asleep. I was thinking. Since oligonucleotides were not that hard to make anymore, wouldn’t it be simple enough to put two of them into the reaction instead of only one such that one of them would bind to the upper strand and the other to the lower strand with their three prime ends adjacent to the opposing bases of the base pair in question. If one were made longer than the other then their single base extension products could be separated on a gel from each other and one could act as a control for the other. I was going to have to separate them on a gel anyway from the large excess of radioactive nucleosidetriphosphate. What I would hope to see is that one of them would pick up one radioactive nucleotide and the other would pick up its complement. Other combinations would indicate that something had gone wrong. It was not a perfect control, but it would not require a lot of effort. It was about to lead me to PCR.</p><p> 一个星期五晚上，按照我的习惯，我从伯克利开车到门多西诺，那里有一间客舱，远离树林中的一切。我的女友珍妮弗·巴内特（Jennifer Barnett）睡着了。我刚在想。由于不再难于制造寡核苷酸，将两个寡核苷酸而不是仅一个寡核苷酸放进反应中是否足够简单，以至于它们中的一个可以与上链结合，而另一个则与它们的下链结合在一起邻近所述碱基对的相对碱基的主要末端。如果一个比另一个更长，那么它们的单碱基延伸产物可以在凝胶上彼此分离，并且一个可以作为另一个的对照。无论如何，我将不得不在凝胶上将它们与过量的放射性核苷三磷酸分开。我希望看到的是，其中一个会拾取一个放射性核苷酸，而另一个会拾取其互补序列。其他组合将表明出现了问题。这不是一个完美的控制，但不需要太多的努力。这将导致我进入PCR。</p><p> I liked the idea of a control that was nearly free in terms of cost and effort. And also, it would help use up the oligonucleotides that my lab could now make faster than they could be used.</p><p> 我喜欢在成本和精力上几乎免费的控件的想法。而且，这将有助于耗尽我实验室现在可以比使用的寡核苷酸更快的寡核苷酸。</p><p> As I drove through the mountains that night, the stalks of the California buckeyes heavily in blossom leaned over into the road. The air was moist and cool and filled with their heady aroma.</p><p> 那天晚上，当我开车穿过群山时，大量盛开的加州七叶树的茎向路倾斜。空气湿润凉爽，充满了令人愉悦的香气。 </p><p> Encouraged by my progress on the thought experiment I continued to think about it and about things that could possibly go wrong. What if there were deoxynucleoside triphosphates in the DNA sample, for instance? What would happen? What would happen, I reasoned, is that one or more of them would be added to the oligonucleotide by the polymerase prior to the termination of chain elongation by addition of the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate, and it could easily be the wrong dideoxynucleoside triphosphate and it surely would result in an extension product that would be the wrong size, and the results would be spurious. It would not do. I needed a way to insure that the sample was free from contamination from deoxynucleoside triphosphates. I could treat the sample before the extension reaction with bacterial alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme would degrade any triphosphates present down to nucleosides which would not interfere with the main reaction, but then I would need to “deactivate the phosphatase before adding the dideoxynucleoside triphosphates and everyone knew at that time that BAP, as we called it, was not irreversibly denaturable by heat. The reason we knew this was that the renaturation of heat denatured BAP had been demonstrated in classic experiments that had shown that a protein’s shape was dictated by it’s sequence. In the classical experiments the renaturation had been performed in a buffer containing lots of zinc. What had not occurred to me or apparently many others was that BAP could be irreversibly denatured if zinc was omitted from the buffer, and that zinc was not necessary in the buffer if the enzyme was only going to be used for a short time and had its own tightly bound zinc to begin with. There was a product on the market at the time called matBAP wherein the enzyme was attached to an insoluble matrix which could be filtered out of a solution after it had been used. The product sold because people were of the impression that you could not irreversibly denature BAP. We’d all heard about, but not read, the classic papers.</p><p>在思想实验方面取得进步的鼓舞下，我继续思考和思考可能出错的事情。例如，如果DNA样品中存在脱氧核苷三磷酸，该怎么办？会发生什么？我认为，将会发生的是，在通过添加双脱氧核苷三磷酸来终止链延长之前，通过聚合酶将它们中的一个或多个添加到寡核苷酸中，这很可能是错误的双脱氧核苷三磷酸，而且肯定会导致扩展产品的尺寸错误，并且结果是虚假的。它不会。我需要一种确保样品不受脱氧核苷三磷酸污染的方法。在延伸反应之前，我可以用细菌碱性磷酸酶处理样品。该酶会降解存在的三磷酸直至核苷，而不会干扰主要反应，但随后我需要“在添加双脱氧核苷三磷酸之前使磷酸酶失活，那时每个人都知道我们所说的BAP并不受热不可逆地变性。我们知道的原因是，热变性BAP的复性已在经典实验中得到证明，该实验表明蛋白质的形状由其序列决定。在经典实验中，已在含有大量锌的缓冲液中进行了复性。对我或显然其他许多人没有发生过的事情是，如果从缓冲液中省略锌，BAP可能会不可逆地变性，并且如果酶仅在短时间内使用并具有其酶，则在缓冲液中不需要锌首先要拥有紧密结合的锌。当时市场上有一种名为matBAP的产品，其中酶附着在不溶性基质上，使用后可将其从溶液中滤除。之所以出售该产品，是因为人们给您留下了无法不可逆转地变性BAP的印象。我们都听说过，但没有读过经典论文。</p><p> This says something about the arbitrary way that many scientific facts get established, but for this story, it’s only importance is that, had I known then that BAP could be heat denatured irreversibly, I may have missed PCR. As it was, I decided against using BAP, and tried to think of another way to get rid of deoxynucleoside triphosphates. How about this, I thought? What if I leave out the radioactive dideoxynucleoside triphosphates, mix the DNA sample with the oligonucleotides, drop in the polymerase and wait? The polymerase should use up all the deoxynucleoside triphosphates by adding them to the hybridized oligonucleotides. After this was complete I could heat the mixture, causing the extended oligonucleotides to be removed from the target, then cool the mixture allowing new, unextended oligonucleotides to hybridize. The extended oligonucleotides would be far outnum- bered by the vast excess of unextended oligonucleotides and therefore would not rehybridize to the target to any great extent. Then I would add the dideoxynucleoside triphosphate mixtures, and another aliquot of polymerase. And now things would work.</p><p> 这说明了建立许多科学事实的任意方式，但是对于这个故事，唯一重要的是，如果我那时知道BAP可能会发生不可逆的热变性，那么我可能错过了PCR。原来是这样，我决定不使用BAP，而是尝试思考另一种摆脱三磷酸脱氧核苷的方法。我觉得呢？如果我遗漏了放射性双脱氧核苷三磷酸，将DNA样品与寡核苷酸混合，放入聚合酶中等待，该怎么办？聚合酶应通过将其添加到杂交的寡核苷酸中来耗尽所有的三磷酸脱氧核苷。完成此操作后，我可以加热混合物，使延伸的寡核苷酸从靶标中移出，然后冷却混合物，使新的未延伸的寡核苷酸杂交。延伸的寡核苷酸将远远超过未延伸的寡核苷酸的数量，因此不会在很大程度上重新杂交至靶标。然后，我将添加双脱氧核苷三磷酸混合物和另一等分聚合酶。现在一切正常。</p><p> But what if the oligonucleotides in the original extension reaction had been extended so far they could now hybridize to unextended oligonucleotides of the opposite polarity in this second round. The sequence which they had been extended into would permit that. What would happen?</p><p> 但是，如果原始延伸反应中的寡核苷酸已经延伸到现在，它们现在可以在第二轮中与极性相反的未延伸寡核苷酸杂交。他们扩展到的顺序将允许这样做。会发生什么？</p><p> EUREKA!!!! The result would be exactly the same only the signal strength would be doubled.</p><p> EUREKA ！！！结果将是完全相同的，只是信号强度将加倍。</p><p> EUREKA again!!!! I could do it intentionally, adding my own deoxynucleoside triphosphates, which were quite soluble in water and legal in California.</p><p> EUREKA再次！！！我可以有意地做，添加自己的脱氧核苷三磷酸，它们在水中非常易溶并且在加利福尼亚合法。</p><p> And again, EUREKA!!!! I could do it over and over again. Every time I did it I would double the signal. For those of you who got lost, we’re back! I stopped the car at mile marker 46,7 on Highway 128. In the glove compartment I found some paper and a pen. I confirmed that two to the tenth power was about a thousand and that two to the twentieth power was about a million, and that two to the thirtieth power was around a billion, close to the number of base pairs in the human genome. Once I had cycled this reaction thirty times I would be able to the sequence of a sample with an immense signal and almost no background.</p><p> 再次，EUREKA ！！！我可以一遍又一遍地做。每次这样做，我都会加倍信号。对于那些迷路的人，我们回来了！我将汽车停在128号高速公路上的46.7英里处。在手套箱中，我发现了一些纸和一支笔。我证实十分之二的幂大约是一千，二十之二的幂大约是一百万，而十分之二的十进制大约是十亿，接近人类基因组中碱基对的数量。一旦我将这个反应循环了三十次，我就可以对一个信号很大且几乎没有背景的样品进行测序。</p><p> Jennifer wanted to get moving. I drove on down the road. In about a mile it occurred to me that the oligonucleotides could be placed at some arbitrary distance from each other, not just flanking a base pair and that I could make an arbitrarily large number of copies of any sequence I chose and what’s more, most of the copies after a few cycles would be the same size. That size would be up to me. They would look like restriction fragments on a gel.</p><p> 珍妮佛想要动起来。我沿着这条路开车。在大约一英里的距离内，我发现寡核苷酸可以相互之间以任意距离放置，而不仅是碱基对的侧面，而且我可以随意选择任意序列的大量拷贝，而且，大多数几个周期后的副本将具有相同的大小。这个大小取决于我。它们看起来像凝胶上的限制性片段。 </p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1993/mullis/lecture/">https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1993/mullis/lecture/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/诺贝尔/">#诺贝尔</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/发明家/">#发明家</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/prize/">#prize</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
