IBM\u2019s initial work paid dividends a few months later when the company launched its\u00a0 Security Homomorphic Encryption Services\u00a0in December 2020.\n But other tech giants have also taken steps towards researching and adopting FHE into their applications.\n For example,\u00a0 Intel\u00a0began last year researching the possibility of adopting FHE to bolster its confidential computing offerings. Its initial research yielded results this year when, in March, the company\u00a0 signed an agreement\u00a0with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to work on developing new FHE-based technologies together with the US military research agency and Microsoft.\n Microsoft was included in the DARPA project because the company has been\u00a0 one of the earliest adopters of FHE, which it currently uses to\u00a0 handle passwords in its Edge browser, and which the company has also\u00a0 included in ElectionGuard, an open-source voting machine software kit it released back in July 2019.\n Nevertheless, despite these early steps and support from some of the world\u2019s largest tech firms, FHE is still in its infancy, both\u00a0 as a standard\u00a0and in terms of adoption, and it will take at least a few more years before the technology makes into day-to-day apps and enterprise applications.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 19:41:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org",

few ways you can easily try Hasura with SQL Server in just a few minutes:\n       Run powerful queries with support for nested filtering, sorting and SQL Server types like GIS.\n   Create granular model-level RLS style authorization rules to secure the GraphQL API for internal or external consumers.\n      Hasura compiles the GraphQL query to a single SQL query, including a predicate push-down of authorization rules, preventing typical N+1 problems while fetching data.\n Hasura also uses JSON aggregations to avoid fetching a cartesian product from the database and avoids unnecessary Ser/De overhead.\n                 Extend the GraphQL API and add custom business logic in any language or framework by adding your own resolvers as REST or GraphQL APIs\n  Modern workloads in the cloud or end-user web/mobile apps need a flexible and secure API over HTTP to access data\n Use Hasura to to get a data API instantly, instead of having to build and maintain an API server\n    Once the Hasura service starts running, you can dynamically configure its metadata. This configuration is achieved through using a UI, or using an API call, or using code in a git repo to integrate with your CI/CD pipeline.\n The metadata captures connection configuration to upstream data sources, relationships between models, and their authorization policies.Using this, Hasura generates a GraphQL schema and presents a GraphQL API that can be consumed.\n Hasura takes incoming GraphQL API calls over HTTP and then compiles that into a T-SQL query, including authorization policies with a predicate push-down.\n  Because of its compiler-like architecture Hasura can avoid N+1 issues entirely. It can memoize aggressively, and issue the minimal number of hits to upstream data sources.\n   Instead of resolving a GraphQL query piece by piece, Hasura tries to compile parts of the query to a single data source, into a single query that an upstread source can understand - in this case, a SQL query for SQL Server.\n This is especially impactful when dealing with authorization rules since they can be compiled into the same query as the data fetch instead of having to make multiple requests to the data source.\n  Hasura runs the JSON aggregation in the database. This prevents serialisation/deserialisation overhead and transfers much lesser data over the wire from the database as compared to a join which returns a cartesian product.\n  Hasura also performs connection pooling, since it runs as a service, and also leverages prepared statements automatically.\n This allows the entire GraphQL + data fetch querying and planning process to be as efficient as possible since only variables (parameters or session variables) are processed and the queries at different layers have already been processed and planned.\n  Hasura generates a GraphQL API on tables and views - with support for stored procedures and functions coming soon. This allows evolution of the underlying data model without affecting the generated GraphQL API.\n  Users can add authorization rules that restrict access to particular entities (or rows) and their fields (columns). These authorization rules combine properties of the data that is being accessed with properties of the session of an API request.\n Hasura can extract session information from JWT claims or from a webhook. This allows Hasura to accept end-user API calls directly and process them securely.  Read the docs for more information on how it works.\n Here are a few examples of types of authorization rules that can be implemented with Hasura:\n  # Allow access to a music track if the track&#39;s album&#39;s artist_id is the current user role:  user table:  tracks permission:  tracks.album.artist_id = session.user_id\n  This allows Hasura users to create specific subgraphs for particular application roles or scopes # For &#39;public&#39; scope, allow access only to the id and username fields role:  public table:  profile permission:  fields:  [id, username]  # For the &#39;private&#39; scope, allow access to all fields, but only if the session user is the owner of that data role:  private table:  profile permission:  fields:  [id, username, email]  rule:  profile.id = session.user_id\n  Comparing column values allows access to be controlled by a dynamically changing value in another part of the database\n This makes modelling things like &#34;access tiers&#34; in a subscription plan, or a lookup from a dynamic ACL table very simple\n  Hasura composes roles preserving row and field level access using a &#34;cell based nullification&#34; merge algorithm\n This allows Hasura users to specifcy different levels of ownership and visibility on the same data models easily\n Example: Allow a user to fetch all the fields of their own profile, but only some data for profiles that aren&#39;t theirs # Role 1 private:  user can access their own data, and all fields of that data: [id, email, username]  # Role 2 public:  user can access anyone&#39;s data, but only id and username  # Role3 = Role1 + Role 2 user:  [public, private]  # the user role can now safely be assigned to all logged-in users\n     If you&#39;d like to see how Hasura + SQL server can work for your team  contact us via our website.\n      #7074 Mutations: Run inserts, updates, deletes, stored procedures and transactions securely on SQL Server over a GraphQL API\n #7075 Event triggers: Trigger HTTP webhooks with atomic capture and atleast once guarantee whenever data changes inside the database  (read more)\n #7076 Remote Joins: Join models in SQL Server to models from other API services (GraphQL or REST)\n Please do upvote / subscribe to the issues above to stay updated!

", "note_en": "We obviously have a lot to talk about when it comes to the game changes we recently did, or plan to do, but we don&#39;t want to share any of it yet.\n  Yet, there is currently a topic very relevant to us and we can share it without revealing any specific changes to the game. Today&#39;s post will be quite technical and related to programming, so if you just came for the game news, you can safely skip this one.\n    Now that there are only developers here, I can share my new discovery of Uncle Bob and his  really nice explanation of some of the fundamental principles related to programming project management, and more. If you have 8.5 free hours on your hands, I propose you watch it, as there will be some references to what he mentions later on.\n  My general thought was, that we maintain the quality of the code to be quite high, and we have a reasonably good work methodology. But we were the victims of selective blindness in many places actually. It is interesting, how some pieces code were just good from start and stayed pretty good throughout all the years, even when it was expanded a lot... and some of the code just deteriorated heavily.\n    What is a wax foundation and how is it related to programming you might ask? My grandfather was a very enthusiastic bee-keeper. My childhood was spent in our garden, where you had to be careful where you step, where you sit down, and you could never leave anything sweet just laying around, because you would find a big pile of bees on top of it quite soon. I had to help him and learn about the bees from time to time, which I honestly hated, because I knew that I will never have any bees of my own. But he was right about one thing, everything you learn will be useful to you in one way or another.\n  One of the jobs you do around bees, is that when the honey is taken away from the bees, you put the wax foundation in the hive, which looks like this:\n    Its primary function is that the bees build their tiles evenly and quite fast, as it is just natural to follow the optimised structure that is already there. And this is exactly what happens with code that has a good and expandable design from the start.\n  On the other hand, there is code that either had a lazy original design, or it was never expected to grow so much in complexity, and each of the changes were just a small addition to the mess. Eventually we got used to the idea that this part of the code is just hell, and that making small changes is annoying. This implies that we just don&#39;t like this part of the code, and we want to spend as little time as possible working with it. And the result is that the problem is slowly spiralling out of control.\n  When I took the  Uncle Bob glasses and started looking around, I quickly identified several problematic places like this. It is not a coincidence, that these places were eating away an disproportionately large amount of the dev time, not only because making changes is hard, but because they are full of regression bugs and generally are a never-ending source of problems.\n  This is the beautiful thing about having a company that isn&#39;t on the stock market. Imagine you have a company that goes slower and slower every quarter, and then you confront the shareholders with the statement, that the way to solve it, is to do absolutely no new features for a quarter or two, refactor the code, learn new methodologies etc. I doubt that the shareholders would allow that. Luckily, we don&#39;t have any shareholders, and we understand the vital importance of this investment in the long run. Not only in the project, but also in our skill and knowledge, so we do better next time.\n      It would look pretty reasonable if there was the same amount of people working from start to finish, but it is not. It was just me at the very start, and now there are 9 programmers. It could be explained by the game getting bigger and growing a lot of interconnected mechanics, which is harder to maintain. Or it could also mean that the density of the code improved so much. Both of these are not enough explain why having more programmers doesn&#39;t result in faster development.\n  This indicates that the problems Uncle Bob describes are relevant to us, and the solution is actually to improve the way we develop rather than just scaling the amount of people. Once we have a nice clean foundation, then hiring new programmers and getting them up to speed with the code will be much faster.\n  Let me now explain a few typical examples of the problems we had, and how we proceeded to fix them:\n    We wrote a lot about the GUI (for example  FFF-216) and how we iteratively raised the bar of what we find acceptable both from both the user and programmer perspective. The common takeaways from the FFF and from the coding was, that we always underestimated how complicated GUI logic/styles/layouting etc. can become. This implies that improving the way the GUI is written has large potential gains.\n  We are happy with the way the GUI objects are structured and laid out since the 0.17 update. But codewise, it still feels much more bloaty than it should be. The main problem was the amount of places you needed to touch to add some interactive element. Let me show you an example, a simple button used to reset presets in the map generator window.\n          Then, we needed to override the method of the ActionListener in our MapGeneratorClass, so we could listen to the click actions.\n  And finally, we could implement the method, where we if/else through the elements we care about, to do the actual logic\r void MapGeneratorGui::onMouseClick(const agui::MouseEvent&amp; event)\r{\r if (event.getSourceWidget() == &amp;this-&gt;resetPresetButton)\r this-&gt;onResetSettings();\r else if (event.getSourceWidget() == &amp;this-&gt;randomizeSeedButton)\r this-&gt;randomizeSeed();\r ...\n\rThis is way too much boilerplate for one button with one simple action. We had over 500 places where we registered actionListeners in the code, so imagine the amount of bloat.\n  We kind of noticed, that when we use lambdas to signal callbacks and similar things in the GUI, it tends to be much more pleasant to use. So what if we made it the primary way to do the GUI?\n  We decided to completely rewrite the way it works, so instead of adding listeners and the filtering from the event catching functions, we can just specify:\n    Which is a big improvement already, as adding and maintaining the new logic only requires you to look at one place instead of several, and it makes it generally more readable and less prone to errors.\n  And since we don&#39;t need to  hold the pointer object for comparisons, we can completely remove its definition from the class, and make it anonymous on many places in this fashion:\n  Rewriting all the GUI internals (again) was a big task, but in the end it really felt to be well worth it, as now I can&#39;t imagine how we could stand doing it the old way. It also resulted in several thousands of lines of code being removed.\n      There are several main goals to pursue when you try to make the code cleaner. Removing code duplication is the first and biggest priority. It is reasonably easy to solve when the code isn&#39;t structured well, functions are too long, or names are weird, but if you have 5 versions of the same pile of code with slight changes here and there, it is the worst beast. It is just a question of time, until bugfixes/changes are only applied to some variants, and it becomes less and less obvious whether the differences between the variants are intended or circumstantial.\n  The manual building logic is a monster, because of all the things it supports already:\n    Then, all of this logic needs to be multiplied by 2 (when you are lazy and copy paste), as you can have normal building and ghost building.\n  And then, you multiply this whole code abomination by 2 again. Why? Because we also need to do all this logic in the  latency hiding mode. Sounds bad already, but it isn&#39;t all of it, since this logic was continually being patched and touched by different people throughout history, the core of the code was a crazy long method with the code looking like the horizon mentioned by Uncle Bob.\n  Now imagine that you need to change something about this code, especially when you take into consideration, that the code naturally had many corner cases wrong, or fixed only in some variant of the code. This is a great example of how lazy long-term design leads to poor productivity.\n  Long story short, this was approached like a hobby side project of mine that took weeks to be finished, but in the end, all the duplications were merged, the code is well structured and fully tested. Managing the code requires a small fraction of the time compared to the previous state, because the reader is not required to read a huge pile of code just to get the big picture and to be able to change anything.\n  This reminds me a quote from Lou after a similar kind of refactoring: &#34; Once we are done with this, it will be actually a pleasure to add stuff to this code.&#34;. Isn&#39;t it beautiful? It is not only more efficient and less buggy, it is also more fun to work with, and working on something enjoyable tends to go faster regardless of other aspects.\n      No, we obviously didn&#39;t get to this point without automated tests, and we mentioned them several times already ( FFF-29,  FFF-288, and more). We try to continuously raise the bar of what code areas are covered by tests, and this lead us to cover yet another area, the GUI. This aligns with the ever repeating underestimation of the amount of engineering care the GUI needs. Having it not tested at all is part of this underestimation, how many times it happened, that we made a release, and it just crashed on something stupid simple in a GUI, just because we didn&#39;t have a test that would click the buttons. And in the end, it proved to not be hard at all to automate the GUI tests.\r\r We just have a mode in which the testing environment is created with GUI (even when tests are run without graphics). We declared some helper methods, that allow a very simple definition of where we want the cursor to move, or what we want to click, like this:\n    The clicking method is then calling the low level events of input, so all layers of event processing and GUI logic are tested. This is an example of end-to-end test, which is a controversial topic, because some &#34;schools&#34; of test methodology say, that everything should be tested separately, so in this case, we should theoretically test only, that clicking the button first, which creates an InputAction to be processed, and then, have an independent test of the InputAction working properly. I like this approach in some cases, but most of the time I really like that I can penetrate all layers of the logic with only a few lines of code. (more in the Test dependencies part)\n      I have to admit, that I didn&#39;t know what TDD really was until recently. I thought that it is some nonsense, because it sounds really impractical and unrealistic to first write all the tests for some feature (without the ability to try it or even compile it), and then try to implement something that satisfies it.\n  But that is not TDD, and it had to be shown to me in a &#34;for dummies&#34; way for me to realize how wrong I was.\n  TDD actually is the constant fast swithing between extending the tests and making them pass continously. So as you write tests, you write code to satisfy them basically at the same time. This allows you to instantly test what you write, and mainly use tests as specifiation of what the code should acctually do, which guides the thought process to make you think about where you are headed to, and to write code that is more structured and testable from the very beginning.\n  So after the &#34;AHA&#34; moment of realizing what TDD really is, I started to be instant fan. I&#39;m now putting a lot of effort to try to follow the TDD methodology as much as possible, and to force it on others in the team as well. It feels slower, to write tests even for simple pieces of logic that just bound to be right, but the test proved me wrong several times already, and prevented annoying low-level debugging sessions in the near future.\n          If tests should be truly independent, test C, should have some mocks of A and B, so the test of C is independent of the system A + B working correctly. The consensus seems to be, that this leads to more independent design etc.\n  This might be applicable in a lot of cases, but I believe that trying to have this approach everywhere is close to impossible, and it would lead to a lot of clutter and  I&#39;m not the only one having problem with this.\n  For example, lets say that we have a test of electric poles connecting properly on the map. But I can hardly test it when I don&#39;t know that searching for entities on the map works properly.\n  My conclusion is, that having dependencies like this is fine, as long as the dependencies are also tested, but the problem comes when you break something and a lot of tests start to fail suddenly. When you do small changes the yes/no indication of tests is enough, but it isn&#39;t always an option, especially when you refactor some internal structure, in which case you kind of expect to break a lot of stuff, and you need to have a way to fix them step by step once it can compile again.\n  If the tests don&#39;t have any special structure, the situation when 100 tests all fail at the same time is very unfortunate, all you are left with is to try to pick some test semi-randomly, and start debugging it. But it is really misleading when some complicated test case fails in the middle, and you spend a long time debugging it, only to realise that it is some very simple low level bug that is causing the failure.\n  The goal is pretty easy, I want to be given the most simple fail case of my change.\n  For this, I implemented a simple test dependency system. The tests are executed and listed in a way, that when you get to debug and check a test, you know that all of its dependencies are already working correctly. I tried to search if others use the dependencies as well, and how they do it, and I surprisingly didn&#39;t find anything.\n      I built and used this structure when refactoring away the duplication of ghost/real poles connection logic and it certainly sped up the process of making it work properly, and I&#39;m confident that this is the way to structure test for us in the foreseeable future. Not only it makes test results more useful, but it forces us to split test suites into smaller more-specialised units, which certainly help as well.\n      When Boskid joined the team as the QA guy, one of his main roles was making sure that any discovered bug is first covered by a test before it gets actually fixed, and generally improving our code test coverage. This made the releases much more confident, and we had less regression bugs, which directly transitions into long-term efficiency. I strongly believe that this clearly indicates and supports what Uncle bob is saying. Working with tests  feels slower but it is actually faster.\n  Test coverage is an indicator of which parts of the code are executed when the application runs (which usually means running the tests in this context). I never used a tool to measure test coverage before, but since it was one of the topics Uncle Bob talked about, I tried to use it for the first time. I found a tool that works only on Windows, but requires the least amount of setup, which is  OpenCppCoverage, which provides an HTML output like this:\n    It is immediately visible, that both of the conditional commands are not triggered in tests. It basically means that either the code just isn&#39;t tested, so it should be covered, or it&#39;s dead code, so it should be removed.

The round hasn\u2019t closed, so terms may change, sources cautioned.\n BharatPe, which prior to the new round had raised about $233 million in equity and $35 million in debt, was valued at about  $900 million in its Series D round in February this year, and $425 million last year.\n  Indian news outlet the CapTable  first reported about the talks between Tiger Global and BharatPe and said the round would value the startup at over $2 billion. BharatPe declined to comment.\n BharatPe operates an eponymous service to help offline merchants accept digital payments and secure working capital. Even as India has already emerged as the second-largest internet market, with more than 600 million users, much of the country remains offline.\n Among those outside of the reach of the internet are merchants running small businesses, such as roadside tea stalls and neighborhood stores. To make these merchants comfortable with accepting digital payments, BharatPe relies on QR codes and point of sale machines that support government-backed UPI payments infrastructure.\n The startup, which serves more than 6 million merchants, said it had deployed over 50,000 PoS machines by November of last year, and enables monthly transactions worth more than $123 million. It does not charge merchants for universal QR code access, but is looking to make money by lending. Grover said the startup\u2019s lending business grew by 10x in 2020.\n On Friday, India\u2019s central bank RBI\u00a0 granted an in-principle licence to Centrum Financial Services to set up a small finance bank. Centrum Financial Services has  collaborated with BharatPe for the license, according to local media.\n This is a big one!  @bharatpeindia and Centrum at the final leg of a its Small Finance Bank license after receiving its &#39;in-principle&#39; license.\n First fintech in the offing to get a banking license in India!

Russia, a hub for ransomware gangs, has been blamed for harbouring cybercriminals by failing to prosecute or extradite them.\n Cl0P is one of several ransomware cartels that seize a target\u2019s data, demanding a ransom to release it. The group has also increasingly threatened to leak sensitive information online if a target refuses to pay, a tactic known as \u201cdouble extortion.\u201d\n Recent targets have included oil company Shell and international law firm Jones Day, as well as several US universities including Stanford and the University of California. In most cases, the hackers wielded a vulnerability in a file transfer product run by Accellion to compromise their victims.\n    The arrests come as ransomware has been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks, following a number of audacious attacks hitting critical infrastructure. Last month,  hackers disrupted the Colonial Pipeline supplying petroleum to much of the US East Coast\u2014an attack the White House has attributed to a Russian-based group.\n As a result, governments are under increasing pressure to curb the activities of cybercriminals. This week, US President Joe Biden attended a summit in Geneva with Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin, in which both parties were expected to discuss the threat of ransomware.\n Some experts allege Moscow allows ransomware criminals to operate with impunity in the country on the understanding that hackers will not target Russian-speaking organizations and will share access with the government if called upon to do so. Ahead of the summit, however, both Putin and Biden suggested they were  open to exchanging cybercriminals.\n As part of its Cl0P takedown, the Ukrainian police on Wednesday said that it had conducted 21 searches in the Kyiv region of homes and cars of those arrested, seizing computer equipment, 5 million Ukrainian hryvnias (around $185,000), and property. Video footage shared by the police showed officers raiding homes in what appeared to be wealthy neighborhoods, and towing luxury cars including Teslas.\n The police also said it had \u201cmanaged to shut down\u201d some of the group\u2019s digital infrastructure.\n It is unclear whether those arrested were core members of the group or affiliates.

A range of mysteries, from the wiggling of strings to the binding of quarks into protons, demanded a new mathematical tool whose silhouette he could just make out.\n \u201cThere are methods and formulae in science which serve as  master keys to many apparently different problems,\u201d he wrote in the introduction to a now famous four-page letter in  Physics Letters B. \u201cAt the present time we have to develop an art of handling sums over random surfaces.\u201d\n Polyakov\u2019s proposal proved powerful. In his paper he sketched out a formula that roughly described how to calculate averages of a wildly chaotic type of surface, the \u201cLiouville field.\u201d His work brought physicists into a new mathematical arena, one essential for unlocking the behavior of theoretical objects called strings and building a simplified model of quantum gravity.\n Years of toil would lead Polyakov to breakthrough solutions for other theories in physics, but he never fully understood the mathematics behind the Liouville field.\n Over the last seven years, however, a group of mathematicians has done what many researchers thought impossible. In a trilogy of landmark publications, they have recast Polyakov\u2019s formula using fully rigorous mathematical language and proved that the Liouville field flawlessly models the phenomena Polyakov thought it would.\n  \u201cIt took us 40 years in math to make sense of four pages,\u201d said  Vincent Vargas, a mathematician at the French National Center for Scientific Research and co-author of the research with  R\u00e9mi Rhodes of Aix-Marseille University,  Antti Kupiainen of the University of Helsinki,  Fran\u00e7ois David of the French National Center for Scientific Research, and  Colin Guillarmou of Paris-Saclay University.\n The three papers forge a bridge between the pristine world of mathematics and the messy reality of physics \u2014 and they do so by breaking new ground in the mathematical field of probability theory. The work also touches on philosophical questions regarding the objects that take center stage in the leading theories of fundamental physics: quantum fields.\n \u201cThis is a masterpiece in mathematical physics,\u201d said  Xin Sun, a mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania.\n  In physics today, the main actors in the most successful theories are fields \u2014 objects that fill space, taking on different values from place to place.\n In classical physics, for example, a single field tells you everything about how a force pushes objects around. Take Earth\u2019s magnetic field: The twitches of a compass needle reveal the field\u2019s influence (its strength and direction) at every point on the planet.\n Fields are central to quantum physics, too. However, the situation here is more complicated due to the deep randomness of quantum theory. From the quantum perspective, Earth doesn\u2019t generate one magnetic field, but rather an infinite number of different ones. Some look almost like the field we observe in classical physics, but others are wildly different.\n But physicists still want to make predictions \u2014 predictions that ideally match, in this case, what a mountaineer reads on a compass. Assimilating the infinite forms of a quantum field into a single prediction is the formidable task of a \u201cquantum field theory,\u201d or QFT. This is a model of how one or more quantum fields, each with their infinite variations, act and interact.\n Driven by immense experimental support, QFTs have become the basic language of particle physics. The  Standard Model is one such QFT, depicting fundamental particles like electrons as fuzzy bumps that emerge from an infinitude of electron fields. It has passed every experimental test to date (although various groups may be  on the verge of finding the first holes).\n Physicists play with many different QFTs. Some, like the Standard Model, aspire to model real particles moving through the four dimensions of our universe (three spatial dimensions plus one dimension of time). Others describe exotic particles in strange universes, from two-dimensional flatlands to six-dimensional uber-worlds. Their connection to reality is remote, but physicists study them in the hopes of gaining insights they can carry back into our own world.\n    The Liouville field, which is based on an equation from complex analysis developed in the 1800s by the French mathematician Joseph Liouville, describes a completely random two-dimensional surface \u2014 that is, a surface, like Earth\u2019s crust, but one in which the height of every point is chosen randomly. Such a planet would erupt with mountain ranges of infinitely tall peaks, each assigned by rolling a die with infinite faces.\n Such an object might not seem like an informative model for physics, but randomness is  not devoid of patterns. The bell curve, for example, tells you how likely you are to randomly pass a seven-foot basketball player on the street. Similarly, bulbous clouds and crinkly coastlines follow random patterns, but it\u2019s nevertheless possible to discern consistent relationships between their large-scale and small-scale features.\n Liouville theory can be used to identify patterns in the endless landscape of all possible random, jagged surfaces. Polyakov realized this chaotic topography was essential for modeling strings, which trace out surfaces as they move. The theory has also been applied to describe quantum gravity in a two-dimensional world. Einstein defined gravity as space-time\u2019s curvature, but translating his description into the language of quantum field theory creates an infinite number of space-times \u2014 much as the Earth produces an infinite collection of magnetic fields. Liouville theory packages all those surfaces together into one object. It gives physicists the tools to measure the curvature \u2014and hence, gravitation \u2014 at every location on a random 2D surface.\n  \u201cQuantum gravity basically means random geometry, because quantum means random and gravity means geometry,\u201d said Sun.\n Polyakov\u2019s first step in exploring the world of random surfaces was to write down an expression defining the odds of finding a particular spiky planet, much as the bell curve defines the odds of meeting someone of a particular height. But his formula did not lead to useful numerical predictions.\n To solve a quantum field theory is to be able to use the field to predict observations. In practice, this means calculating a field\u2019s \u201ccorrelation functions,\u201d which capture the field\u2019s behavior by describing the extent to which a measurement of the field at one point relates, or correlates, to a measurement at another point. Calculating correlation functions in the photon field, for instance, can give you the textbook laws of quantum electromagnetism.\n Polyakov was after something more abstract: the essence of random surfaces, similar to the statistical relationships that make a cloud a cloud or a coastline a coastline. He needed the correlations between the haphazard heights of the Liouville field. Over the decades he tried two different ways of calculating them. He started with a technique called the Feynman path integral and ended up developing a workaround known as the bootstrap. Both methods came up short in different ways, until the mathematicians behind the new work united them in a more precise formulation.\n  You might imagine that accounting for the infinitely many forms a quantum field can take is next to impossible. And you would be right. In the 1940s Richard Feynman, a quantum physics pioneer, developed one prescription for dealing with this bewildering situation, but the method proved severely limited.\n Take, again, Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Your goal is to use quantum field theory to predict what you\u2019ll observe when you take a compass reading at a particular location. To do this, Feynman proposed summing all the field\u2019s forms together. He argued that your reading will represent some average of all the field\u2019s possible forms. The procedure for adding up these infinite field configurations with the proper weighting is known as the Feynman path integral.\n  It\u2019s an elegant idea that yields concrete answers only for select quantum fields. No known mathematical procedure can meaningfully average an infinite number of objects covering an infinite expanse of space in general. The path integral is more of a physics philosophy than an exact mathematical recipe. Mathematicians question its very existence as a valid operation and are bothered by the way physicists rely on it.\n \u201cI\u2019m disturbed as a mathematician by something which is not defined,\u201d said  Eveliina Peltola, a mathematician at the University of Bonn in Germany.\n Physicists can harness Feynman\u2019s path integral to calculate exact correlation functions for only the most boring of fields \u2014 free fields, which do not interact with other fields or even with themselves. Otherwise, they have to fudge it, pretending the fields are free and adding in mild interactions, or \u201cperturbations.\u201d This procedure, known as perturbation theory, gets them correlation functions for most of the fields in the Standard Model, because nature\u2019s forces happen to be quite feeble.\n But it didn\u2019t work for Polyakov. Although he initially speculated that the Liouville field might be amenable to the standard hack of adding mild perturbations, he found that it interacted with itself too strongly. Compared to a free field, the Liouville field seemed mathematically inscrutable, and its correlation functions appeared unattainable.\n   Polyakov soon began looking for a workaround. In 1984, he teamed up with Alexander Belavin and Alexander Zamolodchikov to develop a technique called the  bootstrap \u2014 a mathematical ladder that gradually leads to a field\u2019s correlation functions.\n To start climbing the ladder, you need a function which expresses the correlations between measurements at a mere three points in the field. This \u201cthree-point correlation function,\u201d plus some additional information about the energies a particle of the field can take, forms the bottom rung of the bootstrap ladder.\n From there you climb one point at a time: Use the three-point function to construct the four-point function, use the four-point function to construct the five-point function, and so on. But the procedure generates conflicting results if you start with the wrong three-point correlation function in the first rung.\n Polyakov, Belavin and Zamolodchikov used the bootstrap to successfully solve a variety of simple QFT theories, but just as with the Feynman path integral, they couldn\u2019t make it work for the Liouville field.\n Then in the 1990s two pairs of physicists \u2014  Harald Dorn and Hans-J\u00f6rg Otto, and  Zamolodchikov and his brother Alexei \u2014 managed to hit on the three-point correlation function that made it possible to scale the ladder, completely solving the Liouville field (and its simple description of quantum gravity). Their result, known by their initials as the DOZZ formula, let physicists make any prediction involving the Liouville field. But even the authors knew they had arrived at it partially by chance, not through sound mathematics.\n  Educated guesses are useful in physics, but they don\u2019t satisfy mathematicians, who afterward wanted to know where the DOZZ formula came from. The equation that solved the Liouville field should have come from some description of the field itself, even if no one had the faintest idea how to get it.\n \u201cIt looked to me like science fiction,\u201d said Kupiainen. \u201cThis is never going to be proven by anybody.\u201d\n  In the early 2010s, Vargas and Kupiainen joined forces with the probability theorist R\u00e9mi Rhodes and the physicist Fran\u00e7ois David. Their goal was to tie up the mathematical loose ends of the Liouville field \u2014 to formalize the Feynman path integral that Polyakov had abandoned and, just maybe, demystify the DOZZ formula.\n As they began, they realized that a French mathematician named Jean-Pierre Kahane had discovered, decades earlier, what would turn out to be the key to Polyakov\u2019s master theory.\n \u201cIn some sense it\u2019s completely crazy that Liouville was not defined before us,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cAll the ingredients were there.\u201d\n The insight led to three milestone papers in mathematical physics completed between 2014 and 2020.\n  They first polished off the path integral, which had failed Polyakov because the Liouville field interacts strongly with itself, making it incompatible with Feynman\u2019s perturbative tools. So instead, the mathematicians used Kahane\u2019s ideas to recast the wild Liouville field as a somewhat milder random object known as the Gaussian free field. The peaks in the Gaussian free field don\u2019t fluctuate to the same random extremes as the peaks in the Liouville field, making it possible for the mathematicians to calculate averages and other statistical measures in sensible ways.\n \u201cSomehow it\u2019s all just using the Gaussian free field,\u201d Peltola said. \u201cFrom that they can construct everything in the theory.\u201d\n In 2014, they  unveiled their result: a new and improved version of the path integral Polyakov had written down in 1981, but fully defined in terms of the trusted Gaussian free field. It\u2019s a rare instance in which Feynman\u2019s path integral philosophy has found a solid mathematical execution.\n \u201cPath integrals can exist, do exist,\u201d said  J\u00f6rg Teschner, a physicist at the German Electron Synchrotron.\n With a rigorously defined path integral in hand, the researchers then tried to see if they could use it to get answers from the Liouville field and to derive its correlation functions. The target was the mythical DOZZ formula \u2014 but the gulf between it and the path integral seemed vast.\n \u201cWe\u2019d write in our papers, just for propaganda reasons, that we want to understand the DOZZ formula,\u201d said Kupiainen.\n  The team spent years prodding their probabilistic path integral, confirming that it truly had all the features needed to make the bootstrap work. As they did so, they built on earlier work by Teschner. Eventually, Vargas, Kupiainen and Rhodes succeeded with a paper posted in  2017 and another in October  2020, with Colin Guillarmou. They derived DOZZ and other correlation functions from the path integral and showed that these formulas perfectly matched the equations physicists had reached using the bootstrap.\n \u201cNow we\u2019re done,\u201d Vargas said. \u201cBoth objects are the same.\u201d\n The work explains the origins of the DOZZ formula and connects the bootstrap procedure \u2014which mathematicians had considered sketchy \u2014 with verified mathematical objects. Altogether, it resolves the final mysteries of the Liouville field.\n \u201cIt\u2019s somehow the end of an era,\u201d said Peltola. \u201cBut I hope it\u2019s also the beginning of some new, interesting things.\u201d\n  Vargas and his collaborators now have a unicorn on their hands, a strongly interacting QFT perfectly described in a nonperturbative way by a brief mathematical formula that also makes numerical predictions.\n Now the  literal million-dollar question is: How far can these probabilistic methods go? Can they generate tidy formulas for all QFTs? Vargas is quick to dash such hopes, insisting that their tools are specific to the two-dimensional environment of Liouville theory. In higher dimensions, even free fields are too irregular, so he doubts the group\u2019s methods will ever be able to handle the quantum behavior of gravitational fields in our universe.\n But the fresh minting of Polyakov\u2019s \u201cmaster key\u201d will open other doors. Its effects are already being felt in probability theory, where mathematicians can now wield previously dodgy physics formulas with impunity. Emboldened by the Liouville work, Sun and his collaborators have already imported equations from physics to solve  two  problems regarding random curves.\n  Physicists await tangible benefits too, further down the road. The rigorous construction of the Liouville field could inspire mathematicians to try their hand at proving features of other seemingly intractable QFTs \u2014 not just toy theories of gravity but descriptions of real particles and forces that bear directly on the deepest physical secrets of reality.\n \u201c[Mathematicians] will do things that we can\u2019t even imagine,\u201d said  Davide Gaiotto, a theoretical physicist at the Perimeter Institute.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 18:15:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u91cf\u5b50,quantum,\u7406\u8bba", "title": "\u6570\u5b66\u5bb6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e862D\u7248\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u91cd\u529b\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Mathematicians Prove 2D Version of Quantum Gravity Works", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-2d-version-of-quantum-gravity-really-works-20210617/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u91cf\u5b50", "quantum", "\u7406\u8bba"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6c7218f4516925491aecf0e24d00717c.jpg", "infoid": 1066674, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\u8bf4\u5979\u5728\u9ad8\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u670917\u5c81\uff0c\u5f53\u5979\u7684\u7537\u670b\u53cb\u5c06\u5979\u878d\u5165\u88f8\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u3002\n   \u5979\u8bf4\u5979\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5b83\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5979\u5728\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u6536\u5230\u4e00\u4f4d\u4eb2\u5bc6\u670b\u53cb\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff1a\uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u6ca1\u6709\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u505a\u4e86\u8272\u60c5\u7247\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u5979\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u4f17\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5979\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u540c\u610f\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u7acb\u5373\uff0c\u6211\u77e5\u9053\u662f\u6211\u3002\u6211\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8138\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8863\u670d - \u7acb\u5373\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u5979\u8bf4\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u6389\u8fdb\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u809a\u5b50\u91cc\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n  Isabella\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u5047\u540d\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u5979\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff0c\u8bf4Pornhub\u6ca1\u6709\u8bd5\u56fe\u8054\u7cfb\u5979\u6765\u786e\u8ba4\u5979\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u6216\u8be2\u95ee\u89c6\u9891\u662f\u5426\u662f\u540c\u610f\u7684\u3002\n CBS\u65b0\u95fb\u4e0e34\u540d\u5973\u6027\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff09\u5171\u540c\u8c08\u5230\u4f0a\u838e\u8d1d\u62c9\uff0c\u4ed6\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u5bf9\u9635MindGeek\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662fPornhub\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u516c\u53f8\u548c\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u8272\u60c5\u7f51\u7ad9\u3002\n \u672c\u5468\u5ba1\u8bae\u7684\u6c11\u4e8b\u8bc9\u8bbc\u6307\u8d23\u516c\u53f8\u8fd0\u884cA\uff06\uff0334;\u72af\u7f6a\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\uff06\uff0334;

But the women suing the company have accused it of exploiting them for profit, hosting and promoting graphic videos of rape, revenge porn and even videos that depict child sexual abuse.\n  Isabella said more than 200,000 people ultimately watched the video \u2014 &#34;including everybody at my college, pretty much,&#34; she said.\n &#34;The view count on the video will forever haunt my dreams,&#34; she said. &#34;Just knowing that that many people saw it really messed me up.&#34;\n After learning how many people had seen her video on Pornhub, she said she battled with a sense of shame and worthlessness and had to transfer schools. She couldn&#39;t look in a mirror for six months and drew into isolation, she said, fearful that people at her new school would recognize her.\n And she struggled with the feeling that she&#39;d brought this on herself. &#34;It&#39;s taken me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I am a victim of something,&#34; she said.\n   The lawsuit alleges that Pornhub&#39;s business model is built around funneling online traffic to videos like Isabella&#39;s.\n  MindGeek owns and operates more than 100 pornographic websites, and its brands include Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn and Xtube. MindGeek also owns porn production companies that create content, but for years, a majority of the content on Pornhub was uploaded by unverified users. MindGeek operates some paid-subscription sites, but Pornhub is free for anyone to access and earns money through advertising revenue and optional, premium subscriptions.\n Isabella said she decided to join the lawsuit to protect other victims. A draft of the lawsuit says MindGeek &#34;embraced under-age, non-consensual, and pirated content in its business&#34; and claims the company &#34;profited from content produced through human trafficking.&#34;\n Michael Bowe, the lawyer representing the women, said the company has skirted rules that have long been in place to protect actors in the &#34;traditional&#34; porn industry, which requires producers to verify the age and identities of the people featured in videos.\n &#34;The online porn industry has essentially been the Red Light District of commerce,&#34; Bowe said. &#34;This new industry of online porn, for the last 10 years, has been allowed by law enforcement, government entities, to operate by a different set of rules. Basically, no rules or oversight.&#34;\n Bowe has spent the past year building a civil case against the company based on racketeering laws normally used to go after mobsters and drug gangs.\n Last December, after a wave of backlash over nonconsensual content on the platform, Mastercard and Visa blocked card users from making purchases on Pornhub. Under scrutiny, MindGeek announced an overhaul of its procedures and took down millions of videos uploaded by unverified users, deleting 80% of the content on its site.\n  MindGeek executives also announced last year that they had removed the ability for users to download videos and added a requirement that people posting videos verify their identification.\n   &#34;We are committed to eradicating illegal content,&#34; the company said in a statement to CBS News, adding that earlier this year, the company enacted &#34;the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history.&#34;\n The statement said, &#34;We have banned uploads from unverified users, eliminated downloads, expanded our moderation processes, and partnered with dozens of non-profit organizations around the world, steps that surpass those of any other major platform on the internet.&#34;\n In a statement Thursday after the lawsuit was filed, MindGeek said the allegations in the complaint that Pornhub is a &#34;criminal enterprise&#34; are &#34;utterly absurd, completely reckless and categorically false.&#34;\n During a February hearing before the Canadian House of Commons, MindGeek&#39;s CEO Feras Antoon decried online child abuse imagery. &#34;Sexual material, child abuse material has no place on our platform. It makes us lose money,&#34; he said. &#34;It completely ruins the brand that we have been trying to build for over a decade.&#34;\n But the company still does not require its users to verify the identity or age of those featured in its videos, something that&#39;s standard in the traditional porn industry. The company also doesn&#39;t seek to confirm the consent of everyone who appears in videos posted to the site, a measure that victims of abuse believe would help keep nonconsensual content off porn sites.\n Some of the victims in the lawsuit told CBS News they joined after they discovered their non-consensual videos on Pornhub and reached out to an activist named Laila Mickelwait. In 2020, Mickelwait founded a campaign called Traffickinghub which started a petition to &#34;Shut Down Pornhub.&#34; She told CBS News it now has more than 2 million signatures.\n  During testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in March, Mickelwait called Pornhub a &#34;mega-sex trafficker,&#34; and said the site was infested with non-consensual pornographic content. &#34;The company knowingly has enabled and profited from mass amounts of sex acts induced by force, fraud or coercion, and the commercial sexual abuse of children,&#34; she said.\n   Traffickinghub says it&#39;s &#34;powered by&#34; a religious organization called Exodus Cry, which has been criticized for its efforts to criminalize parts the sex industry and abolish pornography altogether. On its website, Exodus Cry advocates for laws to &#34;end the sex industry&#34; and &#34;reduce the demand for commercial sex.&#34;\n Pornhub&#39;s executives have said the company was designed to celebrate freedom of expression and empower adults. And in its statement Thursday, the company claims Bowe is a &#34;soldier of the ultra-right wing effort to shut down the adult content industry.&#34;\n But Bowe said his goal isn&#39;t to ban online pornography, but rather, to force it to comply with regulations.\n He told CBS News: &#34;This case is not about porn, it&#39;s about rape. This is a legitimate industry that consenting people have every right to participate in. It just needs to be done legally and not with illegal content.&#34;\n Of the 34 women suing the company, 14 said they were underage in videos uploaded to PornHub, and 14 were victims of people charged or convicted of sex crimes.\n  One of those victims is Aubrey, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity. She says her ex-husband secretly recorded a video of them having sex, then uploaded it to Pornhub without her consent or her knowledge. The ex-husband now faces criminal charges of forcible rape, domestic assault and non-consensual dissemination of private sexual images by posting the video on Pornhub.\n Aubrey learned about the video from a friend in 2018, after she said it had garnered more than 400,000 views.\n   &#34;I will never, ever be able to recover the emotional pain that this has caused me,&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;It truly, truly was a living nightmare. I \u2014 I didn&#39;t \u2014 everybody had seen everything about me. And that&#39;s just \u2014 that&#39;s a very private moment. And it&#39;s a very vulnerable moment. And it&#39;s just \u2014 it&#39;s hard to come to terms with. That the world has seen that.&#34;\n Aubrey said she struggled to convince Pornhub to remove her video. Emails reviewed by CBS News show that after she contacted the company to tell them the video was not taken consensually, a Pornhub representative challenged her.\n He asked, &#34;Are you the female in the video? How do you know this is you?&#34;\n Aubrey responded, &#34;I know this is me by several things. That is my bed, I have a mole on my right hip, that is my face, my voice, THAT IS ME and I am pissed.&#34;\n After a three-day exchange, Pornhub took down the video, but even then, Aubrey said she found it posted to other porn websites \u2014 renamed and re-uploaded, by users she didn&#39;t know.\n She said she felt defeated to know that the video was still online. &#34;I felt like everything was taken away from me. And I had no power. I had no say in it. I was completely powerless,&#34; she said.\n One former executive, who worked at MindGeek before the company overhauled its policies, provided information included in the lawsuit against MindGeek. He said that illegal content was seen as &#34;good&#34; for business. He agreed to be interviewed on the condition of anonymity. He fears retribution.\n   He said the company favored keeping more content on the site. &#34;I mean, if you offer everything on the site, there is something for everyone,&#34; he said. &#34;The more you have, the better it is. So for all the free sites like Pornhub, more content is always better.&#34;\n He said when content was flagged on PornHub, MindGeek often moved it to one of the dozens of other porn sites it owned. &#34;Removed content popped up on all their other sites and no one really cared,&#34; he said.\n In its statement to CBS News, MindGeek said: &#34;The spread of illegal content is an existential threat to the internet, and every platform has the moral obligation to join the fight against it. Illegal material on the internet harms its victims, internet users and all platforms that operate online. Any suggestion that the company tolerates or celebrates this material is patently false.&#34;\n   One victim, Michelle, who is using a pseudonym, said that she was targeted at age 15 by an abuser who has since been convicted of blackmailing children to sexually abuse themselves on camera.\n She said he coerced her to take sexual photos and videos, which he later sold as &#34;box sets&#34; to other offenders. Some of those videos were uploaded to Pornhub, and from there, she said, they spread.\n She said that the videos&#39; uploads on Pornhub had &#34;way, way worse&#34; of an impact on her than even her blackmailer&#39;s initial abuse. &#34;It was only when my videos went on sites like Pornhub that my life started to become something that I couldn&#39;t live out properly,&#34; she said, adding that she stopped eating, leaving the house and once attempted suicide.\n Michelle reported the videos to Pornhub during the fall of 2018 and continued flagging content for the site to take down throughout 2019. And although Pornhub took down all unverified content last year, Michele said she continues to find images of her abuse re-uploaded on other websites. She said, &#34;Any other place I find my videos there&#39;s some type of mention of Pornhub or where they originated from, and my name was always with them.&#34;\n   Strangers continue to contact her about her videos, she said, and one man even showed up at her house, telling her that he&#39;d found her through Pornhub.\n The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which investigates reports of child sexual abuse, told CBS News that MindGeek began reporting suspected child abuse to their Cyber Tipline in April 2020, and throughout 2020, reported more than 13,000 instances of child sexual abuse imagery. In its statement, MindGeek said those reports represent approximately 4,000 unique incidents.\n &#34;According to leading advocates, non-profits and third-party analyses, Pornhub&#39;s safeguards and technologies have proven effective,&#34; the statement said, adding that according to  the center&#39;s data, one major social media platform was responsible for more than 20 million reports.\n Despite that, the center said that victims and survivors who contact them &#34;express frustration&#34; with MindGeek&#39;s record in removing sexually abusive content, noting their expectations for MindGeek to take greater steps to proactively identify and remove the content from its site.\n The center added that it receives information from the public about suspected child sexual abuse imagery on MindGeek sites &#34;on a daily basis.&#34;\n  Another victim, Ashley, who is also using a pseudonym to protect her identity, said in August of last year, she learned that Pornhub was hosting a video of her being assaulted while unconscious.\n She said her then-husband drugged and raped her, and had posted the assault on Pornhub. The video was tagged &#34;sleeping pills,&#34; and she says it had been on the site for three years and racked up tens of thousands of views before she learned of its existence.\n   Her abuser was arrested last week on charges of sexual assault, distributing intimate images without consent and indecent exposure. She said his arrest came as a relief, but she hopes MindGeek will be held responsible too.\n Ashley said the changes the company made to their site last year, which require users to upload a government-issued ID in order to post content, may not have prevented a situation like hers.\n &#34;Of course you have consent from the person uploading the video. They&#39;re the one uploading it,&#34; she said. &#34;But it&#39;s the people in the video that really need to be asked.&#34;\n Even after Pornhub deactivated the original video of her rape, she said the thumbnail image of the video, which shows her unconscious and naked, continues to populate in Google image search results to this day.\n She said, &#34;There shouldn&#39;t be anywhere safer in the world than at home in your own bed, right? And you shouldn&#39;t be able to go to bed one night and wake up on Pornhub.&#34;\n The new lawsuit asks a federal court in California to order MindGeek to pay damages to the victims, an amount Bowe told CBS News that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Victims who spoke with CBS News also hope the company will someday be held criminally responsible.\n &#34;How would they like it if it was someone they loved? Their child? Their sister?&#34; Aubrey said. &#34;They&#39;ve got to take steps to prevent this from ever happening to anybody ever again.&#34;\n   In its statement, MindGeek said: &#34;Anyone who attempts to post nonconsensual imagery or child sexual abuse material on the internet is a criminal, and we are committed to remaining at the forefront of the internet when it comes to the elimination of illegal content. Every online platform has the responsibility to join this fight, and it requires collective action and constant vigilance. We hope other platforms will use our model to help eradicate unwanted content.&#34;\n Jessica Kegu, Sara Cook, Martin Finn and Jennie Kamin contributed to this report.

", "note_en": "We have a special blog today from one of our own design engineers, Simon Martin. He\u2019s the designer of Raspberry Pi 400 and our High Quality Camera and spends his free time tinkering with electronic music.\n  Simon has wanted to make his own electronic musical instrument with Raspberry Pi for some time. He designed a circuit board for the project a year ago, but it lay around in a drawer in his desk while he finished  Raspberry Pi 400. Finally, the winter months gave him the incentive to get it working.\n  Simon: The Synth6581 device doesn\u2019t look much like an electronic musical instrument, but just like circuit boards stacked on top of a  Raspberry Pi 4. You have to plug a musical keyboard into a USB port and a pair of speakers into the audio jack on the bottom board to make it work.\n  The code is written almost entirely in Python, with a little bit of C to speed up the communications to the chips. I designed and laid out the circuit boards, which were ordered online. The first six boards cost only \u00a320, but the components were another \u00a3100. I spent more than a day soldering the components on the boards by hand. It took much more time to check every chip and connection worked, a common problem with hand-soldering new boards.\n   And Synth6581 is no ordinary sounding musical instrument. It\u2019s based on the music chip inside a vintage computer: the Commodore 64.\u00a0The microchips are almost forty years old and they have a quirky sound that kids in the 1980s loved and parents hated.\u00a0By the way, did you know that the Commodore 64 was the inspiration for Raspberry Pi 400?\n   I was one of many hobby programmers in the 1980s that used to attempt to program Commodore 64s. Much like people today dabble with programming on Raspberry Pi 400s, kids and adults were dabbling with the BASIC programming language on their Commodore 64s back then.\u00a0Nowadays, Raspberry Pis have video, graphics, and audio readily available, but back in the 1980s, the hardware registers had to be \u2018poked\u2019 one by one into the console window. You had to get quite technical just to get the computer to make a musical sound. Those sounds came from the MOS6581 or \u2018SID\u2019 chip. It had such a famous sound character that it formed the basis of the chiptune music genre, and people are still writing music on Commodore 64s today.\n   By borrowing a few chips from broken Commodore 64s, including one or two lying around Raspberry Pi Towers, I made those 1980s ping noises into a polyphonic synthesiser controlled in Python on Raspberry Pi. The registers in the SID chips are simply being \u2018poked\u2019 by Raspberry Pi instead of Commodore 64. I also reverse-engineered the music from old games and made the sound effects and instruments work across the keyboard.\n   This device is unique: only one of these will ever be built, so please don\u2019t wait for a launch date. There were over 10 million chips manufactured for Commodore 64, but production of the chips ended nearly 30 years ago. The Commodore 64s and spare parts for them are still in high demand, which is pushing up second hand prices. Nonetheless, the code and schematics are available online  on GitHub, and I invite other Raspberry Pi users to use them to make musical instruments out of other games consoles. I reckon Sega Megadrive has a lot of potential for a Raspberry Pi port\u2026", "posttime": "2021-06-18 17:32:47", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "raspberry-pi,pi,\u8986\u76c6\u5b50", "title": "Commodore 64\u548cRaspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581 ", "title_en": "Commodore 64 and Raspberry Pi 4 = Synth6581", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/commodore-64-raspberry-pi-4-synth6581/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["pi", "\u8986\u76c6\u5b50"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1066670, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u6211\u5750\u5728\u6211\u7684\u706b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9760\u7740\u7a97\u6237\u7565\u5fae\u6253\u5f00\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u5c4f\u5e55\uff0c\u6211\u60f3\u4fdd\u6301\u5b83\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u5173\u95ed\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4efb\u4f55\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u7a0d\u5fae\u5f00\u653e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6211\u80fd\u591f\u56de\u5230\u5ba4\u5185\u3002\n \u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5e02\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u70ed\u7684\uff0c\u81ed\u5473\u7684\u4e00\u5929\uff0c\u82cd\u8747\u662fAbuzz\u3002\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u9633\u53f0\u4e0a\u5f88\u96be\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u9080\u8bf7\u6240\u6709\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u8fdb\u5165\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f53\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u788e\u5c51\u7684\u81ea\u52a9\u9910\u3002\n \u8fd9\u8ba9\u6211\u601d\u8003\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u95ed\u5408\u7684\u7a97\u6237\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u63a8\u79fb\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u516c\u5bd3\u91cc\u7684\u82cd\u8747\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\uff1f\u5f53\u4f60\u6ca1\u6709\u670b\u53cb\u65f6\uff0c\u5468\u65e5\u4e0b\u5348\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u9664\u975e\u4f60\u8ba1\u7b97\u82cd\u8747\uff09\u3002\n  \u4e3a\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u6b64\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u98de\u884c\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u822a\u5176\u5783\u573e\u5145\u586b\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\uff0cI\uff06\uff0339;

As there are no screens, I wanted to keep it as closed as possible to keep out any bugs. However, I needed to keep it somewhat open so that I&#39;d be able to get back indoors.\n As it was a hot, smelly day in New York City, the flies were abuzz. I found it hard to relax on my illegal balcony knowing that I was basically inviting all of the flies into my apartment for an all-you-can-eat buffet of human detritus.\n This got me thinking how effective the partially closed window is at keeping out the flies. What does the function of flies in my apartment over time look like? The perfect question for a Sunday afternoon when you have no friends (unless you count the flies).\n  In order to run this simulation, we need a model of how a fly navigates its trash-filled world. As a first pass, I&#39;ll model a fly as moving in a random direction with a random speed for each timestep of the simulation. Pretty simple, but flies do appear to be relatively simple creatures.\n If we take a look at the trajectory of a single fly using this model, it does indeed look random:\n  Now let&#39;s simulate a bunch of flies. To do this, first we initialize an array  xs to hold the position of the flies. We&#39;ll normally distributed this in a  2*WORLDHEIGHT x WORLDHEIGHT square. We&#39;ll also initialize all the flies to be outside (setting the window to be at  x = 0 and indoors to be  x &gt; 0).\n xs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  *  np . array ([[ WORLDHEIGHT  *  2 ,  WORLDHEIGHT ]]) xs [( xs [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 ), 0 ]  *=  - 1 xs [( xs [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  *=  - 1\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  xps  =  xs  +  vs  *  dt  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  inoutmask  =  ( np . sign ( xps [:, 0 ])  *  np . sign ( xs [:, 0 ]))  ==  - 1  m  =  ( xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 1 ])  /  ( xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  -  xs [ inoutmask , 0 ]  +  1e-7 )  b  =  xps [ inoutmask , 1 ]  -  m  *  xps [ inoutmask , 0 ]  invalidmask  =  b  &gt;  WINDOWHEIGHT  idxs  =  np . where ( inoutmask )[ 0 ][ invalidmask ]  xps [ idxs , 0 ]  =  1e-4  *  np . sign ( xs [ idxs , 0 ])  xps [ idxs , 1 ]  =  b [ invalidmask ]  # 3. Bound the flies.  xps [( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT ), 0 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [(( xps [:, 1 ]  &gt;  WORLDHEIGHT )  &amp;  ( xps [:, 0 ]  &gt;  0 )), 1 ]  =  WORLDHEIGHT  xps [( xps [:, 1 ]  &lt;  0 ), 1 ]  =  0  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  xs  =  xps  vs  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES ,  2 )  vs  =  ( vs  /  np . sqrt (( vs  **  2 ). sum ( 1 )[:, np . newaxis ]))  *  maxv  return  ( xs ,  vs )\n Step 2 might require a little explaining. Every timestep, each fly travels in a line from its previous position to its new position. We only want the flies to be able to travel through the crack at the bottom, so we need a way to ensure they can&#39;t travel through the glass.\n To do that, we first find all of the flies that changed indoor/outdoor state this timestep ( inoutmask). This can be done by comparing the sign of the previous and current  x since the window is at  x = 0. We can then calculate where the fly crossed the line  x = 0 using some middle school math.\n It should be impossible for the fly&#39;s y-intercept to be greater than the height of the window crack, we for thos flies ( invalidmask), we set their y to be where they tried to cross the window and their x to be some small epsilon on the side that they came from. I don&#39;t just set it to 0 because then the fly would not get picked up by  inoutmask and may be able to travel through the glass on the next iteration.\n Step 3 just makes sure that the fly does not go through the arbitrary walls of the world. Currently, only the floor and the walls of my apartment are defined so a fly can escape to infinity in the -x or +y directions while outdoors. Here&#39;s a diagram of the world for the visually-inclined:\n ---------------- y = h | | | | | | | _________________________________| x = -h x = 0 x = h\n OK, we can finally see the flies fly! Because of the random velocity vectors, they unsurprisingly look quite jittery:\n    This is great and all but the flies don&#39;t look too realistic. Let&#39;s make their velocity vectors vary smoothly so that they don&#39;t look like a dubstep light show.\n To do this, we&#39;ll pick a random angle in the range  [-pi/8, pi/8] to rotate each fly&#39;s velocity vector by. In this simulation, we won&#39;t vary the magnitude of their velocities at all.\n    def  update ( xs ,  vs ):  ...  # 2. Make sure flies can&#39;t go through the glass.  ...  # 2.5. Flip the x-velocity of the invalid flies.  vs [ idxs , 0 ]  *=  - 1  # 3. Bound the flies.  ...  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  8.  Cs ,  Ss  =  np . cos ( dthetas ),  np . sin ( dthetas )  Rs  =  np . array ([[ Cs ,  - Ss ],  [ Ss ,  Cs ]]). transpose ( 2 ,  0 ,  1 )  vs  =  ( Rs  *  vs . reshape ( NFLIES ,  2 ,  1 )). sum ( axis = 1 )\n While not necessary, Step 2.5 was added so that the flies don&#39;t take get stuck keep trying to go through the window as their velocity rotates slowly.\n In Step 4, instead of choosing new random values for  vs, we create a random rotation matrix for each fly and rotate their initial velocities by it.\n If we take a look at the animation now, we can see the flies look slightly more realistic (if not still a bit spazzy):\n   While the flies now obey the laws of aviation, there&#39;s still something that seems missing. Normally, flies  want to get indoors. They  need to get indoors. So to simulate this, I added an attractor (maybe a rotting piece of fruit) at a position  A indoors to lure the flies.\n To do this, I added one variable to the fly&#39;s state: a scalar value  a which represents how close they are to the delicious piece of fruit. The fly will be able to remember the most recent value of  a so that it can know whether it&#39;s getting warmer or colder.\n  def  attraction ( x ,  A ):  return  1.  /  ( 1e-7  +  np . sqrt ((( x  -  A . reshape ( 1 ,  2 ))  **  2 ). sum ( 1 ))) def  update ( xs ,  vs ,  ats ):  # 1. Propagate the flies.  ...  ats  =  attraction ( xs ,  A )  atps  =  attraction ( xps ,  A )  # 4. Set the new positions and velocities.  ...  dthetas  =  np . random . randn ( NFLIES )  *  np . pi  /  16.  wrongmask  =  atps  &lt;  ats  dthetas [ wrongmask ]  +=  np . random . randn ( wrongmask . sum ())  *  np . pi  /  8.  ...  return  ( xs ,  vs ,  ats )\n  If the attraction increased from the previous timestep, keep going in the same direction (do nothing)\n We add another random rotation in the range of  [-pi/16, pi/16] just to keep things interesting.\n The fly will keep going in a straight line (with some random jitter) as long as the attraction it sense is increasing. If it senses that it&#39;s going in the wrong direction, it will more aggressively explore its neighborhood until it finds a good direction to head in.\n As you can see by the new trajectory, this seems to work fairly well for simulating a stupid but well-motivated fly:\n  However, it seems on the aggregate, the flies just swarm the attractor. Thankfully this isn&#39;t the case in real life as I currently only have two flies in my apartment.\n   With this information in hand, I finally wanted to answer the popular game show question: &#34;How many flies are in my apartment?&#34;\n The first experiment I ran was to plot the average number of flies given how open the window was over a few max velocities. Here is the result for the random flies:\n  Quite nicely, it turns out that as the window, gets more open, the number of flies indoors increases linearly.\n For the smooth flies, we see a less linear function. I&#39;m not quite sure why.\n  The attracted flies produce an even more asymptotic (is that a word?) plot. My hypothesis is that this is because the flies are more likely to find their way to the trash than in other models so it doesn&#39;t help them as much when the window is more open.\n  Then I wanted to see how long the simulation ran for affected the number of flies. We see similar results for the random and smooth flies. With faster moving flies (the orange and green plots), random moving or in the smooth case randomly initialized flies are more likely to barrel off towards infinity when outside. Therefore, the total number of flies decreases as the simulation progresses.\n  In the case of the attracted flies, we again see that a higher max velocity results in the number of flies peaking earlier. However, because the flies have some knowledge as to what direction to go in, they tend not to drift out into the ether and the population eventually plateaus.\n   Thanks for joining me on this pointless exerise and in case you missed it the answer to the titular question is two.

", "note_en": "When a Russian scientist identified the Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple, harvests in Kazakhstan\u2019s forests were bountiful; now this wild fruit is threatened.\n        Winter\u2019s cool indifference had already embraced the snow-tipped peaks of the Tian Shan mountain system, winds whispering the tall trees into a state of undress.\n \u201cIt is cold,\u201d said Alexey Raspopov, a guide with  Trekking Club Kazakhstan, pointing to the dashboard thermometer of his 4x4 as we ascended, leaving Kazakhstan\u2019s second city Almaty to disappear beneath a layer of smog.\n One could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple\n After driving for about two hours to the Turgen Gorge, we abandoned the vehicle and continued on foot. The climb was not difficult, but biting gusts threatened to take the feeling from my fingertips and steal the words from my lips as I asked Raspopov, who has led hikes in the region for the past 30 years, about the landscape that unfolded before us.\n \u201cIt has changed a lot,\u201d he said, calling upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the thickening pollution and a shrinking glacier to illustrate his point \u2013 not that he needed to. The near disappearance of the forests of  Malus sieversii, or wild apple, that once blanketed the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau section of the Tian Shan mountains (which also stretches to Kyrgyzstan), are testament enough to the changing times.\n   When storied Russian scientist Nikolai Vavilov first identified the  Malus sieversii as the progenitor of the domestic apple,  Malus domestica, in 1929, the region\u2019s forests were thick and their harvests bountiful.\n \u201cAll around the city one could see a vast expanse of wild apples covering the foothills,\u201d wrote Vavilov of his visit to Almaty, then Kazakhstan\u2019s capital. \u201cOne could see with his own eyes that this beautiful site was the origin of the cultivated apple.\u201d\n Vavilov based these words on his idea that the \u2018centres of origin\u2019 of a species lie in the places where you find its highest genetic diversity. His observations that all domestic apples may originate from Almaty has since been confirmed by modern genetics.\n \u201cAt some point, either seeds, trees or budwood from desirable trees was taken out of the [ Malus sieversii] forests by humans and grown elsewhere,\u201d said Gayle Volk, a research plant physiologist at the  United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). \u201cIn some cases, those trees could have hybridised with wild apple species growing in other regions. The selection process continued.\u201d\n  Silk Road trade is believed to have scattered the fruit far and wide, eventually reaching North America with European colonists.\n Despite being the first to scientifically assert Almaty\u2019s association with the apple, Vavilov was not the first to observe fruit\u2019s influence on the region. \u201cAlmaty used to be called Alma-Ata [the Russian name for the city],\u201d Raspopov told me at the apogee of our ascent. \u201cIt means \u2018father of apples\u2019,\u201d he added, before handing me an acid-green fruit the size of a child\u2019s fist.\n Zesty, sweet and deliciously crisp, it was not plucked from one of the nearly naked branches in front of us, which, when in season, bear apples of all shapes, sizes, flavours and textures \u2013 and, as Raspopov warned me, are rarely edible. Instead, this apple was a triumph of farming and cultivation, sadly the very same human endeavours that have ravaged the wild apple\u2019s natural habitats. This thought did not stop me from accepting another though, listening as Raspopov continued: \u201cKazakh people, Almaty people, they are very proud of the apple. It comes from here.\u201d\n  That pride is worn plainly for all to see throughout the city. Billboards bearing images of apples and Almaty\u2019s tagline, \u2018the city of [a] thousand colours\u2019, advertise nothing else but the famous fruit, injecting bold pops of red along otherwise grey highways. At the  A Kasteyev State Museum of Arts, Kazakhstan\u2019s biggest art museum, apples appear in oil paintings and metal sculptures. On a larger and more public scale, murals depicting the fruit adorn the sides of buildings, and a giant granite apple-shaped fountain is a point of attraction at Kok Tobe mountain, one of the city\u2019s major landmarks. On my way to the cable car that takes visitors to its peak, I waited patiently in line to take a picture of a sunshine-yellow, Soviet-era car, stuffed full of plastic apples; the licence plate read \u2018I love Almaty\u2019.\n In the city\u2019s Green Bazaar, a farmers\u2019 market thronging with locals wrapped up against the chill, precarious towers of apples fastidiously organised according to hue, size and shape beckoned. Slices were deftly cut and devoured, offered with a steady stream of Russian \u2013 the lingua franca here \u2013 and gratefully received with a grin and a quiet \u201c spasiba\u201d (Russian for \u2018thank you\u2019, and about the sum of my knowledge of the language).\n  Just as the  Malus sieversii is the progenitor of modern apples, the Green Bazaar is ground zero for Kazakh cuisine. Each aisle presents another ingredient or element fundamental to the country\u2019s culinary history. There is the corner dedicated to horsemeat, from an animal so sacrosanct to the once-nomadic Kazakh people that it is considered a delicacy. Then there are countless Korean specialities, emblematic of the diaspora that led many Koreans to settle in Central Asia after being forcibly deported from Soviet Russia by Stalin in 1937, where they had fled following the breakdown of the Chosun dynasty in 1910. And there are pickles of almost every type imaginable, garnished with generous amounts of dill.\n Everything needed to make some of the country\u2019s signature dishes can be found here. Take  plov, a Central Asian rice dish that each country has adapted slightly. In Kazakhstan, the twist comes in the form of apples, which are added to the customary lamb, carrots and onions for a bit of additional sweetness.\n  But while the region has gladly accepted the  Malus domestica as its own, Kazakhstan\u2019s wild apples have been decidedly neglected.\n Malus sieversii is currently listed as \u2018vulnerable\u2019 on the  ICUN Red List (last assessed in 2007), with its population \u2018decreasing\u2019. Threats to the few remaining forests include residential and commercial development, livestock farming and deforestation. Moves have recently been made to preserve those that remain in the Trans-Ili Alatau foothills by Italy\u2019s  Slow Food foundation (which requires permits for visitors to enter the forest) with funding from  Cultures of Resistance Network.\n \u201cAgain and again, Slow Food has demonstrated that slowing down and paying attention to what we eat is not just a matter of the lifestyle choices of the affluent,\u201d said Iara Lee, director of Cultures of Resistance Network. \u201cIt\u2019s about highlighting models of agroecology that provide alternatives to environmentally destructive corporate farming, where profit becomes the driving concern. We need alternative models now more than ever.\u201d\n  Whether Vavilov foresaw such destructive human activity when he first visited Almaty is impossible to imagine. However, the visionary scientist made certain to collect  Malus sieversii seeds to protect the species and help prevent any future famine. He added them to his collection of 250,000 seeds, fruits and roots at one of  the world\u2019s first gene banks in Leningrad (now St Petersburg).\n During the  Siege of Leningrad from 1941 to 1944, several botanists who worked at the gene bank chose to starve to death rather than eat the seeds stored there. Vavilov also died of starvation, imprisoned in the  gulag for falling out of favour with those in power. Thankfully, though, his legacy survives to this day. Now named the  Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry (VIR), the gene bank is the only facility of its kind in Russia.\n \u201cWe collect, evaluate, maintain and use the collection according to Vavilov\u2019s theories and approaches,\u201d said Igor Loskutov, the head of the institute\u2019s rye, barley and oats genetic resources department. \u201cWe are working to prevent the loss of genetic diversity and genetic erosion. The VIR is important not only for Russia, but for the whole of mankind.\u201d\n Volk agreed: \u201cThe wild species in their native habitats will always be important, however, gene banks increase accessibility to the wild species and can serve as a partial backup in case of unexpected circumstances,\u201d she said.\n  In the case of Almaty\u2019s wild apple forests, let\u2019s hope those unexpected circumstances never arise.\n Back in the birthplace of the modern apple, the work of Vavilov, along with his courageous colleagues and his contemporaries, is a footnote in the story of a city whose identity is entwined with the fruit. To celebrate their work, and to satisfy a sudden craving, I stepped into a street-side stall and bought a mottled green-and-red apple. It was delicious.\n CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified the car filled with apples as a Volga.

This is, obviously, utter horseshit; we assemble our political selves either from wanting to embrace a particular social group (all the cool 1 people on Twitter pretend they\u2019re part of the Combahee River Collective so I will too) or to reject one (my parents are annoying limousine liberals so I\u2019ll be a college Republican). We then backfill in a set of political opinions from there. There\u2019s a lot of consequences for this, few of them positive. A big one is what I call the Selfish Fallacy, which is neither an apt nor clever name but I can\u2019t think of anything better.\n The Selfish Fallacy is where you\u2019ve adopted a political view or set of views out of the previously-mentioned social necessity (or, increasingly, professional survival) but aspects of that view are unpalatable to you for various reasons, so you define the view in a way that is unusual or internally inconsistent or otherwise engineered to avoid conflicting with your other views, social world, or prior commitments. You then act as though that motivated definition is the plain truth about the view or set of views. For example, due to  my   Harper\u2019s  piece I have fairly regularly interacted with people who champion  the Nation of Islam as a revolutionary Black power organization. But in fact, as I write in the linked piece, the NOI is first and foremost a bizarre religious cult defined by social conservatism and a truly deranged mythology which has had remarkably little political impact despite its prominence and, at one time, resources. Those people weren\u2019t lying when they represented the NOI the way they did. They genuinely believed that the Nation was some radical liberation organization, rather than a means for Elijah Muhammad to amass money and get access to pliable young women, because doing so helped reconcile various clashing beliefs. The were subject to the Selfish Fallacy, in other words.\n In less explicitly political terms, many people lay claim to the idea of \u201creal Montessori,\u201d which they think encompasses what Maria Montessori really believed was essential to her pedagogy. But all Montessori educators and schools avoid some of the dictates of her book, such as the physical education routines or her strange prohibition against children eating green foods. When you discuss these deviations with passionate Montessori people, their tendency is to express ignorance of that aspect of the philosophy, dispute that it\u2019s in the book at all, or otherwise avoid confronting the deviation. The point is not that there is a dispute about what Montessori\u2019s beliefs were. Rather the point is that, where Montessori\u2019s actual beliefs might conflict with those of the people who claim her legacy, understanding of the philosophy is vague, internally inconsistent, or avoided. The Selfish Fallacy is selfish because ideas and philosophies and traditions are defined in a way that suits the interests of the person espousing them; it\u2019s a fallacy because it prompts arguments that depend on a motivated misrepresentation of the debated ideas.\n Here\u2019s an important point about the Selfish Fallacy: it\u2019s not a matter of accepting some aspects of a philosophy and not others, or wanting to develop a better idea that resolves problems within it. \u201cI admire some elements of the Nation of Islam, but there are parts that need to go\u201d is a perfectly fair position. Instead, the Selfish Fallacy is a convenient ignorance or misunderstanding, a motivated thoughtlessness; it handles conflicts not through potentially-painful reconciliation but through avoidance. \u201cI think there are important insights within critical race theory, but its rejection of the legitimacy of basic democratic rights isn\u2019t helpful,\u201d is not the Selfish Fallacy. \u201cCRT just says we should teach children that slavery is bad and racism still exists\u201d is the Selfish Fallacy because it\u2019s a convenient ignorance that allows the people saying it (and people do say stuff like that) to fulfill the social mandate to support CRT without prompting any cognitive dissonance.\n This tendency towards avoidance is why you observe the Selfish Fallacy most often in relation to the beliefs or behaviors of a specific organization one would like to maintain positive feelings towards (as when people who believe in supporting Black businesses lionize the Black Panthers, an explicitly Marxist organization), when claiming to be working in the legacy of an individual because of the rhetorical power of that claim (such as those who invoke Adam Smith while ignoring  basic elements of his philosophy), or when the debate is deeply concerned with definitions and the boundaries of a given school of thought, as with the critical race theory controversy.\n Indeed the debate about critical race theory is filled with the Selfish Fallacy. CRT is now a completely  floating signifier thanks to the motivated reasoning of those who defend it. Conventional center-left liberals feel compelled to defend CRT because conservatives attack it, but some aspects of that academic field are sufficiently extreme to make advocacy for them unpalatable, so the definition of CRT simply morphs to fit their boundaries for legitimate opinion. For many or most of the people defending critical race theory today, the tradition is just a vague assertion of the prevalence of racism, dressed up in a little academic jargon - because this conception is far more convenient for them than grappling with what CRT actually is.\n Which is funny because these liberal defenders act like they alone know what critical race theory really means. A lot of liberals suddenly find themselves not just defending CRT and pretending that they have read deeply in the field but also pretending that they  always have known what it means. (This stems from one of the most deeply-ingrained aspects of progressive culture,  the addiction to knowingness - the imperative to not only have an opinion on everything but to act like you have always had this opinion because everything is obvious and banal to you.) You can study people\u2019s records on social media or in their written work and find that they never referenced critical race theory before it became an important social signifier in liberal spaces, but that\u2019s easily waved away. In any event, it has become a cultural and professional imperative that good liberals embrace CRT, so they have embraced it.\n But as Yglesias points out here, a big part of CRT involves a skepticism towards, or an out-and-out rejection of, some  elementary aspects of liberal society. This is part of a broader academic left tendency; certainly when I was in academia in the humanities a half-decade ago it was considered terribly embarrassing to believe in individual rights and the Enlightenment etc. But a lot of ordinary everyday progressives still embrace that tradition. Rather than let their social need to defend CRT conflict with that attachment, they simply invent an imaginary CRT in their heads so there\u2019s no conflict. And this is the Selfish Fallacy.\n People are going to the mattresses for a fairly obscure set of theories from legal education that they didn\u2019t know existed last year, and so there are bound to be people passionately advocating for CRT on Twitter when many of its precepts would be very challenging to their broader politics. People want to believe that their political culture is normal and the other side is crazy, so they sand away the edges of the philosophies they\u2019re espousing. But there genuinely is some wild-ass shit in CRT stuff and the broader \u201cantiracism\u201d movement, such as the idea that  math is racist. Because it\u2019s 2021 and culture war reigns in all things, liberals who defend CRT don\u2019t want to accept that such wild shit exists. So they go on Twitter and express performative outrage at conservative ignorance about CRT while remaining entirely ignorant of what CRT is themselves in order to avoid having the nasty feeling of being pretty much conventional center-left Dems who suddenly believe, for example, that free speech is not just undesirable but has always been  a tool for maintaining white supremacy. (Warning: link contains actual critical race theory, though like much of CRT, written by a white guy.)\n This is a problem for the contemporary left and the Democratic party more broadly: recent outbursts of social justice politics have brought normies to the point of expressing aspects of extremist philosophies that they simply are not in a position to really embrace. The radical Black critique of contemporary American society really is radical! For example, it is extremely common within the broad realm of critical race theory  to argue that all white people inherently promote white supremacy, regardless of intentions. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s actually radical in substance - generalizing an accusation to that degree inevitably defangs it to the point of meaninglessness - but it is certainly a challenge to a widespread assumption that your individual racial attitudes matter in moral and political terms. But now respectability in mainstream liberal circles requires elaborate and showy deference to anything that labels itself a part of the Black social justice movement, even while those respectable mainstream liberals continue to maintain a generally bloodless approach to politics where the most radical things on offer are, like, tweaking the Earned Income Tax Credit. This combination of deference to certain kinds of radical ideas with an existentially milquetoast party is, obviously, not sustainable. The way it played out last year was that the radicalism in substance was dropped while the radical posturing endured. We didn\u2019t Defund the Police, but we did spend a lot of political capital convincing people that the Democrat were anti-cop. This does not seem ideal for anyone.\n Jeet Heer is emblematic of a sea of liberal cope on this issue. I\u2019ve been digging around his tweets on CRT and it\u2019s a mess. He simultaneously wants to argue that a) conservative critics of CRT don\u2019t know anything about CRT and are attacking it completely cynically, and b) that most defenders of CRT aren\u2019t defending the anti-liberal attitudes summarized in the passage Yglesias highlighted, which he dismisses as a \u201cfairly esoteric scholarly body of thought.\u201d Hey Jeet, buddy: critical race theory itself is a fairly esoteric scholarly body of thought. It\u2019s an approach to legal education first, and one that was until very recently not very popular even among legal educators. It has seen an explosion of interest in the past year because the kind of soggy liberals who teach at law schools have decided that they need to look busy when it comes to race or risk losing their cush gigs. The question is, should we take it seriously for what it actually is, that particular brand of scholastic \u201cantiracism,\u201d with all of its extremity, insularity, and academic baggage? Or do we just use \u201ccritical race theory\u201d to mean a vague approach to understanding race that emphasizes the symbolic, cultural, and linguistic to the detriment of the material, and which is defined primarily by relentless pessimism dressed up as radicalism?\n The problem with the latter option is that it renders a farce of one of the most commonly-voiced liberal complaints about this debate, which is that conservatives don\u2019t know anything about what they\u2019re critiquing. To acknowledge that the actual substance of CRT is a \u201cfairly esoteric scholarly body of thought,\u201d rather than the free-form social signifier for \u201cpeople who are Good About Race\u201d disarms that critique. It reveals it for the utter hypocrisy that it\u2019s always been. Yes, conservatives don\u2019t know shit about CRT and attack it for cynical reasons, but most of the liberals defending CRT don\u2019t know shit about it either and are defending it for reasons of pure culture war and social signaling. When I made this point earlier this week I was accused of \u201cfalse equivalence,\u201d but I\u2019m not saying that critics and defenders of CRT are the same. The conservatives are full of shit and utterly hypocritical about freedom of speech and exchange of ideas and local control of schools and more. Banning CRT in schools is asinine, for no other reason than that K-12 students aren\u2019t exactly in a rush to uncritically accept what\u2019s they\u2019re taught in the first place. But on the specific question of people arguing about CRT without having read any of it, well - the idea that the average BlueAnon Twitter account raging about conservative attacks on CRT is doing so from an educated place is so absurd I can\u2019t imagine anybody would defend it.\n In 6 months the CRT debate will be over and nobody will talk about it and we\u2019ll be on to a new bullshit \u201cconversation about race\u201d that never admits to the fact that our supposed racial reckoning has  accomplished nothing. Because the very purpose of all of this culture war is to distract from that failure. But the bigger problem for the mainstream left-of-center will remain: they\u2019ve painted themselves into a corner of having to be seen uncritically accepting the positions of Black critics of contemporary society even when those positions cut directly against their own actual beliefs and what they know to be in their political best interest. The Democratic intelligentsia must appear to accept Black radicalism even while their base rejects it and they know that there are electoral advantages to distancing themselves from it. ( Ask Eric Adams.) This situation can\u2019t last, and when it comes to a head, it might get ugly. And for those radical Black critics the story might be bleaker still: the fact that the Democratic party so effortlessly incorporates their rhetoric suggests that it\u2019s far less challenging than they might like to think. Jeet Heer, for one, thinks all that radical stuff can be dismissed out of hand, and this is where Black radicalism stands among liberals today.\n If you think that we must maintain this strange performative deference to Black radicalism because of the events of last year, I would gently suggest that we try giving them results instead of deference.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 16:49:58",

As the project and its community is going strong,  I think we made somemistakes in the earlypositioning and messaging of Knative prevented the project from being a go-toaddon for Kubernetes that\u2019s adopted widely.\n Because I have never been a decision-maker for the Knative project and itsmessaging at Google, I can provide an outsider\u2019s perspective despite havingworked on different aspects of Knative during this time. There are many reasons(internal to Google) as to why Knative was shaped the way it is, and I won\u2019t gointo those here.\n I strongly believe that with the right positioning and marketing, Knativecould\u2019ve been a tool with high adoption that\u2019s naturally installed on mostKubernetes clusters. I still think that there\u2019s no reason not to install KnativeServing into a cluster where you run services \u2013it is a fabulous abstractionlayer that simplifies a dozen of concerns that every service operator goesthrough.\n  First version of Knative came with three parts: Serving, Eventing, and Build.These may sound like they are three orthogonal concerns, because they reallywere. Knative Build was the first part to get separated (and became the Tektonproject).\n It\u2019s worth noting that \u201cserving\u201d is a needed component for doing serverless, andpeople do \u201ceventing\u201d on serverless environments, and these two shared some corelogic. But beyond that, they don\u2019t have anything in common.\n To this day, Knative is still both serving and eventing. This creates confusionthat likely impaired adoption decisions because the project really does twothings; not one. It\u2019s perfectly normal for a developer trying to learn moreabout Knative to ask questions \u201cdo I have to use both\u201d, \u201ccan I install themseparately\u201d and end up not using the project due to perceived complexity.\n I think Knative should have been just the serving component. It would have astrong brand and message like \u201can add-on to do better microservices networking\u201don Kubernetes.\n After all, it brings a ton of features like request-based autoscaling,concurrency controls, meat shielding, reproducible deployments (revisions) withtraffic splitting abilities, rollbacks, out-of-the box telemetry, scale-to-zeroand so on that developers  actuallycare.\n  Our initial announcementand  earlycopies of theproject website kept saying Knative is \u201cbuilding-blocks for Kubernetes\u201d. Whilethis is technically correct, I think we overestimated how many people on theplanet want to build a Heroku-like PaaS layer on top of Knative (for one, wehaven\u2019t built and offered this to our customers).\n In reality, there are perhaps a couple of dozen companies who would build theirown Kubernetes-based PaaS internally using Knative( S&amp;Phas an example of bringing Knative to simplify their internal stack, and Scaleway builds a public FaaSoffering on top of Knative), yet, our messaging revolved around these \u201cplatformengineers\u201d or operators who could take Knative and build their UI/CLI/\u2026experience on top. This was the target audience for those  building blocksKnative had to offer. However, this turned out to be a very small and nicheaudience.\n However, for every platform-builder who we targeted, there are at least a dozenor more Kubernetes users who are not interested in building their internal PaaS,and they could totally use Knative Serving to have an easier time with runningapps on Kubernetes. We just didn\u2019t aim for them directly.\n Knative Serving is a lot more useful beyond just being a \u201cbuilding block\u201d: Ithink it is  the missing servinglayer for runningmicroservices on Kubernetes. It could have been the  firstthing peopleinstalled after creating a cluster.\n If all you are doing on Kubernetes is to run services, you can just use theKnative Service API and touch pretty much  nothingelse inKubernetes. We  accidentally  1 created a \u201csingle point of interaction\u201d CRDAPI that worked andsaved you from worrying about creating 3-5 Kubernetes objects just to run aservice behind a load balancer \u2014butwe didn\u2019t talk about it at all. As one of the founders, Evan,  putsit  &#34;[it wouldhave been] better to be more crisp and less ambiguous, especially when ambiguityprovided space for FUD&#34;.\n  Something we were never able to communicate properly is that Knative is a verylightweight serving layer that doesn\u2019t take up much space in your cluster anddoes not eat up your resources. Heck, it can run even on a Raspberry Pi-basedcluster. But there is a perceived complexity and  largefootprintrequirement that comes with Knative \u2013and it is not unwarranted. For the longesttime, Knative required Istio  2, and Istio itself has been infamous forinstalling 50+ CRDs (APIs) to your cluster. Istio\u2019s installation manifests werenot meant to be readable to the human eye.\n Istio coupling meant our potential users (who were probably hesitant aboutinstalling yet another component to their cluster) were now facing installinghalf a dozen new components and CRD configs just to install Istio. That is ahard sell for many cluster admins who precisely want to know what goes intotheir cluster.\n Once the first ten thousand eyes evaluated Knative and saw that it requiredIstio, we eventually fixed this over time  3, but perhaps the damage was done. Nowthat everything is clear in hindsight, the right way to go about this probablywould be to ship Knative with  its owningress, (and Knative stilloffers the Istio integration).\n  I think Knative wanted to be successful in many areas at the same time and makemany stakeholders happy (especially internally at Google). This worked to someextent, but we never invested in developer marketing to show the world thatKnative could be a natural add-on to any Kubernetes cluster serving HTTPtraffic.\n As always, everything is more clear in hindsight. Thankfully, the Knativeproject is at a great place and the community is going strong. Maybe someday,more people (in masses) will see the parts of Knative that are useful to themand adopt it. Regardless, it\u2019s the friends we made along the way that matteredanyway.\n  This opinion piece was initially shared internally at Google. Thanks to allreading drafts of this and expressing their opinions and giving historicalcontext.\n My bad, not so accidentally. @steren  correctedme that there was UXresearch and proposals behind the  Service abstraction.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n Funny enough, we actually never needed a full mesh for Knative (we justneeded an L7 gateway that we and we picked Istio because it\u2019s developed atGoogle) but users that we scared off definitely did not know that.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n First by offering an Istio Slim installation, and eventually uncouplingIstio and making the gateways pluggable.\u00a0 \u21a9\ufe0e\n  I am a software engineer at Google, working on  Cloud Run, and  Kubernetes. I focus on improving developer experiences and explaining complex features in simple words. I\u2019ve created developer tools like  Krew and  kubectx.

                                                             Bharti Kamble is on the lookout for fake messages related to COVID-19. Late in the afternoon, she carefully reads over 500 messages from eight WhatsApp groups. As she finishes her search, she\u2019s relieved. \u201cFor 30 days now, I didn\u2019t come across a single piece of misinformation as WhatsApp forward,\u201d she says. But after a year spent fighting misinformation, Kamble remains wary. \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to declare a victory,\u201d she says.\n Kamble is an accredited social health activist (ASHA worker), the foot soldier of India\u2019s rural healthcare system. When she started work as an ASHA, she never thought she\u2019d be fact-checking hundreds of messages every week. Selected under India\u2019s National Health Mission, ASHA workers are women who care for about 1,000 people within their village. They are tasked with at least 50 responsibilities, some of which include providing medicines for common ailments like coughs or fevers, maintaining over 73 different community health records, counseling on birth preparedness, ensuring antenatal and postnatal care, arranging for immunizations, providing contraception, and much more.\n Kamble is the ASHA worker for the 701 people living in the remote village of Bolakewadi in Western India\u2019s Maharashtra state. In some ways, they\u2019ve been lucky during the pandemic \u2014 the village hasn\u2019t reported a single COVID case. It is astonishing because over 50 percent of villagers regularly migrate 285 miles north to India\u2019s financial capital Mumbai, a city that became a COVID hotspot.\n  Starting in March 2020, nearly  1 million ASHA workers across 600,000 Indian villages were  tasked with containing the community transmission of coronavirus. They survey their populations to find suspected COVID cases, monitor patients\u2019 oxygen and temperature levels daily, contract-trace, ensure patients complete their quarantine period, and help them get medical care.\n Their daunting task is complicated by misinformation, which spreads like wildfire on social media platforms. While surveying in March 2021, Kamble found a woman in her 80s with heavy fever and fatigue. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you take paracetamol tablets from me?\u201d Kamble asked. The old woman replied, \u201cWhat if you would have given my name to your seniors [supervisors], asking me to quarantine? I heard that fasting and praying to God alleviates the fever.\u201d It was the third day of her fasting. Without any delay, Kamble gave her packets of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) and paracetamol tablets. \u201cWithin four days, she felt better,\u201d Kamble said, but her task was far from over. Kamble began investigating and found that \u201cfasting cures COVID\u201d was a misinformation message forwarded multiple times in the vernacular language Marathi on village WhatsApp groups.\n Kamble, who is a part of over eight such groups, immediately messaged that fasting is no cure for COVID-19. She explained the science behind a proper diet and the importance of modern medicines. She wanted to make sure that no one else tried to fast away a fever. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get training on busting misinformation. We learned on the job and with interactions from the people,\u201d she says. She may not have had any formal training, but Kamble\u2019s had plenty of practice over the past year.\n  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, India has tested positive for pseudoscience and misinformation, leading to a surge in cases. India reported over 29 million cases, with more than 353,000 people succumbing to the virus as of June 9th, 2021, with experts stating that this figure remains a massive  undercount. Several leaders of the elected far-right Bharatiya Janata Party have been vocal about drinking cow urine to prevent COVID, with a few even making  videos of it.\n Last year, its leaders organized a gaumutra (cow urine) drinking  event. Kamble came across several such messages. \u201cWhat do you even say to something like that? A lot of people in fact did try it.\u201d She started sourcing scientific messages from doctors and began messaging about COVID treatments that actually worked. \u201cIf you directly counter misinformation saying it\u2019s wrong, then people don\u2019t listen and start provoking you,\u201d she explains. Instead, her antidote is disseminating scientific information in the easiest possible way. Eventually, she says, people realized cow urine is no cure for COVID.\n Kamble isn\u2019t the only ASHA worker using WhatsApp to curb misinformation. Netradipa Patil, an ASHA and leader of over 3,000 ASHAs from Kolhapur\u2019s Shirol region, found that every family member in her surveying area of 1,000 people has at least one smartphone. \u201cWhen we distributed COVID awareness pamphlets, people threw them [away]. That\u2019s when I decided to act smartly.\u201d When she saw instances of fake news and misinformation, she made a hyperlocal WhatsApp group with 200-plus members. \u201cWhen unscientific messages go viral, I dial up at least three COVID doctors and confirm all the facts,\u201d she says. She then types out messages, makes videos, and forwards newspaper clippings. This has taken a lot of her time but has helped save many lives. \u201cIn COVID\u2019s second wave (March to June 2021), my area reported less than 10 cases and no deaths,\u201d she says proudly. In contrast, Kolhapur district as a whole reported a case fatality rate of  3.5 percent in May 2021 \u2014 one of the highest in India.\n  By June 2020, Patil had mobilized other ASHAs to form similar groups. In addition to combating misinformation over WhatsApp, they also make an effort to bust misinformation during their surveys of their community so they can reach people without internet access.\n The situation became more urgent this spring. Starting on March 1st, 2021, India began its vaccination drive for citizens over the age of 60. ASHAs were to make a list of those citizens and submit it to the local civic authorities \u2014 but even gathering names became an uphill battle. \u201cSenior citizens kept telling me that COVID vaccination is like slow poisoning. \u2018Within six months of getting jabbed, we will die,\u2019\u201d Patil said.  The misinformation that \u201cIndia\u2019s population has increased a lot and the Government is using vaccines to reduce it\u201d spread rapidly. \u201cIt sounds funny, but it took two months of messaging and door-to-door visits to convince more than 90 percent of people to get vaccinated,\u201d she recalls. Patil also shared her photo of getting jabbed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve taken both the doses, and I am alive.\u201d\n Even after people get vaccinated, the job of ASHAs doesn\u2019t end. In Kolhapur\u2019s Pernoli village of 2,265 residents, two people died within a few days of the vaccination. This was a nightmare scenario for ASHA workers Mandakini Kodak and Rekha Dorugade. Suddenly, everyone in their village resisted vaccination. They probed these deaths and found both people were asthmatic and COVID positive \u2014 and that they hadn\u2019t received reputable care. \u201cThey took injections and medicines from a quack. How can someone blame the vaccines then?\u201d asks Kodak.\n  Often, misinformation is intertwined with superstitious beliefs. \u201cLast year, several villagers refused to follow COVID protocol, saying that the village God won\u2019t let Corona in,\u201d remembers Kodak. Kamble faced something similar. As COVID cases kept increasing across the hinterlands, several villagers decided to swarm the local temple for a \u201ccommunity prayer.\u201d Kamble started messaging that even if a single person tests COVID positive, it could lead to community transmission. She put infographics of COVID protocols as her WhatsApp status. \u201cFaith is completely fine, but when it overpowers logic and science, it becomes a problem,\u201d she says.\n  ASHAs work in stifling conditions with inadequate safety gear and receive \u201cperformance-based incentives\u201d based on the tasks completed. Despite working for over a decade, they aren\u2019t recognized as full-time workers and average a monthly pay of $41 to $55 in Maharashtra. \u201cWe are busting misinformation, saving countless lives, and completing surveys on phones, yet the Government doesn\u2019t even reimburse us for the internet,\u201d says Patil. With poor pay, many ASHAs double up as farmworkers to make ends meet.\n Their limited resources aren\u2019t well-understood in the communities they serve. Last year, a rumor began circulating on WhatsApp that said that for every COVID-19 patient detected, the Central Government would send money to local governments, Kodak says. This was not true. \u201cThe Government has no money to even buy hand gloves and sanitizers for us, how and why will they spend on detecting cases?\u201d asks Kodak laughingly.\n The ASHAs\u2019 mission to contain COVID-19 outbreaks is often hampered by their poor-quality oximeters and infrared (IR) thermometers, provided by the government. While surveying, Maya Patil, an ASHA from Shirol, found her oximeter wouldn\u2019t show any readings. There were problems with the oximeter\u2019s display and quality. \u201cIt would show a reading only when indoors. Surveying inside the houses of containment zones with inadequate ventilation means risking life, but the Government doesn\u2019t understand this, and [it refuses to give] us better-quality equipment,\u201d she says. As a result of the faulty readings, many people refrain from getting their oxygen levels tested. \u201cMany lives will be at risk if there\u2019s a community transmission because of faulty equipment,\u201d says Maya Patil.\n  Kamble experienced a similar problem from a 72-year-old woman. \u201cHer oxygen level had dropped to 70. The family didn\u2019t believe it and started verbally abusing me,\u201d she says. The family started accusing Kamble of planning a conspiracy to send the old woman to the quarantine center. Somehow, she persuaded the family to consult a doctor. The patient\u2019s oxygen level was diagnosed to be lower. \u201cLess oxygen doesn\u2019t always mean COVID, and people don\u2019t even know what the normal oxygen level is,\u201d Kamble says.\n To educate the community and regain their trust, Kamble turned again to social media. She found a graphic representing the required oxygen level and put it up as a WhatsApp status. She sent the same photo to multiple WhatsApp groups, eventually reaching over 500 people directly.\n \u201cMy inbox was flooded with replies, with some mentioning they had taken a screenshot as a reference, while others thanked me for making them aware of it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe same family now asks me to monitor the oxygen level daily.\u201d For something as simple as checking oxygen, Kamble was forced to spend several hours working to counter misinformation on WhatsApp. Now, she is facing off with senior health officials regarding the mediocre-quality equipment. Already, she has gotten several of her oximeters and IR thermometers replaced.\n It\u2019s one of the triumphant stories ASHAs share about countering misinformation using technology. \u201cThere are many people who thank us for asking them to get vaccinated,\u201d says Kodak. While some people in the area tested COVID positive, none were hospitalized, vindicating the ASHAs\u2019 vaccination campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to listen to such stories.\u201d\n \u201cEven if people disagree with our messages, they do read and discuss. While surveying, we spend at least three hours every day countering such misinformation,\u201d Kamble says. While misinformation in her own village has slowed, the list of pseudoscientific messages continues ricocheting around WhatsApp groups in other areas of the country.\n  \u201cIf you have taken the vaccine, you should avoid sunrays for a week\u201d\n   These are just a few of the hundreds of messages Kodak has received lately. She addresses every statement, often while working 10- to 12-hour days. \u201cIf I save someone, I will have done my job,\u201d she says.", "posttime": "2021-06-18 15:26:19", "source_domain":

", "note_en": "Here is a mental model I share often with friends looking for job opportunities: your ability to get a job is the product of two quantities, the  value of your skill and the  liquidity of your skill.\n The  value of a skill is the fundamental value you add by applying your skill to a task. It is the difference between a task done with your skill, and a task done without. If I need to build an app to solve a problem, and I can use my programming skill to pull it off quickly and produce a good product, I\u2019ve added some value to this task by being good at programming. That difference that I made is the value of my skill.\n The  liquidity of a skill is how easily and readily you can convert your skill into some other kind of useful resource, like money, social capital, or influence. If I\u2019m only a mediocre programmer, but there are 10,000 people who know exactly how good I am, I\u2019m going to be able to make more money and get hired quicker than a world-class programmer who anyone barely knows.\n Some skills are inherently more liquid than others, but there are ways for everyone to make their skill more easily convertible to money or influence or whatever else you desire.\n The ability to write software is of good (though not exceptional) value, but it is  so unbelievably liquid right now. There\u2019s a huge, growing, market with insatiable demand for good programmers, and the output of your skill can be scaled up so quickly and easily with just a good computer. This is why software engineers make lots of money. The ability to make great Korean food, by comparison, is not as liquid. Your work depends on real, physical ingredients that grow out of the ground, some well-equipped workspace, and real people visiting you to take the fruits of your labor from your hands. I don\u2019t think this skill is any less valuable than my ability to write decent software. This skill is valuable, but illiquid. It\u2019s like having a check for a million bucks that you can\u2019t cash all at once.\n It\u2019s easy to make the mistake of conflating  how much money you can make with  how valuable your skill is. People think that being a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer is of fundamentally more value to society than being a chef or a musician, because they tend to make much more money. But the reality is that if one job makes more money than another, it\u2019s generally not because that labor or skill is fundamentally more valuable, it\u2019s just more liquid, more easily converted to money, or simply less replaceable.\n Your ability to have a good career is the product of two things: the fundamental value and liquidity of the skills you have. So, when applied to job hunting, this means that there are really only two things that matter.\n  All of the games people play to get an edge in hiring, like polishing resumes, practicing interviews, or going to networking events, are simply the popular ways of maximizing one of these two quantities. These small tactical pieces of advice can be useful, but I find it helpful to know what the ultimate goals are: to be good, and to have as many people know that as possible.\n Most people focus too much on being good, and not enough on how liquid their skill is \u2013 how many people know how good they are. Many of my friends are better programmers than I am, no doubt. But I think I have a much less stressful time finding interesting opportunities because I sort of talk about it constantly online to tens of thousands of people and share what I make. Does this mean you should work off-hours or grind away on making a hundred side projects? No, obviously not, I\u2019m just a pathological outlier. But think about how much time you spend improving your skill, going through school and honing your craft. Now think about how much time and energy you spend letting people know about what you do and why you do it. If that distribution of effort were more balanced, where would you be? What could you do?\n        I share new posts on my  newsletter.
