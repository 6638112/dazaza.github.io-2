Then he read a novel—he liked James Patterson and Clive Cussler—or, if he was feeling more ambitious, Freud. On scraps of paper and legal notepads, he jotted down thoughts sparked by his reading. “Deep below the rational part of our brain is an underground ocean where strange things swim,” he wrote on one notepad. On another, “Life: the longer it cooks, the better it tastes.”</p><p>多年来，鲁迪北醒来时醒来。 。并阅读Las Vegas评论 - 在吃一块烤面包时。然后他读了一部小说 - 他喜欢詹姆斯·帕特森和克莱夫·哥伦德 - 或者，如果他感觉更雄心勃勃，弗洛伊德。论纸质和法律记事本的废料，他蹒跚地笑着引发了他的阅读。 “低于我们大脑的理性部分是一个奇怪的东西游泳的地下海洋，”他在一个记事本上写道。另一方面，“生活：煮熟的时间越长，味道越好。”</p><p> Rennie, his wife of fifty-seven years, was slower to rise. She was recovering from lymphoma and suffered from neuropathy so severe that her legs felt like sausages. Each morning, she spent nearly an hour in the bathroom applying makeup and lotions, the same brands she’d used for forty years. She always emerged wearing pale-pink lipstick. Rudy, who was prone to grandiosity, liked to refer to her as “my amour.”</p><p> 雷尼，他的五十七年的妻子飙升速度较慢。她正在从淋巴瘤中恢复，并且患有神经病变如此严重的是她的腿觉得香肠。每天早上，她在浴室里花了近一个小时的涂抹和乳液，同样的品牌她已经使用了四十年。她总是出现穿着淡粉红色的唇膏。鲁迪倾向于壮观，喜欢将她称为“我的崇拜”。</p><p> On the Friday before Labor Day, 2013, the Norths had just finished their toast when a nurse, who visited five times a week to help Rennie bathe and dress, came to their house, in Sun City Aliante, an “active adult” community in Las Vegas. They had moved there in 2005, when Rudy, a retired consultant for broadcasters, was sixty-eight and Rennie was sixty-six. They took pride in their view of the golf course, though neither of them played golf.</p><p> 在星期五，2013年劳动节前，北方刚刚完成了一名护士，刚刚在一周访问了五次才能帮助仁尼洗澡和连衣裙，来到他们的房子，在孙城aliante，是一个“活跃的成人”社区拉斯维加斯。他们于2005年搬到那里，当时广播公司的退休顾问是六十八和雷尼的六十六年。他们在他们对高尔夫球场的看法中骄傲，虽然他们都没有打高尔夫球。</p><p> Rudy chatted with the nurse in the kitchen for twenty minutes, joking about marriage and laundry, until there was a knock at the door. A stocky woman with shiny black hair introduced herself as April Parks, the owner of the company A Private Professional Guardian. She was accompanied by three colleagues, who didn’t give their names. Parks told the Norths that she had an order from the Clark County Family Court to “remove” them from their home. She would be taking them to an assisted-living facility. “Go and gather your things,” she said.</p><p> 鲁迪用护士在厨房里聊了二十分钟，开玩笑，婚姻和洗衣，直到门口敲门。一个闪亮的黑发的股票女人介绍了自己作为4月公园，公司的所有者是私人专业守护者。她陪同三个同事，他没有给出他们的名字。公园告诉北方，她从克拉克县家庭法院有订单，从他们家中“删除”他们。她将把它们带到辅助生活设施。 “去收集你的东西，”她说。</p><p>  One of Parks’s colleagues said that if the Norths didn’t comply he would call the police. Rudy remembers thinking, You’re going to put my wife and me in jail for this? But he felt too confused to argue.</p><p>  公园的同事之一说，如果北方符合他会召唤警察。鲁迪记得思考，你会把我的妻子和我放在监狱里吗？但他觉得争论太困惑了。</p><p>  Parks drove a Pontiac G-6 convertible with a license plate that read “ ,” for “court guardian.” In the past twelve years, she had been a guardian for some four hundred wards of the court. Owing to age or disability, they had been deemed incompetent, a legal term that describes those who are unable to make reasoned choices about their lives or their property. As their guardian, Parks had the authority to manage their assets, and to choose where they lived, whom they associated with, and what medical treatment they received. They lost nearly all their civil rights.</p><p>  公园驾驶了一个庞蒂亚克G-6敞篷车，牌照“，”为“法院监护人”。在过去的十二年里，她一直是一个守护者，为法院的四百个病房。由于年龄或残疾，他们被视为无能，这是一个法律术语，描述了那些无法对其生活或其财产进行理解选择的法律术语。作为他们的监护人，公园有权管理他们的资产，并选择他们居住的地方，他们与他们相关的人以及他们收到的医疗。他们几乎失去了他们所有的公民权利。</p><p> Without realizing it, the Norths had become temporary wards of the court. Parks had filed an emergency ex-parte petition, which provides an exception to the rule that both parties must be notified of any argument before a judge. She had alleged that the Norths posed a “substantial risk for mismanagement of medications, financial loss and physical harm.” She submitted a brief letter from a physician’s assistant, whom Rennie had seen once, stating that “the patient’s husband can no longer effectively take care of the patient at home as his dementia is progressing.” She also submitted a letter from one of Rudy’s doctors, who described him as “confused and agitated.”</p><p> 在没有意识到的情况下，北方已成为法院的临时病房。公园提出了一个紧急的前伙伴请愿，这为这条缔约方必须在法官之前通知任何缔约方的规则提供了例外。她据称，北方向“药物不善，金融损失和身体损害的实质性风险”构成了“实质性风险”。她从医生的助手提交了一封简短的信，莱尼已经见过一次，陈述“患者的丈夫不能再在家里有效地照顾患者，因为他的痴呆症是进步。”她还从一个鲁迪的医生提交了一封信，他将他描述为“困惑和令人震惊”。 </p><p>  Rudy and Rennie had not undergone any cognitive assessments. They had never received a diagnosis of dementia. In addition to Freud, Rudy was working his way through Nietzsche and Plato. Rennie read romance novels.</p><p>Rudy和Rennie没有经历任何认知评估。他们从未接受过痴呆症的诊断。除弗洛伊德外，鲁迪还通过尼采和柏拉图工作。莱尼阅读浪漫小说。</p><p>  Parks told the Norths that if they didn’t come willingly an ambulance would take them to the facility, a place she described as a “respite.” Still crying, Rennie put cosmetics and some clothes into a suitcase. She packed so quickly that she forgot her cell phone and Rudy’s hearing aid. After thirty-five minutes, Parks’s assistant led the Norths to her car. When a neighbor asked what was happening, Rudy told him, “We’ll just be gone for a little bit.” He was too proud to draw attention to their predicament. “Just think of it as a mini-vacation,” he told Rennie.</p><p>  公园告诉北方，如果他们没有来，救护车将把它们带到该设施，她描述为“喘息”的地方。仍然在哭，莱尼把化妆品和一些衣服放入手提箱里。她很快打包了，她忘记了手机和鲁迪的助听器。三十五分钟后，公园的助手将北方带到她的车上。当邻居问发生了什么，鲁迪告诉他，“我们只会走一点点。”他太自豪地吸引了他们的困境。 “只是想到它作为迷你度假，”他告诉莱尼。</p><p> After the Norths left, Parks walked through the house with Cindy Breck, the owner of Caring Transitions, a company that relocates seniors and sells their belongings at estate sales. Breck and Parks had a routine. “We open drawers,” Parks said at a deposition. “We look in closets. We pull out boxes, anything that would store—that would keep paperwork, would keep valuables.” She took a pocket watch, birth certificates, insurance policies, and several collectible coins.</p><p> 在北方左侧，公园乘坐辛迪布雷克的房子走遍了Cindy Brecks，这是一个搬迁老年人的公司，并在遗产销售中销售他们的物品。布雷克和公园有一个例程。 “我们打开抽屉，”公园在沉积时说。 “我们照壁橱。我们拔出盒子，任何东西会储存 - 这将保持文书，会保留贵重物品。“她拍了一个怀表，出生证明，保险政策和几枚收集硬币。</p><p>  The Norths’ daughter, Julie Belshe, came to visit later that afternoon. A fifty-three-year-old mother of three sons, she and her husband run a small business designing and constructing pools. She lived ten miles away and visited her parents nearly every day, often taking them to her youngest son’s football games. She was her parents’ only living child; her brother and sister had died.</p><p>  北美的女儿朱莉·贝尔（Julie Belshe）下午晚点来访。三十三岁的三个儿子母亲，她和她的丈夫经营了一个小型商业设计和建造池。她住了十英里之外，几乎每天都去过父母，经常把它们带到她最小的儿子的足球比赛中。她是她父母的父母;她的兄弟和姐妹已经死了。</p><p> She knocked on the front door several times and then tried to push the door open, but it was locked. She was surprised to see the kitchen window closed; her parents always left it slightly open. She drove to the Sun City Aliante clubhouse, where her parents sometimes drank coffee. When she couldn’t find them there, she thought that perhaps they had gone on an errand together—the farthest they usually drove was to Costco. But, when she returned to the house, it was still empty.</p><p> 她几次敲门后敲门，然后试图推动门打开，但它被锁定了。她惊讶地看到厨房窗户关闭;她的父母总是留下略微打开。她开车去了太阳城aliante俱乐部，她的父母有时会喝咖啡。当她在那里找不到他们时，她认为他们也许他们在一起 - 他们通常驾驶的最远的是胜过哥斯科。但是，当她回到房子时，它仍然是空的。</p><p> That weekend, she called her parents several times. She also called two hospitals to see if they had been in an accident. She called their landlord, too, and he agreed to visit the house. He reported that there were no signs of them. She told her husband, “I think someone kidnapped my parents.”</p><p> 那个周末，她几次打电话给她的父母。她还叫两家医院，看看他们是否发生了意外。她也叫他们的房东，他同意参观房子。他报告说没有他们的迹象。她告诉她的丈夫，“我认为有人绑架了父母。”</p><p> On the Tuesday after Labor Day, she drove to the house again and found a note taped to the door: “In case of emergency, contact guardian April Parks.” Belshe dialled the number. Parks, who had a brisk, girlish way of speaking, told Belshe that her parents had been taken to Lakeview Terrace, an assisted-living facility in Boulder City, nine miles from the Arizona border. She assured Belshe that the staff there would take care of all their needs.</p><p> 在劳动节之后的星期二，她再次开车到房子，发现一份录音在门口：“如果是紧急情况，请联系卫士4月公园。” belshe拨打了这个号码。 Parks有了轻快，少女的讲话方式，告诉Belshe，她的父母被带到湖景露台，这是距离亚利尔城的博尔德市九英里的辅助生活设施。她向贝尔斯保证，工作人员会照顾他们所有的需求。 </p><p>  “You can’t just walk into somebody’s home and take them!” Belshe told her.</p><p>“你不能只是走进某人的家，带走他们！” Belshe告诉她。</p><p>  Guardianship derives from the state’s  parens patriae power, its duty to act as a parent for those considered too vulnerable to care for themselves. “The King shall have the custody of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits of them without waste or destruction, and shall find them their necessaries,” reads the English statute  De Prerogative Regis, from 1324. The law was imported to the colonies—guardianship is still controlled by state, not federal, law—and has remained largely intact for the past eight hundred years. It establishes a relationship between ward and guardian that is rooted in trust.</p><p>  监护派对来自国家的Parens Patriae权力，其责任作为父母，因为那些被认为太容易照顾自己的人。 “国王将拘留自然傻瓜的土地，在没有浪费或毁灭的情况下，在没有浪费或毁灭的情况下取得利润，并应发现他们的必需品，”读取英国法规De Prerogative Regis，从1324年读到殖民地-Guardianship仍然受到国家，而不是联邦，法律 - 在过去的八百年里仍然在很大程度上完好无损。它建立了拯救信任的病房和监护人之间的关系。</p><p> In the United States, a million and a half adults are under the care of guardians, either family members or professionals, who control some two hundred and seventy-three billion dollars in assets, according to an auditor for the guardianship fraud program in Palm Beach County. Little is known about the outcome of these arrangements, because states do not keep complete figures on guardianship cases—statutes vary widely—and, in most jurisdictions, the court records are sealed. A Government Accountability report from 2010 said, “We could not locate a single Web site, federal agency, state or local entity, or any other organization that compiles comprehensive information on this issue.” A study published this year by the American Bar Association found that “an unknown number of adults languish under guardianship” when they no longer need it, or never did. The authors wrote that “guardianship is generally “permanent, leaving no way out—‘until death do us part.’ ”</p><p> 根据棕榈滩的监护欺诈计划的审计师，在美国，一百万个成年人受到监护人，家庭成员或专业人士的关注，无论是家庭成员或专业人士，他们都控制了大约二百七十三十亿美元的资产县。关于这些安排的结果，因为各国不会在监护案件中保持完全的数据 - 法规在大多数司法管辖区内差异，因此法院记录被封印。从2010年的政府问责报告说：“我们无法找到一个网站，联邦机构，州或地方实体，或任何汇总关于此问题的全面信息的其他组织。”美国酒吧协会今年发表的一项研究发现，当他们不再需要它或从未如此，“在监护下的一个未知数量的成年人萎靡不振”。作者写道，“监护人一般是”永久性的，没有办法，不会出现 - ''“</p><p> When the Norths were removed from their home, they joined nearly nine thousand adult wards in the Las Vegas Valley. In the past twenty years, the city has promoted itself as a retirement paradise. Attracted by the state’s low taxes and a dry, sunny climate, elderly people leave their families behind to resettle in newly constructed senior communities. “The whole town sparkled, pulling older people in with the prospect of the American Dream at a reasonable price,” a former real-estate agent named Terry Williams told me. Roughly thirty per cent of the people who move to Las Vegas are senior citizens, and the number of Nevadans older than eighty-five has risen by nearly eighty per cent in the past decade.</p><p> 当北方从他们的家中删除时，他们加入了拉斯维加斯山谷的近九千成年病房。在过去的二十年里，该市已作为退休天堂促进自己。被州的低税和干旱，阳光明媚的气候所吸引，老年人将家人留在新建的高级社区的重新安置。 “整个城镇闪闪发光，以合理的价格向美国梦想的前景拉动老人，”一个名叫特里·威廉姆斯的前房地产经纪人告诉我。大约三十个搬到拉斯维加斯的人是老年人，而八十五岁的尼沃亚人数在过去十年中近八十八十八十五岁。</p><p> In Nevada, as in many states, anyone can become a guardian by taking a course, as long as he or she has not been convicted of a felony or recently declared bankruptcy. Elizabeth Brickfield, a Las Vegas lawyer who has worked in guardianship law for twenty years, said that about fifteen years ago, as the state’s elderly population swelled, “all these private guardians started arriving, and the docket exploded. The court became a factory.”</p><p> 在内华达州，如同许多州，只要他或她没有被判犯有重罪或最近宣布的破产，就可以通过参加课程成为守护者。伊丽莎白Brickfield，Las Vegas律师在20年代曾在监护法律上工作，这是大约十五年前，随着国家的老年人口膨胀，“所有这些私人监护人都开始到达，而店铺爆炸。法院成为一家工厂。“</p><p> Pamela Teaster, the director of the Center for Gerontology at Virginia Tech and one of the few scholars in the country who study guardianship, told me that, though most guardians assume their duties for good reasons, the guardianship system is “a morass, a total mess.” She said, “It is unconscionable that we don’t have any data, when you think about the vast power given to a guardian. It is one of society’s most drastic interventions.”</p><p> Pamela Teaster是弗吉尼亚理工学院中心中心的主任，以及研究监护人的少数学者之一告诉我，虽然大多数监护人都承担了理想理由的职责，但监护系统是“莫拉斯，总计混乱。”她说：“当您考虑给监护人的巨大力量时，我们没有任何数据是不合情理的。这是社会最激烈的干预措施之一。“</p><p> After talking to Parks, Belshe drove forty miles to Lakeview Terrace, a complex of stucco buildings designed to look like a hacienda. She found her parents in a small room with a kitchenette and a window overlooking the parking lot. Rennie was in a wheelchair beside the bed, and Rudy was curled up on a love seat in the fetal position. There was no phone in the room. Medical-alert buttons were strung around their necks. “They were like two lost children,” Belshe said.</p><p> 与公园交谈后，Belshe开车到Lakeview露台四十英里，这是一座旨在看起来像一个庄园的灰泥建筑物。她在一个小房间里找到了父母，带小厨房和俯瞰停车场的窗户。雷尼在床上旁边是一个轮椅，鲁迪在胎儿位置的爱情座位上蜷缩着。房间里没有电话。医疗警报按钮围绕着颈部。 “他们就像两个失去的孩子一样，”贝尔说。 </p><p>  She asked her parents who Parks was and where she could find the court order, but, she said, “they were overwhelmed and humiliated, and they didn’t know what was going on.” They had no idea how or why Parks had targeted them as wards. Belshe was struck by their passive acceptance. “It was like they had Stockholm syndrome or something,” she told me.</p><p>她问她的父母帕克斯是帕克斯，她可以找到法院命令，但是，她说：“他们被淹没和羞辱，他们不知道发生了什么。”他们不知道公园如何将他们视为病房。 Belshe因被动验收而被击中。 “这就像他们有斯德哥尔摩综合症或其他东西，”她告诉我。</p><p> Belshe acknowledged that her parents needed a few hours of help each day, but she had never questioned their ability to live alone. “They always kept their house really nice and clean, like a museum,” she said. Although Rudy’s medical records showed that he occasionally had “staring spells,” all his medical-progress notes from 2013 described him as alert and oriented. He did most of the couple’s cooking and shopping, because Rennie, though lucid, was in so much pain that she rarely left the house. Belshe sometimes worried that her father inadvertently encouraged her mother to be docile: “She’s a very smart woman, though she sometimes acts like she’s not. I have to tell her, ‘That’s not cute, Mom.’ ”</p><p> Belshe承认，她的父母每天需要几个小时的帮助，但她从未质疑他们独自生活的能力。 “他们总是让他们的房子非常好，像博物馆一样干净，”她说。虽然Rudy的病历表明，他偶尔有“凝视法术”，但他从2013年的所有医疗笔记都将他描述为警惕和导向。他做了大部分夫妻的烹饪和购物，因为莱尼虽然清醒但是痛苦，她很少离开房子。 Belshe有时担心她的父亲无意中鼓励她的母亲是温顺的：“她是一个非常聪明的女人，虽然她有时候表现得像她不是这样。我必须告诉她，“这不可爱，妈妈。”</p><p>  When Belshe called Parks to ask for the court order, Parks told her that she was part of the “sandwich generation,” and that it would be too overwhelming for her to continue to care for her children and her parents at the same time. Parks billed her wards’ estates for each hour that she spent on their case; the court placed no limits on guardians’ fees, as long as they appeared “reasonable.” Later, when Belshe called again to express her anger, Parks charged the Norths twenty-four dollars for the eight-minute conversation. “I could not understand what the purpose of the call was other than she wanted me to know they had rights,” Parks wrote in a detailed invoice. “I terminated the phone call as she was very hostile and angry.”</p><p>  当Belshe叫公园要求法院命令时，公园告诉她，她是“三明治一代”的一部分，而且她将继续照顾她的孩子和父母的同时太压倒了。公园为她在案件上花费的每小时都会收到了她的病房庄园;法院对监护人的费用没有限制，只要它们出现“合理”。后来，当Belshe再次呼吁表达她的愤怒时，公园为八分钟的谈话向北方带来了二万四美元。 “我无法理解电话的目的是什么，除了她希望我知道他们有权利，”公园在详细的发票中写道。 “当她非常敌对和生气时，我终止了电话。”</p><p> A month after removing the Norths from their house, Parks petitioned to make the guardianship permanent. She was represented by an attorney who was paid four hundred dollars an hour by the Norths’ estate. A hearing was held at Clark County Family Court.</p><p> 从他们的房子删除北方的一个月后，公园请求使监护常驻。她是由北美庄园每小时支付四百美元的律师代表。在克拉克县家庭法院举行了听证会。</p><p> The Clark County guardianship commissioner, a lawyer named Jon Norheim, has presided over nearly all the guardianship cases in the county since 2005. He works under the supervision of a judge, but his orders have the weight of a formal ruling. Norheim awarded a guardianship to Parks, on average, nearly once a week. She had up to a hundred wards at a time. “I love April Parks,” he said at one hearing, describing her and two other professional guardians, who frequently appeared in his courtroom, as “wonderful, good-hearted, social-worker types.”</p><p> 克拉克县监护专员曾为Jon Norheim命名的律师，自2005年以来一直主持了该县的所有监护案件。他在法官的监督下工作，但他的命令具有正式裁决的重量。诺尔海姆平均地授予公园的监护，几乎每周一次。她一次有一百个病房。 “我爱4月公园，”他在一个听证会上说，描述了她和另外两个专业的守护者，他们经常出现在他的法庭上，作为“精美，良好，社会工作者的类型”。</p><p>  Norheim’s court perpetuated a cold, unsentimental view of family relations: the ingredients for a good life seemed to have little to do with one’s children and siblings. He often dismissed the objections of relatives, telling them that his only concern was the best interest of the wards, which he seemed to view in a social vacuum. When siblings fought over who would be guardian, Norheim typically ordered a neutral professional to assume control, even when this isolated the wards from their families.</p><p>  诺尔海姆的法院持续了一种冷漠，无意义的家庭关系看法：美好生活的成分似乎与一个人的孩子和兄弟姐妹有点不小。他经常驳回了亲戚的反对，告诉他们他唯一关心的是病房的最佳利益，他似乎在社会真空中看待。当兄弟姐妹遭到守护者时，诺尔海姆通常命令一个中立专业人员来瞄准控制，即使这个孤立来自家人的病房。</p><p> Rudy had assured Belshe that he would protest the guardianship, but, like most wards in the country, Rudy and Rennie were not represented by counsel. As Rudy stood before the commissioner, he convinced himself that guardianship offered him and Rennie a lifetime of care without being a burden to anyone they loved. He told Norheim, “The issue really is her longevity—what suits her.” Belshe, who sat in the courtroom, said, “I was shaking my head. No, no, no—don’t do that!” Rennie was silent.</p><p> 鲁迪确保了贝尔什，他会抗议监护，但像大多数病房一样，Rudy和Rennie没有由律师代表。正如鲁迪在专员面前站在委员会之前，他说服了自己，监护人提供了他和莱尼一生的护理，而不会对他们所爱的人负担。他告诉诺里海姆，“这个问题真的是她长寿 - 什么适合她。”坐在法庭上的Belshe说，“我正在摇头。不，不，不，不做！“莱尼是沉默的。 </p><p> Norheim ordered that the Norths become permanent wards of the court. “Chances are, I’ll probably never see you folks again; you’ll work everything out,” he said, laughing. “I very rarely see people after the initial time in court.” The hearing lasted ten minutes.</p><p>Norheim命令北方成为法院的永久性病区。 “机会是，我可能再也见不到你们;你会努力工作，“他说，笑。 “我在法庭上的最初时间后很少看到人们。”听证会持续了十分钟。</p><p> The following month, Even Tide Life Transitions, a company that Parks often hired, sold most of the Norths’ belongings. “The general condition of this inventory is good,” an appraiser wrote. Two lithographs by Renoir were priced at thirty-eight hundred dollars, and a glass cocktail table (“Client states that it is a Brancusi design”) was twelve hundred and fifty dollars. The Norths also had several pastel drawings by their son, Randy, who died in a motorcycle accident at the age of thirty-two, as well as Kachina dolls, a Bose radio, a Dyson vacuum cleaner, a Peruvian tapestry, a motion-step exerciser, a LeRoy Neiman sketch of a bar in Dublin, and two dozen pairs of Clarke shoes. According to Parks’s calculations, the Norths had roughly fifty thousand dollars. Parks transferred their savings, held at the Bank of America, to an account in her name.</p><p> 第二个月，即使是潮流过渡，公园经常被雇用的公司销售大多数北方物品。 “这个库存的一般条件很好，”评估师写道。 Renoir的两款石像仪镜在三十八百美元的价格上价，玻璃鸡尾酒桌（“客户说这是Brancusi Design”）是十二百元。北美的兰迪也有几个柔和的柔和画，他在三十二岁的摩托车事故中死亡，以及kachina娃娃，一个bose收音机，戴森真空吸尘器，秘鲁挂毯，运动步骤锻炼者，一伯林的一家酒吧的Leroy Neiman素描，以及二十几对Clarke鞋。根据Parks的计算，北方大约有五万美元。公园将他们的储蓄转移到美国银行，以她的名义占据了一个账户。</p><p> Rennie repeatedly asked for her son’s drawings, and for the family photographs on her refrigerator. Rudy pined for his car, a midnight-blue 2010 Chrysler, which came to symbolize the life he had lost. He missed the routine interactions that driving had allowed him. “Everybody at the pharmacy was my buddy,” he said. Now he and Rennie felt like exiles. Rudy said, “They kept telling me, ‘Oh, you don’t have to worry: your car is fine, and this and that.’ ” A month later, he said, “they finally told me, ‘Actually, we sold your car.’ I said, ‘What in the hell did you sell it for?’ ” It was bought for less than eight thousand dollars, a price that Rudy considered insulting.</p><p> 莱尼多次要求她儿子的图纸，以及家庭在她的冰箱上拍照。鲁迪为他的车而追逐，是一个午夜 - 蓝2010克莱斯勒，这是象征着他失去的生活。他错过了驾驶允许他的常规互动。 “药房的每个人都是我的伙伴，”他说。现在他和雷尼觉得像流亡者一样。鲁迪说：“他们一直告诉我，'哦，你不必担心：你的车很好，这就是这样。”“他们终于告诉我，”实际上，我们卖了你的车。“我说，'你到底是什么卖给它的？”“它被买了不到八千美元，这是一个鲁迪被认为是侮辱的价格。</p><p> Rudy lingered in the dining room after eating breakfast each morning, chatting with other residents of Lakeview Terrace. He soon discovered that ten other wards of April Parks lived there. His next-door neighbor, Adolfo Gonzalez, a short, bald seventy-one-year-old who had worked as a maître d’ at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, had become Parks’s ward at a hearing that lasted a minute and thirty-one seconds.</p><p> 鲁迪每天早上吃早餐后，鲁迪在餐厅里徘徊，与湖景露台的其他居民聊天。他很快发现了四个四月公园的病房住在那里。他的下门邻居，阿夫多夫·戈祖兹，一个短暂的，七十一岁的曾在MGM Grand Las Vegas曾经工作过的七十一岁，已经成为持续一分钟和三十一分钟的帕克斯的病房秒。</p><p> Gonzalez, who had roughly three hundred and fifty thousand dollars in assets, urged Rudy not to accept the nurse’s medications. “If you take the pills, they’ll make sure you don’t make it to court,” he said. Gonzalez had been prescribed the antipsychotic medications Risperdal and Depakote, which he hid in the side of his mouth without swallowing. He wanted to remain vigilant. He often spoke of a Salvador Dali painting that had been lost when Parks took over his life. Once, she charged him two hundred and ten dollars for a visit in which, according to her invoice, he expressed that “he feels like a prisoner.”</p><p> 冈萨雷斯在资产中大约三百五万美元，敦促鲁迪不接受护士的药物。 “如果你服用药丸，他们会确保你没有致法，”他说。 Gonzalez已经规定了抗精神病药的抗精神病药，他在嘴巴的侧面没有吞咽。他想保持警惕。当公园接管他的生命时，他经常谈到萨尔瓦多大理绘画。曾经，她向他收取了两百十亿美元的访问，根据她的发票，他表示，“他感觉像囚犯。”</p><p>  Rudy was so distressed by his conversations with Gonzalez that he asked to see a psychologist. “I thought maybe he’d give me some sort of objective learning as to what I was going through,” he said. “I wanted to ask basic questions, like What the hell is going on?” Rudy didn’t find the session illuminating, but he felt a little boost to his self-esteem when the psychologist asked that he return for a second appointment. “I guess he found me terribly charming,” he told me.</p><p>  他与冈萨雷斯的谈话如此痛苦，他要求看到一个心理学家。 “我想也许他会给我某种客观的学习，就我经历了什么，”他说。 “我想问一下基本问题，就像到底发生了什么？”鲁迪没有找到会议照明，但当心理学家要求他返回第二次任命时，他感到令他对自己的自尊提升。 “我猜他发现我非常迷人，”他告诉我。</p><p> Rudy liked to fantasize about an alternative life as a psychoanalyst, and he tried to befriend the wards who seemed especially hopeless. “Loneliness is a physical pain that hurts all over,” he wrote in his notebook. He bought a pharmaceutical encyclopedia and advised the other wards about medications they’d been prescribed. He also ran for president of the residents, promising that under his leadership the kitchen would no longer advertise canned food as homemade. (He lost—he’s not sure if anyone besides Rennie voted for him—but he did win a seat on the residents’ council.)</p><p> 鲁迪喜欢幻想替代生活作为精神分析师，他试图与似乎特别绝望的病房交朋友。 “寂寞是一种伤害困扰的物理痛，”他写在他的笔记本上。他买了一份药物百科全书，并建议其他病房关于他们已经开的药物。他还担任居民总裁，承诺在他的领导下，厨房不再将罐头食品作为自制。 （他输了 - 他不确定是否有人除了雷尼为他投票 - 但他确实赢得了居民委员会的席位。） </p><p> He was particularly concerned about a ward of Parks’s named Marlene Homer, a seventy-year-old woman who had been a professor. “Now she was almost hiding behind the pillars,” Rudy said. “She was so obsequious. She was, like, ‘Run me over. Run me over.’ ” She’d become a ward in 2012, after Parks told the court, “She has admitted to strange thoughts, depression, and doing things she can’t explain.” On a certificate submitted to the court, an internist had checked a box indicating that Homer was “unable to attend the guardianship court hearing because______,” but he didn’t fill in a reason.</p><p>他特别关注一个名叫的玛琳本垒打的病房，这是一个成为教授的七十岁女性。 “现在她几乎隐藏在柱后面，”鲁迪说。 “她是如此糟糕。她就像，那样，我过来了。跑了我。“她在2012年成为一个病房，在公园告诉法庭后，”她已经承认了奇怪的想法，抑郁症，以及她无法解释的事情。“关于提交法院的证书，内科医生检查了一个表明本垒打“无法参加监护法院听证会，因为__________________________________________________________________________________________________</p><p>  The Norths could guess which residents were Parks’s wards by the way they were dressed. Gonzalez wore the same shirt to dinner nearly every day. “Forgive me,” he told the others at his table. When a friend tried to take him shopping, Parks prevented the excursion because she didn’t know the friend. Rennie had also tried to get more clothes. “I reminded ward that she has plenty of clothing in her closet,” Parks wrote. “I let her know that they are on a tight budget.” The Norths’ estate was charged a hundred and eighty dollars for the conversation.</p><p>  北方北方人可能猜测哪些居民是帕克斯的病房。 Gonzalez每天几乎戴着同样的衬衫吃饭。 “请原谅我，”他告诉其他人在他的桌子上。当一位朋友试图带他购物时，公园阻止了游览，因为她不认识朋友。雷尼也试图拿更多的衣服。 “我想起了她在衣柜里有足够的衣服，”公园写道。 “我知道他们的预算紧张。”北美的遗产被收取一百八十美元的谈话。</p><p> Another resident, Barbara Neely, a fifty-five-year-old with schizophrenia, repeatedly asked Parks to buy her outfits for job interviews. She was applying for a position with the Department of Education. After Neely’s third week at Lakeview Terrace, Parks’s assistant sent Parks a text. “Can you see Barbara Neely anytime this week?” she wrote. “She has questions on the guardianship and how she can get out of it.” Parks responded, “I can and she can’t.” Neely had been in the process of selling her house, for a hundred and sixty-eight thousand dollars, when Parks became her guardian and took charge of the sale.</p><p> 另一个居民，Barbara Neely，一名五十五岁的精神分裂症，多次要求公园买她的服就面试的服装。她申请了与教育部的职位。在LakeView Terrace的Neely第三周之后，Parks的助手将Parks发短信。 “本周，你能看到芭芭拉吗？”她写了。 “她对监护有疑问，以及她如何摆脱它。”公园回应，“我可以，她不能。”当帕克斯成为她的监护人并负责销售时，Neely一直在销售她的房子，达到一百六万八千美元。</p><p> The rationale for the guardianship of Norbert Wilkening, who lived on the bottom floor of the facility, in the memory-care ward, for people with dementia (“the snake pit,” Rudy called it), was also murky. Parks’s office manager, who advertised himself as a “Qualified Dementia Care Specialist”—a credential acquired through video training sessions—had given Wilkening a “Mini-Mental State Examination,” a list of eleven questions and tasks, including naming as many animals as possible in a minute. Wilkening had failed. His daughter, Amy, told me, “I didn’t see anything that was happening to him other than a regular getting-older process, but when I was informed by all these people that he had all these problems I was, like, Well, maybe I’m just in denial. I’m not a profe</p><p> 诺伯特·威尔期的监护的理由，他们在设施的底层，在记忆保守病房中，为痴呆症的人（“蛇坑，”鲁迪称为它），也是Myky。 Parks的办公室经理，作为通过视频培训课程获得的“合格的痴呆症护理专家”，宣传了“合格的痴呆症护理专家” - 给出了潜水的“迷你精神状态考试”，其中11个问题和任务名单，包括命名为许多动物可能在一分钟内。威尔期失败了。他的女儿，艾米告诉我，“除了定期变化的过程之外，我没有看到任何事情发生在他身上，但是当我被所有这些人通知他有所有这些问题时，就像我一样，也许我只是拒绝。我不是一个专业人士</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/how-the-elderly-lose-their-rights">https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/how-the-elderly-lose-their-rights</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/失去/">#失去</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/lose/">#lose</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/公园/">#公园</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
