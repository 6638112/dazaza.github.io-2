So I retrieved it from the Wayback Machine and put a copy here.)  June 28, 2010  Why did so many successful entrepreneurs and startups come out ofPayPal? I long have been fascinated by the extraordinary achievementfrom the ex-Paypal team and wonder about the reasons behind theirsuccess. In the past, mass media tried to answer this questionseveral times but still couldnt give us a clear answer.  I once asked David Sacks the same question during an event in LosAngeles. He told me the secret is that Paypal has built a &#34;scrappy&#34;culture. No matter what problems they faced, they would find a wayto solve them. I kind of got the idea, but was still confused aboutthe execution details.  So when I saw some of the past Paypal employees answering thisquestion on Quora, I was super excited! After all, they should bethe only ones who can tell people the inside stories.  Below are some highlights of their answers.  On Talent Management  &#34;Peter and Max assembled an unusual criticalmass of entrepreneurial talent, primarily due to their ability torecognize young people with extraordinary ability (the median ageof *execs* on the S1 filing was 30). But the poor economy allowedus to close an abnormal number of offers, as virtually nobody otherthan eBay and (in part) google was hiring in 2000-02.&#34; (by KeithRabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)  &#34;Extreme Focus (driven by Peter): Peter required that everyone betasked with exactly one priority. He would refuse to discuss virtuallyanything else with you except what was currently assigned as your#1 initiative. Even our annual review forms in 2001 required eachemployee to identify their single most valuable contribution to thecompany.&#34; (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President ofPaypal)  &#34;Dedication to individual accomplishment: Teams were almost consideredsocialist institutions. Most great innovations at PayPal were drivenby one person who then conscripted others to support, adopt, implementthe new idea. If you identified the 8-12 most critical innovationsat PayPal (or perhaps even the most important 25), almost every onehad a single person inspire it (and often it drive it to implementation).As a result, David enforced an anti-meeting culture where any meetingthat included more than 3-4 people was deemed suspect and subjectto immediate adjournment if he gauged it inefficient. Our annualreview forms in 2002 included a direction to rate the employee on&#34;avoids imposing on others time, e.g. scheduling unnecessarymeetings.&#34; (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President ofPaypal)  &#34;Refusal to accept constraints, external or internal:We were expectedto pursue our #1 priority with extreme dispatch (NOW) and vigor.To borrow an apt phrase, employees were expected to &#34;come to workevery day willing to be fired, to circumvent any order aimed atstopping your dream.&#34; Jeremy Stoppelman has relayed elsewhere thestory about an email he sent around criticizing management that heexpected to get him fired and instead got him promoted. Peter didnot accept no for answer: If you couldnt solve the problem, someoneelse would be soon assigned to do it.&#34; (by Keith Rabois, formerExecutive Vice President of Paypal)  &#34;Driven problem solvers: PayPal had a strong bias toward hiring(and promoting / encouraging, as Keith mentions) smart, drivenproblem solvers, rather than subject matter experts. Very few ofthe top performers at the company had any prior experience withpayments, and many of the best employees had little or no priorbackground building Internet products. I worked on the fraud analyticsteam at PayPal, and most of our best people had never before doneanything related to fraud detection. If hed approached things&#34;traditionally&#34;, Max would have gone out and hired people who hadbeen building logistic regression models for banks for 20 years butnever innovated, and fraud losses would likely have swallowed thecompany.&#34; (by Mike Greenfield, former Sr. Fraud R&amp;D Scientist ofPaypal)  &#34;Self-sufficiency individuals and small teams were given fairlycomplex objectives and expected to figure out how to achieve themon their own. If you needed to integrate with an outside vendor,you picked up the phone yourself and called; you didnt wait for aBD person to become available. You did (the first version of) mockupsand wireframes yourself; you didnt wait for a designer to becomeavailable. You wrote (the first draft of) site copy yourself; youdidnt wait for a content writer.&#34; (by Yee Lee, former Product &amp;BU GM of Paypal)  On Culture &amp; Ideology  &#34;Extreme bias towards action early PayPalwas simply a really *productive* workplace. This was partly drivenby the culture of self-sufficiency. PayPal is and was, after all,a web service; and the company managed to ship prodigious amountsof relatively high-quality web software for a lot of years in a rowearly on. Yes, we had the usual politics between functional groups,but either individual heroes or small, high-trust teams more oftenthan not found ways to deliver projects on-time.&#34; (by Yee Lee,former Product &amp; BU GM of Paypal)  &#34;Willingness to try even in a data-driven culture, youll alwaysrun in to folks who either dont believe you have collected theright supporting data for a given decision or who just arentcomfortable when data contradicts their gut feeling. In manycompanies, those individuals would be the death of decision-making.At PayPal, I felt like you could almost always get someone to giveit a *try* and then let performance data tell us whether to maintainthe decision or rollback.&#34; (by Yee Lee, former Product &amp; BU GM ofPaypal)  &#34;Data-driven decision making PayPal was filled with smart,opinionated people who were often at logger-heads. The way to winarguments was to bring data to bear. So you never started a sentencelike this &#34;I feel like its a problem that our users cant do X&#34;,instead youd do your homework first and then come to the tablewith &#34;35% of our [insert some key metric here] are caused by thelack of X functionality&#34; (by Yee Lee, former Product &amp; BU GM ofPaypal)  &#34;Radical transparency on metrics: All employees were expected tobe facile with the metrics driving the business. Otherwise, howcould one expect each employee to make rational calculations anddecisions on their own every day? To enforce this norm, almost everyall-hands meeting consisted of distributing a printed Excel spreadsheetto the assembled masses and Peter conducting a line by line reviewof our performance (this is only a modest exaggeration).&#34; (by KeithRabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)  &#34;Vigorous debate, often via email: Almost every important issue hadchampions and critics. These were normally resolved not by officialedict but by a vigorous debate that could be very intense. Beingable to articulate and defend a strategy or product in a succinct,compelling manner with empirical analysis and withstand a witheringcritique was a key attribute of almost every key contributor. Istill recall the trepidation I confronted when I was informed thatI needed to defend the feasibility of my favorite &#34;baby&#34; to Max forthe first time.&#34; (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice Presidentof Paypal)  &#34;Extreme Pressure PayPal was a very difficult business with manymajor issues to solve. We were able to see our colleagues work underextreme pressure and hence we learned who we could rely on andtrust.&#34; (by Keith Rabois, former Executive Vice President of Paypal)</p><p>Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://paulgraham.com/paypal.html">http://paulgraham.com/paypal.html</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/文森特/">#文森特</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/chan/">#chan</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/warning/">#warning</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
