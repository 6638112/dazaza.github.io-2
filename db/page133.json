As usual, this is the exact same chip as the previous version that hit the market in February, just with a faster clock rate. Those looking for a serious\u2014or even noticeable\u2014upgrade will be disappointed. This is the smallest &#34;Plus&#34; upgrade Qualcomm has ever done.\n Qualcomm says the Prime CPU core\u2014one of the chip&#39;s eight cores\u2014can now hit 3.0 GHz, which is a five percent improvement over the 2.84 GHz of the base chip. After the Prime core (which handles things like foreground processing and main thread duties), the three &#34;medium&#34; and four &#34;small&#34; cores remain unchanged.\n The company also mentioned that the &#34;AI Engine&#34; is now 20 percent faster. This is a nebulous measurement of how the entire phone\u2014CPU, GPU, DSP, and software\u2014processes AI tasks. It&#39;s not a single concrete object you can point to that has been clocked higher, and good luck tying overhyped AI performance to any actual performance improvements in the real world.\n That&#39;s the entirety of the changes to the Snapdragon 888 Plus. Last year&#39;s  Snapdragon 865 Plus added Wi-Fi 6E support and a 10 percent faster CPU and GPU, so this is a disappointment in comparison.\u00a0It&#39;s the bare minimum Qualcomm could do to justify a new chip release, and this update probably only exists to fulfill roadmap promises made to partners.\n Qualcomm says\u00a0Asus, Honor, Motorola, Vivo, and Xiaomi are lined up to ship Snapdragon 888 Plus phones, which should be out sometime in Q3.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:52:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "qualcomm,bare,\u82af\u7247", "title": "Qualcomm\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684Snapdragon 888 Plus SoC\u7684\u6700\u4f4e\u9650\u5ea6 ", "title_en": "Qualcomm does the bare minimum for the new Snapdragon 888 Plus SoC", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-888-plus-soc-has-a-new-name-not-much-else/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["qualcomm", "bare", "\u82af\u7247"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "60c8810f7dc88a374262a4c916de7b58.jpg", "infoid": 1068635, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u592a\u7a7a\u516c\u53f8Roscosmos\u5728\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5c01\u95ed\u5728\u5176\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\u6574\u6d41\u7f69\u4e2d\u7684\u4f17\u591aNauka\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u5341\u591a\u4e2a\u5341\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u7684\u56fd\u9645\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u4eba\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6a21\u5757\u4e3b\u8981\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;

This will be Russia&#39;s first significant addition to the International Space Station in more than a decade, and it will provide the Russians with their first module dedicated primarily to research. &#34;Nauka&#34; means science in Russian.\n This is a sizable module, including crew quarters, an airlock for scientific experiments, and much more. With a mass of about 24 metric tons, it is about 20 percent larger than the biggest Russian segment of the station, the Zvezda service module.\n The timing for this launch, scheduled for as early as July 15 on a Proton rocket, is notable. For one, the multi-purpose Nauka module is more than a dozen years late due to a lack of budget for the project on top of technical issues. At times, it seemed like the module was never actually going to launch.\n Additionally, Russia is launching its largest module at a time when its future participation in the International Space Station program is uncertain. Russian officials have said the existing hardware on orbit, much of which is more than two decades old, is aging beyond repair. The Russians  have said they may pull out of the program in 2025 and build a brand-new station.\n    So why launch a new module just a few years before exiting the station? One possibility is that the Russians are simply posturing. Some NASA officials have speculated privately that this may be an angle to obtain new funds from the United States. With the success of SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon vehicle and nearing availability of Boeing&#39;s Starliner, NASA is no longer annually sending hundreds of millions of dollars to Roscosmos to purchase Soyuz seats for access to the station. This was an important source of funding for Russia&#39;s space program.\n However, NASA would like to keep the station flying for another decade, and for this it needs the Russians.\u00a0The first elements of the International Space Station were launched in 1998, and it was designed such that the US and Russian segments were dependent upon one another for attitude control, power, and other critical resources. The NASA officials suspect Russia may seek &#34;maintenance&#34; funding from the United States in return for keeping its part of the space station going.\n Nauka&#39;s launch is an important symbolic win for Russia&#39;s space program, in that it is increasingly rare for Roscosmos to develop and fly new hardware. Mostly, the program maintains and launches decades-old spacecraft such as the Soyuz vehicle and the Proton rocket.\n After being encapsulated in its payload fairing, Nauka will now move to a &#34;filling station&#34; at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where it will be fueled and pressurized. After that, it will be mated to its Proton rocket for a launch that may occur as soon as July 15.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:52:30", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af,\u63a8\u51fa,launching", "title": "\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u62d4\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ad9\uff1f ", "title_en": "Why is Russia launching a new module to the space station if it\u2019s pulling out?", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/decades-in-the-making-russias-nauka-module-to-finally-take-flight/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launching"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "754d45756bc0f280e04eee22688b2ae8.jpg", "infoid": 1068634, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e00\u79cb\u5b63\u6b63\u5728\u5851\u9020\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178\u79d1\u5b66\u5c0f\u8bf4\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f10\u670822\u65e5\u7684Dunis Villeneuve\uff06\uff0339;\u82f9\u679c\u7535\u89c6+\u7ec8\u4e8e\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u7089\u6392\u7684\u9996\u6620\u65e5\u671f\uff0c\u590f\u5b63\u9884\u671f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7535\u89c6\u9002\u5e94\u7684ISAAC Asimov\uff06\uff0339;\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u5217\u3002\u524d\u4e09\u96c6\u5c06\u4e8e2021\u5e749\u670824\u65e5\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6bcf\u5468\u53d1\u4f5c\u3002\n \u201c\u4ece\u57fa\u91d1\u4f1a\u7cfb\u5217\u9996\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\u6765\u770b\uff0cAsimov\u7684\u9884\u8a00\u79d1\u5e7b\u4f5c\u54c1\u4ece\u672a\u6bd4\u73b0\u5728\u66f4\u52a0\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u201dShowrunner David Goyer\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u6210\u957f\uff0c\u6211\u541e\u566c\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u68a6\u60f3\u6709\u4e00\u5929\u5728\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u770b\u5230\u5b83 - \u4f46\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7535\u5f71\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u62e5\u62b1\u91ce\u5fc3\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u666f\u89c2\u548c\u4e0e\u82f9\u679c\u548c\u65af\u5854\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9d\u8d35\u4f19\u4f34\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6b63\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u8be5\u7cfb\u5217\u5e26\u5230\u5c4f\u5e55\u4e0a\u3002\u201c\n  \u5f53\u9769\u547d\u535a\u58eb\u54c8\u91cc\u00b7\u7d22\u5c14\u987f\uff08Jared Harris\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u5e1d\u56fd\u7684\u5373\u5c06\u57ae\u53f0\uff0c\u4ed6\u548c\u4e00\u652f\u5fe0\u8bda\u7684\u7c89\u4e1d\u4e50\u961f\u5192\u9669\u5230\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u8fdc\u822a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bd5\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u660e\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002\u7531Hari\uff06\uff0339;

Not only are we getting Denis Villeneuve&#39;s film adaptation of   Dune on  October 22, but Apple TV+ has finally announced the premiere date for the streamer&#39;s hotly anticipated\u00a0  Foundation, a TV adaptation of Isaac Asimov&#39;s hugely influential series. The first three episodes will debut on September 24, 2021, with weekly episodes released after that.\n \u201cIn the decades since the  Foundation series first saw print, Asimov\u2019s prophetic science-fiction work has never been more relevant than it is now,\u201d said showrunner David Goyer in a statement. \u201cGrowing up, I\u00a0devoured  Foundation\u00a0and dreamed of one day seeing it on screen\u2014but a feature film didn\u2019t seem big enough to embrace the ambition.\u00a0Thanks to the broader landscape of\u00a0streaming and a\u00a0valuable\u00a0partnership with Apple and Skydance, we are able to bring the series to the screen in a way that truly does it justice.\u201d\n  When revolutionary Dr. Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) predicts the impending fall of the Empire, he and a band of loyal followers venture to the far reaches of the galaxy to establish The Foundation in an attempt\u00a0to rebuild and preserve the future of civilization. Enraged by Hari&#39;s claims, the ruling Cleons \u2014 a long line of emperor clones\u2014fear their grasp on the galaxy may be weakening as they\u2019re forced to reckon with\u00a0the potential reality of losing their legacy forever.\n Harris plays Seldon, with Lee Pace co-starring as Brother Day, current emperor of the galaxy and part of a long line of emperor clones (the aforementioned Cleons). Lou Llobell plays Seldon&#39;s mathematical genius proteg\u00e9, Gaal; Leah Harvey plays a gender-swapped Salvor, warden of Terminus; and Laura Birn plays Eto Demerzel, aide to Brother Day.\n    Other listed characters include Brother Dusk (Terrence Mann), the ruling family&#39;s oldest living member, and Brother Dawn (Cassian Bilton), the youngest member and heir apparent to Brother Day. There&#39;s also Daniel MacPherson as Hugo, T&#39;Nia Miller as Halima, Pravessh Rana as Rowan, Kubbra Sait as Phara, Mido Hamada as Shadow Master Obrecht, Amy Tyger as Azura, and\u00a0Buddy Skelton as Keir.\n  It has been more than a year since we  got the first teaser, unveiled in June 2020 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). That included some brief commentary from Goyer, noting all the past efforts to adapt  Foundation over the last 50 years, as well as the enormous influence the series had on  Star Wars. There were some accompanying behind-the-scenes photographs, too, but mostly it just introduced\u00a0the basic premise, along with some visually stunning shots of the scenes that had been completed before the pandemic shutdown. Since then there has been nothing, save for a  few brief glimpses earlier this month when Apple TV+ released its &#34;summer and beyond&#34; preview trailer.\n This new two-minute teaser opens with a lone figure walking through a dark corridor to a secret laboratory where cloned fetuses are suspended in fluid. It&#39;s Brother Dusk. &#34;You can&#39;t be here,&#34; Eto tells him. &#34;I can&#39;t be the first person who wanted to see my youngest self,&#34; he replies. &#34;Strange, watching yourself being born.&#34; Next we cut to Brother Day bragging about how their genetic dynasty has reigned for over four centuries, bringing peace to thousands of worlds. But he rants that this stability is now being threatened by a single man.\n That would be Seldon, of course, who insists in his defense that he is not a revolutionary. Furthermore, his alarming calculations about the demise of civilization are deemed correct by Gaal. &#34;Order will vanish,&#34; Seldon insists, as scenes of chaos and destruction play out. &#34;Wars will be endless. You can&#39;t save yourselves. But you can save your legacy.&#34; It&#39;s a doom-and-gloom message, but, nonetheless, Seldon amasses a following, much to Brother Day&#39;s chagrin. And as Brother Day knows all too well, &#34;Words have a way of fanning into wildfires. &#34;\n Foundation will premiere on Apple TV+ on September\u00a024, 2021.

The new group is an independently governed directed fund of the Linux Foundation, with the goals of improving trust, choice, inclusivity, and openness in voice recognition technology.\n While similar to Amazon&#39;s  Voice Interoperability Initiative\u00a0in some ways, the OVN claims a primary focus on ethics. Although Amazon&#39;s effort does touch on user choice and freedom, its primary goal is considerably narrower than OVN&#39;s\u2014to provide &#34;multiple, simultaneous voice services on the same product, each with its own wake word.&#34; Amazon did not say much about ethical restrictions or guidelines for those individual services, either in its  current mission statement or in the 2019  press release announcing it.\n The Open Voice Network is a neutral nonprofit industry association with some impressive names in its founding-member registry, including Target and Microsoft. OVN&#39;s goal is not to develop the technology itself but to deliver open, trustworthy, and inclusive standards and usage guidelines.\n OVN&#39;s initial press release goes into further detail, stating that the association will begin by focusing in these areas:\n Standards development: research and recommendations toward the global standards that will enable user choice, inclusivity, and trust.\n Industry value and awareness: identification and sharing of conversational AI best practices that are both horizontal and specific to vertical industries, serving as the source of insight and value for voice assistance.\n Advocacy: working with and through existing industry associations on relevant regulatory and legislative issues, including those of data privacy.\n Membership in the Open Voice Network entails supporting its research, awareness, and advocacy with direct resource contribution as well as active participation in its conferences and workshops.\n    Mike Dolan, senior VP and project manager at the Linux Foundation, says that &#34;voice [command] is expected to be a primary interface to the digital world... it is already increasingly being used beyond smart speakers to include applications in automobiles, smartphones, and home electronics devices of all types.&#34; He goes on to say that &#34;the potential impact of [voice] is staggering, and we&#39;re excited to bring it under the open governance model of the Linux Foundation.&#34;\n Target VP of Architecture Joel Crabb describes Target as &#34;continuously exploring and embracing new technologies,&#34; including voice recognition, and states that &#34;the Linux Foundation, with its role in advancing open source for all, is the perfect home for this initiative.&#34;\n Microsoft Azure AI General Manager Ali Dalloul underlines the importance of the technology itself, saying, &#34;to speak is human&#34;\u2014and following that up with a bold statement that &#34;voice is rapidly becoming the primary interaction modality between users and their devices and services at home and work.&#34; (We aren&#39;t certain we agree that voice command as the\u00a0 primary method of communication with devices and systems will arrive soon\u2014or perhaps ever\u2014but it&#39;s certainly increasingly important.)\n Founding OVN member and Schwarz Gruppe\u00a0Chief Digital Officer Rolf Schumann points out the stark need for ethical design and standards in voice recognition: &#34;voice includes more information than a fingerprint and can entail data about the emotional state or mental health of a user.

", "note_en": "Last year, a study made waves by suggesting that a chemical that had been proposed as a potential indicator of life was  present in the atmosphere of Venus. While the hellish conditions on the planet&#39;s surface preclude the existence of any sort of life there, it remained possible that a milder environment existed in the planet&#39;s clouds, high above its surface. So the prospect that the chemical was indicating life couldn&#39;t be immediately discounted.\n In the months following, other researchers  cast doubt on the claim that the chemical was present at all. And today, a paper is being released the suggests that the conditions in Venus&#39; clouds are in no way compatible with life even remotely similar to that on Earth. Although the temperatures in the clouds are indeed milder, there&#39;s nowhere near enough water to support life, and most of what&#39;s present is in droplets that are mostly composed of sulfuric acid.\n  In a press conference announcing the results, John Hallsworth of Queen&#39;s University Belfast said that the new work was inspired by the apparent detection of phosphine in Venus&#39; atmosphere. He and his collaborators realized that two areas of research had combined to create other ways to examine the prospects of life on Venus. One was a study of life in extreme conditions on Earth, driven in part by a NASA effort to determine how best to protect Mars from contamination by the probes we were sending there.\n The second was also NASA-driven: we&#39;d sent probes into the atmospheres of some planets and imaged others. While these probes didn&#39;t specifically look for life, they provided direct measurements of things like temperature and pressure, which set limits on things like the amount of water present in the atmosphere and the form that it will adopt.\n Relevant to Venus, people have identified organisms that can maintain a metabolism within various limits: temperature, acidity, and water content. Since temperature changes with altitude, the former sets limits on what altitudes can be considered. The latter two are relevant because Venus is thought to be a very dry planet, and its clouds are generated not by condensed water but rather by the presence of sulfuric acid droplets that would contain some water.\n    The world record-holder for surviving dry conditions is currently a salt-tolerant fungus, which can run a metabolism and undergo cell divisions with very little water present. Scientists quantify the amount of available water through a measure called the water activity. In simple conditions like a humid atmosphere, this is the same as the relative humidity\u2014the amount of water present versus the maximum amount at that temperature and pressure. But it can also be measured in a way that takes into account things like dissolved salts or ice formation.\n For the acid extreme, there is a microbe that survives down to a pH of -0.06, which is the equivalent of having sulfuric acid account for a bit over 10 percent of the weight of its solution (with the rest being water).\n  Applying that information to the conditions on Venus yields grim results. Based on measurements from its atmosphere, the researchers calculate that Venus&#39; relative humidity would be below 0.4 percent\u2014over 100 times lower than the record low tolerated by an organism on Earth.\n If you assume that Venusian life could have evolved methods of pulling water out of the sparse atmosphere, then the sulfuric acid becomes a big problem. The researchers calculate that the droplets that form around sulfuric acid would have so little water that concentration by weight of sulfuric acid would be 78 percent\u2014at a minimum. The droplets would max out as nearly pure sulfuric acid with a tiny bit of water.\n At that point, the acidity of the sulfuric acid is less of an issue than its ability to chemically degrade molecules in order to form new water molecules to dissolve in. A graphic demonstration of this process is available in  this video, which shows sugar converting into pure carbon when the water is stripped out of it. The authors of the paper list all of the problems it creates: &#34;Sulfuric acid dehydrates the cellular systems, removes water from biomacromolecules, reduces hydrophobic interactions, and damages plasma-membrane integrity.&#34;\n With Venus ruled out, the researchers turn their attention to elsewhere in the Solar System. Mars&#39; clouds are at temperatures well below the point where metabolisms shut down entirely on Earth, based on measurements made by probes that have gone through its atmosphere. Any water present is ice that, for good measure, is bombarded with enough UV radiation to sterilize it. So Mars&#39; clouds are ruled out as well.\n     Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere is also likely to be too dry to support life, but the relative humidity of its lower atmosphere (the troposphere) can vary anywhere from zero percent to 100 percent. Most clouds in the troposphere, however, will have a water activity that&#39;s compatible with life, which is consistent with findings that a variety of microbes probably survive the trips through the clouds that some of them end up taking.\n Finally, the oddest finding comes from a look at Jupiter, which had been visited by a probe that was dropped off during the Galileo mission. The probe happened to fall through a dry region of the giant planet&#39;s atmosphere, but we know that different cloud bands can differ in their composition, and some of them are likely quite wet. Ammonia is a complicating presence but is mostly present at altitudes above those where temperatures are within the range compatible with life.\n While there are a lot of uncertainties, the overall conclusion is that there&#39;s likely to be enough water around to support life at altitudes where the temperatures would range from -30\u00ba to 10\u00ba C.\n  The researchers note that this same approach should help us look into high-altitude life as we begin to get details on the atmospheres of exoplanets. It won&#39;t tell us anything about surface conditions, however (although some of those could probably be inferred from other data). &#34;To be able to pinpoint potential habitability based on that personally excites me,&#34; Hallsworth said.\n The other notable thing here is that this applies to life as we know it: water-based, with extensive use of hydrocarbons and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Other liquids have very different boiling and freezing points and would favor very different chemistries. To date, we have no indication that life could form within them, but it&#39;s still an exciting possibility. As Chris McKay of NASA&#39;s Ames Research Center said during the press conference, &#34;Part of me hopes that, when we do find life elsewhere, it&#39;s really, really different.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:51:41", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9178\u6027,clouds,\u786b\u9178", "title": "\u91d1\u661f\u7684\u4e91\u592a\u5e72\uff0c\u9178\u6027\u9178\u6027 ", "title_en": "Venus\u2019 clouds too dry, acidic for life", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/06/venus-clouds-too-dry-acidic-for-life/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9178\u6027", "clouds", "\u786b\u9178"]}]
