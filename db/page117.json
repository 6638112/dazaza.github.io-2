"note_en": "As we continue digging, we found some Ars-recommended fitness trackers among\u00a0 Prime Day&#39;s many deals. In particular, a slew of  our favorite smartwatches from Garmin and Fitbit are on sale. All these deals are today only, so if you&#39;re a Prime member looking for a fitness tracker or running watch, this is your moment. There are also discounts on the  Apple Watch Series 3 and  Series 6\u00a0if pure smartwatch capability is more important to you than fitness tracking.\n    Garmin\u2019s watches took a few top spots in our recent\u00a0 smartwatch buying guide. We picked the  Forerunner 45 as our favorite runner\u2019s watch while the Vivo series took top honors as the most stylish. Both devices are seeing record discounts for Prime Day. We especially like some older models of the Vivomove. Today&#39;s discounts bring the newer versions, the Vivoactive 4 and 4s, down to about the same price. The\u00a0 sub-$200 Garmin Forerunner 45 is our favorite watch for casual runners, offering GPS and 24/7 heart rate for runs and tracking modes for sleep, yoga, elliptical, and cardio exercise. It\u2019s not the watch for long-distance serious runners, but rather it&#39;s a great inexpensive option for those who enjoy shorter runs or don\u2019t mind bringing their phone along for music and enhanced safety features.\n If smartwatch functionality and broader activity support is your thing, then the  Venu Sq Music\u00a0is another sub-$200 device that brings a lot of what the Forerunner 45 misses, like a blood oxygen sensor, music storage, golfing features, strength and Pilates workout modes, and touchscreen interaction. It\u2019s a more traditional smartwatch experience with a bit more in the way of activity tracking, as well.\n    The  Vivoactive 4 and  4s build on this with more premium metal materials, more sensors, and a round watch face. It also adds on-screen workout animations, along with more workout modes.\n Last up are the high-end  Garmin Fenix 6 Sapphire\u00a0and  6s Pro running, hiking, and multisport watches, both at $499, and the rugged  Instinct Solar and  Tactical watches for $249 and $179, respectively. The Fenix series is Garmin\u2019s highest-end running watch, and it supports a plethora of advanced, proprietary metrics through  Firstbeat technology\u00a0and boasts compatibility with accessories (like  chest-worn heart rate monitors and  footworn running posture devices). Both features provide highly specific data and useful insights to improve training and recovery for serious athletes. The Fenix 6 also supports all of the same smartwatch and wide-ranging sport features, from golfing to triathlons, with two-week battery life, built-in maps, and 10 ATM water resistance.\n The Instinct Solar and Tactical are a little less feature-rich, lacking the broad range of sport tracking of some of the other Garmin watches we mentioned in favor of things like night vision mode and a claimed 54 days of battery with solar power\u2019s aid. It won\u2019t give you the deep training analytics of a Fenix watch, but it\u2019s still plenty capable of moderate tracking for running and activities.\n        Fitbit&#39;s no stranger to advanced fitness tracking analytics either, though the company&#39;s data is not as specified as some of Garmin\u2019s features. Where Fitbit excels is in reliable basic fitness tracking and top-tier specs at competitive prices.\n The Fitbit Sense, in particular, took the runner-up spot in our best smartwatch guide, finishing second only to the Apple Watch as our favorite all-around smartwatch. With a blood oxygen monitor, ECG, GPS, and heart rate sensor for less than $200 with this Prime Day sale, it\u2019s a strong value.\n The Sense handles notifications well from iPhone and Android devices, and it can accept calls with its built-in mic and speaker. The vibrant display and shiny metal case give it a premium look and feel to match its top-level internals. There isn\u2019t a ton of app compatibility beyond Fitbit\u2019s own suite of features and music controls for Spotify, but we found its sleep tracking and activity insights to be more useful, which only gets more proactive and personal with Fitbit\u2019s optional Premium subscription plan.\n Although Fitbit Premium is typically $9.99 a month, the simpler in form and much less expensive  Fitbit Inspire 2 tracker comes with a year of this for free, further adding value to a nice Prime Day discount. At $57, it\u2019s a good price for a casual fitness tracker, particularly one with Fitbit\u2019s research, community, and resources backing it.\n The Inspire 2 has a heart rate sensor, an estimated 10 days of battery, and sleep tracking, but it lacks GPS. Luckily, the  Fitbit Charge 4, which does have GPS, is also on sale for $100. And that device adds NFC and blood oxygen monitoring to the mix.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:47:54", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "smartwatches,good,\u624b\u8868", "title": "\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u826f\u597d\u7684Garmin Smartwatches\u548cFitbits\u5728\u9500\u552e\u4e2d\u9500\u552e ", "title_en": "A range of good Garmin smartwatches and Fitbits on sale for Prime Day", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/a-range-of-good-garmin-smartwatches-and-fitbits-are-on-sale-for-prime-day/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["good", "\u624b\u8868"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "aba4b5455468e5927426ed30238bf10b.jpg", "infoid": 1067250, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5404\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u786e\u5b9e\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u5149\u7ebf\u5728\u5bb6\u91cc\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u505a\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u5ba3\u5e03\u4e86\u5b83\u65e8\u5728\u6267\u884c\u56fd\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e3b\u8981\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\n \u201cTRI\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u57f9\u8bad\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4ee5\u56f0\u60d1\u548c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u904f\u5236\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u7684\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u57f9\u8bad\u5e76\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53cd\u5149\u8868\u9762\uff0c\u201d\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u5728\u535a\u5ba2\u6587\u7ae0\u4e2d\u5199\u9053\u3002\n   \u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u53a8\u623f\u7b49\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u5404\u79cd\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u8868\u9762\u63a5\u89e6 -

This does, however, shed some interesting light on the work TRI has been doing in the home. Today the company announced some key advances to robotics it has designed to perform domestic tasks.\n \u201cTRI roboticists were able to train robots to understand and operate in complicated situations that confuse most other robots, including recognizing and responding to transparent and reflective surfaces in a variety of circumstances,\u201d the Institute writes in a blog post.\n   With settings like kitchens, the robots come in contact with a variety of transparent and reflective surfaces \u2014 a hurdle for traditional vision systems. Specifically in the kitchen, things like a transparent glass or reflective appliance can create an issue.\n \u201cTo overcome this, TRI roboticists developed a novel training method to perceive the 3D geometry of the scene while also detecting objects and surfaces,\u201d TRI Robotics VP Max Bajracharya said in  a post describing the research. \u201cThis combination enables researchers to use large amounts of synthetic data to train the system.\u201d Using synthetic data also alleviates the need for time-consuming, expensive or impractical data collection and labeling.\n  With an aging population in its native Japan, Toyota has made eldercare a key focus in its ongoing robotics research. So it makes a lot of sense that sort of robotics tasks form a core of much of its research in the category, as well as those elements that bleed into the work it\u2019s doing on  Woven City. And certainly the company gets credit for putting in some work here, before the orchestrated appearances we\u2019ve seen of robotics offerings from companies like Samsung.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s not only about keeping people in their homes longer and living independently,\u201d Bajracharya \u00a0recently told me in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s one aspect of it \u2014 but in Japan, in 20-30 years, the number of people who are over 65 will roughly be the same as the number of people who are under 65. That\u2019s going to have a really interesting socioeconomic impact, in terms of the workforce. It\u2019s probably going to be much older and we at Toyota are looking at how these people can keep doing their jobs, so they can get the fulfillment from doing their jobs or staying at home longer. We don\u2019t want to just replace the people. We really think about how we stay human-centered and amplify people.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:47:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "The proposal, unveiled by India\u2019s Ministry of Consumer Affairs on Monday evening, comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers in India have ramped up their complaints to raise concerns about the what they allege as unfair practices employed by Amazon and Flipkart as they expand their operations in the country.\n In its proposal, India\u2019s Ministry of Consumer Affairs  said that e-commerce firms should not be allowed to hold flash sales in India. These flash\u00a0sales, akin to Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales in the U.S., are very popular during festive season in the country. During flash sales e-commerce firms have traditionally observed the biggest spikes in customer orders as brands offer heavy discounts on their products.\n  \u201cCertain e-commerce entities are engaging in limiting consumer choice by indulging in \u2018back to back\u2019 or \u2018flash\u2019 sales wherein one seller selling on platform does not carry any inventory or order fulfilment capability but merely places a \u2018flash or back to back\u2019 order with another seller controlled by platform. This prevents a level playing field and ultimately limits customer choice and increases prices,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.\n As it has done with its  recent IT rules, India is also proposing that e-commerce firms appoint a chief compliance officer, a nodal contact person for 24\u00d77 coordination with law enforcement agencies, and officers to ensure compliance to their orders and as well as a resident grievance officer for redressing of the grievances of the consumers on the e-commerce platform.\n \u201cThis would ensure effective compliance with the provisions of the Act and Rules and also strengthen the grievance redressal mechanism on e-commerce entities,\u201d the ministry said.\n Amazon, which has  invested over $6.5 billion in its India business, said it was reviewing the proposed policies while Flipkart, whose  majority stake Walmart bought for $16 billion\u00a0in 2018, had no immediate comment.\n In a court hearing on Monday, a Flipkart lawyer said the company sees nothing wrong in offering to cut charges for sellers on its platform if they lower product prices.\n The ministry said it is making the proposal, for which it plans to seek industry feedback over the next 15 days, after receiving \u201cseveral complaints against widespread cheating and unfair trade practices being observed in e-commerce ecosystem.\u201d\n Additionally, the new proposal asks e-commerce firms to introduce a mechanism to identify goods on their platforms based on their country of origin and suggest alternatives to \u201censure fair opportunity to domestic goods.\u201d\n The announcement comes at a time when Flipkart is in talks to raise as much as $3 billion and  explore the public markets. Both Amazon and Flipkart are also the subject of an ongoing antitrust probe in India.\n This is the second major amendment the Indian government has proposed in recent years.\u00a0Long-standing laws in India have constrained Amazon and other e-commerce firms to not hold inventory or sell items directly to consumers. To bypass this, firms have operated through a maze of joint ventures with local companies that operate as inventory-holding firms.\n After complaints from offline retailers, India got around to  fixing this loophole in late 2018 in a move that was widely seen as the biggest blowback to the American firm in the country at the time. Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart scrambled to  delist hundreds of thousands of items from their stores and made their investments in affiliated firms way more indirect.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:47:10", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u89c4\u5219,proposes", "title": "\u5370\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u786c\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6b3a\u9a97\u201d\u6295\u8bc9 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tIndia proposes tougher e-commerce rules to address \u2018widespread cheating\u2019 complaints\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/india-proposes-tougher-e-commerce-rules-following-widespread-cheating-and-unfair-trade-by-amazon-and-flipkart/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u89c4\u5219", "proposes"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d0854266d69dbc58717bd8d327e69cbc.jpeg", "infoid": 1067248, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8df3\u8dc3\u53ea\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6279\u51c6\u540e\u7531\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u547c\u5438\u5668\uff0c\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\uff0cQuizlet\uff0cStatmuse\u548cTabelog\u7b49\u5e73\u53f0\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86Beta\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\uff0cTiktok\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u50cfBuzzfeed\uff0cJumprope\uff0cIRL\u548cWatcha\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5c06\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u672a\u6765\u51e0\u5468\u5185\u5b9e\u65bd\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6559\u80b2\u521b\u9020\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u94fe\u63a5\u5230Quizlet\u62bd\u8ba4\u5361\uff0c\u4ee5\u67e5\u770b\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728Tiktok\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u745c\u4f3d\u6559\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u4eab\u547c\u5438\u547c\u5438\u7ec3\u4e60\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u751a\u81f3\u8ba9\u6240\u6709\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u6269\u5c55\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u5fc5\u987b\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u53d7\u4f17\u3002\n   Tiktok\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u8df3\u8f6c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002 Sean Kim\uff0c\u4ea7\u54c1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\uff0c\u8482\u514b\u6258\u9676\u5199\u9053\uff0c\u201cTiktok\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5a31\u4e50\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u5730;\u901a\u8fc7Tiktok Jump\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u6211\u4eec\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u73b0\u65c5\u7a0b\u7684\u201c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u82f1\u91cc\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u5e2e\u52a9\u6fc0\u53d1\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u201c\n \u4f46\u5728Snapchat\u548c\u5fae\u4fe1\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u96c6\u6210\u9a71\u52a8\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u3002\u8df3\u8dc3\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624bSnapchat\u7684Minis\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u539f\u5b50\u8d2d\u4e70\u7535\u5f71\u7968\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528HTML5\u6784\u5efaMiniS\u548c\u8df3\u8dc3\u96c6\u6210\u3002\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5fae\u4fe1\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7250\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u4ea4\u6613 - \u622a\u81f32018\u5e74\u7684\u666e\u901a\u79d1\u6280\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u8ff7\u4f60\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n \u867d\u7136Instagram\u5728\u5377\u8f74\u4e0a\u5347\u9ad8\u4e86\u5176\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u7279\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u7684Tiktok\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u53ef\u4ee5\u8df3\u8dc3\u53ef\u80fd\u4ee5\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6765\u9500\u552e\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u3002 12\u6708\uff0cWalmart\u5728Tiktok\u4e0a\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u8d2d\u7269\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u57283\u6708\u4efd\u518d\u6b21\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8df3\u8dc3\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u6df1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002 ", "note_en": "Jumps can only be built by third-party providers after being approved through  an application process.\u00a0Platforms like  Breathwrk,\u00a0 Wikipedia,\u00a0 Quizlet,\u00a0 StatMuse, and\u00a0 Tabelog participated in the beta test, and now, TikTok says providers like  BuzzFeed,\u00a0 Jumprope,\u00a0 IRL, and\u00a0 WATCHA will begin implementing their own Jumps in the coming weeks. So, an educational creator could link to Quizlet flashcards to review a concept they explained in a TikTok, or a yoga instructor could share breathing exercises on Breathwrk. For a platform that doesn\u2019t even let all users include a link in their bio yet, this expands the existing tools creators have to engage their audience.\n   TikTok is positioning Jump as a feature that propels discovery. Sean Kim, Head of Product, TikTok US  writes, \u201cTikTok has become a destination both to be entertained and to learn; through TikTok Jump, we\u2019re creating that \u2018last mile\u2019 of our community\u2019s discovery journey and helping to spark action and deeper interaction both on and off the platform.\u201d\n But on other apps like Snapchat and WeChat, these lightweight third-party integrations drive e-commerce. Jump is similar to competitor  Snapchat\u2019s Minis feature, which lets you buy movie tickets via Atom, for example. Both Minis and Jump integrations can be built using HTML5. Meanwhile, WeChat facilitates  over $250 billion dollars in annual transactions through its own mini apps \u2013 there were over  a million mini apps on WeChat as of 2018.\n While Instagram has been ramping up its  e-commerce features on Reels, its TikTok competitor, it\u2019s possible that Jump could later be used to sell items featured in a video. In December, Walmart piloted  video shopping on TikTok, which performed well enough that  they did it again in March. But for now, it seems like Jump is being used to improve user experience and deepen the platform\u2019s relationships with third-party partners.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:46:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u63a8\u51fa,launches,tiktok", "title": "Tiktok\u63a8\u51fa\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u662f\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tTikTok launches Jump, a third-party integration tool\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/tiktok-launches-jump-a-third-party-integration-tool/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u63a8\u51fa", "launches", "tiktok"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "bcc2fdc783fb82fd9074529f613a8de9.jpg", "infoid": 1067247, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Ryan Sammy\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u957f\u8425\u9500\u673a\u6784Fract\u7684\u6218\u7565\u603b\u76d1\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8d22\u5bcc500\u5e74\u548c\u7cbe\u54c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6539\u5584\u53cd\u51fb\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u54c1\u724c\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u6709\u673a\u4ea4\u901a\u3002\n    \u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7acb\u5373\u663e\u793a\u9876\u90e8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d5b\u6bb5\u4e2d\u56de\u7b54\u60a8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5047\u671f\u5012\u8ba1\u65f6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5728\u53f3\u8fb9\u662fWikipedia\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9762\u677f\uff0c\u5927\u7ea6\u4e07\u5723\u8282\uff0c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5b83\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u770b\u5230\u7279\u8272\u7247\u6bb5\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5f53\u5355\u51fb\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u6bb5\u5c06\u6269\u5c55\u3002\n  \u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b54\u6848\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4efb\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u7f51\u7ad9\uff1f\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u641c\u7d22\u4e0d\u662f\u66fe\u7ecf\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5929\uff0c\u5230\u8fbe\u8be5\u804c\u4f4d\u662f\u4e0d\u591f\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u503c\u5f97\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u9876\u7ea7\u7279\u8272\u7247\u6bb5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\n  \u7279\u8272\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u8c37\u6b4c\u4ece\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u76f4\u63a5\u62c9\u52a8\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u6216\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u4e0b\u65b9\uff0c\u5e76\u65e8\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u56de\u7b54\u641c\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u7247\u6bb5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ee5\u5217\u8868\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u8868\uff0c\u77ed\u6bb5\u6846\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u683c\u5f0f\u3002 ", "note_en": "Ryan Sammy is director of strategy at  Fractl, a growth marketing agency that helps Fortune 500s and boutique businesses improve backlink portfolios, brand awareness and organic traffic through high-quality content.\n    You can see that instead of displaying the top result right away, Google answers the question for you in a rich snippet.

", "note_en": "Vancouver\u2019s  SoleSavy, a sneaker community dedicated to giving fans a curated place to navigate the world of shoes, with all of its drops, news and rumors, has raised a $12.5 million Series A just months after wrapping a $2 million seed round, showcasing investor enthusiasm behind vertical-specific premium social experiences. The round was led by Bedrock Capital with participation from Dapper Labs\u2019 CEO Roham Gharegozlou, Diplo, Bessemer Ventures and Turner Novak\u2019s Banana Capital, among others.\n CEO Dejan Pralica says the company has tripled its user base since its seed raise late last year, while growing its team from 10 to 37 employees in the same period.\n  Today, SoleSavy\u2019s community is based largely around a network of Slack groups where users can discuss just about everything. Though the platform\u2019s chat communities are organized in Slack now, Pralica sees a future where the company could build its own chat hub for members, something to further tie-in the startup\u2019s app, website and online conversations. The more near-term goal is to grow this community into a hub of trusted buyers and sellers where a peer-to-peer member marketplace can thrive. SoleSavy is at the forefront of a new generation of more social internet marketplaces where vertical-specific communities can gather and grow inside an all-encompassing platform.\n \u201cI do envision on end-to-end platform that\u2019s very integrated,\u201d Pralica tells TechCrunch.\u201dI want to make sneakers fun again and enjoyable for the people that are passionate about them.\u201d\n Part of that fun has been diminished by free-for-all chat groups that can quickly grow toxic or grow exploitative as moderators look to cash in on their networks, something SoleSavy hopes a more curated approach can bring back.\n  As my boss (and TC\u2019s resident sneaker head) Matthew said in his  write-up of SoleSavy\u2019s seed raise earlier this year:\n That positive community vibe is what Pralica says is SoleSavy\u2019s long-term focus and differentiating factor that keeps the 4,000 members across the U.S. and Canada interacting with the group on a nearly daily basis\u2026 I\u2019ve been in a dozen or so different groups focused on buying large quantities of each release to re-sell over the years and many of them are, at best, rowdy and at worst toxic.

All that is certain is that Amblin will produce \u201cmultiple new feature films per year\u201d for Netflix.\n \u201cFrom the minute Ted [Sarandos, Netflix Co-CEO and Chief Content Officer] and I started discussing a partnership, it was abundantly clear that we had an amazing opportunity to tell new stories together and reach audiences in new ways,\u201d said Spielberg in the release.\n  Those new ways didn\u2019t sound so amazing to Spielberg a couple years ago when he was reportedly pushing to exclude Netflix films from the Academy Awards.\n \u201cOnce you commit to a television format, you\u2019re a TV movie,\u201d Spielberg told ITV in March of 2019. \u201cI don\u2019t believe films that are just given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for the Academy Award nomination.\u201d\n Ultimately no real push was made, though. Whether Spielberg was misrepresented, changed his mind, or just read the room, he has since tempered his position. He has said rather that he simply wants to cherish and protect \u201cthe theatrical experience\u201d \u2014 understandable from one of the pioneers of the modern blockbuster.\n Naturally it\u2019s a huge get for Netflix, which will get a steady stream of Amblin features, though there\u2019s no guarantee of a Spielberg picture. Meanwhile Amblin will continue its longtime partnership with Universal, which fills the more traditional moviemaking and distribution side of things. The company has already broken bread with streaming companies, with shows and films made for and distributed by Netflix and others, but this is most significant partnership so far.\n Perhaps it was COVID that suggested to Spielberg and Amblin that streaming platforms are, far from going away, simply the future of the industry in many ways. In a world where the \u201ctheatrical experience\u201d is a potential superspreader event and people are perfectly happy to watch (and pay for) a \u201cpremiere\u201d at home, it may be better to roll with the punches and hope that things bounce back.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 01:46:16", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7535\u5f71,amblin", "title": "Spielberg\u7684Amblin\u58a8\u6c34\u58a8\u6c34\u591a\u5e74\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7535\u5f71\u5904\u7406Netflix ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tSpielberg\u2019s Amblin inks multi-year feature film deal with Netflix\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/spielbergs-amblin-inks-multi-year-feature-film-deal-with-netflix/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7535\u5f71", "amblin"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f836ce1f3532f41865e7566a77edcbcf.png", "infoid": 1067243, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u7b80\u800c\u8a00\u4e4b\uff0cqu'est-ce qu'une plante\uff1f \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f89\u714c\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f53\u65f6\u690d\u7269\u751f\u6d3b\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u548c\u8089\u98df\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u690d\u7269\u4e3b\u4e49\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u548c\u8c10\u7684\u58f0\u97f3\u3002 ", "note_en": "What if plants suffered, thought, helped each other? And what if the carrot were an animal like any other? According to Peter Wohlleben, famous German forest engineer and author of the best-seller  The Hidden Life of Trees, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a wolf ripping apart a wild boar or a deer eating an oak seedling, in both cases there is pain and death\u201d (quoted p. 13). The thesis is original, and seems all the more innocuous since none of its defenders call for people to stop cooking plants.\n Is there not in this form of neo-animism, which sees a continuity between human and plant subjective interiority, an element of bad faith? Is not the alleged suffering of plants, Florence Burgat asks, \u201ca new diversion from the cause of animals\u201d (p. 172)? Dominique Lestel, author of  Apologie du carnivore (Apology for Carnivorism), does not hide his polemical intentions: \u201cWhy would it be more ethical to make a carrot suffer than a hare?\u201d (quoted p. 13). In good logic, if the carrot and the hare suffer in equal measure, \u201cit is not ethical\u201d to discriminate between them, to spare animals while savagely killing blades of grass, carrots, and soy sprouts. In this sense, vegetarians are murderers like any other. Just let carnivores enjoy themselves!\n Against this thesis, known as the \u201ccry of the carrot\u201d ( le cri de la carotte), animalists have so far been content to answer two things. On the one hand, plants do not have a nervous system, and so they do not feel pain. On the other hand, carnivores consume animals that are themselves fed on plants. Worse, the production of one animal protein requires 7 to 10 plant proteins. The argument is a strictly accounting one. Even if plant suffering were of the same intensity as animal suffering, omnivores would produce seven to ten times more suffering than plant lovers alone.\n Burgat is not satisfied with these arguments. The first is based on the idea that there can be no suffering without a nervous system. A  handful of biologists, controversial to be sure, follow in Wohlleben\u2019s footsteps and argue that plants have a form of \u201cdiffuse nervous system.\u201d In their view, synaptic activity\u2014electrical signals\u2014on the body of plants functions like a diffuse brain, one that is not concentrated in a single organ, as in animals. As for the second argument, it concedes that killing a carrot is murder, a murder comparable to that of a farm animal. In the eyes of the philosopher, this concession is absurd, pointless.\n Qu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019une plante? (What is a plant?) goes beyond these two arguments by defending the thesis of a radical ontological difference between plant and animal life. According to Burgat, resolving the question of pain, of subjectivity, requires us to focus on how plants give themselves to us, on their phenomenology.\n  The book is divided into three parts: epistemology, ontology, and morals and rights. The first part deals with the knowledge of plants. How does one produce knowledge about plants? Two models of knowledge can be distinguished: homological and analogical. The homological model assimilates plants to animal or human life. The body parts of one correspond to the body parts of the other. This is Wohlleben\u2019s model. Drawing on numerous passages from his book, Burgat easily shows that anthropomorphism is not here a simple method of popularizing science, a pedagogical metaphor; it is taken as a given. The other model of knowledge, the analogical paradigm, is more interesting and more complex. Since we know animals better than plants, since the former are closer to us physically, emotionally, and mentally, the scientific strategy of botanists has long consisted in investigating the unknown in plants based on the animal model\u2014as Fran\u00e7ois Delaporte observes in his works, but also Foucault in  The Order of Things. According to Burgat, this model of knowledge stumbles on at least two fundamental points: plant nutrition and reproduction. Unlike animals, plants are capable of feeding themselves without taking ready-made organic molecules from their environment; they can synthesize the latter from light. Thus, plants do not need to look for food. As for reproduction, some plants reproduce by cutting, \u201cwhich remains unexplained, for lack of finding an analogue elsewhere\u201d (Canguilhem, quoted p. 36). In this mode of reproduction, like comes from like. \u201cA plant,\u201d writes Hegel quoted by Burgat (p. 40), \u201cis an aggregate of a group of individuals which form a single individual, but whose parts are completely self-subsistent.\u201d\n It will be objected that certain plants, for instance carnivorous plants (p. 60), are mixotrophic, capable also of feeding on pre-existing organic constituents. Moreover, plant reproduction is not always asexual; not all plants can grow from a cutting. This is because a good part of the misunderstandings concerning plants stems \u201cfrom the idea that finding an animal feature in a plant organism suffices to extract [this organism] from its category and to place it in the opposite category\u201d (pp. 51-52). No single empirical feature is the truth of an organism. \u201cUnder the analytical eye, empirical features say nothing when taken one by one; they never allow the ontological question to be decided\u201d (p. 52). The organism is the structure and not the sum of its parts. Against analytical methodology, which decomposes the living into its elements, Burgat pleads for a science or an interpretation of forms, of the whole that is formed and transformed.\n  Thus, Florence Burgat propose an ontological study based on a phenomenology of plant life. The investigation focuses on what plants are. The challenge is to understand what substantially differentiates plants from animals by proposing both a negative, privative definition (what they do not have compared to animals) and a positive one (what they have that animals do not have). To understand what is specific to plant life, one must first engage in comparative analysis, which is the means by which philosophy, and not only the current of philosophical anthropology, approaches the \u201cquestion of plant life.\u201d Negatively, the plant has no perception in the psychological sense (p. 55). When the plant has infraperceptions, that is, perceptions without a subject to experience them as its own, it is not necessarily its unity that infraperceives\u2014a unity that is nowhere to be found\u2014but some of its parts. Plants react finely to any corpuscular or undulatory phenomenon, but without forming mental images of it (p. 90).\n There is no interiority, no life of consciousness, no intentionality in plant life: \u201cConsciousness appears only in the primitive reflection of sensation\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 79). Plant life is neither experiential nor restless (p. 102).\n Plants do not have a lived world; their life is immediate. They are among the living beings for whom objects in the world have only one meaning. There is no multivocality of meaning. There is no error experienced as an error, no astonishment at what appears. There is an \u201cabsolutely radical\u201d division between the plant world and the animal world, between the world of \u201cobjective correspondence\u201d and the world of subjective meaning (p. 64). Plants are not individuals, if individuals are indivisible totalities whose division implies destruction (p. 105).\n Finally, plants do not move. Phototropism, or reaction to light, is just that\u2014a reaction. \u201cThe animal,\u201d writes Hans Jonas, \u201ccan freely close and open its jaws whenever it feels like it\u2014to chew, to yawn, or simply to exercise this faculty\u2014and it can stop and reverse every movement in progress\u201d (quoted p. 62). The plant does not have this freedom; it cannot close and open its leaves.\n From the perspective of a positive ontology, Burgat wonders whether the life of the plant might not closely approximate life as a superpowerful and eternal force. In some respects, the plant seems immortal, freed from temporality: Seeds or root fragments suffice for its rebirth. Plants are \u201cdriven by pure growth, unaware of the caesura of birth and the irreversible rupture of death, slowly collapsing in on themselves to relive elsewhere\u201d (p. 83). If the plant is not an individual, then its positive quality may be that it is a  dividuum (according to the expression coined by a biologist quoted by Plessner, p. 105). The plant is \u201cthe greatest chemist among all living beings (...) it builds the elements of its organic development from inorganic substances\u201d (Scheler, quoted p. 110). This capacity\u2014this autotrophy\u2014is the mark of its autarchic royalty (p. 130). Whereas for Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss the animal is the most other of all others, that is, the psycho-subjective structure which, sharing a common basis, is the most alien to us, plant life for Burgat is \u201cradical alterity\u201d (p. 129), that which resists all common, lived experience.\n  Is plant life\u2014as defined through the ontological investigation\u2014worthy of respect? The philosopher shares with L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Francis Hall\u00e9 a certain repugnance for the felling of trees. Their destruction as well as \u201cthe ransacking and pollution of natural environments are reproved for their consequences and for what they are in themselves: a repugnant attitude\u201d (p. 144). This repugnance appears to be an intuition, the first answer that comes to mind when we are summoned to answer the question \u201cis it right to cut down the tree that is standing over there, right in front of me, and has been around for decades?\u201d But is this intuition correct? Is it reprehensible to cut down a hundred hundred-year-old oaks to rebuild the framework of Notre-Dame Cathedral (p. 148)? If it is reprehensible, is our repugnance consistent with the principle of attributing fundamental rights to plants?\n Burgat does not definitively settle these questions. In terms of content, she sides with Rousseau and Bentham. Sensibility is a necessary and sufficient condition to be a bearer of rights. In terms of form, she points out that, from a strictly technical point of view, nothing prevents the legislator from protecting the interests of humans in the environment, if they consider these interests sufficiently important to set up a specific protection, or to protect such and such a species of flower, or such and such a tree that is particularly remarkable for aesthetic reasons. One may well call legal \u201crights\u201d these types of rights which are conceptually indirect. If historical monuments can be protected (p. 153), then so can plants.

Maybe you should improve your hiring process. How do you track what they are getting done now?\n I don&#39;t know. Now I walk around and ask them, and we have meetings where we talk about it; if I&#39;m not around how would I know if they were slacking off?\n Maybe you should work to improve what you measure and how you encourage feedback. It is normally a good idea to have ways to tell if people are doing a good job for what you are paying them to do.\n But if I can\u2019t see them to make sure they are working, then I can\u2019t manage them.\n Sounds like you need to level up as a manager. There are other skills to improve how you manage different types of teams and working styles. Your job as a leader is to have a productive team; take ownership of this and adjust to running a productive team in a new way.\n But we can\u2019t let our people not see each other, they won\u2019t communicate well.\n People coordinate large projects all the time without being in the same place. You might want to think about improving your processes. Some simple changes could improve your communication.\n  The last year isn&#39;t typical remote work; most companies were rushing to move away from the office, but were not embracing remote work. Remote work, if done well, is not a day full of Zoom meetings. GitLab, a $6B company, has a guide that might be an  interesting read. In it, they say that the company is in the  Skeumorph phase when they just do everything the same way, but not in the same place. You can mature past this into later phases where you don&#39;t spend so much on video calls.\n I&#39;m a manager, if I spend less time in meetings, what am I going to be doing all day?\n I appreciate the honesty; that sounds like a great problem to have. Thinking strategically, helping to grow your people, writing documents that would have been meetings. You will be plenty busy, just in a different way.\n  Sounds like if they want to and you don\u2019t let them, they will leave to one of the many companies that let them. I hope none of them are your  competitors.\n But we are paying all this money for office space, I don&#39;t want to waste that.\n That is ultimately your call. Depending on your business,  losing a few key employees might be worse that eating a year of a lease. Depending on your business, reducing in-person meetings, being able to hire talented people a few hours away, and having happier more loyal employees might be less important than a big lease cost. Also, you might be experiencing the  Sunk Cost Fallacy.\n I don&#39;t want to change the way I work, I just want people to join me in the office. My kids are driving me crazy. Is it weird to say I&#39;m lonely; I miss my office friends.\n The office has some great things going for it. Have you ever sat down and listed them and thought about how more established companies make sure those things happen without an office? You might be surprised.

And nearly 40% of high earners \u2014 those making more than $100,000 annually \u2014 said they live that way.\n That means high-earning millennials aren&#39;t the only ones feeling stretched thin, but they feel that way more than their six-figure-making peers. Living on constrained budgets may therefore have less to do with income and more to do with expenses, the report said.\n     That&#39;s partly because of lifestyle choices. Many of these millennials are likely  HENRYs \u2014 short for high earner, not rich yet. The acronym was invented in 2003, but it has come to characterize a certain group of 30-something six-figure earners who struggle to balance their spending and savings habits.\n HENRYs typically fall victim to  lifestyle creep, when one increases one&#39;s standard of living to match a rise in discretionary income. They prefer a comfortable and often expensive lifestyle that leaves them living paycheck to paycheck.\n        As the report said, &#34;Living paycheck to paycheck sometimes carries connotations of barely scraping by and of poverty. The reality of a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle in the United States today is much more complex, and the current economic environment has made it even more complicated.&#34;\n It cited the example of a college-educated 35-year-old earning more than $100,000 while juggling a mortgage, student-loan debt, and a child, which could leave them with little savings for big purchases or unexpected emergencies.\n The generation is facing an  affordability crisis. Income increases simply  have not kept up with an exponential increase in living costs, and the pandemic hasn&#39;t helped matters by throwing job loss and  pay cuts into the mix.\n The cost of education has also more than doubled since the 1970s, leaving many millennials with student debt. Priya Malani, the founder of  Stash Wealth, a financial firm that works with HENRYs,  previously told Insider that 40% of her clients had student loans. On average, they owed $80,000.\n     As a byproduct of this increased cost in living, the middle class has been shrinking.

Other preliminary evidence puts  humans in central Mexico as early as around 33,000 years ago ( SN: 7/22/20).\n The latest evidence comes from animal bones that biological anthropologist and archaeologist Andrew Somerville and two Mexican colleagues found stored in a Mexico City lab. The bones had been excavated in the 1960s at a rock-shelter called Coxcatlan Cave.\n Radiocarbon analyses of six rabbit bones from the site\u2019s deepest sediment  yielded unexpectedly old ages, the researchers report online May 19 in  Latin American Antiquity. That sediment also contained chipped and sharp-edged stones regarded as tools by the site\u2019s lead excavator.\n Higher sediment layers yielded clearer examples of stone tools and other remnants of human activity dating to nearly 9,900 years ago. \u00a0Somerville, of\u00a0Iowa State University in Ames, initially suspected that rabbit bones from the deepest sediment were perhaps around 12,000 years old. But analyses revealed they were much older, hinting humans were living in the cave roughly 30,000 years ago.\n Somerville will next determine whether other animal bones from the ancient sediment display butchery marks, breaks where marrow was removed or burned patches from cooking. He also wants to locate and study possible stone tools from that same sediment that may be stored in the same lab.\n Based on additional radiocarbon dates and comparisons with stone-tool finds from other Mexican sites, Somerville suspects that a separate occupation of Coxcatlan Cave occurred between 13,500 and 9,900 years ago. Regional food and water sources may have dwindled when the last Ice Age peaked between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago, causing the earliest settlers to leave and delaying further occupations \u00a0until conditions improved, Somerville speculates.\n   A.

Maybe we should not have added  signed-by, people seem to forget that debs still run maintainer scripts as root.\n Aside from this email, Debian users should look into  extrepo, which manages curated external repositories for you.\n        Older (and all) releases only support unarmored files with an extension .gpg. If you care about them, provide one, and use\n  Some people will tell you to download the  .asc and pipe it to  gpg --dearmor, but  gpg might not be installed, so really, just offer a  .gpg one instead that is supported on all systems.\n      People say it\u2019s good practice to  not use  trusted.gpg.d and install the file elsewhere and then refer to it from the  sources.list entryby using  signed-by=&lt;path to the file&gt;. So this looks a lot safer, because now your key can\u2019t sign other unrelated repositories. Inpractice, security increase is minimal, since package maintainer scripts run as root anyway. But I guess it\u2019s better for publicity :)\n As an example, here are the instructions to install  signal-desktop from signal.org. As mentioned,  gpg --dearmor use in there is not a good idea, and I\u2019d personally not tell people to modify  /usr as it\u2019s supposed to be managed by the package manager, but we don\u2019t have an  /etc/apt/keyrings or similar at the moment; it\u2019s fine though if the keyring is installed by the package. You can also just add the file there as a starting point, and then installa keyring package overriding it (pretend there is a signal-desktop-keyring package below that would override the .gpg we added).\n # NOTE: These instructions only work for 64 bit Debian-based# Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Mint etc.# 1. Install our official public software signing keywget -O- https://updates.signal.org/desktop/apt/keys.asc | gpg --dearmor &gt; signal-desktop-keyring.gpgcat signal-desktop-keyring.gpg | sudo tee -a /usr/share/keyrings/signal-desktop-keyring.gpg &gt; /dev/null# 2.

Update your package database and install signalsudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt install signal-desktop\n I do wonder why they do  wget | gpg --dearmor, pipe that into the file and then  cat | sudo tee it, instead of having that all in one pipeline. Maybe they want nicer progress reporting.\n   For system image building, shipping the key in  /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d seems reasonable to me; you are the vendor sort of, so it can be globally trusted.\n Chrome-style debs and repository config debs: If you ship a deb, embedding the  sources.list.d snippet (calling it  $myrepo.list) and shipping a  $myrepo.gpg in  /usr/share/keyrings is the best approach. Whether you ship that in product debs aka  vscode/ chromium or provide a repository configuration deb (let\u2019s call it  myrepo-repo.deb) and then tell people to run  apt update followed by  apt install &lt;package inside the repo&gt; depends on how many packages are in the repo, I guess.\n Manual instructions (signal style): The third case, where you tell people to run  wget themselves, I find tricky.As we see in signal, just stuffing keyring files into  /usr/share/keyrings is popular, despite  /usr supposed to be managed by the package manager.We don\u2019t have another dir inside  /etc (or  /usr/local), so it\u2019s hard to suggest something else.There\u2019s no significant benefit from actually using  signed-by, so it\u2019s kind of extra work for little gain, though.\n  This part is new, just for this blog post.

That transaction wasn\u2019t completed until the third quarter of 2020 other than in Mexico, which closed in January 2021. This latest agreement, which was reached June 18 and reported Monday, will make Cornershop a wholly owned subsidiary of Uber.\n The deal suggests Uber\u2019s bullishness in delivery hasn\u2019t waned. With Cornershop as wholly owned subsidiary, Uber can beef up its grocery delivery options, a service made popular during the pandemic. Uber started offering grocery delivery  in select cities across Latin America, Canada and the U.S. last summer after it acquired Postmates in a deal valued at  $2.65 billion. Uber faces stiff competition from grocery retailers themselves, many of whom offer delivery through partnering with startups like DoorDash or Favor Fleet.\n  Cornershop, which is headquartered in Chile, was founded in 2015 by Oskar Hjertonsson, Daniel Undurraga and Juan Pablo Cuevas. The company expanded its operations to eight countries up and down the Americas, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, the U.S. and Canada. The company raised  $31.7 million over four rounds of funding from investors that include Accel and Jackson Square Ventures.\n Uber wasn\u2019t the only grocery service with its eyes on Cornershop; the startup was supposed to be acquired by Walmart in a $225 million deal, but it ultimately fell through after Mexican anti-trust regulators blocked the deal from moving forward.

The company announced today that some US-based public figures, as well as certain groups, can start hosting rooms through the main Facebook iOS app. (People can join, however, from both iOS and Android.) Anyone can be invited up as a speaker with up to 50 people able to speak at once. There\u2019s no cap on the number of listeners allowed in \u2014 a major shot at Clubhouse, which imposes room size limitations.\n It\u2019s also introducing other nifty features, like notifications when your friends or followers join a room, as well as live captions. There will be a \u201craise a hand\u201d button to request to join the conversation, and reactions will be available to to interact throughout the chat. Twitter Spaces, Twitter\u2019s live audio feature, includes captions, but Clubhouse still does not.\n Within groups, admins can control who\u2019s allowed to create a room: moderators, group members, or other admins. Public group chats will be accessible both in and outside the group, but private group chats will be restricted to members. Additionally, hosts can also select a nonprofit or fundraiser to support during their conversation with a button to directly donate showing up on the chat. Again, this feels like a feature directly built to address a key Clubhouse use case and make it frictionless. (Many Clubhouse creators have hosted fundraisers on the app but have to direct people to outside links in order to facilitate donations.)\n   Additionally, Facebook is making podcasts available on the platform, confirming earlier   Verge reporting. People will be able to listen to podcasts through either a mini-player or a full-screen player with various playback controls, including the ability to listen while the screen is off. They\u2019ll be able to find shows on specific podcast creators\u2019 Pages, as well as in the News Feed, and they can react to, comment, bookmark, and share their favorites. The Facebook team says it plans to roll out automatic captioning later this summer, as well as a clips feature where listeners can create and share their favorite clips.\n All these features come  just days after Spotify debuted its own live audio app, Greenroom;  three months since Stage Channels came to Discord;  four months after Reddit Talk; roughly  seven months after Twitter launched Spaces; and about 15 months after Clubhouse first launched.  LinkedIn and  Slack are, reportedly, working on their own versions of an audio product, even as  downloads of and  buzz around Clubhouse itself have waned considerably.\n   Unlike Clubhouse, which drew in early listeners by giving them auditory access to Silicon Valley hot shots, Facebook is hoping to cast a broader net of influencers with Live Audio Rooms. Among the named public figures who will have access to the feature on launch will be musicians (TOKiMONSTA, D Smoke, Kehlani); media figures (Joe Budden, DeRay Mckesson); and athletes (Russell Wilson, Omareloff). Joe Budden will also distribute his podcast through Facebook.\n Audio rooms may or may not be a feature with real staying power, but Facebook seems intent on investing broadly in the space.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:50:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,\u63a8\u51fa,launches,\u529f\u80fd", "title": "Facebook\u63a8\u51fa\u5176\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u514b\u9686 ", "title_en": "Facebook Launches Its Clubhouse Clone", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22540508/facebook-live-audio-rooms-clubhouse-rival-spaces-greenhouse", "via": "", "real_tags": ["facebook", "\u63a8\u51fa", "launches", "\u529f\u80fd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1067234, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\uff1a\u53ea\u8981\u4f60\u7684CI\u4ece\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8bf7\u4e0d\u8981\u629b\u5f03\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u6539\u4e3a\u53d1\u5e03\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97QA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8bb0\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6765\u6613\u4e8e\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002\n  \u6211\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528Jenkins\u3002 Jenkins\u4e0d\u662f\u6211\u9996\u9009\u7684CI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u7528\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u5176\u8d85\u7ea7\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\uff1a\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5f52\u6863\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f7f\u7528ArchiveARtifacts Pipeline\u547d\u4ee4\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6267\u884c\u6b64\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u6211\u4eec\u7684QA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n \u5f53\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u8003\u8651\u5b83\u51c6\u5907QA\u65f6\uff0cQA\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4e0b\u8f7dPR\u6784\u5efa\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n  \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u6211\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u5728Github\u4e0a\u6258\u7ba1\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Gi\u200b\u200btHub CI\u3002\n \u6211\u9884\u8ba1\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u6211\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002 GitHub\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5efa\u7b51\u7269\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6587\u7269\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\uff1a\n \u4f2a\u50cf\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u7684zip\u4e2d\u6346\u7ed1\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u65b9\u4fbf\u7684\uff1a\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u4e0b\u8f7d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u76f8\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684acos\uff0cwindows\u548clinux\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002 \n\u4e00\u4e9b\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u751f\u4ea7\u4e3b\u5206\u652f\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4e0d\u559c\u6b22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002\u53eb\u6211\u4e00\u4e2a\u7eaf\u7968\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u611f\u89c9\u50cf\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8865\u507f\u4e22\u5931\u7684github\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n \u7531\u4e8e\u6211\u6258\u7ba1vps\u4e0a\u7684\u535a\u5ba2\uff0c\u6211\u6700\u7ec8\u505a\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u6b63\u5728vps\u4e0a\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b50\u57df\uff08builds.agateau.com\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06github\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u6211\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684ssh\u3002\n  \u6211\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u662fHTTP\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u5728\u6211\u7684\u6ce8\u518c\u5546\u4e0a\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b50\u57df\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u5728\u6211\u7684vps\u4e0a\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u5f55\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u7f6e\u4e86nginx\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bbf\u95ee\uff06\uff0334;

This makes it easy to provide QA engineers or bug reporters with new builds to try.\n  I first experienced this setup at work, where we use Jenkins. Jenkins is  not my preferred CI system, but to its credit, it makes it super easy to implement this feature: add a step to archive artifacts, either using the GUI or using the  archiveArtifacts pipeline command.\n We actually do this for all builds at work, not only master branch builds. It makes the life of our QA engineers much easier. Our workflow looks like this:\n when developers consider it ready to QA, QA engineers download the artifacts produced by the PR build and use them to validate the work.\n  I thought it would be a good idea to setup something similar for my own projects, which are hosted on GitHub and use GitHub CI.\n I expected a feature like this to be readily available, but I could not find exactly what I wanted. GitHub provides a way to download artifacts from a build but it&#39;s not ideal:\n Artifacts are all bundled together in a big zip, which is inconvenient when building multi-platform apps: no-one wants to download a single archive containing the same application for macOS, Windows and Linux.\n Some projects use tags to produce main branch builds, but I don&#39;t like this idea. Call me a purist, but using tags that way feels like subverting the concept to compensate for a missing GitHub feature.\n Since I host my blog on a VPS, what I ended up doing is setting up a subdomain for builds on the VPS ( builds.agateau.com) and making GitHub upload artifacts to my server over SSH.\n  The first thing I set up was the HTTP server to serve the files. After adding the subdomain on my registrar, I created a directory on my VPS and configured Nginx so that users visiting &#34;builds.agateau.com&#34; would be able to browse and download the content of this directory, using the  Nginx Fancy Index module.\n   I then created a  build user on the VPS, created one directory per project in  /srv/builds.agateau.com/html and made the  build user the owner of these directories so that it can write to them.\n Finally I created an SSH key for this user, so that the GitHub builder can connect to it.\n  I looked into existing GitHub actions for SSH uploads but it all felt overkill for just an  scp call. Instead I decided to keep it simple: my build is going to call a shell script to do the upload. I prefer keeping dependencies with the CI to a minimum anyway, it makes it easier to test build scripts locally instead of using the commit-push-and-pray &#34;workflow&#34;.\n  #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail PROGNAME = $(basename  $0 )die ()  {  echo  &#34; $PROGNAME :  $* &#34; &gt; &amp; 2  exit  1 } # Check $1 is defined and not emptycheck_var ()  {  local  name = $1  if ! env  | grep -q  &#34;^ $name =..*&#34;  ;  then die  &#34;Environment variable  $name  is not set or is empty&#34;  fi }usage ()  {  if  [  &#34; $* &#34; ! =  &#34;&#34;  ]  ;  then  echo  &#34;Error:  $* &#34;  echo  fi cat  &lt;&lt; EOF Usage: $PROGNAME [OPTION ...] &lt;project&gt; &lt;build_file&gt; [build_file...] Uploads build artifacts to a server using scp.

I find that it helps when revisiting them 6 months later (I wrote about my  shell script template some time ago if you are interested).\n This script takes the name of the project, which matches the directory created on the server for it, and the files to upload. Sensitive information (username, host name and private key) is provided through environment variables.\n Note: I had to disable host-key checking (the  -o &#34;StrictHostKeyChecking off&#34; option in the  scp call) because I could not figure out how to pass the host key as an argument or environment variable. I believe in that case it won&#39;t be too bad, the worse that could happen is someone managing to steal the account public key and uploading builds to their server instead of mine. Still I&#39;d prefer to be able to pass the host key. If you know how to do this, I would love to hear from you!\n  I connected to the project GitHub admin page and declared the username, host name and private keys as  GitHub encrypted secrets.\n Now all that was left to do was to call the  upload-build script from the GitHub build workflow.\n Here is  Git Bonsai build workflow, showing how to call  upload-build after each push to the master branch.\n name :  Build on :  [ push ,  pull_request ] jobs :  build :  strategy :  fail-fast :  false  matrix :  os :  -  ubuntu-18.04  -  macos-10.15  -  windows-2019  runs-on :  ${{ matrix.os }}  defaults :  run :  shell :  bash  steps :  -  uses :  actions/ [email\u00a0protected]  -  name :  Build  run :  ci/build-app  -  name :  Run static checks  run :  ci/run-static-checks  -  name :  Run tests  run :  ci/run-tests  -  name :  Create archive  run :  ci/create-archive  -  name :  Upload  if :  github.ref == &#39;refs/heads/master&#39;  run :  ci/upload-build git-bonsai artifacts/*.bz2  env :  UPLOAD_USERNAME :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_USERNAME }}  UPLOAD_PRIVATE_KEY :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_PRIVATE_KEY }}  UPLOAD_HOSTNAME :  ${{ secrets.UPLOAD_HOSTNAME }}\n  One last thing was required on the server side: to ensure the server disk does not get filled with builds and the build list page does not become too long to load, I added a cleanup script to keep only the latest 30 builds for each project. This script runs every day.\n Here it is, once again it&#39;s a bit longer than what one would expect because of argument parsing:\n #!/bin/bash set -euo pipefail PROGNAME = $(basename  $0 ) ROOT_DIR =/srv/builds.agateau.com/html MAX_BUILDS = 30 # Verbose command by default CMD = &#34;rm -v&#34; QUIET_CMD = &#34;rm&#34; DRY_RUN_CMD = &#34;echo Would delete &#34;clean_project_dir ()  {  local  project_dir = &#34; $1 &#34; ls --sort  time --reverse  &#34; $project_dir &#34;  \\  | awk  &#39;NR &gt; &#39; $MAX_BUILDS &#39; { print $1 }&#39;  \\  |  while  read name  do  $CMD  &#34; $project_dir / $name &#34;  done }usage ()  {  if  [  &#34; $* &#34; ! =  &#34;&#34;  ]  ;  then  echo  &#34;Error:  $* &#34;  echo  fi cat  &lt;&lt; EOF Usage: $PROGNAME [OPTION ...] Delete old builds artifacts. Options: -h, --help display this usage message and exit -q, --quiet work silently --dry-run print what would be deleted instead of deleting anything EOF  exit  1 } while  [  $# -gt  0  ]  ;  do  case  &#34; $1 &#34; in -h |--help ) usage  ;; -q |--quiet )  CMD = &#34; $QUIET_CMD &#34;  shift  ;; --dry-run )  CMD = &#34; $DRY_RUN_CMD &#34;  shift  ;; -* ) usage  &#34;Unknown option &#39; $1 &#39;&#34;  ;; * ) usage  &#34;Too many arguments&#34;  ;;  esac done for project_dir in  $ROOT_DIR/*/  ;  do clean_project_dir  &#34; $project_dir &#34; done\n  To make the builds site look a bit nicer, I configured the Fancy Index module to use the  Flat theme. I also made it list builds in descending date order, so that the latest builds are always at the top of the page.\n That&#39;s it, you can have a look at it here:  https://builds.agateau.com/. There are only two projects for now, I plan to add more in the future.\n  I am happy I spent some time setting up this artifact upload system as it has proved useful to let bug reporters confirm a fix after they reported an issue. Let me know if this was useful to you, or if you know of simpler solutions to publish build artifacts.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 00:49:35", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u53d1\u5e03,publishing,\u6784\u5efa", "title": "\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u5e03\u60a8\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4ef6 ", "title_en": "Automatically publishing your build artifacts", "transed": 1, "url": "https://agateau.com/2021/automatically-publishing-your-build-artifacts/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u53d1\u5e03", "\u6784\u5efa"]}]
