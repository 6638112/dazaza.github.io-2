Three times a week, several older women would sit in a line against the wall in the corridor. Some were slumped motionless in their chairs. Others seemed scared and agitated. Occasionally, one would try to run off and was brought back to the chair by kind but firm staff. When I found out that they were waiting for ‘electroshock’, I volunteered for the job of sitting with them as they came round from the general anaesthetic, after the electric shock and the seizure. They would ask me: ‘Where am I?’ ‘Who am I?’ ‘Why is my head pounding?’ and ‘What did they do to me?’ I remember being unable to answer the old lady who asked me, in tears: ‘Why would they do such a thing to me?’</p><p>在20世纪70年代初，我是一个天真的21岁，以自毕业大学以来的第一份工作，作为纽约精神病病房的护理助手。每周三次，几个老年女性将坐在一条线上靠在走廊里的墙上。有些人在他们的椅子上迟钝。其他人似乎害怕和激动。偶尔，人们会试图逃跑，并被善良的员工带回主席。当我发现他们正在等待“埃斯托克”时，我自愿参加与他们一起坐在一起的工作，因为他们从一般麻醉后，在电击和癫痫发作之后。他们会问我：'我在哪里？''我是谁？''为什么我的头部冲击？“他们对我做了什么？”我记得无法回答那个让我问我的老太太，泪流满面：'为什么他们会对我做这么件事？“</p><p> The Royal College of Psychiatrists in the UK, in its latest public information document (2020), writes:</p><p> 英国皇家精神科医生，在其最新信息文件（2020年）中，写道：</p><p> ECT is a treatment for some types of severe mental illness that have not responded to other treatments.</p><p> ECT是一种治疗某些类型的严重精神疾病，其尚未应对其他治疗。</p><p> An anaesthetic and muscle relaxant are given, and then an electric current is passed across your head. This causes a controlled fit, which typically lasts less than  90 seconds.</p><p> 给出麻醉剂和肌肉松弛剂，然后通过电流穿过头部。这导致受控合适，通常持续不到90秒。</p><p> The anaesthetic means that you are asleep while this happens. The muscle relaxant reduces the movement of the fit.</p><p> 麻醉意味着你在发生这种情况时睡着了。肌肉松弛剂减少了配合的运动。</p><p> It is given as a course of treatments twice a week, typically for  3-8 weeks.</p><p> 它作为每周两次治疗疗程，通常为3-8周。</p><p> The most common response I get when mentioning shock therapy beyond mental health circles is: ‘Are we seriously still doing that?’ To grasp the persistence of this treatment, you need to go back in time. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) joins a long tradition of applying extreme physical procedures to distressed or distressing people: harsh laxatives, bloodletting, blistering of the forehead, rotating chairs, surprise baths, being packed in ice, inoculation of scabies, force-feeding chimney soot and wood lice and, briefly at the beginning of the 20th century in the US, surgically removing teeth, testicles, ovaries, gall bladders and colons. The  20th century witnessed malaria-induced fevers, insulin-induced comas and a range of ‘psychosurgery’ procedures including hammering an ice-pick-shaped instrument into the brain via the eye socket (‘prefrontal leucotomy’) and insertion of radioactive yttrium (Y90) into the brain (‘subcaudate tractotomy’). All these ‘treatments’ were administered by practitioners who, in their time, genuinely believed that they were helping people.</p><p> 我得到的最常见的回应，当提到精神健康界之外的休克治疗是：'我们认真对待这一点吗？为了掌握这种治疗的持久性，你需要及时回去。电耦合治疗（ECT）加入了一个漫长的传统，将极端的物理程序应用于痛苦或令人痛苦的人：苛刻的泻药，额头，额头，旋转椅子，惊喜浴，被包装在冰上，接种疥疮，牛皮地区和木虱子，简要介绍了20世纪初的美国，手术删除牙齿，睾丸，卵巢，胆囊和冒号。 20世纪目睹了疟疾诱导的Freves，胰岛素诱导的玉米和一系列“精神科医历”程序，包括通过眼部插座（'推列白膜膜'）并插入放射性Ytrium（Y90）将冰镐形仪器锤入大脑中（Y90 ）进入大脑（'亚推荐术治疗术语'）。所有这些“治疗”由从业者管理，在他们的时间，真正相信他们正在帮助人们。 </p><p> Seizures per se, of course, were always considered the symptom of an illness rather than a cure. So, why, in the 1930s, did some Italian psychiatrists come up with the idea that it would be helpful to cause grand mal seizures in people considered mad? The key is a theory of the era positing that epilepsy couldn’t exist alongside a group of symptoms lumped together and called ‘schizophrenia’. So, while some doctors started treating epilepsy by injecting blood from people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’, psychiatrists were exploring ways to induce epilepsy, or at least epileptic seizures, in ‘schizophrenics’.</p><p>当然，缉获本身，总是被认为是疾病的症状而不是治愈。那么，为什么，在20世纪30年代，一些意大利精神科医生提出了这个想法，使得在被认为是疯狂的人们中扮演盛大的枪击性癫痫发作会有所帮助？关键是癫痫患者与一群症状一起存在并叫做“精神分裂症”的理论。所以，虽然一些医生开始通过被诊断为“精神分裂症”的人来治疗癫痫，但精神科医生在“精神分裂症”中探索患有癫痫或至少癫痫发作的方法。</p><p> In Hungary in 1934, the psychiatrist Ladislas Meduna induced seizures in patients by injecting camphor and metrazol. After giving his first injection, Meduna ‘was so distressed he had to be supported to his room by nurses’, according to researchers. Meanwhile in Italy, the neurologist Ugo Cerletti was giving electricity a go. He experimented first with dogs, placing electrodes in their mouths and rectum. Many died. He discovered a way to bypass the heart, at a slaughterhouse:</p><p> 在匈牙利于1934年，精神科医生Ladislas Meduna通过注射樟脑和甲状腺醇诱导患者的癫痫发作。据研究人员称，梅杜拉“被梅杜拉”如此苦恼，他必须被护士支持他的房间。与此同时，在意大利，神经科学家Ugo Cerletti送电。他先用狗试验，将电极放在嘴里和直肠上。许多人死了。他发现了一种屠宰场绕过心脏的方法：</p><p> The hogs were clamped at the temples with big metallic tongs which were hooked up to an electric current (125 volts) … they fell unconscious, stiffened, then after a few seconds they were shaken by convulsions in the same way as our experimental dogs … I felt we could venture to experiment on man.</p><p> 用大金属钳子夹在寺庙的寺庙中，大金属钳挂在电流（125伏特）上......他们昏迷不醒，加强了，然后在几秒钟后，随着我们的实验犬的方式，他们被痉挛摇动......我觉得我们可以冒险实验。</p><p> His first human subject was a 39-year-old engineer from Milan, whom the police found wandering around a Rome train station in a confused state. When the first electric shock failed to produce the desired convulsion, Cerletti and his assistant discussed whether to administer a more powerful shock. Cerletti reported:</p><p> 他的第一个人类主题是来自米兰的39岁的工程师，警察在迷茫的状态下发现罗马火车站徘徊。当第一次电击未能产生所需的痉挛时，Cerletti和他的助手讨论了是否管理更强大的休克。 Cerletti报道：</p><p> All at once, the patient, who evidently had been following our conversation, said clearly and solemnly, without his usual gibberish: ‘Not another one! It’s deadly!’</p><p> 一下子，患者显然是在我们的谈话之后，清楚而庄严地说，没有他平常的痛苦：'不是另一个！这是致命的！“</p><p> Cerletti proceeded anyway, in the first of the millions of instances that were to follow, and which continue today, of people being given this treatment despite clearly stating they don’t want it. After another, larger electric shock, which did produce a convulsion, the engineer couldn’t recall being shocked; the first of millions of instances of the short-term memory loss caused by this treatment.</p><p> 无论如何，Cerletti继续进行，在最多的数百万个实例中，在今天持续的情况下，尽管如此，但在今天被赋予这种治疗的人。陆续，较大的电击，这确实产生了一种痉挛，工程师无法回忆震惊;本治疗引起的短期内记忆损失的第一百万个实例。</p><p>  Like Meduna before him, Cerletti wasn’t insensitive to the effects of what he was doing on the person in front of him:</p><p>  就像梅森一样，Cerletti对他在他面前的人身上的影响并不敏感： </p><p> When I saw the patient’s reaction I thought to myself: this ought to be abolished! Ever since I have looked forward to the time when another treatment would replace electroshock.</p><p>当我看到病人的反应时，我想到了自己：这应该被废除！自从我向前期待着另一个治疗的时间来取代电孔。</p><p> I had a similar reaction to Meduna’s and Cerletti’s when, at that New York hospital, I witnessed my first ECT, along with some medical students. When the psychiatrist asked: ‘Would anyone like to press the button?’, the five other young men were all keen. Having watched the woman convulse and then become limp, I wheeled her unconscious body back down the corridor, not a very reassuring sight for the queue. I ended up in the car park, throwing up. Even before knowing what the research says about ECT, I’d had, quite literally, a gut reaction that something was dreadfully wrong. But to understand why ECT still happens today, remember that the five medical students either didn’t share my revulsion or, perhaps, chose to conceal it from their teacher.</p><p> 我对Meduna和Cerletti的时候，在那个纽约医院的时候，我目睹了我的第一个等待，以及一些医学生。当精神科医生问：'有人喜欢按下按钮吗？“，其他五个年轻人都热衷于此。看着女人的刺穿，然后变得跛行，我把昏迷的身体拉下走廊，而不是一个非常令人放心的队列。我最终在停车场，呕吐。甚至在知道研究中所说的学生时，我也有，非常简单地，肠道反应是一种令人恐惧的错误。但要理解为什么现在仍然发生的原因，请记住，五个医学生要么没有分享我的厌恶，也许是选择从老师隐瞒它。</p><p> Acceptance in the 1940s of Cerletti’s strange invention is best understood by recalling that psychiatry’s ‘medical model’ of human distress had thus far developed no effective treatments. There were hundreds of vast mental institutions, full of thousands of ‘chronic’ ‘incurable’ patients and, presumably, rather demoralised, pessimistic staff.</p><p> 通过回顾迄今为止，最佳地理解了20世纪40年代的90年代的奇怪发明是最突出的人类窘迫的“医学模式”。有数百个庞大的心理机构，充满了成千上万的“慢性”患者，概述，令人悲伤的八分之一，悲观的员工。</p><p> I view what happened as a huge naturalistic experiment demonstrating the power of placebo, including the creation of positive expectations in staff and, ultimately, patients. The 1940s and ’50s certainly saw many people discharged from hospital following ECT, sometimes after being incarcerated for many years, or even decades. This was a hugely important development, given the devastating effects of institutionalisation and the belief that recovery was impossible. But the people deciding on discharges would probably have been the same people who had decided to administer ECT. The first two studies in the 1950s to actually compare patients who did or didn’t receive ECT found lower recovery rates for ECT recipients than for non-recipients or no difference. While some critics took issue with that work, the fact is that it was impossible to make the call because there were no placebo control groups. This was a common failing of studies at this time but ECT researchers had a genuine excuse. Because of the frequent fractures of the spine and other injuries, a disguisable placebo was impossible.</p><p> 我认为发生了什么是一个巨大的自然主义实验，证明了安慰剂的力量，包括在员工中创造积极的期望，并最终是患者。 20世纪40年代和50年代肯定看到了许多人从医院出院后从医院出院，有时在被监禁多年后，甚至几十年。鉴于制度化的破坏性效果和恢复不可能的信念，这是一个非常重要的发展。但决定排放的人可能是同一决定管理等的人。 20世纪50年代的前两项研究实际上比较了没有收到的患者，因为非接受者或没有差异，所以没有收到的恢复率较低。虽然一些批评者对这项工作产生了问题，但事实是，由于没有安慰剂对照组，因此无法打电话。这是目前研究的常见失败，但研究人员有真正的借口。由于脊柱和其他伤害的频繁骨折，因此无法辨认的安慰剂是不可能的。</p><p> In the early 1950s, muscle relaxants and general anaesthesia were introduced, making it possible to evaluate this new ‘modified ECT’ by comparing it with control groups rendered unconscious by general anaesthesia but not given ECT (simulated ECT). The first such study, in 1953, in which it was hoped that neither psychiatrists nor patients knew who received ECT, found no difference in outcome between the two groups. By now, ‘anti-psychotic’ drugs were replacing ECT as the treatment of choice for ‘schizophrenia’, and ECT proponents were transferring their attention to depression. In 1959, the first placebo-controlled trial that included depressed patients found no significant difference between ECT and simulated ECT, for depression or ‘schizophrenia’.</p><p> 在20世纪50年代初期，引入了肌肉松弛剂和全身麻醉，使得可以通过将其与一般麻醉无意识的对照组进行比较来评估这种新的“改性的等”，但未给予ECT（模拟ECT）。在1953年，首先是这样的研究，希望精神病学家和患者都知道谁接受了被接受的，发现两组之间的结果没有差异。到目前为止，'反精神病毒性的药物正在取代ECT作为“精神分裂症”的选择，而ECT支持者将注意力转移到抑郁症。 1959年，包括抑郁症患者的第一次安慰剂对照试验在抑郁症或“精神分裂症”中，ECT和模拟ECT之间没有显着差异。</p><p> Meanwhile, researchers were documenting harm. In 1946, a review called ‘The Brain Changes Associated with Electrical Shock Treatment’ in the  Lancet reported extensive haemorrhaging in multiple parts of the brain. Although not willing to conclude that the changes were all ECT-related, the reviewer cited the autopsy findings of a 57-year-old man who had died  90 minutes after his  13th shock: ‘In the frontal and temporal lobes were several small areas of devastation, entirely devoid of ganglion cells … Diffuse degeneration of the nerve cells in the cortex was present.’</p><p> 同时，研究人员造成了危害。 1946年，综动症中的综述称为“与电击处理相关的大脑变化”报告了大脑多个部分的广泛出血。虽然不愿意得出结论，这些变化都与之相关，但审稿人引用了一个57岁男子的尸检调查结果，他在第13次震惊后90分钟死亡：'在额外的裂片中是几个小区域毁灭性，完全没有神经节细胞......存在皮质中神经细胞的弥漫性退化。</p><p> A review of the first  20 years of autopsies concluded: ‘damage to the brain, sometimes reversible but often irreversible, occurred in the course of electric shock treatments’. As early as 1956, a ‘controlled study’ of people  over 65 had established that ECT accelerates senile dementia. As one early commentator pointed out: ‘given the extraordinarily sensitive electrochemical nature of the human brain, it is not difficult to realise the gross overkill of ECT … Electrical damage and destruction in some degree cannot be avoided.’</p><p> 对前20年的尸检的审查得出结论：'对大脑的损坏，有时可逆但经常不可逆转，发生在电击处理过程中。早在1956年，人们超过65岁的“受控研究”已经确定了ECT加速老年痴呆症。作为一个早期评论员指出：'鉴于人类大脑的非常敏感的电化学性质，它不难实现ECT的总跨度......在某种程度上无法避免电气损坏和破坏。 </p><p> The idea that ECT causes brain damage was so obvious to the early proponents that they incorporated it into an explanation for how ECT worked. In 1941, the American physician Walter Freeman, best-known for championing lobotomies, wrote of ECT:</p><p>ECT导致脑损伤的想法对于早期的支持者来说是如此明显，因为他们将其纳入了如何努力的解释。 1941年，美国医师沃尔特弗里曼，为冠军障碍而最为符合ECT的作品：</p><p> The greater the damage, the more likely the remission of psychotic symptoms … Maybe it will be shown that a mentally ill patient can think more clearly and more constructively with less brain in actual operation.</p><p> 损害越大，精神病症状的缓解越多......也许会表明，精神病患者可以在实际操作中较少地思考较少的大脑。</p><p>   There have to be organic changes … for the cure to take place … I think that it may be true that these people have for the time being at any rate more intelligence than they can handle and that the reduction in intelligence is an important factor in the curative process.</p><p>   必须有有机变化......对于治疗来解决......我认为这些人可能需要比他们可以处理的更多智力，并且智力的减少是一个重要因素治疗过程。</p><p> The idea that brain damage can be good seems bizarre to me. Nevertheless, variations and extensions on the theme persist in the  21st century. A  study in Scotland in 2012 found that ECT reduces the ‘functional connectivity’ of the brain. Instead of cautioning against ECT because of this damage, the authors claimed that this was evidence to support the theory that the brains of depressed people have ‘hyperconnectivity’ and that ECT corrects this. Some psychiatrists in the Netherlands are even  arguing that ECT can, and should, be used to target and erase painful memories.</p><p> 脑损伤可能好的想法似乎是奇怪的。然而，在21世纪，主题的变化和延长持续存在。 2012年苏格兰的一项研究发现，ECT降低了大脑的“功能连接”。作者声称这是支持抑郁症的大脑有“超级连接”的理论，而不是警告ECT，而不是警惕，而不是警惕，而不是证据。荷兰的一些精神科医生甚至可以争论ECT可以，应该用来瞄准和抹去痛苦的回忆。</p><p>  As I learned in that New York hospital all those years ago, almost everyone experiences some combination of confusion, headaches, nausea and aching muscles immediately after an ECT. This typically wears off within an hour. However, most also experience some memory gaps, usually for the period immediately prior to the treatment. Some lose life memories from months or years before the treatment (‘retrograde amnesia’) and/or have difficulty retaining new information (‘anterograde amnesia’). The Royal College of Psychiatrists (2020) informs the public that:</p><p>  正如我在那些年前在那个纽约医院那里了解到的那样，几乎每个人都经历了不同之后的混乱，头痛，恶心和肌肉的某种组合。这通常在一个小时内磨损。然而，大多数人也经历了一些内存差距，通常在治疗前立即的时期。一些待遇前几个月或几年的一些失去生活回忆（'逆行艾尼西亚'）和/或难以保留新信息（'onterograde Amnesia'）。皇家精神科医生（2020年）通知公众：</p><p> A small number of patients report gaps in their memory about events in their life that happened before they had ECT. This tends to affect memories of events that occurred during, or shortly before, the depression started. Sometimes these memories return fully or partially, but sometimes these gaps can be permanent.</p><p> 少数患者报告他们在他们生命中发生的事件的记忆中的空白。这往往会影响在抑郁症期间或短暂的事件的记忆，抑郁症开始。有时这些存储器完全或部分返回，但有时这些差距可能是永久性的。</p><p> Sadly, the ECT community hasn’t been sufficiently concerned about long-term damage to establish just how many suffer permanent memory losses. But it is not ‘a small number’.</p><p> 遗憾的是，自然界社区并没有足够关注长期损害，以确定有多少遭受永久性记忆损失。但这不是“少数”。 </p><p> One  review identified four studies of memory loss lasting at least six months and described by patients as ‘persistent or permanent’. They found a range of  29 to  55 per cent, and a weighted average of  38 per cent. The most rigorous  study to date was conducted in 2007 by the ECT proponent Harold Sackeim, professor of psychiatry and radiology at Columbia University in New York. Six months after ECT, retrograde amnesia, overall, was much worse than pre-ECT levels. Importantly, the degree of impairment was related to the number of ECTs received. Women and older people were disproportionately impaired. The memory loss was also greater among those who received bilateral ECT (where the electrodes are placed on either side of the head) rather than unilateral ECT (where they are both placed on the same side, thereby protecting half of the brain). Our recent  review placed persistent or permanent gaps in life memories, including of weddings and birthdays, somewhere between  12 and  55 per cent.</p><p>一篇审查确定了四项记忆损失研究持续至少六个月，并被患者描述为“持久性或永久”。他们发现了29％至55％的范围，加权平均为38％。迄今为止，纽约哥伦比亚大学精神病学和放射学教授的ECT Proponent Harold Sackeim在2007年进行了最严格的研究。 ECT六个月后，总体而言，逆行艾尼西亚比预应前的水平差得多。重要的是，损害程度与收到的等人数有关。妇女和老年人不成比例受损。在接收双边等（其中电极放置在头部的两侧）而不是单侧等（它们都放置在同一侧，它们均放置在同一侧）中，内存损耗也更大。我们最近的评论在生活中持续或永久性差距，包括婚礼和生日，在12到55％之间。</p><p> ECT proponents often argue that memory loss following ECT for depression is caused by the depression not the ECT. A  review concluded that: ‘There is no evidence of a correlation between impaired memory/cognition after ECT and impaired mood, much less a causal relationship.’ Furthermore, if the depression is the cause for memory loss, how do they explain the persisting memory loss after depression has been treated with ECT?</p><p> ECT支持者通常认为抑郁症后的记忆损失是由抑郁症引起的。审查得出结论：“没有证据表明在被外包和情绪受损后的记忆/认知之间存在相关性，这减少了因果关系。”此外，如果抑郁症是内存损失的原因，它们如何解释持久的记忆抑郁症患者损失已被另外治疗？</p><p> Either way, ECT advocates dispute that the long-lasting memory loss observed constitutes ‘brain damage’. Instead, they point to brain-scan studies showing no obvious signs of damage. Critics like me  point to other studies identifying cellular, microvascular and neuronal damage invisible on a scan.</p><p> 无论哪种方式，倡导争议的争议认为观察到的长期记忆损失构成“脑损伤”。相反，他们指向脑扫描研究，显示没有明显的损坏迹象。批评者，如我指向识别细胞，微血管和神经元损伤的其他研究在扫描中。</p><p> Whether or not we call the memory loss ‘brain damage’, it’s easy to find hundreds of personal accounts of incapacitating levels of disruption to people’s lives. In correspondence, one woman recently wrote:</p><p> 无论我们是否称之为记忆损失的“脑损伤”，很容易找到对人们生活中断的持续破坏程度的数百个个人账户。在通信中，一个女人最近写道：</p><p> Today I resent myself for agreeing to receive ECT. My long-term memory was destroyed. Memories of childhood friends, memories of major events I attended, memories of my training as a psychiatric registrar, academic memories, etc. I started struggling with simple spelling and calculations. I basically cannot recall an almost entire three years (2004-06), including the relationship I was in at the time. I never told colleagues about this, as I felt ashamed. But I started talking to other people who had ECT and realised I am not alone.</p><p> 今天，我怨恨自己同意收到等。我的长期记忆被摧毁了。童年朋友的回忆，我参加的主要活动记忆，我作为精神病学家，学术记忆等的培训回忆，我开始与简单的拼写和计算挣扎。我基本上不能记得几乎整整三年（2004-06），包括当时的关系。我从来没有告诉同事，因为我感到羞耻。但我开始与其他人的人交谈并意识到我并不孤单。</p><p> What about lethal consequences? The Royal College of Psychiatrists holds that ‘death caused by ECT is extremely rare’. The American Psychiatric Association reports one death per 10,000 ECT recipients, which they argue is on a par with minor operations involving general anaesthesia. But this assessment ignores the fact that, on average, the patient is about to undergo about 10 such procedures. One of the leading causes of death from ECT is cardiovascular failure. A recent  review of  82 studies, including more than  100,000 patients, found that one in  50 patients experience ‘major adverse cardiac events’.</p><p> 致命后果怎么样？皇家精神科医生认为，“被异国造成的死亡极为罕见”。美国精神病协会报告每10,000个受助人的一次死亡，他们争辩于涉及全身麻醉的次要行动。但这种评估忽略了一个事实，平均而言，患者即将发生大约10个此类程序。从被ect的死亡原因之一是心血管失败。最近对82项研究的综述，包括超过10,000名患者，发现50名患者体验中的一个主要不利心脏事件'。</p><p> At a staff meeting in my very first job as a clinical psychologist in the UK, I raised the issue of a man who had died on the ECT table the day before. I still recall the exact response of the psychiatrist: ‘That is none of your business and I am personally insulted by your insinuation that we killed him.’ When I pointed out that the man’s notes included ‘ECT contraindicated – serious heart condition’, I was evicted from the meeting – physically. A colleague and I had copied that page of the notes, accurately predicting that it would quickly be removed from the file. I tried for two years to get the hospital, professional and governmental authorities to investigate. I failed.</p><p> 在我第一份临床心理学家在英国的一份工作人员会议上，我提出了一个在前一天在桌子上死去的男人的问题。我仍然记得精神科医生的确切反应：“这不关你的事，我个人侮辱了你杀死他的罪名。从会议中被驱逐 - 身体上。同事和我已复制了笔记的页面，准确地预测它将快速从文件中删除。我试过两年的时间来获得医院，专业政府当局进行调查。我失败了。 </p><p> I have been involved with the publication of several  reviews of the research literature about whether ECT works. All have  found weak evidence that, when compared with a placebo, ECT has been shown to create a temporary lift in mood for a minority of patients, but that there’s no evidence of any benefits beyond the end of the course of treatments, and no evidence that ECT prevents suicide.</p><p>我参与了关于ECT工作的研究文献的几次审查。所有这些都发现了弱的证据，与安慰剂相比，ECT被证明为少数患者创造了一种临时电梯，但没有证据表明在治疗过程结束之外，没有证据这种被防止自杀。</p><p> In the  83 years since Cerletti administered the first treatment in Rome, there have only ever been  11 studies comparing ECT for depression (its target group for the past  60 years) with a placebo group receiving simulated-ECT (S-ECT). Four out of these 11 found that, in the short-term, ECT is statistically superior to S-ECT; five found no difference; and two found mixed results (in one of which the psychiatrists’ ratings produced a difference but the patients’ ratings did not). The only difference found beyond the end of the last treatment was one  study that found the S-ECT group to be faring better than the real ECT group one month after the treatments had ended.</p><p> 在83年以来，由于Cerletti在罗马进行第一次治疗后，只有11项研究比较抑郁症（过去60年靶群）的研究，接受模拟 -  ECT（S-ECT）。在这11中有四个发现，在短期内，ECT在统计上优于S-ECT;五个发现没有区别;两个发现的混合结果（精神科医生的评级中的一个差异产生了差异，但患者的评级没有）。在最后一次治疗结束时发现的唯一差异是一项研究，发现S-ECT组比治疗结束后的一个月比真实的群体更好。</p><p> What seems amazing is that the most recent of these  11 studies was  conducted in 1985. So, despite the unimpressive and inconclusive outcomes of the first  11 studies, and the obvious dangers of this highly controversial treatment, psychiatry has made no attempt to determine whether it works, with a placebo-controlled study, for the past  36 years.</p><p> 似乎惊人的是，这11项研究中的最近11项研究是在1985年进行的。因此，尽管前11项研究的不抑郁和不确定的结果，并且这种高度争议的治疗的明显危险，但精神病学已经没有试图确定它是否确定在过去的36年里，有一个安慰剂对照的研究。</p><p> This becomes even more alarming when one understands just how methodologically inadequate the first  11 studies were. Their average sample size (counting both groups) was just 37. None are definitely double-blind studies, in which neither the patients nor the raters know who is in which group. Five report only some of their findings and omit others. Only four report any ratings by patients, and none have any ‘quality of life’ measures.</p><p> 当一个人理解的方法表现如何不足，这变得更加令人惊叹。它们的平均样本大小（计数两个组）仅为37.没有绝对是双盲的研究，其中患者和评估者都不知道谁在哪个组。五个报告只有一些发现并省略他人。只有四次报告患者的任何评级，没有任何“生活质量”措施。</p><p>  There have, meanwhile, been many studies comparing different types of ECT and comparing ECT with antidepressants, which are different questions than ‘Does ECT work?’ Our  review of these kinds of studies between 2009 and 2016 concluded:</p><p>  同时，有许多研究比较了不同类型的ECT并与抗抑郁​​药进行比较，这些抗抑郁药比“有效的问题”是不同的问题吗？我们对2009年至2016年之间的这些研究的审查得出结论：</p><p> Of the  91 studies, only two aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ECT. Both were severely flawed. None of the other 89 produced robust evidence that ECT is effective for depression, primarily because at least  60 per cent maintained ECT participants on medication and  89 per cent produced no meaningful follow-up data beyond the end of treatment. No studies investigated whether ECT prevents suicide.</p><p> 在91项研究中，只有两个旨在评估ECT的功效。两者都受到严重缺陷。另外89个产生的强大证据表明ECT对抑郁症有效，主要是因为至少60％的药物维持药物的参与者，89％的人在治疗结束时没有产生有意义的后续数据。没有研究调查了ECT是否防止自杀。</p><p> In fact, the ECT research literature as a whole has, from the outset, been of remarkably poor quality. For example, of the more than  200 ECT studies about schizophrenia between 1955 to 1960, only 10 were ‘considered acceptable’ with  regards to meeting the minimal requirements of valid and reliable research. Four decades later, the UK ECT Review Group (2003)  reported that only 73 of 624 studies  (12 per cent) had met their standards for inclusion in their review, and that the ‘quality of reporting’ of the  12 per cent was ‘poor’. For example, a  study in the flagship  British Journal of Psychiatry claimed that the proportions showing at least ‘moderate improvement’ were: depression,  100 per cent; schizophrenia,  97.6 per cent. The entire methodology section describing how improvement was measured was just six words long: ‘A record was kept of progress.’</p><p> 事实上，从一开始就有一个完整的研究文献，质量非常差。例如，在1955年至1960年之间的有关精神分裂症的200多种研究中，对于满足有效和可靠的研究的最小要求，只有10个“被认为是可接受”。四十年后，英国“2003年”审查小组（2003年）报告称，只有624项研究中只有73名（12％）达到了他们的审查标准，而12％的“报告质量”是“穷人” '。例如，旗舰英国精神病学杂志的一项研究声称，表现至少“中等改善”的比例是：抑郁症，100％;精神分裂症，97.6％。整个方法部分描述了如何测量改善的时间只是六个词长期：“记录是一直在进行的。” </p><p> However, this body of literature, or at least those studies with a placebo group, most definitely did teach us something. We learned that some people who are given ECT feel better, though usually not because of the electric shocks or the seizures, but because of the extra attention and kindness shown to them by the nurses, doctors, anaesthetists and other staff, and because of the hope instilled by the expectation of all those staff that what was about to happen to them would, indeed, make them feel better.  Placebo is Latin for ‘I shall be pleasing.’</p><p>然而，这个文献的身体，或至少有安慰剂组的研究，最肯定地教我们一些东西。我们了解到，一些人被赋予的人感觉更好，但通常不是因为电击或癫痫发作，而是因为护士，医生，麻醉师和其他工作人员向他们展示了额外的关注和善良，而且因为希望灌输所有这些工作人员的期望，即将发生在他们身上的事情，实际上让他们感觉更好。安慰剂是拉丁语的'我会愉悦。'</p><p>  It could very well be that the primary therapeutic agent is the psychological meaning of the treatment to the patient … The influence of the unusual amount of care and attention which all receive could be studied further.</p><p>  它很可能是初级治疗剂是对患者治疗的心理意义......可以进一步研究所有接受的不寻常的护理和注意力的影响。</p><p> A  review focusing just on the placebo response with ECT found ‘an unexpectedly high rate of response in the sham groups’ and concluded: ‘The modern ECT practitioner should be aware that placebo effects are commonly at play.’ Some of the positive outcomes from psychotherapy are due to placebo effects. I have encouraged two generations of clinical psychologists to always instil a bit of hope and some (realistic) positive expectations, especially in a first session. It works. Have you never felt a little bit b</p><p> 一篇审查，专注于安慰剂反应的反应发现“假群”中的意外的高响应率并得出结论：“现代ECT从业者应该意识到安慰剂效应通常在剧中。”心理治疗的一些积极成果是由于安慰剂效应。我鼓励两代临床心理学家始终灌输一点希望，一些（现实）积极的期望，特别是在第一届会议上。有用。你从来没有感受到有点b</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-electroshock-therapy-still-a-mainstay-of-psychiatry">https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-electroshock-therapy-still-a-mainstay-of-psychiatry</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/静电/">#静电</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/therapy/">#therapy</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/ect/">#ect</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
