[1]  [2]</p><p>跳转到导航跳转到搜索mari马里斯坦（波斯语：波斯语：بيمارستان，bīmārestān；阿拉伯语：بِيْمَارِسْتَان，bīmāristān），也被称为dar al-shifa（在土耳其语中也是darüşşifa），或者简称为maristan，是一家医院。 [1] [2]</p><p>   Bimaristan is a  Persian word ( بیمارستان  bīmārestān) meaning &#34;hospital&#34;, with  bimar- from  Middle Persian (Pahlavi) of  vīmār or  vemār, meaning &#34;sick&#34; or &#34;ill person&#34; plus   -stan as location and place suffix.  [1]</p><p>   Bimaristan是波斯语单词（بیمارستانbīmārestān）的意思是“医院”，bimar-来自中波斯语（Pahlavi）中的vīmār或vemār，意思是“患病”或“病人”，加-stan表示位置和后缀。 [1]</p><p> In  English literature, the term is often used to designate the historical or pre-modern institutions that existed in the Islamic world, but they are also still used sometimes in their native languages to refer to modern hospitals or to specific types of medical institutions.  [3]</p><p> 在英语文学中，该术语通常用于表示伊斯兰世界中存在的历史或前现代机构，但有时仍有时以其母语使用它们来指代现代医院或特定类型的医疗机构。 [3]</p><p>  Islamic hospitals served many purposes. Bimaristans served the purpose of being a designated place where medical treatment would be given to individuals in need. Along with being a central place for medical treatment to be given, Islamic hospitals also served the purpose of being a designated place where recovering individuals could go to help gain back their strength. The individuals were typically recovering from accidents as well as sicknesses.  [1]</p><p>  伊斯兰医院有许多目的。 Bimaristans的目的是成为指定的地方，向需要帮助的人提供医疗服务。伊斯兰医院不仅是提供医疗服务的中心，而且还旨在成为康复者可以用来帮助恢复体力的指定场所。个人通常从事故和疾病中恢复。 [1]</p><p> Most Islamic hospitals did not discriminate on who could be a patient; even wealthy individuals used the bimaristans when they became ill when traveling instead of an outpatient facility or home care.  [1] Islamic hospitals were able to care for many diverse people who all had unique accidents, illnesses, injuries, and needs due to the different sections within the bimaristans. Patients were divided into these different sections based on their needs.  [4] Patients were also divided up to minimize the risk of spreading illnesses to other patients.  [4] Not only were Islamic hospitals used to provide care for individuals, they were also used to advance medical students’ knowledge in the  medical field, especially the most well-known bimaristans located in  Baghdad,  Damascus, and  Cairo.  [4] Islamic hospitals, books, and  apprenticeships are the main three ways medical students learned different types of medical information to make tremendous advances in Islamic Medicine.  [4]</p><p> 大多数伊斯兰医院并没有歧视谁可以成为病人。甚至有钱人在旅行时生病时也使用了bimaristans，而不是使用门诊设施或家庭护理。 [1]伊斯兰医院能够照顾到许多不同的人，由于两栖动物不同的地区，他们都有独特的事故，疾病，受伤和需求。根据需要将患者分为这些不同的部分。 [4]还对患者进行了划分，以最大程度地减少将疾病传播给其他患者的风险。 [4]伊斯兰医院不仅被用来为个人提供护理，还被用来提高医学生在医学领域的知识，特别是位于巴格达，大马士革和开罗的最著名的比马里斯坦人。 [4]伊斯兰医院，书籍和学徒制是医科学生学习不同类型医学信息以在伊斯兰医学领域取得巨大进步的主要三种方式。 [4]</p><p> Islamic hospitals can best be understood by being viewed as a  philanthropy because they gave  public assistance to individuals who needed care.  [5] Bimaristans were able to provide these services at no costs due to   waqfs, which were endowments that paid for the costs of creating bimaristans as well as maintaining them .  [2]</p><p> 伊斯兰医院可以被视为慈善机构，因此可以得到最好的理解，因为它们向需要护理的人提供了公共帮助。 [5]由于waqfs，Bimaristans能够免费提供这些服务，而waqfs是用于支付创建bimaristans和维持其费用的end赋。 [2]</p><p> Islamic hospitals were different from other hospitals because Muslims were led to form bimaristans by  Muhammad, who taught that God would not create a disease without creating a cure.  [6] Mobile hospitals were the first version of the bimaristans.  [6] According to tradition, the first mobile hospital was located in a tent to treat war victims from the Battle of the Ditch (627 CE).  [6] Mobile Hospitals consisted of medications, food and water, doctors, and pharmacists to aid the patients.  [6] These services from the mobile hospital transitioned into the other Islamic hospitals that were built as well. Bimaristans were generally located in urban areas.  [1] Though the Islamic realm was very large,  Baghdad,  Damascus, and  Cairo housed the most well-known Islamic hospitals.  [1] The first six bimaristans show major changes within Islamic hospitals in a short period of time.  [5] The first bimaristan, built in 706 in  Damascus by the  Umayyad Caliph named  Al-Walid, focused on treating individuals with  leprosy.  [1]  [5] Around the same period the second bimaristan was built in  Cairo.  [5] The third and fourth Islamic hospitals were built in  Baghdad.  [5] The third bimaristan was built in 805 by Caliph Harun al-Rashid.  [1] This Islamic hospital in  Baghdad was the first documented general hospital.  [1]</p><p> 伊斯兰医院与其他医院不同，因为穆罕默德领导穆斯林组成了比马里安人，他们教导说上帝不创造疗法就不会制造疾病。 [6]流动医院是两栖动物的第一个版本。 [6]根据传统，第一所流动医院位于帐篷中，以治疗沟渠之战（公元627年）的战争受害者。 [6]流动医院由药物，食物和水，医生和药剂师组成，以帮助患者。 [6]这些来自流动医院的服务也过渡到其他也建造的伊斯兰医院。 Bimaristans通常位于市区。 [1]尽管伊斯兰教的领域很大，但巴格达，大马士革和开罗还是最著名的伊斯兰医院。 [1]前六个Bimaristans在短时间内显示出伊斯兰医院内部的重大变化。 [5]第一个两栖动物，由乌马亚德·哈里发于706年在大马士革建造，名为Al-Walid，致力于治疗麻风病患者。 [1] [5]大约在同一时期，在开罗建造了第二座两栖马里斯坦。 [5]第三和第四家伊斯兰医院在巴格达建造。 [5]第三个两栖动物由哈里发·哈伦·拉希德（805）建造。 [1]这家位于巴格达的伊斯兰医院是第一家有据可查的综合医院。 [1]</p><p> Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi,  Hunayn ibn Ishaq,  Ibn Sina (Avicenna),  Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal,  Ibn al-Nafis, and  Mir Mu’min Husayni Tunikabuni were all students that trained at Islamic hospitals in order to advance their knowledge in the medical field.  [4] These students were key players in the advancement of bimaristans because of contributions to Islamic Medicine from their observations and writings.  [4]  Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi was an Islam philosopher, physician, and  alchemist, who trained well in the Greek science and is known for his  Comprehensive Book of Medicine.  [4]  Hunayn ibn Ishaq was viewed as a mediator between Greek sciences and Arabs due to his translations of multiple documents that were tremendously important.  [2]  Hunayn ibn Ishaq was also an  optometrist.  [4]  Avicenna was a physician as well as a government official.  [4] The   Canon of Medicine constructed by  Avicenna systemized medicine logically.  [4] Like  Hunayn ibn Ishaq,  Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal was also an  optometrist, who classified more than one hundred diseases of the eyes.  [4]  Ibn al-Nafis was also a physician and an author,  [2] most known for his commentary on  pulmonary circulation.  [4] Lastly,  Mir Mu’min Husayni Tunikabuni focused on how yogic breath control can control the humours.  [4] While all of these people did many different things, they all contributed to advancements in medicine.</p><p>Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi，Hunayn ibn Ishaq，Ibn Sina（Avicenna），Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal，Ibn al-Nafis和Mir Mu'min Husayni Tunikabuni都是在伊斯兰医院接受培训以提高知识水平的学生在医学领域。 [4]这些学生是Bimaristans进步的主要参与者，因为他们的观察和著作对伊斯兰医学做出了贡献。 [4]穆罕默德·本·扎卡里亚·拉齐（Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi）是一位伊斯兰哲学家，医师和炼金术士，在希腊科学领域受过良好的训练，并以《医学综合手册》而著称。 [4] Hunayn ibn Ishaq被认为是希腊科学和阿拉伯人之间的调解人，因为他翻译了许多非常重要的文件。 [2] Hunayn ibn Ishaq还是验光师。 [4] Avicenna既是医生又是政府官员。 [4]由阿维森纳（Avicenna）建立的医学佳能在逻辑上将医学系统化。 [4]与Hunayn ibn Ishaq一样，Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal也是视光师，他对一百多种眼病进行了分类。 [4]伊本·纳菲斯（Ibn al-Nafis）还是一名医生和作家，[2]以对肺循环的评论而闻名。 [4]最后，米尔·穆敏（Mu Mu'min Husayni Tunikabuni）着重介绍了如何通过瑜伽呼吸控制来控制幽默感。 [4]尽管这些人都做了许多不同的事情，但他们都为医学进步做出了贡献。</p><p>   There is evidence that the beginning of the human study of medicine was around 3500 B.C.E.  [7] Religious priests and medicine men were the first medical practitioners. In ancient  Mesopotamia, c. 3500 B.C.E., there were two kinds of medicine men–the &#34; ashipu&#34; who diagnosed the disease or injury, and the &#34;asu&#34; who practiced healing medicine and was practiced in herbal remedies.  [7] Practices in this early period included bandaging and making plasters for wounds. Although many patients were treated in their home, the first houses of medicine were often placed near rivers, so the evil substances and spirits would be washed away.  [7] This tradition continues into the Greek and Roman periods, both societies placing their centers of healing near the ocean, a river or spring. Temples to gods and goddesses of healing were often used as healing centers, with spiritual and scientific remedies practiced there.  [7]</p><p>   有证据表明，人类对医学的研究始于公元前3500年左右。 [7]宗教牧师和医务人员是第一批医生。在古代美索不达米亚，c。公元前3500年，有两种医务人员：诊断疾病或受伤的“ ashipu”和实践治愈医学并以草药治疗的“ asu”。 [7]在此早期阶段的做法包括包扎绷带和制作伤口膏药。尽管许多患者在家中接受治疗，但第一批药房经常被放置在河流附近，因此恶物和精神将被冲走。 [7]这种传统一直延续到希腊和罗马时期，两个社会都将其康复中心置于海洋，河流或泉水附近。神殿和疗养女神经常被用作疗养中心，并在那里实行精神和科学疗法。 [7]</p><p> Ancient Indian medicine, or the  Vedic tradition, encouraged the balance of body, mind and spirit between 3000 B.C.E. to about 800 B.C.E. They had knowledge of surgery and even the beginnings of plastic surgery were founded here.  [7]</p><p> 古老的印度医学或吠陀的传统在公元前3000年之间促进了身体，思想和精神的平衡。到公元前800年他们具有外科知识，甚至在这里也开始了整容手术。 [7]</p><p> Ancient Egyptian medicine was quite advanced for c. 2500 B.C.E. They had a solid understanding of anatomy because human dissection did not have the taboo much later Christian societies experienced.  [7] There are a few medical texts that have been preserved to the present that help us understand the medical practices of ancient Egypt. The  Edwin-Smith papyrus, written c. 17th century B.C.E. and probably based on much older knowledge, is a text on trauma surgery.  [7] It is suspected to be written based on military battles and battle wounds. Most medical practitioners were literate and often priests.  [7] Once again, there is a connection between gods and medicine – the earliest recorded physician was  Imhotep, who lived c. 2725 B.C.E., and who was later lauded as a deity and called the god of medicine and healing.  [7] The practice of combining religious centers and medical centers was continued through the Greek and Roman periods, as well as into the medical practices of Muslims and Christians.</p><p> 古埃及医学对于c来说相当先进公元前2500年他们对解剖学有扎实的理解，因为人类解剖学并没有在后来的基督教社会中成为禁忌。 [7]目前保存了一些医学文献，可以帮助我们了解古埃及的医学实践。埃德温·史密斯的纸莎草纸，写成c。公元前17世纪可能基于更古老的知识，是有关创伤手术的文章。 [7]怀疑是根据军事战斗和战斗伤痕写的。大多数医生是有文化的，经常是牧师。 [7]再次，神与医学之间存在联系-最早记录的医师是伊姆霍特普，他活着c。公元前2725年，他后来被称赞为神灵，被称为医学和治愈之神。 [7]在希腊和罗马时期，以及在穆斯林和基督教徒的医疗实践中，继续存在着将宗教中心和医疗中心合并的做法。</p><p> These  ascelpia took the environment of their grounds into account as well as their healing rituals. Most of the ascelpia were centered on a spring or a fountain and were near a gymnasium or theater.  [8] This was encouraged by the medicine at the time, which focused on balance of the whole person, both of body and mind. There were no official schools of medicine at the time, most practitioners learned their art through apprenticeships or assisting a practitioner.  [8] Even after the Christian conversion of  Constantine, the Askelpian cult continued their practices and rituals well into the fourth century CE. Towards the end of the century, Theodosius outlawed any pagan traditions and the cult finally died.  [9]</p><p> 这些天蝎座考虑了他们所处环境以及他们的康复习惯。大多数天文望远镜都集中在泉水或喷泉上，并且靠近体育馆或剧院。 [8]这在当时的药物中得到了鼓励，该药物专注于整个人的身心平衡。当时还没有官方的医学院，大多数从业者都是通过学徒制或协助从业者来学习艺术的。 [8]即使在基督教君士坦丁ine依之后，阿斯凯尔比派的邪教仍继续其习俗和礼节进入公元四世纪。到本世纪末，狄奥多西修斯（Theodosius）取缔了任何异教徒的传统，该邪教终于死了。 [9]</p><p> After the Christening of Constantine, as well as the influx of refugees into cities as populations grew and land did not, the church became the center for healing. The term xendocheia began to be used, which came to mean a hostel for the poor.  [9] Bishops became known as spiritual healers, or physicians of the soul.  [9] One such bishop who was associated with an institution of healing was  Saint Basil of Caesarea. Saint Basil built a hostel for the poor and the ill and placed it in the care of a monastery.  [9] It is described by fifth century historian Sozomen as “a storehouse of piety where disease is regarded in a religious light and sympathy put to the test.”  [9] Similar to the Askelpian cults, the idea of healing through incubation (sleeping in the temple) was also practiced under Christian empires. Patients would sleep in specific rooms that housed relics of a saint and hoped for the saint to appear in their dreams.  [9]</p><p> 君士坦丁堡洗礼仪式结束后，随着人口的增长和土地的流入，难民涌入城市，教堂成为了康复中心。开始使用xendocheia一词，这意味着为穷人提供旅馆。 [9]主教被称为精神治疗者或灵魂医师。 [9]凯撒利亚的圣巴西尔（Saint Basil）是一位与疗养院有关的主教。圣瓦西里（Saint Basil）为穷人和病人建造了一家旅馆，并将其放在修道院的照顾下。 [9]五世纪历史学家索佐门将其描述为“虔诚的仓库，在这种仓库中，人们从宗教的角度看待疾病，并对其进行了同情。” [9]与阿斯凯尔派的邪教类似，在基督教帝国中也实践了通过孵化（在庙里睡觉）进行康复的想法。患者会在容纳圣徒遗物的特定房间里睡觉，并希望圣徒出现在梦中。 [9]</p><p> The church was often charged with the care of the sick, although students were not allowed to study theology and medicine at the same time. Statute 590 stated that students of theology could not even reside in the same area as medical students, because “books of the craft of the world should not be read with books of holiness in one light.”  [9]</p><p> 尽管不允许学生同时学习神学和医学，但教会经常要负责照顾病人。 590号法令规定，神学学生甚至不能与医学生居住在同一地区，因为“世界手工艺品的书不应一目了然地与圣洁的书一起阅读。” [9]</p><p> These centers of health in antiquity helped shape the many new advances Muslim scholars would pursue in medicine.</p><p>这些古代的健康中心帮助塑造了穆斯林学者在医学上追求的许多新进步。</p><p> As for healing centers in the Islamic world, the first bimaristans were mobile centers that date back to the time of Muhammed. They were transported by beast of burden, primarily camels.  [6] Before there were major towns and cities, the mobile bimaristans were able to travel to patients and the remote areas of the region.  [6]</p><p> 至于伊斯兰世界的康复中心，最早的比马里斯坦人是可以追溯到穆罕默德时代的机动中心。他们是由野兽，主要是骆驼来运输的。 [6]在出现主要城镇之前，流动的bimaristans能够前往患者和该地区的偏远地区。 [6]</p><p>  As hospitals developed during the Islamic civilization, specific characteristics were maintained. For instance, Bimaristans served all people regardless of their race, religion, citizenship, or gender.  [10] The  Waqf documents stated nobody was ever to be turned away.  [11] The ultimate goal of all physicians and hospital staff was to work together to help the well-being of their patients.  [11] There was no time limit a patient could spend as an inpatient;  [12] the Waqf documents stated the hospital was required to keep all patients until they were fully recovered.  [10] Men and women were admitted to separate but equally equipped wards.  [10]  [11] The separate wards were further divided into mental disease, contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and eye disease.  [11]  [12] Patients were attended to by same sex nurses and staff.  [12] Each hospital contained a lecture hall, kitchen, pharmacy, library, mosque and occasionally a chapel for Christian patients.  [12]  [13] Recreational materials and musicians were often employed to comfort and cheer patients up.  [12]</p><p>  随着医院在伊斯兰文明时期的发展，特定的特征得以保留。例如，比马里斯坦人不分种族，宗教，公民身份或性别，为所有人服务。 [10] Waqf文件指出，没有人会被拒绝。 [11]所有医生和医院工作人员的最终目标是共同努力，以帮助他们的患者福祉。 [11]患者没有住院时间限制； [12] Waqf文件指出，医院必须保留所有患者，直到他们完全康复。 [10]男人和女人被接纳为分开但装备相同的病房。 [10] [11]分开的病房进一步分为精神病，传染病，非传染病，手术，药物和眼病。 [11] [12]患者由同性护士和工作人员照料。 [12]每家医院都设有一个演讲厅，厨房，药房，图书馆，清真寺，有时还设有一个基督教徒的小教堂。 [12] [13]经常使用娱乐材料和音乐家来安慰和振兴患者。 [12]</p><p> The hospital was not just a place to treat patients, it also served as a medical school to educate and train students.  [11] Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients and their medical treatment.  [11] Students were responsible in keeping these patient records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.  [12]</p><p> 医院不仅是一个治疗病人的地方，而且还是一所医学院，对学生进行教育和培训。 [11]通过私人辅导，自学和讲座学习了基础科学的准备。伊斯兰医院是最早保留患者及其医疗记录的书面记录。 [11]学生负责保留这些患者记录，这些记录随后由医生编辑并在以后的治疗中参考。 [12]</p><p> During this era, physician licensure became mandatory in the  Abbasid Caliphate.  [12] In 931 AD, Caliph  Al-Muqtadir learned of the death of one of his subjects as a result of a physician&#39;s error.  [13] He immediately ordered his  muhtasib  Sinan ibn Thabit to examine and prevent doctors from practicing until they passed an examination.  [12]  [13] From this time on, licensing exams were required and only qualified physicians were allowed to practice medicine.  [12]  [13]</p><p> 在这个时代，阿巴斯王朝的医生必须获得执照。 [12]在公元931年，哈里发·穆克塔迪尔得知医生的错误导致他的一名受试者死亡。 [13]他立即下令他的多西他滨Sinan ibn Thabit检查并阻止医生执业，直到他们通过检查。 [12] [13]从那时起，需要进行许可考试，并且只有合格的医生才能进行医学治疗。 [12] [13]</p><p>  The first few Islamic hospitals that arose in Baghdad, in the early 9th century, were to quarantine those who suffered from leprosy. At first, it was considered by many as a &#34;leprosorium&#34; due to its limited purpose; nonetheless, these hospitals still salaried doctors whose specialties were not solely limited to leprosy.  [14] The function of these hospitals soon became diversified over time as newly built hospitals in Baghdad began to incorporate the knowledge from Islamic physicians, scientists such as  Al-Razi.  [15] Al-Razi&#39;s hospital in Baghdad, had 24 physicians on staff; these physicians had diverse specialties, including, physiologists, occultists, surgeons, and bonesetters.</p><p>  9世纪初期，在巴格达兴起的最初几家伊斯兰医院是隔离那些患有麻风病的人。起初，由于目的有限，它被许多人视为“ le”。尽管如此，这些医院仍在向其专业不仅仅限于麻风病的医生发薪。 [14]随着时间的推移，这些医院的功能很快变得多样化，因为在巴格达新建的医院开始吸收伊斯兰医生，如拉齐等科学家的知识。 [15]位于巴格达的Al-Razi医院拥有24名医生；这些医师具有多种专长，包括生理学家，神秘学家，外科医生和植骨师。</p><p> Madrasas, in  Islamic civilizations, were teaching institutions, some of which focussed on  medicine. These madrasas were often closely linked with  hospitals so that students could learn in the institutions and put their theoretical knowledge into practice in the hospitals.  [15] Physicians were not exclusively Muslim; practicing physicians included  Jews, and  Christians.  [16] In the major hospitals at  Cairo,  Baghdad, and  Damascus, students could visit patients often with the supervision of a practicing physician, in a system that is comparable to that of medical residents today.</p><p> 在伊斯兰文明中的马达拉斯（Madrasas）是教学机构，其中一些专注于医学。这些madrasas通常与医院紧密联系，以便学生可以在机构中学习并在医院中实践他们的理论知识。 [15]内科医生并不是专门穆斯林。执业医师包括犹太人和基督徒。 [16]在开罗，巴格达和大马士革的主要医院中，学生可以在与现今医疗居民相当的系统中，在执业医师的监督下经常拜访患者。</p><p> The greatest contribution of the Islamic hospitals was the structure itself and how it functioned in Islamic culture. The first documented general hospital (hospitals that treated a multitude of  pathologies, including mental illness) arose in Baghdad, in 805, built by vizier to the caliph,  Harun al-Rashid.  [15] Although not much is known about this hospital due to poor documentation, the system of the general hospital itself set forth an example for the many other hospitals to come. Soon after, 34 new hospitals were built throughout the Islamic world with the number increasing annually. Islamic hospitals were even the first to specialize in treating convicts as the prison population was continually increasing.  [17]</p><p>伊斯兰医院的最大贡献在于其结构本身及其在伊斯兰文化中的作用。 805年在巴格达兴起了第一家有记载的综合医院（治疗了包括精神疾病在内的多种疾病的医院），由哈里发哈里发哈里尔·拉希德（Harun al-Rashid）修建。 [15]尽管由于文献不多，人们对这家医院知之甚少，但综合医院本身的制度为以后的许多其他医院树立了榜样。此后不久，整个伊斯兰世界又建立了34家新医院，并且数量逐年增加。随着监狱人口的不断增加，伊斯兰医院甚至是最早专门治疗罪犯的医院。 [17]</p><p> Newly founded hospitals strived to be better than their preceding counterparts in the Islamic world. The purpose was to compete with European hospitals as well in order to attract more physicians and scholars. Many of these hospitals also contained a conjoined library typically filled with any possible writings that may be relevant to the medicine practiced in the hospitals.  [18]</p><p> 新成立的医院努力做到比伊斯兰世界以前的医院更好。目的是与欧洲医院竞争，以吸引更多的医生和学者。这些医院中的许多医院还包含一个联合图书馆，图书馆通常装有可能与医院所用药物有关的任何可能著作。 [18]</p><p>  In order to meet the demands of these specialties, Islamic hospitals were subdivided into departments for surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics, mental illness, and systemic diseases. The systemic disease department was designated for general illnesses that did not fall into categories of other departments.  [18] In some hospitals, they were further divided into subsections to address the needs of the patient depending on the symptoms. Examples include, but are not limited to, infections, fevers, and digestive issues. Hospital staff was not limited to physicians. Much like today&#39;s hospitals, they also relied on pharmacists, nurses, sanitary inspectors, supervising specialists, secretaries, and superintendents. The superintendents, or in Arabic, sa&#39;ur, ensured that hospitals met certain standards in addition to managing the entire hospital institution.  [18] Pharmacists produced drugs as means for treatment of the hospitals&#39; patients; they relied on a knowledge of  chemistry, or  Alchemia.  [18]</p><p>  为了满足这些专业的需求，将伊斯兰医院细分为外科，眼科，骨科，精神病和全身性疾病的科室。全身性疾病科被指定为不属于其他科目的普通疾病。 [18]在一些医院中，根据症状将它们进一步分为小节，以满足患者的需求。例子包括但不限于感染，发烧和消化问题。医院工作人员不仅限于医生。就像今天的医院一样，他们也依靠药剂师，护士，卫生检查员，监督专家，秘书和院长。院长（或用阿拉伯语sa'ur）确保医院除了管理整个医院机构外，还满足某些标准。 [18]药剂师生产药物来治疗医院的病人；他们依靠化学或炼金术的知识。 [18]</p><p> Before the 10th century, hospitals operated throughout the day and closed at night. Later hospitals operated on a 24-hour basis. Nonetheless, the practicing physicians worked a set number of hours with their salaries prescribed by law; the physicians were paid generously enough so as to retain their talent. Chief of staff physician,  Jabril ibn Bukhtishu, was salaried 4.9 million  Dirham; for comparison, a medical resident worked significantly longer hours salaried at 300 Dirham per month.  [18]</p><p> 十世纪之前，医院全天营业，而晚上则关闭。后来的医院全天24小时营业。尽管如此，执业医师按照法律规定的工资工作了一定的时间。医生们得到了足够的报酬，以保留他们的才能。主任医师Jabril ibn Bukhtishu的年薪为490万迪拉姆；相比之下，一名医疗工作者的工作时间明显更长，每月工资为300迪拉姆。 [18]</p><p> Islamic hospitals attained their endowment through charitable donations or bequests, called waqfs. The legal documents establishing a waqf also set forth rules for how the hospital should be organized and operate in relation to the patient, stating that anyone can be admitted irrespective of race, gender, or citizenship.  [17] Patients of all socioeconomic statuses would have had access to full treatment, that is, costs were borne by the hospital itself. An example was the  Al-Mansuri Hospital, in Cairo, built under the orders of the  Mameluke ruler of Egypt,  Al-Mansur Qalawun. Its maximum capacity was around 8000, and the annual endowment alone was said to be one-million Dirhams. The design was intended to accommodate various pathologies, for both men and women; as well as a pharmacy, a library, and lecture halls. The lecture halls were used for regular meetings on the status of the hospital, lecturing residents, and staff as well</p><p> 伊斯兰医院通过慈善捐赠或遗赠（waqfs）获得捐赠。建立工作场所质量法的法律文件还规定了有关患者医院的组织和运作方式的规则，指出无论种族，性别或公民身份，任何人都可以入院。 [17]所有社会经济地位的患者都将获得全面治疗，即费用由医院本身承担。一个例子是开罗的Al-Mansuri医院，该医院是在埃及Mameluke统治者Al-Mansur Qalawun的命令下建造的。它的最大容量约为8000，据称仅年度捐赠基金就达一百万迪拉姆。该设计旨在适应男性和女性的各种疾病。以及药房，图书馆和演讲厅。演讲厅被用来定期举行会议，讨论医院的状况，讲授居民和员工</p><p>    The existence of hospitals in  Baghdad has been documented since the 9th century CE, with the first having most likely been established by the vizier of caliph  Harun al-Rashid. By the end of the 10th century CE, five more hospitals had been built in Baghdad.  [1]</p><p>    自公元9世纪以来，已有文献记载巴格达有医院存在，最早的医院是哈里发哈伦·拉希德（Harun al-Rashid）的养眼者。到公元10世纪末，在巴格达又建立了五家医院。 [1]</p><p>  Among the most important of these was the Al-Adudi Hospital. The Al-Adudi Hospital was founded in 981 by the then ruler of Baghdad,  Adud al-Dawlah, and was also named after him. Within Baghdad, the Al-Adudi Hospital&#39;s location was decided upon by its administrator, Abu-Bakr al-Razi. He determined where it should be located by &#34;hanging a piece of meat in several places for a few days and deciding in favor of the place where meat was found to be least infected.&#34;  [19] Al-Razi eventually decided to build the hospital along the  Tigris River.  [19] At its inception, the Al-Adudi Hospital had twenty-five staff members, specializing in fields ranging from optics to surgery. In addition to these specialists, the Al-Adudi Hospital also served as a teaching hospital for new doctors. The Al-Adudi Hospital remained operational into the 12th century CE when, in 1184, it was described as &#34;...being like an enormous palace in size.&#34;  [1] Ultimately, the Al-Adudi Hospital was destroyed in 1258 by  Mongols led by  Hulagu Khan in the  siege of Baghdad.  [19]</p><p>  其中最重要的是Al-Adudi医院。 Al-Adudi医院由当时的巴格达统治者Adud al-Dawlah于981年建立，并以他的名字命名。在巴格达，Al-Adudi医院的位置由其管理员Abu-Bakr al-Razi决定。他通过“将一块肉在几个地方悬挂几天，然后决定发现肉被感染最少的地方”来确定应该在哪里放置肉。 [19] Al-Razi最终决定沿着底格里斯河建造医院。 [19] Al-Adudi医院成立之初只有25名工作人员，专门研究从光学到手术的各个领域。除了这些专家之外，Al-Adudi医院还充当了新医生的教学医院。 Al-Adudi医院一直运营到公元12世纪，1184年，医院被描述为“……像一座巨大的宫殿”。 [1]最终，Al-Adudi医院在1258年被Hulagu Khan领导的蒙古人在巴格达的包围中摧毁。 [19]</p><p>     One of the first Egyptian hospitals was the Al-Fustat Hospital, which was founded in 872 CE. It was founded by  Ahmed Ibn-Tulum and was so named because of its location within  Cairo. The Al-Fustat Hospital shared many common features with modern hospitals. Among these were bath houses separated by gender, separate wards and the safekeeping of personal items during a patient&#39;s convalescence.  [19]  [5] In addition to these practices, the Al-Fustat Hospital is the first to have offered treatment for mental disorders.  [1] Beyond the practice of medicine, the Al-Fustat Hospital was also a teaching hospital and housed approximately 100,000 books. The Al-Fustat Hospital remained in operation for approximately 600 years.  [19] Another key feature of the Al-Fustat Hospital was that it offered all treatment for free. This was made possible by waqf revenue, which the Al-Fustat Hospital was likely the first to have been endowed with.  [5] Near the Al-Fustat Hospital, Ibn-Tulum also established a pharmacy to provide medical care in emergencies.  [5]</p><p>最早的埃及医院之一是成立于872 CE的Al-Fustat医院。它由艾哈迈德·伊本·图卢姆（Ahmed Ibn-Tulum）创立，并因其在开罗的地理位置而得名。 Al-Fustat医院与现代医院具有许多共同之处。其中包括按性别分开的浴室，分开的病房以及在患者康复期间对个人物品的保管。 [19] [5]除这些做法外，Al-Fustat医院是第一家提供精神障碍治疗的医院。 [1]除了医学以外，Al-Fustat医院还是一家教学医院，约有100,000本书籍。 Al-Fustat医院运转了大约600年。 [19] Al-Fustat医院的另一个主要特点是它免费提供所有治疗。 waqf收入使这成为可能，而Al-Fustat医院很可能是第一个获得收入的医院。 [5]在Al-Fustat医院附近，Ibn-Tulum还建立了一家药店，在紧急情况下提供医疗服务。 [5]</p><p>   The Al-Mansuri Hospital was another hospital located in Cairo, and was completed in 1284 CE. Its founder,  Al-Mansur Qalawun, was inspired to establish a hospital after his own experience being hospitalized in  Damascus.  [19] Because of Al-Mansur&#39;s vision for the hospital, treatment was free to make the hospital accessible to both the rich and the poor. Furthermore, &#34;...upon discharge the patient was given food and money as a compensation for the wages he lost during his stay in the hospital.&#34;  [19] The Al-Mansuri Hospital was so accessible, in fact, that it treated roughly 4,000 patients every day. Like the Al-Fustat Hospital before it, the Al</p><p>   Al-Mansuri医院是位于开罗的另一家医院，于公元1284年建成。它的创始人Al-Mansur Qalawun经历了自己在大马士革住院的经历，受到启发，创办了一家医院。 [19]由于Al-Mansur对医院的愿景，治疗是免费的，使富人和穷人都可以进入医院。此外，“……出院后，患者获得了食物和金钱，以补偿他住院期间失去的工资。” [19] Al-Mansuri医院非常方便，实际上，它每天大约治疗4,000名患者。像之前的福斯塔医疗医院一样，</p><p>......</p><p>......</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimaristan#Al-Adudi_Hospital">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimaristan#Al-Adudi_Hospital</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/范围/">#范围</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/hospital/">#hospital</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/医院/">#医院</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
