Joel (who I greatly respect, and consider an asset to the data science community) was not involved in NumFOCUS’s action, was not told about it, and did not support it. NumFOCUS did not follow their own enforcement procedure and violated their own CoC, left me hanging for over a week not even knowing what I was accused of, and did not give me an opportunity to provide input before concluding their investigation. I repeatedly told their committee that my emotional resilience was low at the moment due to medical issues, which they laughed about and ignored, as I tried (unsuccessfully) to hold back tears. The process has left me shattered, and I won’t be able to accept any speaking requests for the foreseeable future. I support the thoughtful enforcement of Code of Conducts to address sexist, racist, and harassing behavior, but that is not what happened in this case.</p><p>摘要：NumFOCUS发现我违反了他们在JupyterCon的行为准则(CoC)，因为我的发言不是“友好的”，因为我说Joel Grus关于Jupyter Notebook不是一个好的软件开发环境的观点是“错误的”。Joel(我非常尊重他，认为他是数据科学界的资产)没有参与NumFOCUS的行动，没有被告知，也不支持它。NumFOCUS没有遵循他们自己的执法程序，违反了他们自己的COC，让我挂了一个多星期，甚至不知道我被指控了什么，也没有给我机会在结束他们的调查之前提供意见。我反复告诉他们的委员会，由于医疗问题，我的情绪弹性目前很低，他们对此嗤之以鼻，因为我试图忍住眼泪(但没有成功)，他们对此不屑一顾。这个过程让我筋疲力尽，在可预见的未来，我将无法接受任何演讲请求。我支持深思熟虑地执行行为准则，以解决性别歧视、种族主义和骚扰行为，但这不是在这个案例中发生的事情。</p><p>  In my recent JupyterCon keynote, “I Like Jupyter Notebooks” (re-recording provided at the bottom of this post, if you’re interested in seeing it for yourself), I sought to offer a rebuttal to Joel Grus’ highly influential JupyterCon presentation “ I Don’t Like Notebooks”. Joel claimed in his talk that Jupyter is a poor choice for software development and teaching, and I claimed in my talk that it is a good choice. The NumFOCUS committee found me guilty of violating their code of conduct for having not been “kind” in my disagreement with Joel, and for “insulting” him. The specific reasons given were that:</p><p>在我最近的JupyterCon主题演讲“我喜欢Jupyter笔记本”中(如果您有兴趣亲眼看看，请在本文底部重新录制)，我试图反驳Joel Grus极具影响力的JupyterCon演讲“我不喜欢笔记本”。Joel在他的演讲中声称Jupyter对于软件开发和教学是一个糟糕的选择，而我在我的演讲中声称这是一个很好的选择。NumFOCUS委员会认定我违反了他们的行为准则，因为我在与乔尔的分歧中没有表现出“善意”，并“侮辱”了他。具体理由如下：</p><p> I used some of his slides (properly attributed) and a brief clip from one of his videos to explain why I thought he was wrong</p><p>我使用了他的一些幻灯片(正确归类)和他的一段视频中的一段简短片段来解释为什么我认为他是错的。</p><p>  I was also told that “as a keynote speaker” I would “be held to a higher standard than others” (although this was not communicated to me prior to my talk, nor what that higher standard is)</p><p>我还被告知，“作为一名主旨演讲者”，我将“被要求达到比其他人更高的标准”(尽管在我演讲之前没有向我传达这一点，也没有被告知更高的标准是什么)。</p><p> Code of Conducts can be a useful tool, when thoughtfully created and thoughtfully enforced, to address sexism, racism, and harassment, all of which have been problems at tech conferences. Given the  diversity issues in the tech industry, it is important that we continue the work of making conferences more inclusive, particularly to those from marginalized backgrounds. Having a code of conduct with explicit rules against violent threats, unwelcome sexual attention, repeated harassment, sexually explicit pictures, and other harmful behavior is the first step towards addressing and stopping those behaviors. The JupyterCon code provides the following examples of unacceptable behavior, none of which are at all similar to what I did (i.e. saying that someone was wrong on a technical topic, and explaining how and why):</p><p>行为准则可以是一个有用的工具，如果经过深思熟虑地制定和实施，就可以解决性别歧视、种族主义和骚扰问题，所有这些都是科技会议上的问题。鉴于科技行业的多样性问题，我们继续努力使会议更具包容性，特别是对那些来自边缘背景的人，这一点很重要。制定一套行为准则，明确规定禁止暴力威胁、不受欢迎的性关注、反复骚扰、露骨的性图片和其他有害行为，是解决和制止这些行为的第一步。JupyterCon代码提供了以下不可接受行为的示例，其中没有一个与我所做的完全相似(例如，说某人在某个技术主题上出错，并解释如何以及为什么)：</p><p> Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”)</p><p>张贴(或威胁要张贴)他人的个人身份信息(“doxing”)。</p><p>  The CoC enforcement process involved conflicting &amp; changing information, no opportunity for me to give input, the stress of a long wait of unknown duration with no information about what I was accused of or what would happen next, and the committee members violated their own CoC during the process</p><p>COC的执行过程包括相互冲突和不断变化的信息，我没有机会发表意见，漫长的等待带来的压力，持续时间未知，没有关于我被指控什么或接下来会发生什么的信息，委员会成员在这个过程中违反了他们自己的COC。</p><p> There were two totally different Codes of Conduct with different requirements linked in different places</p><p>有两个完全不同的行为准则，在不同的地方有不同的要求联系在一起</p><p>  The existence of, or details about, the CoC were not communicated prior to confirmation of the engagement</p><p>在确认签约之前，没有传达CoC的存在或有关CoC的详细信息。</p><p> CoC experts recommend avoiding requirements of politeness or other forms of “proper” behavior, but should focus on a specific list of unacceptable behaviors. The JupyterCon CoC, however, is nearly entirely a list of “proper” behaviors (such as “Be welcoming”, “Be considerate”, and “Be friendly”) that are vaguely defined</p><p>COC专家建议避免对礼貌或其他形式的“适当”行为的要求，但应该关注一系列具体的不可接受的行为。然而，JupyterCon CoC几乎完全是一个定义模糊的“适当”行为(如“欢迎”、“体贴”和“友好”)的列表。</p><p> CoC experts recommend using a CoC that focuses on a list of unacceptable behaviors. Both the codes linked to JupyterCon have such a link, and none of the unacceptable behavior examples are in any way related or close to what happened in this case. But NumFOCUS nonetheless found me in violation.</p><p>COC专家建议使用侧重于不可接受行为列表的COC。链接到JupyterCon的两个代码都有这样的链接，并且不可接受的行为示例中没有一个与本例中发生的事情有任何关联或接近。尽管如此，NumFOCUS还是发现我违反了规定。</p><p> I would rather not have to write this post at all. However I know that people will ask about why my talk isn’t available on the JupyterCon site, so I felt that I should explain exactly what happened. In particular, I was concerned that if only partial information became available, the anti-CoC crowd might jump on this as an example of problems with codes of conduct more generally, or might point at this as part of “cancel culture” (a concept I vehemently disagree with, since what is referred to as “cancellation” is often just “facing consequences”). Finally, I found that being on the “other side” of a code of conduct issue gave me additional insights into the process, and that it’s important that I should share those insights to help the community in the future.</p><p>我宁愿根本不用写这篇文章。然而，我知道人们会问为什么我的演讲在JupyterCon网站上不可用，所以我觉得我应该确切地解释发生了什么。我特别担心，如果只有部分信息，反CoC的人群可能会跳出来，认为这是行为准则普遍存在问题的一个例子，或者可能会指出这是“取消文化”的一部分(这个概念我非常不同意，因为所谓的“取消”往往只是“面临后果”)。最后，我发现，身处行为准则问题的“另一边”让我对这一过程有了更多的洞察力，我应该分享这些洞察力，以帮助未来的社区，这一点很重要。</p><p>  The rest of this post is a fairly detailed account of what happened, for those that are interested.</p><p>对于那些感兴趣的人来说，这篇文章的其余部分是对所发生事情的相当详细的描述。</p><p>  I recently gave a talk at  JupyterCon. My partner Rachel gave a  talk at JupyterCon a couple of years ago, and had a wonderful experience, and I’m a huge fan of Jupyter, so I wanted to support the project. The conference used to be organized by O’Reilly, who have always done a wonderful job of conferences I’ve attended, but this year the conference was instead handled by  NumFOCUS.</p><p>我最近在JupyterCon上做了一次演讲。几年前，我的合作伙伴瑞秋在JupyterCon上做了一次演讲，经历了一段美妙的经历，我是Jupyter的超级粉丝，所以我想支持这个项目。这个会议过去是由O‘Reilly组织的，我参加过的会议他总是做得很好，但今年的会议改由NumFOCUS负责。</p><p> For my talk, I decided to focus on Jupyter as a literate and  exploratory programming environment, using  nbdev. One challenge, however, is that two years earlier Joel Grus had given a brilliant presentation called  I Don’t Like Notebooks which had been so compelling that I have found it nearly impossible to talk about programming in Jupyter without being told “you should watch this talk which explains why programming in Jupyter is a terrible idea”.</p><p>在我的演讲中，我决定使用nbdev将Jupyter作为一个识字和探索性的编程环境。然而，一个挑战是，两年前，Joel Grus做了一场精彩的演讲，名为“我不喜欢笔记本”，这篇演讲非常有说服力，以至于我发现如果没有人告诉我“你应该看这个演讲，这解释了为什么用Jupyter编程是一个糟糕的想法”，我几乎不可能谈论用Jupyter编程的问题。</p><p> Joel opened and closed his presentation with some light-hearted digs at me, since I’d asked him ahead of time  not to do such a presentation. So I thought I’d kill two birds with one stone, and take the opportunity to respond directly to him. Not only was his presentation brilliant, but his slides were hilarious, so I decided to directly parody his talk by using (with full credit of course) some of his slides directly. That way people that hadn’t seen his talk could both get to enjoy the fantastic content, and also understand just what I was responding to. For instance, here’s how Joel illustrated the challenge of running cells in the right order:</p><p>乔尔在演讲开始和结束时对我进行了一些轻松的挖苦，因为我事先已经要求他不要做这样的演讲。所以我想我应该一举两得，利用这个机会直接回复他。不仅他的演讲很精彩，而且他的幻灯片也很搞笑，所以我决定直接使用他的一些幻灯片(当然是完全值得称赞的)直接模仿他的演讲。这样，没有看过他演讲的人既可以享受精彩的内容，也可以理解我的回应。例如，以下是Joel如何说明以正确的顺序运行单元的挑战：</p><p>  I showed that slide, explaining that it’s Joel’s take on the issue, and then followed up with a slide showing how easy it actually is to run all cells in order:</p><p>我展示了这张幻灯片，解释说这是乔尔对这个问题的看法，然后接着放了一张幻灯片，展示了按顺序运行所有单元格实际上是多么容易：</p><p>  Every slide included a snippet from Joel’s title slide, which, I explained, showed which slides were directly taken from his presentation. I was careful to ensure I did not modify any of his slides in any way. When first introducing his presentation, I described Joel as “a brilliant communicator, really funny, and wrong”. I didn’t make any other comments about Joel (although, for the record, I think he’s awesome, and highly recommend  his book.</p><p>每张幻灯片都包括乔尔标题幻灯片的一个片段，我解释说，它显示了哪些幻灯片是直接从他的演示文稿中摘录的。我小心翼翼地确保我没有以任何方式修改他的任何幻灯片。当我第一次介绍他的演讲时，我形容乔尔是“一位出色的沟通者，非常有趣，而且是错误的”。我没有对乔尔发表任何其他评论(尽管，根据记录，我认为他很棒，并强烈推荐他的书。</p><p>  A week later, I received an email telling me that two CoC reports were filed regarding my JupyterCon keynote presentation. I was told that “The Code of Conduct Enforcement Team is meeting tomorrow to review the incident and will be contacting you to inform you of the nature of the report and to understand your perspective”.</p><p>一周后，我收到一封电子邮件，告诉我关于我的JupyterCon主题演讲有两份COC报告。我被告知，“行为准则执行小组明天将开会审查这一事件，并将与您联系，告知您报告的性质，并了解您的观点”。</p><p> The CoC wasn’t mentioned at all until after I’d been invited to speak, had accepted, and had completed the online registration. I had reviewed it at that time, and had been a bit confused. The email I received linked to a  JupyterCon Code of Conduct, but that in turn didn’t provide much detail about what is and isn’t OK, and that in turn linked to a different  NumFOCUS Code of Conduct. A link was also provided to  report violations, which also linked to and named the NumFOCUS CoC.</p><p>直到我被邀请发言，接受了邀请，并完成了在线注册，COC才被提及。我当时看过了，有点糊涂。我收到的电子邮件链接到了JupyterCon的行为准则，但这反过来并没有提供太多关于什么是好的和不好的细节，而这反过来又链接到了不同的NumFOCUS行为准则。还提供了一个报告违规行为的链接，该链接也链接到NumFOCUS CoC并将其命名为NumFOCUS CoC。</p><p> I was concerned that I had done something which might be viewed as a violation, and looked forward to hearing about the nature of the report and having a chance to share my perspective. I was heartened that JupyterCon documented that they follow the  NumFOCUS Enforcement Manual. I was also heartened that the manual has a section “Communicate with the Reported Person about the Incident” which says they will “Let the reported person tell someone on the CoC response team their side of the story; the person who receives their side of the story should be prepared to convey it at the response team meeting”. I was also pleased to see that much of the manual and code of conduct followed the advice (and even used some wording from) the brilliant folks at the  Ada Initiative, who are extremely thoughtful about how to develop and apply codes of conduct.</p><p>我担心我做了一些可能被视为违规的事情，并期待着听取有关报告的性质，并有机会分享我的观点。令我振奋的是，JupyterCon记录了他们遵循NumFOCUS执行手册。我还感到振奋的是，手册中有一个部分是“与被报告人就事件进行沟通”，其中说他们将“让被报告人告诉COC响应团队中他们那一边的故事；收到他们那一边故事的人应该准备好在响应团队会议上传达这一点”。我还很高兴地看到，大部分手册和行为准则都遵循了Ada Initiative的建议(甚至使用了一些措辞)，他们对如何制定和应用行为准则非常深思熟虑。</p><p> One challenge is that the JupyterCon CoC is based on Django’s, which has very general guidelines such as “Be welcoming” and “Be considerate”, which can be taken by different people in different ways. The NumFOCUS code is much clearer, with a specific list of “Unacceptable behaviors”, although that list includes “Other unethical or unprofessional conduct”, which is troublesome, since “unprofessional” can be catch-all gate-keeping mechanism for whatever those in the “profession” deem to be against their particular norms, and which those outside the in-group (like me) can’t be reasonably be expected to know.</p><p>一个挑战是，JupyterCon COC是基于Django的，它有非常笼统的指导方针，比如“要欢迎”和“要体贴”，不同的人可以用不同的方式来对待这些准则。NumFOCUS的准则要明确得多，有一个具体的“不可接受的行为”清单，尽管该清单包括“其他不道德或不专业的行为”，这是麻烦的，因为“不专业”可能是那些“专业”人士认为违反其特定规范的所有把关机制，而不能合理地期望团队外的人(比如我)知道这些行为。</p><p> Some of these issues are discussed in  an excellent presentation from Valerie Aurora, who explains that “a code of conduct should contain” “behaviors which many people think are acceptable but are unacceptable in your community”, and that “If you want to list good behaviors or describe the community ideal of behavior, do it in a separate document”, and in particular “Do not require politeness or other forms of ‘proper’ behavior”. Pretty much  all of the JupyterCon code of conduct is a list of forms of ‘proper’ behavior (e.g. “be friendly”, “be welcoming”, “be respectful”, etc.) While broader and more subjective values, such as “be kind”, can be useful as part of a conference’s values, it is less clear if or even how they should be enforced via a code of conduct.</p><p>瓦莱丽·奥罗拉(Valerie Aurora)在一篇出色的演讲中讨论了其中一些问题，她解释说，“行为准则应该包含”“许多人认为你的社区可以接受但不能接受的行为”，“如果你想列出良好的行为或描述社区的行为理想，就在一个单独的文件中完成”，特别是“不要求礼貌或其他形式的‘适当’行为”。几乎所有的JupyterCon行为准则都是“适当”行为的清单(例如，“友好”、“欢迎”、“尊重”等)。虽然更广泛和更主观的价值观，如“友善”，可以作为会议价值观的一部分，但是否甚至如何通过行为准则来执行这些价值观还不太清楚。</p><p>   The promised call happened the next day. However, the representative told me that they would  not be informing me of the nature of the report at that time, and would not be seeking to understand my perspective at that time. I asked why the change of plans. The representative explained that they had had a committee meeting and had decided to wait until they had spoken to the two reporters.</p><p>承诺的电话发生在第二天。不过，该名代表告诉我，他们当时不会告知我该报告的性质，也不会试图了解我当时的观点。我问为什么改变计划。该代表解释说，他们已经召开了委员会会议，并决定等到他们与两名记者交谈后再说。</p><p> I was stunned. The representative could not even commit to a time when they would get back to me, or tell me what would be happening next. I told them that I thought that telling someone that they had a violation report, but then not saying what it is, or when or whether they would be able to provide their side of the story, or providing any time-frame for any next step was cruel. I told them that my emotional resilience was not high, since I’ve been dealing with challenging family health issues, and that I hoped they would consider changing their approach for other people in the future, so they wouldn’t have to deal with an open-ended and obscure charge like I did.</p><p>我目瞪口呆。这位代表甚至不能承诺他们什么时候会给我回电话，也不能告诉我下一步会发生什么。我告诉他们，我认为告诉别人他们有一份违规报告，但随后不说是什么，或者他们何时或是否能够提供他们的情况，或者为下一步提供任何时间框架，都是残忍的。我告诉他们，我的情绪弹性不高，因为我一直在处理具有挑战性的家庭健康问题，我希望他们将来能考虑改变对其他人的做法，这样他们就不必像我那样处理无限期和晦涩的指控。</p><p> The representative explained that I had “made at least two people feel uncomfortable”. I told them that I really didn’t think that was fair. We shouldn’t be held responsible for other people’s feelings. As a proponent of  Nonviolent Communication I believe that we should  share how we feel in reaction to the words or deeds of others, but should not  blame others for these feelings. Furthermore, if it is a requirement that talks make people feel comfortable, that should be clearly communicated and documented (NumFOCUS did neither).</p><p>这位代表解释说，我“至少让两个人感到不舒服”。我告诉他们我真的认为这不公平。我们不应该对别人的感受负责。作为非暴力沟通的倡导者，我认为我们应该分享我们对他人言行的反应，但不应该因为这些感受而责怪别人。此外，如果要求谈话让人感到舒服，那就应该清楚地传达和记录下来(NumFOCUS两者都没有做到)。</p><p> The next call did not happen for another week (I had made myself available to meet any time). I was shocked to read that the purpose of the call would be to “discuss the results of our investigation”. I could not understand how they could have completed their investigation and have results, without any input from me. Nonetheless, I agreed to the call; I figured that all I needed to do was dial in, hear the results, and I was done.</p><p>下一通电话又过了一周才打来(我已经安排好了随时见面)。当我读到这次通话的目的是“讨论我们的调查结果”时，我感到震惊。我无法理解，如果没有我的任何意见，他们怎么能完成调查并得出结果。尽管如此，我还是同意了这个电话；我想我所需要做的就是拨进去，听到结果，然后我就完成了。</p><p>  One the call, I was surprised to find myself facing four people. The previous call had been with just one, and suddenly being so greatly outnumbered made me feel very intimidated. One of the representatives started by telling me exactly what the finding was. The reporters claimed, and the committee agreed, that there had indeed been a code of conduct violation, specifically in failing to be “kind to others” and in “insulting others”.</p><p>有一通电话，我惊讶地发现自己面对的是四个人。之前的电话只有一个，突然间人数远远超过了我，这让我感到非常害怕。其中一位代表一开始就告诉我确切的发现是什么。记者们声称，委员会也同意，确实存在违反行为准则的行为，特别是在未能“善待他人”和“侮辱他人”方面。</p><p> I was stunned. I think Joel is great, and I know for a fact that he doesn’t mind being called “wrong” (since the call I checked with him). I most certainly did not insult him. I said that I think his approach to coding is sub-optimal, and specifically that it would benefit from using Jupyter. I showed a clip of him live coding to demonstrate that. I found it shocking that part of the findings of the committee would be a claim as to  why I showed a particular slide, especially considering they never even asked. I have no desire to discredit Joel, and I don’t think that my view that his coding setup is sub-optimal should be considered a slight on his character.</p><p>我目瞪口呆。我认为乔尔很棒，而且我知道他并不介意被称为“错误的”(自从我和他确认了那个电话之后)。我肯定没有侮辱他。我说，我认为他的编码方法是次优的，特别是它将受益于使用Jupyter。我给他看了一段他现场编程的片段来证明这一点。我发现令人震惊的是，委员会的部分调查结果会声称我为什么要放映特定的幻灯片，特别是考虑到他们甚至都没有问过。我不想诋毁Joel的名声，我也不认为我认为他的编码设置是次优的观点应该被认为是对他性格的轻视。</p><p> Could it be argued that I was not “kind”. I guess it could. I did a parody. In some ways, this  is kind – it shows that (and I explicitly said this) that I think his presentation is brilliant and highly influential, to the extent that I put in a significant amount of time studying it and working with the jokes and structure as best as I could. On the other hand, I did indeed say he is wrong, and tried to show the errors he made by pointing them out directly on his slides; I don’t think that’s unkind, but it seems that NumFOCUS committee disagrees. Personally, I don’t think it can be argued I was insulting him. It’s quite possible to debate someone and say they’re wrong, without claiming they’re a bad person or saying mean things about their person. The JupyterCon CoC even mentions this: “When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Jupyter is no exception”.</p><p>难道可以说我不是“善良的”吗？我想是可以的。我做了个恶搞。在某些方面，这是友善的-它表明(我明确地说了这一点)，我认为他的演讲很精彩，很有影响力，以至于我花了大量的时间研究它，尽我所能地处理笑话和结构。另一方面，我确实说过他是错的，并试图通过在幻灯片上直接指出他所犯的错误来展示他所犯的错误，我不认为这是不友好的，但NumFOCUS委员会似乎不同意。就我个人而言，我不认为我是在侮辱他。辩论某人并说他们是错的，而不说他们是坏人或说他们本人的坏话，这是很有可能的。JupyterCon COC甚至提到了这一点：“当我们意见不一致时，试着理解为什么。社会和技术上的分歧时有发生，Jupyter也不例外。</p><p> There is a huge disparity between the examples that are provided on the Jupyter and NumFOCUS codes compared to what I was being charged with. Here’s the list from NumFOCUS of “unacceptable behaviors”:</p><p>与我被指控的相比，Jupyter和NumFOCUS代码上提供的例子之间存在着巨大的差异。以下是来自NumFOCUS的“不可接受行为”排行榜：</p><p> Written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership in a specific group, including level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, neurotype, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality</p><p>书面或口头评论，其效果是根据某一特定群体的成员资格而将其排除在外，包括经验水平、性别、性别认同和表达、性取向、残疾、神经类型、个人外表、体型、种族、民族、年龄、宗教或国籍</p><p>  Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or direct message history, without the senders consent</p><p>未经发件人同意，共享私人内容，如私下或非公开发送的电子邮件，或直接消息历史记录。</p><p> Continuing to initiate interaction (such as photography, recording, messaging, or conversation) with someone after being asked to stop</p><p>在被要求停止后继续发起与某人的互动(如拍照、录音、消息或对话)。</p><p>  Publishing (or threatening to post) other peoples personally identifying information (doxing), such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission</p><p>未经明确许可，发布(或威胁要发布)他人的个人身份信息(Doxing？？)，例如物理或电子地址。</p><p>   These are behaviors that I strongly agree should be stopped, and the community should unite to stand behind this. But these are not the behaviors that the NumFOCUS committee focused on in this case, or in the sections of the CoC that I was found to have violated.</p><p>这些都是我强烈同意应该停止的行为，社会应该团结起来支持这一点。但这些都不是NumFOCUS委员会在本案中关注的行为，也不是我被发现违反CoC的部分。</p><p> I have no idea what happened here – why some people decided to use a code that was, apparently, written to protect people from sexism, violence, racism, and intimidation, in this way. I know that I’ve made many enemies this year with my advocacy of universal masking, and have had to deal with constant harassment and even death threats as a result. I’ve also received a lot of abuse over recent years from some due to my attempts to democratize AI, from those who have felt their privileged positions threatened.</p><p>我不知道这里发生了什么--为什么有些人决定使用一种显然是为了保护人们免受性别歧视、暴力、种族主义和恐吓而编写的代码，通过这种方式。我知道，今年我倡导的普遍蒙面已经树敌无数，因此不得不应对持续不断的骚扰，甚至死亡威胁。近年来，由于我试图将人工智能民主化，我也收到了一些人的很多辱骂，来自那些感到自己的特权地位受到威胁的人。</p><p>  After they told me of the reports and their finding that I had violated the code of conduct, they asked if I had anything to say. I told them I didn’t. I’d only mentally prepared myself for what they said the call was about: to inform me of the findings. I told them I didn’t think it would be that useful, since they’d already completed their investigation and made their findings. I didn’t have a emotional resilience to engage in a discussion, and I told them that. One person then chuckled in response, and as I struggled to hold back tears he started talking at some length about how the next phase is for me to help them decide on next steps.</p><p>当他们告诉我报告和他们发现我违反了行为准则后，他们问我是否有什么要说的。我告诉他们我没有。我只是在思想上为他们所说的电话内容做好了准备：通知我调查结果。我告诉他们，我不认为这会有什么用处，因为他们已经完成了调查并得出了他们的结论。我没有情绪上的弹性来参与讨论，我告诉了他们这一点。一个人随后咯咯地笑了起来，当我努力忍住眼泪时，他开始长篇大论地谈到我的下一阶段是如何帮助他们决定下一步的。</p><p> I had already told the committee that I wasn’t able to have a discussion. One of the NumFOCUS “unacceptable behaviors” is: “Continuing to initiate interaction (such as photography, recording, messaging, or conversation) with someone after being asked to stop.” Since he was ignoring my request, I interrupted him, repeated that I couldn’t carry on, and terminated the call. I really didn’t feel like having a committee of people I didn’t know watch me sobbing.</p><p>我已经告诉委员会我不能进行讨论。NumFOCUS的“不可接受的行为”之一是：“在被要求停止之后，继续发起与某人的互动(如拍照、录音、消息或对话)。”因为他不理睬我的请求，我打断了他，重复说我不能继续了，然后终止了通话。我真的不想让一个由我不认识的人组成的委员会看着我哭泣。</p><p> I’m an independent, self-funded researcher. I don’t have a legal team, a comms team, or colleagues to support me. I’m a rare kind of voice at conferences, which are mainly populated by people from big companies, well-funded universities, and hot startups.</p><p>我是一名独立的自筹资金的研究人员。我没有法律团队、通讯团队或同事来支持我。我是会议上罕见的代言人，会议主要由来自大公司、资金雄厚的大学和热门初创公司的人组成。</p><p> It seems that perhaps the NumFOCUS policy just is not designed to consider the rights and mental health of people that are accused. Their policy says “As soon as possible, let the reported person know that there is a complaint about them (before the response team meeting)”, and that in approaching the accused, they should say ‘This behavior isn’t appropriate for our event/meetup’, and they should “Emphasize the result/impact of the behavior and that it should cease/stop”. In short, many parts of the document, including this one, assume guilt, and do not show any consideration for the accused. The potential for misuse and weaponization of such a code is of concern.</p><p>似乎NumFOCUS的政策并不是为了考虑被指控人的权利和心理健康而设计的。他们的政策是“尽快让被举报的人知道有关于他们的投诉(在响应小组会议之前)”，在接近被告时，他们应该说‘这种行为不适合我们的活动/会议’，他们应该“强调这种行为的结果/影响，应该停止/停止”。简而言之，该文件的许多部分，包括这一部分，都是有罪的，并且没有显示出对被告的任何考虑。这种代码的误用和武器化的可能性令人担忧。</p><p> I’ve tried to make myself available for public speaking events when I can, in order to support the community. However, the potential cost is too great, and there is no real upside for me personally, so I don’t expect to be accepting invitations in the future, at least not for quite a while. I will of course complete those commitments I’ve already made.</p><p>为了支持社区，我尽量让自己在可能的情况下参加公共演讲活动。然而，潜在的成本太高了，对我个人来说也没有什么真正的好处，所以我不指望将来会接受邀请，至少在相当长的一段时间内不会。我当然会完成我已经做出的那些承诺。</p><p> I was not able to cope with the NumFOCUS CoC process. Although I’m not in the best position at the moment to handle something like that, I’m much better off than many. For one thing, I’m a white, cis, straight male, and I have had some success in my life which has helped my self-confidence. I’m also financially independent, and do not need the approval or support of the influential NumFOCUS organization. Many people, facing the same situation, may well feel forced to go along with the process, even if it is an emotional burden they are not well able to deal with. Many people who do not benefit from the privilege I have may not even realize they have the ability to say “no”. It was assumed by the committee that I’d have the mental toughness to be ready to face, via video, four people I didn’t know, as they told me of my “violations” and demanded I help them decide on next steps. Limiting NumFOCUS conference speakers to only those ready and able to handle such a situation may significantly limit the diversity of NumFOCUS conferences. NumFOCUS recently “ screwed up badly” and has a lot of  work  to do to improve diversity in its community. Improving its Code of Conduct and enforcement process to meet the ideals of kindness, fairness, respect, and consideration that it demands of others, may help in this direction.</p><p>我无法应付NumFOCUS CoC流程。虽然我目前并不处于处理这类事情的最佳位置，但我比许多人过得都要好得多。首先，我是一个白人，顺从，直男，我在生活中取得了一些成功，这帮助了我的自信。我在经济上也是独立的，不需要有影响力的NumFOCUS组织的批准或支持。面对同样的情况，许多人很可能会感到被迫接受这一过程，即使这是他们无法很好地应对的情感负担。许多没有从我的特权中受益的人可能甚至没有意识到他们有能力说“不”。委员会认为我有足够的精神准备通过视频面对四个我不认识的人，因为他们告诉我我的“违规行为”，并要求我帮助他们决定下一步的行动。限制NumFOCUS会议演讲者仅限于那些准备好并能够处理这种情况的人，可能会极大地限制NumFOCUS会议的多样性。NumFOCUS最近“搞砸了”，要提高其社区的多样性，还有很多工作要做。改进其行为准则和执行过程，以满足其要求他人的善良、公平、尊重和体贴的理想，可能有助于朝着这个方向发展。</p><p> I don’t want this situation to stop my work from being available, so I’ve created a new independent recording of the talk, using the exact same slides and material. However I didn’t use a script for either talk, so the wording won’t be identical. The video is below. The PowerPoint slides are  </p><p>我不希望这种情况阻止我的工作，所以我用完全相同的幻灯片和素材制作了一份新的演讲的独立录音。不过，这两次演讲我都没有使用脚本，所以措辞不会完全相同。下面是视频。PowerPoint幻灯片是。</p><p>......</p><p>.</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fast.ai/2020/10/28/code-of-conduct/">https://www.fast.ai/2020/10/28/code-of-conduct/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/违反/">#违反</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/code/">#code</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/美国/">#美国</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/linux/">#linux</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
