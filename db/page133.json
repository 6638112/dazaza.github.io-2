These companies\u2019 market capitalizations, as of May 6 of this year, range from $2.8 billion (Yelp) to $2.1 trillion (Apple); our financial data is current as of June 14.\n Thirty-seven technology giants responded to our queries and agreed to participate in the project. Stripe and Roku declined to participate, and Tesla, SpaceX, and Coinbase did not respond to repeated requests. For companies that did not participate, we searched for any public information about commitments or policy changes, and included those findings in the final project.\n Pieces of this data set, which encapsulates the public financial commitments made by these companies, as well as the changes made to their policies and procedures in the last year, are highlighted in data visualizations, which you can see  here. But it\u2019s worth unpacking this data more.\n  One of the biggest trends in tech over the last year is financial commitments to improving racial equity both within individual tech companies\u2019 walls, as well as across the country at large. While some companies have made commitments to racial justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) before, it has never happened collectively on the same scale it did in 2020. Notably, after police killed Michael Brown Jr. in Ferguson in 2014, no major tech companies  made any statements or donations (though Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey, who was executive chairman at the time, did tweet about it and attended the protests in person).\n Cumulatively, the tech giants we surveyed have committed a total of $3.8 billion toward DEI in 2020 and 2021, in various forms. The largest chunk of these funds\u2014$2.9 billion, or 75%\u2014have gone toward initiatives that support Black-owned businesses. That includes venture capital funding deployed specifically toward Black founders, as well as funds earmarked for Black-owned suppliers.\n Eleven percent of the commitments, a total of $422.5 million, is going toward racial justice organizations, often taking the form of direct donations to nonprofits. About 10% of the commitments, $375.1 million, were committed to educational initiatives. These sorts of commitments are sometimes framed as an effort to solve the  \u201cpipeline problem\u201d\u2014the  often-contested\u00a0claim that tech\u2019s diversity woes are due to a lack of qualified Black people to hire. The remaining money has been allocated to undesignated or internal commitments; very few companies shared their internal DEI spend. In addition, a few companies, including Microsoft, Netflix, and Yelp, included loans and deposits into Black-owned banks as part of their commitments.\n  While these numbers seem substantial, it\u2019s important to compare companies\u2019 commitments to their operating income. We took a look at companies which answered our survey that had an operating income of over $100 million in 2020, and analyzed how many days it would take for their profits to surpass their total commitments to racial equity. The results were stark.\n Apple, which committed $100 million, will make that money in profit in less than a day. But even the largest tech companies that committed substantially more\u2014like Microsoft ($772.5 million), Alphabet/Google ($418 million), and Facebook ($347 million)\u2014make their commitments back in profit in between three and six days.\n There are some standouts on the list. PayPal, which made $3.3 billion in operating income in 2020, would take almost two months of profit to pay for its substantial $535 million commitment. In addition, Salesforce, which made $422 million in operating income in 2020, has committed the vast majority of it\u2014$402.2 million\u2014to various diversity and equity initiatives.\n  These comparisons reveal how companies\u2019 financial commitments are best understood in the context of how much money they make; even some of the largest dollar amounts begin to look small in this context. As surveillance expert Chris Gilliard  puts it, \u201ci t\u2019s not even couch-cushion money to them.\u201d\n  Along with asking companies about their financial commitments to equity, we also asked them a range of questions about their policies that can indicate a company is attempting to improve its DEI. (It\u2019s important to note that not all policy changes are equal. Critics have suggested that some moves, like making Juneteenth a holiday, don\u2019t result in a systemic change to company culture).\n One movement that\u2019s taken place is a push to bring more Black people on to boards of directors, and we found this reflected in the data. While 71% of companies surveyed currently have a Black board member, 37% of those companies appointed their first Black board member in 2020 or 2021. Twenty-nine percent of companies surveyed do not currently have a Black board member.\n  We found that tech companies are split on requiring anti-bias or anti-racism training. According to our survey, 48% of companies require it for all employees. Thirty-one percent made it mandatory for all employees starting in 2020 or 2021. It is not mandatory for all employees at 35% of companies. Included in this bucket are companies that have made the decision to make it mandatory for all managers, or all hiring managers, but not for all employees. For instance, an Uber spokesperson told us it has mandatory training on unconscious bias and microaggressions for leaders and has a training program focused on anti-bias for new employee and manager onboarding, but doesn\u2019t require that training for all employees because  research suggests it doesn\u2019t have the \u201cdesired impact.\u201d\n One noteworthy shift that\u2019s just starting to take place is who a company\u2019s DEI head reports to; for the vast majority of the companies who responded to our survey, the DEI head reports to the chief people officer, or equivalent. A small handful\u2014including Facebook, Pinterest, Peloton, and Etsy\u2014have their head of DEI reporting to either the CEO or the head of operations. These changes were made in 2020 or 2021, after the racial justice protests. Only one company\u2014Yelp\u2014had this kind of reporting structure in place before the protests. Its head of DEI has reported to the COO since 2016.\n Giving employees Juneteenth as a paid company holiday is another change that\u2019s occurred in the last year. About half of companies surveyed now close their offices for Juneteenth, starting in 2020. No company had offered Juneteenth as a holiday previously.\n  Overall, we found that about two-thirds of companies had made some kind of DEI policy change after the summer 2020 protests. It should be noted that several companies already had the policies we asked about in place before 2020.\n A year isn\u2019t a long time to create systemic change, and it\u2019s still unclear if any of the changes we\u2019ve catalogued will end tech\u2019s long track record of undervaluing and exploiting Black employees. Based on the interviews featured in the  Black in Tech project, workers just want to be paid and treated fairly; if companies can\u2019t meet those basic requirements, having a Black board member, giving everyone a paid holiday, or donating millions certainly won\u2019t solve the problem.\n We are publishing and analyzing this data to hold these companies accountable for their promises, since without transparency change will be even further out of reach.  Fast Company will continue to follow how these commitments impact tech workers and users in the years to come.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

the Big Four firm will not be obligated to work from the office for a minimum number of days per week, as has been a typical response of Deloitte\u2019s competitors.\n Some 15,000 Deloitte staff responded to an internal survey about the future of work at the Big Four firm, with more than 80 per cent of those saying they expected to work from a Deloitte office for two days or fewer per week.\n     More than 90 per cent of Deloitte\u2019s workforce said \u2018choice\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 should be at the heart of how the business operates in future.\n Deloitte senior partner and chief executive Richard Houston said: \u201cThe impact of the pandemic has profoundly changed our way of life, not least in the way we work. The last year has really shown that one size does not fit all when it comes to balancing work and personal lives.\n \u201cIt has also shown that we can trust our people to make the right choice in when, how and where they work.\u201d\n He continued: \u201cOnce the Government has lifted all of the Covid-19 restrictions and we\u2019re back up to full office capacity, we will let our people choose where they need to be to do their best work, in balance with their professional and personal responsibilities.\u201d\n Deloitte said when restrictions are eased its offices will principally be used for team collaboration, training and client meetings.\n     Many City companies have announced plans to adopt a hybrid structure post-pandemic, with staff asked to spend some time in the office each week.\n Competitors KPMG and EY have said staff will spend on average two days in the office each week, while rival PwC estimated staff will be in the office between two and three days.\n The government is currently consulting on plans that could prevent employers from forcing staff to come into the office unless they can prove it is essential.\n A Whitehall source told The Mail: \u201cWe are looking at introducing a default right to flexible working. That would cover things like reasonable requests by parents to start late so they can drop their kids at childcare.\n \u201cBut in the case of office workers in particular it would also cover working from home \u2013 that would be the default right unless the employer could show good reason why someone should not.\u201d\n   The government has shot down the reports, with the Prime Minister understood to be against large-scale working from home beyond final lockdown restrictions.\n     \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTags:  Big Four", "posttime": "2021-06-22 09:10:01", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u544a\u8bc9,tells", "title": "\u5fb7\u7f57\u7279\u544a\u8bc9\u5458\u5de5\u4ed6\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6c38\u8fdc\u5728\u5bb6\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "Deloitte tells staff they can work from home forever", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cityam.com/deloitte-tells-staff-they-can-work-from-home-forever/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u544a\u8bc9", "tells"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "da6fa34e42e38144809834f25b88e043.jpg", "infoid": 1067324, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u54c7\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cfApp Backhannel\uff06amp\u4e2d\u542f\u7528\u4e86@Clubhouse\u7684\u610f\u5916\u66f4\u65b0;\u4ea4\u6362\u4fa7\u680f\uff06amp;\u5168\u9762\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\n \u4f3c\u4e4e\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u7ecf\u56de\u6765\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u6211\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u662f\u7f8e\u4e3d\u7684\uff01\n  \u821e\u53f0\uff06gt;\u8d70\u5411\u8d70\u5eca\uff06gt;\u70b9\u51fb\u7bad\u5934\uff06gt;\u540e\u9891\u5f39\u51fa\uff01 @jowyang @garylhenderson pic.twitter.com/5bjfvlg7t5.\n \u867d\u7136BackChannel\u5c4f\u5e55\u5b8c\u5168\u662f\u7a7a\u767d\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5982\u6b64\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6846\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b63\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98Paul Davison\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u804a\u5929\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u524d\u5728\u516c\u53f8\u5e02\u653f\u5385\u8ba8\u8bba\u8fc7\u3002\n \u201c......\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6709\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u4eba\u4e00\u76f4\u52aa\u529b\u505aDM\u80cc\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e48\u591a\u4eba\u60f3\u8981\u52a0\u6df1\u4e0e\u4eba\u7684\u53cb\u8c0a\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u5404\u79cd\u5404\u6837\u7684\u4e1c\u897f - \u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5e94\u8be5\u62e5\u6709\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u201c\u6234\u7ef4\u68ee\u8bf4\u3002\n \u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u8bc4\u8bba@pdavison\u5728\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5e02\u653f\u5385\u671f\u95f4\u4e3a@clubhouse\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9@clubhouse\u7684\u5907\u4efd\uff08\u4eba\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e92\u76f8dm\u7684exthelnesel\u3002\n Clubhouse\u8054\u5408\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bf4\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9002\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7528\u4f8b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5fae\u4e0d\u8db3\u9053\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u7acb\u5373\u53d1\u751f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5c06\u6dfb\u52a0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00DMS\u6216\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u7ec4\u6587\u672c\u804a\u5929\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u4ed6\u8fd8\u62d2\u7edd\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\u3002 \n\u5f53\u8fbe\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u65f6\uff0c\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u9662\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4ece\u5047\u8bbe\u62d0\u70b9\u56f4\u7ed5\u89d2\u843d\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u529d\u963bTechCrunch\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d1\u51fa\u4e86COY\u58f0\u660e\u3002  \u201c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4ea7\u54c1\u5efa\u8bbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0cClubhouse\u7ecf\u5e38\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u201d\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u544a\u8bc9TechCrunch\u3002 \u201c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u6210\u4e3a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u3002\u201d  Spotify\u7684\u65b0\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8HodeCat App Greentroom\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u76f4\u64ad\u6587\u672c\u804a\u5929\u5ba4\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u6ed1\u52a8\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8\u5c4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002 \u4eceClubhouse Backhannel\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6ed1\u52a8\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u7a97\u53e3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u663e\u7136\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002 ", "note_en": "Wow looks like accidental update of  @clubhouse enabled in app backchannel &amp; switch of side bar &amp; full experience.\n Seems it\u2019s rolled back now but from what I saw it was beautiful!!\n  On stage &gt; move to hallway &gt; hit arrow &gt; back channel popped up!

Amid surface temperatures of up to 471 \u00b0C and surface pressures 100 times greater than those on Earth, new research suggests the planet might still be geologically active. That\u2019s encouraging news to people who think it\u00a0 could once have hosted life\u00a0( or that it might still be able to).\n  Earth\u2019s lithosphere (its crust and upper mantle) is made of \u201cplates\u201d that move around and crash into each other, resulting in mountains, deep ocean trenches, and volcanic and seismic activity. This tectonic activity also plays an important role in the carbon cycle, the processes in which carbon is released and reabsorbed in the ecosystem; by regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it has helped keep the planet cool and comfortable this whole time.\n  Thus far, scientists have never observed anything similar on Venus. But we\u2019ve never been able to rule it out, because it\u2019s hard to make scientific observations of the planet (its thick clouds obscure its surface, and any spacecraft we\u2019d land there would most likely melt in a matter of hours). In the new findings,  published in PNAS today, scientists think they\u2019ve finally spotted evidence of a new type of tectonic activity on Venus.\n   The team used observations made by the Magellan probe, which orbited Venus from 1990 to 1994 and mapped the surface using radar. The features it spotted have been analyzed before, but the new study uses a new computer model that can recognize surface deformations indicating large block structures in the lithosphere. These blocks, each about the size of Alaska, seem to have been sluggishly jostling against each other like broken pack ice on a pond or lake.\n  This is quite different from the current type of plate tectonics on Earth. But if confirmed, it would nonetheless be evidence of heat currents and molten material in Venus\u2019s interior\u2014something that\u2019s never before been observed. The authors think parallels with Earth\u2019s geology during the Archean Eon (2.5 to 4 billion years ago) suggest that the \u201cpack ice\u201d patterns could be a transition from an earlier period of plate tectonics on Venus when the planet was more Earth-like.\n    This movement \u201cis widespread across the Venus lowlands, and argues for a previously unrecognized style of global tectonics,\u201d says Sean Solomon, a research scientist at Columbia University and a coauthor of the new study.\n  The findings only fuel more excitement behind  the new Venus missions\u00a0recently approved by NASA and the European Space Agency. Solomon says he and his team hope all three can provide \u201ccritical data for testing the ideas we\u2019ve described in our paper.\u201d Those missions won\u2019t be ready to launch till closer to the end of the decade, so let\u2019s hope the excitement doesn\u2019t wane over the next several years.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 08:21:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6,\u53ef\u80fd,spotted,\u91d1\u661f", "title": "\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u91d1\u661f\u5185\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6784\u9020\u6d3b\u52a8 ", "title_en": "Scientists Might Have Spotted Tectonic Activity Inside Venus", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/21/1026643/venus-tectonics-geology-lithosphere-active/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6", "\u53ef\u80fd", "spotted", "\u91d1\u661f"]}]
