But over the last few years, he has neglected his establishments’ pages on the platform.</p><p>Ashwin Deshmukh，Williamsburg Pizza Chain和短篇小说酒吧的部门所有者，用于促进他的业务在Yelp上。但在过去几年中，他忽略了他在平台上的房档。</p><p>  Instead, the focus is mainly on other marketing funnels, like organic social growth via Instagram and Google — as well as keeping an eye on other restaurant platforms like Resy and Tock. Deshmukh isn’t the only one.</p><p>  相反，重点主要是通过Instagram和Google的有机社会成长，如有机社会增长，以及留在其他餐馆平台上，如Resy和Tock。 deshmukh不是唯一的一个。</p><p>  Founded in 2004, the customer reviews-based site and app became a vital part of businesses’ marketing efforts. After years of building its business model around selling ads, the company went public in 2012 and continued to court businesses to buy ads in exchange for greater visibility, which helped it become profitable two years later. This pay for visibility model paved the way for other restaurants platforms like DoorDash and GrubHub. In 2014, the company boasted 135 million unique monthly visitors — a 13% year-over-year increase from the year before.</p><p>  基于客户评论的网站和应用程序成立于2004年，成为企业营销努力的重要组成部分。经过多年的建设其在销售广告周围的商业模式之后，该公司于2012年向公开开展公开，并继续向法院企业购买广告以换取更高的知名度，这有助于它两年后有助于其盈利。这种可见性模型的支付为Doordash和Grubhub等其他餐馆平台铺平了道路。 2014年，该公司拥有1.35亿独特的每月游客 - 从前一年开始增加13％。</p><p> That growth has since sputtered. In recent years, Yelp has faced a rise in competition, namely from the likes of Google, OpenTable and Resy, who have all clamored for market share. For example, Google has made it easier for customers to enter reviews, which appear on the business’ homepage during search. That –along with Google’s efforts to surface its own reviews above Yelp’s — has led to a years-long rivalry between the two companies   as they continue to vie for SEO dominance . Over 60% of consumers say   they check Google reviews  before visiting a business, with 45% saying they’re likely to check Yelp ratings, according to ReviewTrackers data.</p><p> 这种增长已经溅射。近年来，Yelp面临着竞争的兴起，即来自谷歌，可怜和重新的喜欢，他们都有狂热的市场份额。例如，谷歌使客户更容易进入搜索期间出现在业务“主页上的评论。谷谷谷物努力在叶利普上以上的努力 - 这导致了两家公司之间的竞争，因为他们继续为SEO统治而继续争夺。超过60％的消费者表示，他们在访问业务之前查看Google评论，45％的人表示，根据RecomeTrackers数据，他们可能会检查yelp评分。</p><p> Yelp’s earnings performance has been on a downward trend for years, even prior to the pandemic. In 2020, Yelp’s year-over-year revenue slowed by 14%, compared to the previous year. In contrast, OpenTable and competitors have started to take a bigger share of the reservations pie. OpenTable, which is owned by Booking Holdings, currently provides its booking software to more than 60,000 restaurants worldwide, resulting in about 1.3 billion diner reservations annually. Yelp, however, is still bigger, with over 5 million listed businesses.</p><p> 即使在大流行之前，yelp的盈利表现已经处于下行趋势。 2020年，与去年相比，叶利普年度收入增长了14％。相比之下，可享有的和竞争对手已经开始采取更大的预订馅饼。可通过预订控股所拥有的可享受的可达，目前将其预订软件为全球60,000多家餐馆提供，每年每年都有约13亿晚餐。然而，Yelp仍然更大，超过500万个上市业务。</p><p> Still the competition is creeping up. Now, Yelp has to fight a multi-pronged battle: it has to once again become the go-to place for people to check customer reviews while preventing further market share loss to other reservation apps. Meanwhile, it must win back the trust of restaurant partners — many of which became disillusioned with its ads-based business model.</p><p> 竞争仍然爬行。现在，Yelp必须打击一个多管之战：它必须再次成为人们检查客户评论的去处，同时防止进一步的市场份额损失其他预订应用程序。与此同时，它必须赢回餐馆合作伙伴的信任 - 其中许多人因其广告的商业模式而变得幻灭。</p><p> Yelp is working on regaining market share with a slew of new features that take aim at the growing competition of OpenTable, Resy and Tock. These include a revamped diner waitlist that integrates with takeout orders, backend analytics, POS integration and customer profiles. All these tools point to Yelp’s ambitions to be more than just a customer reviews destination.</p><p> Yelp正在努力恢复市场份额与扭转的新功能，这些功能旨在瞄准令人享受的可令人享受，重大和托克的竞争。其中包括一个改进的晚餐候补者，它与外出订单集成，后端分析，POS集成和客户配置文件。所有这些工具都指向Yelp的雄心，不仅仅是客户评论目的地。 </p><p>  The company has also been trying to adapt some tools to meet the needs of businesses during the pandemic. Last year, Yelp noticed many restaurants adapt their use of Waitlist  — a three-year-old tool that allows customers to be placed on a live waiting list before arriving at the restaurant — to manage takeout and curbside pickup orders, according to the company. However, the platform’s technology wasn’t initially built to meet this growing need, only to manage dine-in service.</p><p>该公司还试图调整一些工具，以满足大流行期间企业的需求。去年，Yelp注意到许多餐馆适应他们使用候补者 - 这是一个三岁的工具，允许客户在抵达餐厅之前放置在一个现场等待名单上 - 根据该公司管理进攻和路边皮卡订单。但是，该平台的技术不会最初建立以满足这种不断增长的需求，仅用于管理用餐服务。</p><p> Restaurant owners and hosts can now use Waitlist to manage takeout orders and communicate with consumers about their order status via SMS. Yelp Waitlist customers can also find the new takeout feature in their Waitlist app. For local restaurants with nine or fewer locations, the takeout feature is available at no additional cost; pricing will vary for restaurants with ten or more locations. Hosts can enter and keep track of all takeout orders in the app – whether the orders were received via phone or website — and input other information, such as type of car due to curbside pickup.</p><p> 餐馆所有者和主机现在可以使用候补名单来管理收纳订单，并通过SMS与消费者通信。 Yelp Waitlist客户还可以在其助人的游客应用程序中找到新的外卖功能。适用于当地餐厅，含有九个或更少的地点，无法额外成本提供外卖功能;定价会有所不同，餐厅有十个或更多地点。主机可以进入并跟踪应用程序中的所有外卖订单 - 无论订单是否通过电话或网站收到 - 并输入其他信息，例如由于路边拾取而导致的汽车类型。</p><p> Rahul Hampole, vp of product at Yelp, told Modern Retail that these updates with Waitlist showcase the company’s new focus: the company wants to help restaurants operate more efficiently. These latest features, Yelp Waitlist and Yelp Reservations, are a way to manage the front of house and engage with customers, he said. Another component is the upgraded Yelp for Business’ Analytics, Guest Profiles and the POS integration. These are meant to enable restaurant owners to better understand their diners, and to be used for upcoming features to run relevant content and promotions for certain customers.</p><p> yelp的产品副总裁Rahul Hampole告诉现代零售，这些更新与候补人士展示该公司的新重点：该公司希望帮助餐馆更有效地运营。他说，这些最新的功能，yelp waitlist和yelp保留是一种管理房屋前面并与客户携带的方式。另一个组件是商业分析，访客个人资料和POS集成的升级yelp。这些是为了使餐馆所有者能够更好地了解他们的食客，并用于即将到来的功能，为某些客户提供相关内容和促销活动。</p><p> These new features mimic existing tools on other reservation platforms — such as OpenTable, Resy and Tock — which have increasingly been   courting retailers  and small businesses themselves. OpenTable has been helping restaurants with digital bookings since launching in 1998, and began a delivery partnership with UberEats in 2019. On the customer reviews end, OpenTable Reviews launched in 2008 and has generated over 97 million reviews by verified diners to date, according to the company.</p><p> 这些新功能在其他预订平台上模仿现有的现有工具 - 例如可实现的，重新和Tock  - 这越来越多地展示零售商和小型企业本身。从1998年发布以来，Apendable一直在帮助餐厅，并于2019年开始与Ubereats提供交付伙伴关系。根据客户评论结束，2008年推出的可享受的评论通过迄今已达到9700万条点评公司。</p><p> Last year, all three platforms expanded their own variation of reservations and waitlists for non-dining retailers. Furthermore, American Express-owned Resy and OpenTable waived onboarding fees to attract new clients during the pandemic.</p><p> 去年，所有三个平台都扩大了自己对非餐饮零售商的保留和候补员的变化。此外，美国明确拥有的重大和可尊重的船舶在大流行期间吸引新客户。</p><p>  While some of Yelp’s new tools were rolled out to immediately meet the new needs of restaurants or consumers during the pandemic, Hampole said they’re part of Yelp’s long term strategy. Takeout and curbside, for instance, have become increasingly popular among consumers. “We anticipate that even as dining-in returns to pre-pandemic levels, the interest in pickup orders will remain high,” he said.</p><p>  虽然一些Yelp的新工具被推出，在大流行期间立即达到餐馆或消费者的新需求，但Hampole表示他们是Yelp长期战略的一部分。例如，外卖和路边在消费者中越来越受欢迎。 “我们预计即使用餐回报到大流行水平，拾取订单的兴趣也将保持高位，”他说。</p><p> Searches for takeout on Yelp have increased by 3,200% since March 1, 2020 year-over-year, and have remained at 2,265% above prior levels as of last month. But despite delivery platforms taking off during the pandemic, Yelp’s integration is still mainly focused on front of house operations. More delivery integration options will gradually be added in the coming year, Hampole said.</p><p> 自3月1日以上，越来越多地增加了越来越多的屈服增加了3,200％，并且截至上个月，截至上个月以上持续高于现有水平的2,265％。但尽管在大流行期间出发了交付平台，但叶面的一体化仍然主要集中在房屋运营前。 Hampole表示，即将逐步增加更多交付整合选项。 </p><p> Yelp has also been building out more features that focus on the consumer side of these services. The company, for example, has updated the user experience, making it easier for diners to find the information that is most valuable to them — like the latest menu images, most relevant food photos and most popular dishes.</p><p>Yelp还构建了专注于这些服务的消费方面的更多功能。例如，该公司已更新用户体验，使食客更容易找到对它们最有价值的信息 - 就像最新的菜单图像，大多数相关食品照片和最受欢迎的菜肴一样。</p><p> According to Yelp, as of January 2021, it’s seen more than a 60% increase in consumer interaction with menus on Yelp, compared to January 2020. The idea is to continue to improve virtual searches for customers. For example, the new On the Menu feature is meant to better highlight available meals. Another new feature is the dish and photo search upgrades, which better surfaces images when users search for that dish under each business’ listing. Additionally, Yelp just released an iOS 14 home screen widget that allows for direct search on iPhone.</p><p> 根据Yelp，截至2021年1月，与1月2020年1月相比，它在yelp与yelp上的菜单增加了60％以上的消费者互动增加了60％。该想法是继续改善客户的虚拟搜索。例如，菜单上的新功能意味着更好地突出可用餐点。另一个新功能是菜肴和照片搜索升级，当用户在每个企业列表下搜索该菜肴时更好的曲面图像。此外，Yelp刚刚发布了iOS 14主屏幕小组件，允许直接搜索iPhone。</p><p> Yelp isn’t the only platform restaurants are turning to to post menus digitally. Indeed, Instagram has become an indispensable restaurant tool for posting both updated menus and the latest dish photos. The platform, already a go-to for retailers and brands, has become popular   among local businesses  looking to easily stay connected with their customers. During the pandemic, small business owners increasingly relied on live Stories and Direct Messages to keep customers informed on updates to their operations. For many, the social platform replaced the slower-to-update Yelp and Google pages. For example, Chelsea Goss, owner of Salt Lake City-based bridal shop Off White,  previously told Modern Retail when shutdowns began last year, the business focused on Instagram — as opposed to other retail-focused search platforms — to update hours and field customer questions.</p><p> Yelp不是唯一的平台餐厅正在数字上转向张贴菜单。事实上，Instagram已成为一个不可或缺的餐厅工具，用于发布更新的菜单和最新的菜肴照片。该平台已经成为零售商和品牌的比赛，在当地的企业中，希望轻松与客户联系。在大流行期间，小型企业主越来越依赖于实时故事和直接邮件，以使客户了解他们的运营更新。对于许多人来说，社交平台替换了更慢的yelp和Google页面。例如，切尔西高斯，盐湖城的新娘商店的所有者脱掉白人，此前在去年开始关机时告诉现代零售，该业务专注于Instagram  - 而不是其他零售的零售搜索平台 - 更新时间和现场客户问题。</p><p> Nick Verses, owner of pizza restaurant BarDough near Times Square, which predominantly uses Yelp to attract tourists, said the site remains an important part of his digital toolkit. “We use it for reservations,” said Verses, mainly because many non-U.S. tourists are more familiar with Yelp and TripAdvisor over local platforms. BarDough’s staff also uses Yelp Connect — Yelp’s Instagram Stories-like feature — which is a quick way to publish and push content to the Instagram feed. These range from promotions to new menu additions.</p><p> Nick Verses，Pizza Restaurant Bardough的所有者在时代广场，主要是使用Yelp吸引游客，该网站仍然是他数字工具包的重要组成部分。 “我们将其用于预订，”经文，主要是因为许多非美国。游客更熟悉Yelp和TripAdvisor在当地平台上。 Bardough的员工还使用Yelp Connect  -  Yelp的Instagram故事 - 类似的功能 - 这是一种快速发布和推送到Instagram Feed的内容的方法。这些范围从促销到新菜单添加。</p><p> Despite shortcomings compared to competitors, Yelp remains an important part of the U.S. dining scene, said Koorosh Bakhtiar, owner of Jajaja Plantas Mexicana. He said that all his restaurants still check user posts frequently; he responds to all 3-star and under reviews. “They’ve also added Covid sanitation standard check boxes, which are useful to a lot of customers,” he said.</p><p> Jajaja Plantas Mexicana的所有者，尽管与竞争对手相比，Yelp仍然是美国餐饮场所的重要组成部分。他说，他的所有餐厅仍然经常检查用户帖子;他回应了所有三星级和下的评论。 “他们还增加了Covid卫生标准复选框，这对大量客户有用，”他说。</p><p> Bakhtiar’s restaurant group, which has a total of seven restaurants, had one location switch from OpenTable to Yelp reservations back in 2019. The locations also use Yelp to run occasional promotions and advertise seasonal menu items. All of his restaurants also use Yelp’s delivery and takeout integration with Grubhub, albeit it’s hard to quantify if those are increasing actual sales, Bakhtiar said.</p><p> Bakhtiar的Restaurant Group，共有七家餐馆，有一个位置开关，从2019年获得yelp预订。地点也使用Yelp偶尔促销，并宣传季节性菜单。 Bakhtiar说，他所有的餐馆都使用yelp的交付和外卖融合与Grubhub，尽管是难以量化的是，但是Bakhtiar说，如果这些正在增加实际销售。</p><p>  Even though his restaurants use Yelp, Bakhtiar admitted it still has many shortcomings. “When it comes to reservations, I think they’ve lost their luster to the Resys and OpenTables of the world,” Bakhtiar said. Reservation upgrades aside, one of the biggest frustrations with Yelp’s interface remains unresolved, Bakhtiar said. “You still have to pay to get other restaurants’ ads off your page.”</p><p>  即使他的餐馆使用Yelp，Bakhtiar也承认它仍然有很多缺点。 “在谈到预订时，我认为他们已经失去了他们的光泽，对世界的重新和尊重者，”Bakhtiar说。 Bakhtiar说，抛开预订升级，其中yelp界面的最大挫败感仍未得到解决。 “你仍然必须支付你的页面上的其他餐馆的广告。” </p><p> This refers to an issue many businesses have faced while using Yelp. Over the years, a number of restaurants alleged that Yelp used predatory practices to force them to buy ads on the platform in order to get user visibility. Some claimed to be swayed into paying for Yelp’s enhanced tools. In the past decade, multiple business operators — mainly restaurateurs — have complained about Yelp   allegedly manipulating ratings  by removing authentic positive reviews.</p><p>这是指使用yelp时许多企业面临的问题。多年来，许多餐馆所谓的yelp使用掠夺性做法来强迫他们在平台上购买广告，以获得用户的可见性。有人声称要摇曳支付Yelp的增强工具。在过去的十年中，多个商业运营商 - 主要是restaurateurs  - 涉及盲目的依据验证的阳性审查来操纵评级。</p><p> The company has maintained it does not do so; a 2015 class action lawsuit — filed by multiple owners — was dismissed by the U.S Court of Appeals, which found “no extortion or wrong doing” by Yelp. Since then, the company has moved away from the restrictive ads structure. As of 2018, Yelp began implementing a “pause anytime” paid advertising model. That change   has resulted in a decrease  of long-term paying clients.</p><p> 公司坚持不懈; 2015年课程诉讼 - 由多个业主提交 - 由美国法院解雇，由Yelp发现“没有敲诈勒索或错误”。从那时起，该公司已经远离限制性的广告结构。截至2018年，Yelp开始实施“随时随到”付费广告模型。这种变化导致了长期付费客户的减少。</p><p> Danny Teran, co-founder of Watson Hospitality Group, has led the charge against Yelp. Teran,   the subject of the Yelp-focused documentary Billion Dollar Bully , alleged that when he opened his first restaurant, Yelp continuously manipulated dozens of the business page’s existing positive reviews. And for years following the incident, he claimed the Yelp sales team aggressively reached out to advertise with them in order to improve his negative ratings.</p><p> 沃森酒店组织联合创始人Danny Teran已领导对yelp的指控。 Teran是eLELP纪录片的主题纪录片亿美元欺凌，声称当他开设了第一家餐馆时，叶利普不断操纵数十个商业页面现有的积极评价。事件发生后多年来，他声称叶利普销售团队积极达到与他们一起宣传，以改善他的负面评级。</p><p> When asked about the recent changes to the ad program, Teran said “it’s too little, too late to regain businesses’ trust,” adding that he’s “never been a fan of their pay-to-play model.”</p><p> 当被问及最近对广告计划的更改时，泰南说：“它太少，恢复企业的信任太晚了，”加入他的“从来没有成为他们的付费模型的粉丝。”</p><p> In response to questions about Teran’s allegations, Yelp confirmed that his page’s reviews likely went through quality control as part of Yelp’s automated fake ratings detection system, which it implemented at the beginning of 2015. “Yelp takes significant measures to maintain the integrity and quality of the content on our site, while leveling the playing field for businesses that rightfully earn their great reputation,” the spokesperson said.</p><p> 为了回应关于Teran的指控问题，Yelp确认他的页面评论可能通过质量控制作为Yelp自动虚假评级检测系统的一部分，它在2015年初实施。“叶利普采取了重大措施，以维持诚信和质量发言人说，在我们网站上的内容，同时培养了业务的竞争环境，“这位发言人表示。</p><p> Still, Teran said that in many ways, Google has taken over what Yelp was doing when it comes to customer ratings and reviews. “It also helps that people seem more respectful on Google,” he added. Teran also pointed to his newly-opened bar — Brooklyn-based Farewell — as a testament to this shift. Farewell currently has over 50 Google reviews since opening last summer, and just one on Yelp, he noted.</p><p> 不过，泰山仍然在许多方面，谷歌已经接管了Yelp在客户评级和评论方面正在做的事情。 “它还有助于人们在谷歌上似乎更加尊重，”他补充道。泰山还指出了他的新开放的酒吧 - 布鲁克林的告别 - 作为这种转变的证明。他指出，自去年夏天开业以来，当前有超过50个谷歌点评，他指出。</p><p> For now, according to Hampole, the focus for now is to continue building out these new tools while preparing for a post-coronavirus restaurant scene.  “As restaurants continue to open and reopen, review platforms like Yelp will remain essential to consumers,” he said.</p><p> 目前，根据Hampole的说法，目前的重点是在准备冠状病毒餐厅场景时继续构建这些新工具。 “随着餐馆不断开放和重新开放，凯尔普等审查平台将对消费者至关重要，”他说。 </p><p> Despite Yelp’s efforts to win back operators, these new tools haven’t won over everyone. “As of now, we don’t have a reason to waste time on partners that don’t benefit us,” Deshmukh said.</p><p>尽管越来越努力赢回运营商，但这些新工具没有赢得每个人。 “截至目前，我们没有理由浪费时间对我们没有利于我们的合作伙伴，”Deshmukh说。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/how-yelp-is-planning-a-comeback-with-reservations-and-pickup-tools/">https://www.modernretail.co/platforms/how-yelp-is-planning-a-comeback-with-reservations-and-pickup-tools/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/planning/">#planning</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/yelp/">#yelp</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
