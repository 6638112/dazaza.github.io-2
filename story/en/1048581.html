A few hours before, he had eaten a breakfast of pancakes, two bowls of cereal, no milk, his final meal in prison.</p><p>费城-在本月初一个积雪的早晨，乔·利贡（Joe Ligon）从律师的车上走下来，步态刻意而稳重，头发像棉花一样洁白。几个小时前，他吃了一顿薄煎饼早餐，两碗麦片，没有牛奶，最后一顿进了监狱。</p><p>  “This is no sad day for me,” he said. “Feel real good. Like a dream come true. I anticipated this from Day One.”</p><p>  他说：“对我来说这不是悲伤的一天。” “感觉真的很好。梦想成真。我从第一天就开始预料到这一点。”</p><p>    The son of Alabama sharecroppers, Ligon entered prison when Eisenhower was president. During the 68 years he spent incarcerated in a half-dozen penal institutions, the world outside moved on. At the one-day trial in 1953, Ligon and his co-defendants were referred to as “colored.” At school, his special-education classes were designated for the “orthogenically backward.” He was incarcerated in a facility named the Pennsylvania Institution for Defective Delinquents, the inmates classified by the courts “as mentally defective with criminal tendencies.”</p><p>    艾贡·阿拉贡的农作物之子，艾贡豪森（Eisenhower）担任总统时，利贡入狱。在他68年监禁在六个刑事机构中的68年中，外面的世界继续前进。在1953年的为期一天的审判中，利贡及其同案被称为“有色人种”。在学校，他的特殊教育班级被指定为“后生型”。他被关押在一家名为“宾夕法尼亚州违法犯罪者协会”的设施中，该设施被法院分类为“精神上有犯罪倾向的人”。</p><p>  Ligon, 83, has never had his own place, paid a bill, cast a ballot, earned the minimum wage, lived with a partner, fathered children.</p><p>  现年83岁的利贡从未有过自己的住所，付账，投票，赚取最低工资，与伴侣，育儿一起生活。</p><p>    While he was locked up, almost all of his family died; many of the men were murdered. A sister, some nieces and nephews are all he has left. This was his central sadness: “It would have been much better if I had come out when my parents were still alive,” he said.</p><p>    当他被关起来时，几乎他的整个家庭都死了。许多人被谋杀。他只剩下一个姐姐，一些侄女和侄子。这是他的中心悲伤：“如果我在父母还活着的时候出来，那会好得多。”他说。</p><p>  Ligon was 15 on that wretched night when everything went wrong. Now, he is an old man with few teeth — but an old man who is free and, given the circumstances, in remarkably good health. He doesn’t take any pills except vitamins.</p><p>  那天出事了，那不幸的夜晚，利贡只有15岁。现在，他是一个牙齿很少的老人，但是他是一个自由的老人，在有条件的情况下，身体非常健康。除了维生素他不吃任何药。</p><p>  “I feel real good. One reason for that is because I’m out. I’m home,” Ligon said. “When you get life, you have no hope, especially if you give up. You don’t make plans like I made plans.” His plans were always to be free.</p><p>  “我感觉真的很好。原因之一是因为我不在。我回家了，”利贡说。 “当你得到生活时，你没有希望，特别是如果你放弃了。您制定的计划不像我制定的计划。”他的计划永远是免费的。 </p><p>  That February night, Ligon and four other teenagers drained two bottles of wine, ripped through the streets of South Philadelphia near his home and stabbed eight men, two of whom died. It was the first time he ever drank, he has said. They were teens, being stupid and then horrible. The murders made all the front pages, the teens were dubbed “The Head Hunters,” though Ligon insisted “we were no gang.”</p><p>那个二月的夜晚，利贡和其他四个少年倒掉了两瓶酒，在他家附近的南费城街头撕开，刺伤了八个人，其中两人死亡。他说，这是他第一次喝酒。他们是十几岁，很愚蠢，然后又很恐怖。谋杀案登上了头版，十几岁的孩子被称为“猎头者”，尽管利贡坚称“我们不是帮派”。</p><p>    His lawyers instructed him to plead guilty to the facts, leaving the judge to determine the crimes. Ligon admitted to stabbing one victim who survived. He always contended that he did not kill anyone. Ligon was sentenced to life in prison with no chance of ever getting out.</p><p>    他的律师指示他对事实认罪，由法官来决定罪行。利贡承认刺伤了一名幸存的受害者。他一直争辩说他没有杀死任何人。利贡被判处无期徒刑，没有机会脱身。</p><p>  Since then, all of his co-defendants have been released except one who died in prison.</p><p>  从那以后，他的所有共同被告都被释放，除了一名在监狱中死亡的人。</p><p>  The United States has long led the world in incarcerating juveniles for life without possibility of parole, known as JLWOP. The practice was condemned by human rights and civil liberties organizations, questioned based on growing research on adolescent brain development and ultimately ruled cruel and unusual punishment — a violation of the Eighth Amendment —  in a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions between 2005 and 2016.</p><p>  长期以来，美国一直在监禁无生命的未成年人监禁世界，这一活动被称为JLWOP。该做法遭到人权和公民自由组织的谴责，并根据对青少年大脑发育的不断研究而受到质疑，并最终在2005年至2016年间美国最高法院的一系列裁决中裁定了残酷和不寻常的惩罚-违反了《第八修正案》。</p><p>  Pennsylvania has long led the country in juvenile “lifers,” by far, with more than 525 of them in 2016, around a quarter of the total. Sixty percent of those prisoners were from Philadelphia, the nation’s poorest big city, and the overwhelming majority of them were Black.</p><p>  到目前为止，宾夕法尼亚州一直是少年“救生员”的领先国家，2016年有525多个，占总数的四分之一。这些囚犯中有60％来自美国最贫穷的大城市费城，其中绝大多数是黑人。</p><p>  It cost the state an estimated $3 million to lock up Ligon for so long, excluding 37 treatments for prostate cancer. He is now in remission. Correctional departments spend far more incarcerating elderly prisoners because of their health needs, even though they’re less of a danger to society.</p><p>  该州锁定Ligon的时间花费了大约300万美元，这不包括37种前列腺癌治疗方法。他现在处于缓解状态。尽管他们对社会的威胁较小，但由于他们的健康需要，惩教部门在监禁方面花费更多。</p><p>  Ligon broke every unenviable record, becoming the nation’s oldest, longest-serving juvenile lifer. He is a symbol of this tragic legal legacy. But Ligon is also an octogenarian grappling with fresh challenges as he reenters a modern world that he barely knows.</p><p>  利贡（Ligon）打破了所有令人羡慕的记录，成为美国历史最悠久，服务时间最长的少年。他是这一悲剧性法律遗产的象征。但是，利贡在重新进入一个鲜为人知的现代世界时，也是一位八十年代人，正面临着新的挑战。 </p><p>      He left prison with 14 cardboard boxes, half of them stuffed with legal papers. They are among his dearest worldly possessions, the paper trail of his protracted confinement, though he can barely read.</p><p>他带着14个纸箱离开监狱，其中一半装满了法律文件。它们是他最珍贵的世俗财产之一，尽管他勉强识字，但仍是他长期监禁的纸迹。</p><p>  He is guilty of robbery and assault, said public defender Bradley Bridge, Ligon’s lawyer of 15 years who has made the release of juvenile lifers a mission, “but he is not guilty of any homicide. He deserved appropriate punishment. But this is particularly disproportionate punishment for someone not guilty of homicide.”</p><p>  利贡（Ligon）从事15年律师的公共辩护人布拉德利·布里奇（Bradley Bridge）说，他犯有抢劫和殴打罪，但他并未犯任何凶杀罪。他应受到适当的惩罚。但这对没有犯杀人罪的人来说是特别不相称的惩罚。”</p><p>  What was singularly cruel about sentencing juveniles to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Bridge said, “is it denied them their humanity. It denies them their ability to change, to demonstrate that they can get out of prison and be contributing members of society.”</p><p>  布里奇说，将未成年人判处无期徒刑在监狱中是极其残酷的，“是因为这剥夺了他们的人性。它剥夺了他们的改变能力，证明他们可以脱离监狱并成为社会的一员。”</p><p>  Ligon’s case seemed egregious to Bridge, 67. He said, “To be very clear, as I read the transcript, if this went to trial today, Joe Ligon would be found guilty of robbery, aggravated assault or attempted murder, and he would have gotten a sentence of five to 10 years.”</p><p>  Ligon的案子对67岁的Bridge来说似乎是惊人的。他说：“要很清楚，当我阅读笔录时，如果今天将其审判，乔·利根将被判犯有抢劫罪，加重殴打罪或谋杀未遂罪，他将被判处五到十年的徒刑。”</p><p>    In 2016, after the Supreme Court ruled that all juvenile lifers had to get new sentences, Ligon became eligible for one that would permit his release on parole.</p><p>    2016年，在最高法院裁定所有未成年犯必须获得新的判决后，利贡有资格获得一个可以假释的条件。</p><p>  But parole was anathema to Ligon. He wanted to be done with what he called “the long tail” of the law and refused.</p><p>  但是假释令利贡感到厌恶。他想用他所谓的法律的“长尾巴”来做，因此拒绝了。</p><p>  Bridge told Ligon that he could fight parole from the cellblock or the street and advised the street.</p><p>  布里奇告诉利贡，他可以与牢房或街道上的假释作斗争，并建议街道。 </p><p>  At a status hearing the following spring, the judge told him, “I don’t want you to die in prison.”</p><p>在次年春天的一次听证会上，法官告诉他：“我不想让你死在监狱里。”</p><p>    That first morning after his release, he sat in his lawyer’s office — he had come directly from prison, with a stop for a rapid  coronavirus test (negative). “I am a stubborn type of person. I’ve been that way since I was able to talk,” he said.</p><p>    获释后的第一天早上，他坐在律师的办公室里-他是直接从监狱来的，停下来进行快速的冠状病毒检测（阴性）。 “我是一个固执的人。自从我能够讲话以来，我一直都这样。”他说。</p><p>  He didn’t want to have to ask permission to travel to New Jersey to visit his sister and niece. After so many years, he wanted to be free of supervision.</p><p>  他不想获得许可前往新泽西探望姐姐和侄女。这么多年后，他希望摆脱监督。</p><p>  “My case don’t call for no parole after being in for so long,” Ligon said. “I want to be free the right way, the proper way.”</p><p>  利贡说：“我的案子待了这么长时间，不要求不假释。” “我想以正确的方式，正确的方式自由。”</p><p>  Bridge re-litigated the case on Ligon’s terms, requesting that he be freed without parole. In November, a judge ruled that Ligon could be released within 90 days, which happened this month.</p><p>  布里奇以利贡的条款重新审理了此案，要求他免假释。 11月，法官裁定Ligon可以在90天内获释，而本月发生了这种情况。</p><p>    Ligon’s freedom came with its own headaches for both his social workers and an inmate reentry program. Housing, health insurance, proper identification and more, everything required to live a legal life outside, necessitated working with more than 10 separate agencies. Ligon was given a wallet, his own television with a sports package (he loves all Philly teams, provided they are winning) and a phone with unlimited minutes.</p><p>    Ligon的自由让他的社工和一个犯人重返社会都感到头疼。住房，健康保险，适当的身份证明等，以及在外部生活以合法生活所需的一切，必须与十多个独立机构合作。利贡得到了一个钱包，自己的电视和体育节目包（他爱所有费城球队，只要他们获胜）和一部无限通话的电话。</p><p>  His niece, Valerie, the daughter of Ligon’s ailing sister, plans to be a constant in his life, as he has been in hers. She was there to greet Ligon hours after his release.</p><p>  他的侄女瓦莱丽（Valerie）是利贡病s的姐姐的女儿，他计划像他一样生活在他的身边。释放利昂之后的几个小时，她在那里与他打招呼。 </p><p>  “It will not be easy, but he is so happy,” she said. “This is all new. Our world is so foreign to him.”</p><p>她说：“这并不容易，但是他很高兴。” “这是全新的。我们的世界对他来说是如此陌生。”</p><p>  A couple with a two-story West Philadelphia rowhouse, contracted caregivers with an agency that cares for older citizens, agreed to take him in.</p><p>  一对夫妇和一栋两层楼的西费城联排别墅，与一家照顾老年人的机构签定了看护人协议，同意将他收留。</p><p>  Ligon’s first day was momentous, too, for the many people who have helped him: Team Joe. After the stop at Bridge’s office, Bridge drove Ligon to his new home, where his family and support team celebrated on the street and then inside the tidy home. Among his advocates was John Pace, 52, a former juvenile lifer who knew Ligon for two decades in Graterford prison. He earned a bachelor’s degree from Villanova University and works for the Youth Sentencing &amp; Reentry Project (YSRP).</p><p>  对于许多帮助过他的人，利贡的第一天也很重要：乔队。在Bridge的办公室停下来之后，Bridge开车将Ligon带到他的新家，他的家人和支持团队在街上然后在整洁的房子里庆祝。他的拥护者中包括现年52岁的约翰·佩斯（John Pace），他是一名少年少年，在格拉特福德监狱认识利贡已有二十年。他获得了维拉诺瓦大学（Villanova University）的学士学位，并为“青少年判刑与青少年”计划工作。再入项目（YSRP）。</p><p>  On the narrow side street of his new home, Pace met Ligon, who was still wearing his beaten maroon cap from the yard. This was not the attire befitting a free man, Pace told him.</p><p>  在他的新房子的狭窄小巷上，佩斯遇到了利根，后者仍戴着从院子里被殴打的栗色帽子。佩斯告诉他，这不是适合自由人的服装。</p><p>  “That was a prison hat. What is Joe doing with that hat on?” asked Pace, incredulous.</p><p>  “那是一顶监狱帽。乔戴着那顶帽子在做什么？”佩斯问，难以置信。</p><p>  Ligon stopped, hurled the cap on the ground and commenced stomping, an act that would have never been allowed in prison. Team Joe all stomped on the cap. Later, Ligon tossed it in the trash and donned a new Flyers hat instead, a fresh start.</p><p>  利贡停下脚步，将帽子扔在地上，开始踩踏，这在监狱中是绝对不允许的。乔队所有人都踩在盖帽上。后来，利贡把它扔进了垃圾桶，戴上了新的飞人帽子，这是一个崭新的开始。</p><p>      “I’m telling you that was maybe the high point of my entire career,” said Eleanor Myers, a YSRP senior adviser and law professor emerita. “Because it was freedom.”</p><p>      YSRP高级顾问兼法学教授埃里塔（Ereita）埃莉诺·迈尔斯（Eleanor Myers）说：“我告诉你，这也许是我整个职业生涯的顶峰。 “因为那是自由。” </p><p>    His new home is “beautiful. It’s clean. I walked in, I could smell the freshness,” he said. He was too excited to eat.</p><p>他的新家“美丽。很干净我走进去，闻到了新鲜的味道，”他说。他太激动了，无法吃饭。</p><p>  “Everything looks different to me. It’s all new to me,” he said. During the stop at his lawyer’s office, Ligon looked out the eighth-floor window, two blocks from the courtroom where he was convicted in 1953, and claimed to have never before been up this high in any building. “I’m glad I lived long enough to see this,” he said.</p><p>  “对我来说，一切看起来都不同。这对我来说是全新的，”他说。在律师办公室的停留期间，利贡从8楼的窗户向外望去，距离他在1953年被定罪的法庭只有两个街区，并声称此举从未有过如此高的记录。他说：“我很高兴能活到如此长的时间，看到了这一点。”</p><p>    Ligon calls himself a loner, and his former fellow inmates describe “Mr. Joe” as quiet, someone who kept to himself. He worked as a custodian in prison. Cleaning is his thing. He loves pushing a broom — that, and maintaining good habits.</p><p>    利贡自称独来独往，他的前囚徒形容“乔”安静而自言自语。他在监狱里当过监护人。清洁是他的事。他喜欢推扫帚-并保持良好的习惯。</p><p>  But Ligon luxuriates in attention and sharing his story. When I first met him  for a column in 2010, Ligon talked uninterrupted for five hours. Unbidden, he will speak at length of the night that ended his former life, as though he’s still mounting a defense.</p><p>  但是Ligon忙于关注并分享他的故事。当我在2010年第一次见到他参加专栏文章时，Ligon连续讲话了五个小时。不被禁止，他会在结束前世的那一整夜里说话，好像他仍在进行防御。</p><p>  He asked that he not be relocated to his old South Philadelphia neighborhood, a half-mile from where he was sitting and since gentrified. He wants nothing to do with the place.</p><p>  他要求不要搬迁到他旧的南费城居民区，距他坐的地方半英里，自那以后变得高档。他不希望与这个地方有任何关系。</p><p>  “The night I got in trouble was in South Philadelphia. My baby brother was murdered in South Philadelphia. My father was murdered in South Philadelphia,” he said. “Nothing but murder, murder, murder.”</p><p>  “我遇到麻烦的那天晚上是在南费城。我的弟弟在南费城被谋杀。我父亲在南费城被谋杀。”他说。 “只不过是谋杀，谋杀，谋杀。”</p><p>  On his second day of his new life, Ligon went shopping for a down coat, some new pants and undergarments. The stores had become so big, so bright. After 36 hours of no food, Pace finally got Ligon to eat in his car: Popeyes chicken, mashed potatoes and coleslaw.</p><p>  在新生活的第二天，利贡去买羽绒服，一些新的裤子和内衣。商店变得如此庞大，如此明亮。禁食36个小时后，佩斯终于让利贡去了他的车：Popeyes鸡肉，土豆泥和凉拌卷心菜。 </p><p>    Ligon outlived many of the prisons that housed him. Graterford, his longest home, closed in 2018. In his youth, he was a boxer in the vaunted program at Holmesburg, which was decommissioned in 1995,  Bernard Hopkins its most famed pugilist alum. Ligon was at one point held for evaluation  in Eastern State Penitentiary, which opened in 1829 and once held Al Capone and bank robber Willie Sutton. Shuttered in 1971, it is now a historic site and home to the annual Halloween attraction “Terror Behind the Walls.”</p><p>利贡（Ligon）在他的许多监狱中活了下来。最长的家格拉特福德（Graterford）于2018年关闭。在他年轻的时候，他曾是霍姆斯堡（Holmesburg）吹牛项目的拳击手，该项目于1995年退役，伯纳德·霍普金斯（Bernard Hopkins）是最著名的拳击手明矾。利贡当时曾在东部州立监狱中进行评估，该监狱于1829年开业，曾经是Al Capone和银行抢劫犯Willie Sutton。它于1971年被关闭，如今已成为历史古迹，并且是年度万圣节景点“墙后的恐怖”的所在地。</p><p>  Ligon has no intention of visiting and declined to take part in an exhibit. He said, “That don’t suit my taste.”</p><p>  利贡无意参观，并拒绝参加展览。他说：“那不适合我的口味。”</p><p>  School was never a vital part of his life. He rarely went to class in Troy, Ala., where he picked cotton and tobacco, preferring to spend time with his parents as a self-professed mama’s boy. When he was 13, the family moved north to South Philadelphia. His father found work as a mechanic, his mother as a nurse’s aide. He floundered in school. In prison, he did not take classes to advance his rudimentary reading or writing. He asked fellow inmates to type or write letters for him and to read the ones he received.</p><p>  学校从来不是他生活中至关重要的部分。他很少去阿拉巴马州特洛伊（Troy）上课，在那里他拾棉花和烟草，宁愿与父母陪伴，作为一个自称是妈妈的男孩。他13岁时，一家人北移至南费城。他的父亲是技工，母亲是护士的助手。他在学校挣扎。在监狱里，他没有上课来提高基本的阅读或写作能力。他要求囚犯为他打打字或写信，并阅读他收到的信。</p><p>  Now, Ligon hopes to work, preferably cleaning one of the offices of the people who assisted in his release. Pace plans to get him a membership at a local gym. When the weather improves, Ligon wants to visit local parks. He looks forward to restaurants where he is free to select “good food from a menu.” He dreams of choices.</p><p>  现在，利贡希望工作，最好是清理协助他获释的人的办公室之一。佩斯计划让他成为当地一家体育馆的会员。天气好转时，利贡想参观当地的公园。他期待在餐馆里自由选择“菜单上的好食物”。他梦想着选择。</p><p>    “There are going to be a lot of ladies who are going to like me,” he said. “I like good clothes that fit me. I like to smell good. I’m going to make it my business to do that. I’m going to respect women.”</p><p>    他说：“会有很多女士喜欢我。” “我喜欢适合我的好衣服。我喜欢闻起来很香。我要做那件事是我的事。我要尊重女人。”</p><p>  He is even willing to return to prison to speak with juvenile lifers still inside.</p><p>  他甚至愿意回到监狱与仍在里面的未成年生命者讲话。</p><p>  “We’ve been to hell and back,” he said. “But I like my chances in terms of survival.”</p><p>  他说：“我们去过地狱。” “但是我喜欢生存的机会。” </p><p>  In West Philadelphia, Ligon stopped with Pace in front of a mural created by inmates at Graterford. Mark Cumberbatch, a prison sergeant, recognized Ligon and came over to welcome him to the neighborhood. “He was always quiet, a good guy,” Cumberbatch said.</p><p>在西费城，里根（Ligon）和佩斯（Pace）停在格拉特福德（Graterford）囚犯创作的壁画前。监狱中士马克·康伯巴奇（Mark Cumberbatch）认出了利贡，并过来欢迎他到附近。 “他总是很安静，一个好人，”坎伯巴奇说。</p><p>  That’s what Ligon has become: prison-famous. Bridge’s daughter is making a documentary about Ligon’s life. News outlets, including CNN and German television, have called.</p><p>  这就是Ligon变成的：著名的监狱。布里奇（Bridge）的女儿正在制作一部关于利贡（Ligon）生活的纪录片。包括CNN和德国电视台在内的新闻媒体已经致电。</p><p>  His first night out, Ligon didn’t sleep any better than his last night in, even without the sirens and glaring lights that, for decades, woke him at 6 a.m.</p><p>  在他的第一个晚上，即使没有警报器和刺眼的灯光，数十年来在早上6点醒来的时候，利贡也没有比前一晚睡得更好。</p><p>    “That’s an adjustment. You have to get used to governing your own life. Your life’s been controlled for so long,” said Pace, sitting with Ligon in a back pew of Bible Way Baptist Church, his place of worship, which he hopes Ligon will attend. “This is going to take some time to learn exactly what he wants to do.”</p><p>    “这是一种调整。您必须习惯于控制自己的生活。佩斯与利贡一起坐在他的礼拜场所圣经之路浸信会教堂的后座子里，佩斯说，他希望利贡能够参加。 “这将需要一些时间来确切地了解他想做什么。”</p><p>    “For so long, you live a certain way,” he said. “You get immune to change. Your system gets immune to it. No better way that I can describe it than that.” The goal, he said, is “to live as normal a life as I possibly can.”</p><p>    他说：“长期以来，你过着一定的生活方式。” “您可以免疫变化。您的系统对此免疫。没有比这更好的描述方式了。”他说，目标是“尽可能地过正常的生活。”</p><p>  One of his first requests was an alarm clock, which Bridge bought for him at a CVS the morning of his release.
