its seventh early-stage European and Israeli fund also at $650 million and its sixth global growth stage fund at $1.75 billion. The latter fund is in addition, and designed to complement, a  previously unannounced   $2.3 billion global \u201cLeaders\u201d fund that is focused on later-stage investing \u00a0that Accel closed in December.\n  Accel expects to invest in about 20 to 30 companies per fund on average, according to Partner Rich Wong. Its average investment in its growth fund will be in the $50 million to $75 million range, and $75 million and $100 million out of its global Leaders fund.\n But the firm is also still eager and \u201cexcited\u201d to incubate companies, Wong said.\n \u201cWe\u2019ll still write $500,000 to $1 million seed checks,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to work with companies from the very beginning and support them through their entire journey.\u201d\n Indeed, as TechCrunch recently reported, Accel has a history of backing companies that were previously bootstrapped (and often profitable) -\u2013 the latest example being  Lower, a Columbus, Ohio-based fintech, which just raised a  $100 million Series A.\n Interestingly, Accel is often referred to some of these companies by existing portfolio companies (also in the case of Lower, whose CEO was referred to Accel by Galileo Clay Wilkes). More often than not, companies that Accel backs out of its early-stage and growth funds are bootstrapped and located outside of Silicon Valley.\n The venture firm has long looked outside of Silicon Valley for opportunities, and has had offices not only in the Bay Area, but in London and Bangalore for years. Part of its investment thesis is to \u201cinvest early and locally,\u201d according to Wong. Examples of this philosophy include investments in companies based all over the world \u2014 from Mexico to Stockholm to Tel Aviv to Munich.\n Since the time of its last fund closure in 2019, the firm has seen 10 portfolio companies go public, including  Slack, Austin-based Bumble, Bucharest-based UiPath, CrowdStrike, PagerDuty, Deliveroo and  Squarespace, among others.\n  It also had 40 companies experience an M&amp;A, including Utah-based Qualtrics\u2019s $8 billion acquisition by SAP and Segment\u2019s $3.2 billion acquisition by Twilio. Also, just last week, Rockwell Automation announced it was   buying Michigan-based Plex Systems  for  $2.22 billion in cash. Accel first invested in Plex, which has developed a subscription-based smart manufacturing platform, in 2012.\n Recent investments include a number of fintech companies such as LatAm\u2019s  Flink, Berlin-based  Trade Republic,  Unit and Robinhood rival  Public. Accel has also backed as existing portfolio companies such as  Webflow, a software company that helps businesses build no-code websites and events startup  Hopin.\n   \u201cFor example, we\u2019ll look at automation companies, consumer businesses and security companies, but at a global scale. Our goal is to find the best entrepreneurs regardless of where they are,\u201d she said.\n That has only been intensified by the recent rise of the smartphone and cloud, Wong said.\n \u201cBefore, companies were mostly selling to the consumer in their own country,\u201d he added. \u201cBut now the size of the market is so dramatically bigger, allowing them to become even larger, which is one of the reasons why I believe we\u2019re seeing investment pace at this speed.\u201d\n To support this, it\u2019s notable that Accel\u2019s global Leaders fund is \u201cdramatically\u201d larger than the $500 million Leaders fund the firm closed in 2019.\n Also, de Rycker points out, companies are staying private longer so the opportunity to invest in them until they sell or go public is greater.\n Accel is also patient. In some cases, the firm\u2019s investors will develop \u201cyears-long\u201d relationships with companies they are courting.\n \u201c1Password is an example of this approach,\u201d Wong said. \u201cArun [Mathew] had that relationship for at least six years before that investment was made. Finally, 1Password called and said \u2018We\u2019re ready, and we want you to do it.\u2019 \u201d\n And so Accel led the Canadian company\u2019s first external round of funding in its 14-year history \u2014  a $200 million Series A \u2014 in 2019.\n While the firm is open-minded, there are still some industries it has not yet embraced as much as others. For example, Wong said, \u201cWe\u2019re not announcing a $2.2 billion crypto fund, but we have done crypto investments, and see some very interesting trends there. We\u2019ll look at where crypto takes us.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:18:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,\u9636\u6bb5,stage", "title": "Accel\u5ba3\u5e03\u7b2c\u5341\u4e94\u6b21\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u57fa\u91d1\uff0c\u4e03\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e03\u5c4a\u6b27\u6d32\u548c\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u57fa\u91d1\u4e3a6.5\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u7b2c\u516d\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u589e\u957f\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u91d1\u4e3a1.75\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "Accel announces fifteenth early-stage US fund at $650M, seventh early-stage European and Israeli fund at $650M, and sixth global growth stage fund at $1.75B", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/accel-closes-on-3b-across-three-funds/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u9636\u6bb5", "stage"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2bedc5c16cfa82d8369d66f1bf97a11a.png", "infoid": 1068557, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u4e86\u89e3\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u7a7a\u57df\u53ef\u4ee5\u68d8\u624b\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5927\u57ce\u5e02\u3002\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u5b57\u6bcd\u8868\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4ed8\u5b50\u516c\u53f8\u7ffc\u5ba3\u5e03\u5b83\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u5728Google Play\u548ciOS App Store\u4e0a\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86OpenSky\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\n   \u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e8e2019\u5e74\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u7231\u597d\u8005\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u9a71\u52a8\u5668\u98de\u884c\u5458\uff0c\u6c11\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40\uff08Casa\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002 U.S.\u7248\u672c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7FAA\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u7684\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u6388\u6743\u548c\u901a\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff08LANC\uff09\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\n \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u53ef\u4ee5\u7533\u8bf7\u6279\u51c6\u5728\u50cf\u5468\u56f4\u5730\u533a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8425\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u51e0\u5929\u6216\u51e0\u5468\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n \u201c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e00\u4e2a\u6295\u8d44\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4ed8\u516c\u53f8\uff1f\u201d\u7ffc\u5728\u535a\u5ba2\u5e16\u5b50\u4e2d\u4fee\u6574\u95ee\u9053\u3002 \u201c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u8fd1200\u4e07\u767b\u8bb0\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u9075\u5b88\u5c06\u4f7f\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u5206\u4eab\u5929\u7a7a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u6269\u5927\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u7528\u9014\u548c\u76ca\u5904 - \u5728\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5546\u4e1a\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4ed8\u4e2d - \u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4eba\u3002\u201c ", "note_en": "Knowing precisely where the nearest open airspace is can get tricky, particularly in large cities like New York. Today, Alphabet\u2019s drone-delivery subsidiary Wing announced that it\u2019s launching its OpenSky app in the U.S. on Google Play and the iOS App Store.\n   The app was launched in Australia back in 2019 for both hobbyist and commercial drone pilots, with help from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). The U.S. version was created with input from the FAA for operation in Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC) airspaces.\n Using the app, drone operators can request approval to operate in spaces like those around areas, expediting a process that would traditionally take days or weeks to go through.\n \u201cWhy is a drone delivery company investing in an operator app?\u201d Wing asks rhetorically in a blog post. \u201cBecause with nearly two million registered drones in the U.S. already, regulatory compliance of all drones will allow them to share the sky safely. Moreover, compliance will ultimately expand the uses and benefits of drones \u2014 among them emergency response, commercial inspections and contactless delivery \u2014 to more people.\u201d",

", "note_en": "At first blush, it may seem like a textbook example of a startup idea destined never to get anywhere. By definition, any new search engine competes with Google, whose 90 percent-plus market share leaves little oxygen for other players. And we\u2019ve been accustomed to getting our search for free since well  before there was a Google\u2014which might make paying for it sound like being expected to purchase a phone book.\n But  Neeva is indeed a new search engine, officially launching today, that carries a subscription fee. Though it\u2019s extremely similar to Google in many respects\u2014with a few twists of its own\u2014it dumps the web giant\u2019s venerable ad-based business model in the interest of avoiding distractions, privacy quandaries, and other compromises. It\u2019s free for three months\u2014long enough for users to grow accustomed to it without obligation\u2014and $4.95 a month thereafter. Apps for iPhones and iPads, and browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Brave, are part of the deal.\n Neeva may have a certain whiff of improbability about it, but its cofounders,  Sridhar Ramaswamy and Vivek Raghunathan, are the furthest thing from na\u00effs. Two long-time Google executives with more than a quarter-century of experience at the web giant between them, they have an insider\u2019s understanding of how it operates. Moreover, about 30 percent of the roughly 60-person staff they\u2019ve assembled at Neeva consists of ex-Googlers, including Hall-of-Famers such as Udi Manber (a former head of Google search) and Darin Fisher (one of the inventors of Chrome). They\u2019ve also secured $77.5 million in funding, including investments from venture-capital titans Greylock and Sequoia.\n  At its highest level, Neeva represents a bet that the way Google monetizes search and other services through advertising\u2014as it\u2019s done for more than two decades to wildly profitable effect\u2014has hampered its user experience, thereby opening up an opportunity. \u201cI tell people that Neeva is as much a social experiment as it is a technological experiment,\u201d says Ramaswamy, the company\u2019s CEO. \u201cIt\u2019s looking for the answer to the question, \u2018If there was a high-quality product that clearly benefits you in multiple ways, would you pay for it as opposed to having it be free, supported by ads?&#39;\u201d\n Whatever the answer to that question, Neeva\u2019s creators understand what they\u2019re getting into. \u201cSridhar and Vivek, with their depth of knowledge on everything from technology to what people actually need and do, are probably the only people in the world where I would go, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll go on this journey with you, because you know how to go on this journey,&#39;\u201d says Greylock partner and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman.\n (Which is not to say there aren\u2019t other ambitious privacy-centric search engines on journeys at least somewhat similar to Neeva\u2019s. DuckDuckGo has been on its own for 13 years;  once a one-man operation, it now has  129 employees and $100 million in annual revenue from ads that don\u2019t involve tracking individual users. And Brave, the browser company  founded by web pioneer Brendan Eich, is beta-testing its own  privacy-first search engine and says free and for-pay versions will be available.)\n  Looming antitrust case aside, it\u2019s not that Google is all that obviously vulnerable. Over the years, unlike some products with monopolistic market share\u2014 Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer comes to mind\u2014the search behemoth hasn\u2019t calcified through lack of competition. Instead, it remains the category\u2019s\u00a0 leading engine of innovation: Google says that it  rolled out 4,500 improvements\u00a0last year alone.\n But  some of the downsides of Google\u2019s dependence on ad revenues are right before our eyes. Once famously unobtrusive, the ads displayed with search results have gradually migrated from the right column to the top of search results, multiplied in number and size, and lost the shaded box that isolated them from organic results. Today, for many searches, ads all but crowd the organic results off the screen until you scroll downwards. For others, links to Google\u2019s own money-making services, such as Google Flights, get prime real estate.\n  Then there\u2019s the fact that Google  builds profiles of its users based on their online activity, the better to precisely target them with advertising not only at its own sites but all the other ones across the web whose ads are powered by Google. With no ads to serve up, Neeva shouldn\u2019t leave privacy-conscious types feeling like they\u2019re being monitored for ulterior purposes. (By default, Neeva does hold onto your searches for 90 days to improve the quality of features such as autosuggestions, but you can erase this log or tell the service you don\u2019t want it to keep it in the first place.)\n  In another break from search-engine tradition, Neeva says that it will  turn at least 20 percent of its top-line revenue over to publishing partners, including the first two it\u2019s announced, Quora and Medium. Though the details of where this could lead remain vague, it\u2019s another attempt to set Neeva apart from Google, which has often been accused of benefiting from media outlets\u2019 content without adequate compensation, a long-simmering dispute that has led to  lawsuits and  legislation. (After years of controversy, Google can at least point to the fact that it\u2019s  spending $1 billion on programs involving giving money to news outlets.)\n  Ramaswamy and Raghunathan tend to frame their discomfort about Google\u2019s business model in polite terms. One of Neeva\u2019s investors\u2014NYU professor, author, and entrepreneur  Scott Galloway\u2014isn\u2019t so circumspect. As you might expect of someone who has  called for the breakup of Google and other tech giants, he\u2019s withering in his analysis of Google and enthusiastic about the possibility of an upstart like Neeva chipping away at its pervasiveness.\n \u201cThe addictive nature of search, of getting answers at your fingertips or connecting with people, that\u2019s sort of the nicotine,\u201d says Galloway. \u201cIt\u2019s bad for you, it\u2019s addictive, but it doesn\u2019t give you cancer. The thing that gives you cancer, the tobacco, if you will, is the ad model. Because ultimately, over time, all you\u2019re focused on is gathering more data on the consumer so that you can further monetize him or her. And where it ends up is where you are now with Google, where Google no longer takes you to the best place based on your query, but to another place they can further monetize.\u201d\n  Galloway emphasizes that he put money into Neeva mostly because he thinks it\u2019s a smart investment. At the same time, he adds, \u201cI want to be a small part of the effort to try and release the stranglehold that Google has on content discovery. I think it leads to very bad places.\u201d\n Even if you\u2019re nowhere near as agitated over Google\u2019s dominance and practices as Galloway is, you might find yourself rooting for for what Neeva is trying to accomplish. Search \u201cis a phenomenal daily habit that has transformed how we live,\u201d says Neeva board member Margo Georgiadis, herself a former high-ranking Googler who ran the company\u2019s commercial and ad operations in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. \u201cBut there\u2019s an opportunity with how we\u2019ve evolved the way we live our lives and use technology to make it much, much better if your business model is aligned 100 percent with the consumer.\u201d\n It\u2019s hard to bring up ad-subsidized services from big tech companies without someone helpfully reminding you that if  you\u2019re not paying for the product, you are the product. With Neeva\u2019s subscription-based model, the product is unquestionably the product. It just needs to be a compelling one\u2014even though its team is small and the competition has a 23-year head start.\n  In a way, the Neeva story begins in 2003. That\u2019s when Ramaswamy joined Google and was put to work on its still-nascent advertising team. Placing targeted text ads next to search results was already proving to be a powerful idea, but \u201clittle did I, or most others, realize that this would be one of the largest businesses ever,\u201d he remembers. He devoted the next fifteen years to the engineering side of that growth, eventually overseeing 10,000 Googlers as senior VP of ads and commerce.\n But by the latter part of that time, he was developing qualms about the whole proposition of monetizing eyeballs through targeted ads all around the web, as Google was doing. \u201cOne of the things that I paid a lot of attention to is how data was separated between off-Google experiences and on-Google experiences,\u201d he explains. \u201cTo me, keeping that data separate was an important part of the promise that Google implicitly made to its users.\u201d Increasingly, however, he found himself having to consent to compromises such as users\u2019 Google searches influencing the ads they saw on YouTube.\n \u201cWe tried to be thoughtful about how information flowed around, but it was also very clear where things were pointed at,\u201d Ramaswamy says. Having had his fill of the dilemmas associated with the ad business, he explored the possibility of pivoting to a different role within Google. Ultimately, \u201cI decided that a clean start was what I needed,\u2019 he says.\n  After quitting Google in the fall of 2018, he thought he\u2019d found that clean start as a venture capitalist at Greylock. The conflict between ad-based business models and serving users remained on his mind, though. Thinking about it took him down the path that would lead to Neeva.\n Soon, he was joined in this exploration by Raghunathan, who\u2019d had an impressive Google career of his own. In the middle of it, he\u2019d worked on  Google Now, an initiative to make search more anticipatory that later evolved into the Google Assistant. He says that he found shaping the future of search to be exhilarating, but nonetheless then \u201cwent over to the dark side, and I monetized YouTube.\u201d\n Like Ramaswamy, Raghunathan wrestled with the effect that business pressures had on user experiences. Marketers love to reinforce their messaging by exposing consumers to the same ad over and over and over. YouTube fans rankle at such repetition. Guess whose interests won out? \u201cWe\u2019d have these well-intentioned conversations around trading off users\u2019 happiness for customer value,\u201d Raghunathan recounts.\n  Still at Google, Raghunathan chatted with Ramaswamy about the startup idea the latter was formulating. \u201cI remember him telling me this insight, this string he was pulling on,\u201d says Raghunathan. \u201cThat you could not reimagine search the product without reimagining the business model that underpins search.\u201d Eager to join that effort, Raghunathan left Google after almost 12 years to become Neeva\u2019s cofounder.\n (Why the name \u201cNeeva?\u201d Raghunathan cheerfully admits that they chose it, then backfilled in a rationale: \u201cIn hindsight, there is a story we can tell about Neeva, in Sanskrit, meaning \u2018fundamentals\u2019 or \u2018the basics.\u2019 It actually means something that is very core to our mission. But I\u2019d be lying if I told you we knew that.\u201d)\n As Ramaswamy and Raghunathan recruited a team, they found that other Googlers past and present were eager to take a fresh look at search, including some whom they hadn\u2019t known at their old company. \u201cThe kind of ideas I heard from Sridhar and Vivek really excited me,\u201d says Bindu Pucha, who was once an IBM Research staffer, spent five years at Google, and now works on infrastructure technology for Neeva.\n  For Udi Manber, what Neeva was up to was compelling enough to lure him back into search, an area he\u2019d left behind in 2015 to focus on health-related technologies at the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere. Earlier this year, he joined Neeva part-time, spending two or three days a week on research efforts.\n A legendary computer scientist who held top jobs at Yahoo and Amazon as well as Google, Manber was another key Googler who had his frustrations with the dynamics of ad-subsidized search. \u201cI was one of the biggest advocates of privacy at Google, and I pushed for it a long time,\u201d he says. \u201cI won some fights. I lost many others.\u201d The fact that Neeva is tiny is liberating, he argues: \u201cInnovation is hard for every company, but I think small companies are better at it than large companies overall.\u201d\n  To say that Neeva is in a position to rethink search is not to suggest that it\u2019s trying to change everything. What it\u2019s launching is not the iPhone to Google\u2019s BlackBerry. Indeed, much of the user experience can fairly be described as \u201cGoogle-like.\u201d\n  That\u2019s not a bad thing. \u201cThe paradox and the challenge here is that it has to be different enough from what already exists to get attention and to be engaging, but not so radically different that it\u2019s disorienting to people,\u201d says Greg Sterling, a  long-time observer of the search business and VP of market insights at location marketing company Uberall. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird tight rope that I think they\u2019re trying to walk.\u201d\n They\u2019re not doing it alone.\u00a0Neeva has indexed several billion web pages on its own but also credits Apple, Bing, and Yelp at the bottom of search results; other information providers include\u00a0Intrinio, Weather.com, and Xignite.\u00a0Even Google is an ingredient, with Google Maps embedded in search results.\n \u201cWherever we can build, we will build,\u201d declares Raghunathan. \u201cWhere we can license or buy, we will. Users don\u2019t care. And so we will do what makes sense for users to build a maximally differentiated, maximally useful, maximally, delightful product.\u201d\n  Nothing about the end result is likely to discombobulate the Googling masses. There\u2019s a search field that looks just like Google\u2019s search field\u2014except that it sports a rotating set of taglines such as \u201cNo ads here\u201d and \u201cYou are not the product.\u201d There are autosuggestions as you type, plus links to related searches and \u201cPeople Also Asked\u201d queries. Rows of videos and news items are interspersed throughout the results, and the right column often includes a block of facts on whatever you searched for based on sources such as Wikipedia.\n  Dig into the same results on Neeva and Google, however, and you\u2019ll notice some differences. For instance, while both search engines respond to searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d with tidy carousels summarizing expert reviews, they\u2019re more prominent on Neeva, while Google puts a similar-looking carousel of paid links at the top. You can also expand Neeva\u2019s summaries into more detailed previews without leaving the search results, a boon for comparison shopping. (The service takes a similar approach with recipes.)\n The Google home page consists of a search field, \u201cGoogle Search\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Feeling Lucky\u201d buttons, and an expanse of white space\u2014remarkably unchanged from its original look back in 1998. Neeva, by contrast, fills its home page with personalizable widgets. They include ones for local weather, stock prices of your choice, and news. That last widget consists entirely of stories from name-brand media outlets\u2014from  The Daily Beast to Fox News\u2014and you can customize it by specifying which sources you want to see more often or less often.\n  Still another distinguishing characteristic is Neeva\u2019s integrations with third-party services. You can hook the service up with information sources such as your Gmail or Outlook email and calendar, Google Drive or Dropbox storage, and/or Slack or Jira account. Neeva will then index them and intersperse material from them in your search results as well as presenting it in a dedicated \u201cPersonal\u201d tab. Google has experimented with similar concepts in the past\u2014it once  mashed up Google search and Gmail\u2014but seems to have moved on from the concept.\n  For all that\u2019s nice about Neeva\u2014starting with its organic results sitting at the top of the page rather than below a payload of advertising\u2014it hasn\u2019t done the impossible by reaching Google-like sophistication right out of the gate. Those product-oriented results for searches such as \u201cbest laptops\u201d are well packaged, but the ones I checked out were thin on sources, with  PC Mag dominating the review links to such an extent that I wondered if it was through some partnership deal. (It isn\u2019t.)\n Neeva also doesn\u2019t do local information anywhere near as well as Google: It knows my Zip Code, but when I searched for a local pizza chain, it gave me a map for the branch 28 miles away, not the one within walking distance. It can answer questions such as \u201cWhat time is it in Rio?\u201d and \u201cHow tall is Joe Biden?\u201d with facts that appear on the results page itself, but it doesn\u2019t do so for as dizzying an array of queries as Google does.\u00a0When I used the pre-release site, I also encountered the occasional out-and-out glitch, like a thumbnail map of San Francisco that turned into Indianapolis when I clicked on it.\n  Ramaswamy acknowledges that in its current state, Neeva is something of a rough draft: \u201cWe have several large launches planned for next month, on the search quality side, after being publicly available,\u201d he says. It will be interesting to see where it gets by the fall, when the people now signing up conclude their three-month free trials and choose whether to become paying customers.\n Where it could go after that is hard to say, but it\u2019s not like search has no remaining problems to solve. \u00a0When I asked Manber about what he was working on, he wouldn\u2019t tell me: \u201cI learned a long time ago to talk about things only after I\u2019ve done them, not when I\u2019m just planning to do them.\u201d\n  As I began working on this article and got pre-release access to Neeva, I wanted to use it all the time. To ensure that I didn\u2019t reflexively Google for anything, I went into Safari\u2019s settings to change my default search engine to Neeva. It was only then that I realized I couldn\u2019t. Most major browsers make you pick from a few pre-selected search engines, not (yet) including Neeva; only Chrome allows you to choose one that\u2019s not on its canned list.\n That experience underlined that Neeva is entering a world that isn\u2019t exactly wired to give a new stand-alone search engine its best shot at success. To control its destiny, a search company really needs to write at least some of its own software; it\u2019s not a coincidence that everyone from Google to  DuckDuckGo has come out with a browser. And now so has Neeva, with its iPhone and iPadOS browsers as well as extensions that embed similar functionality in other browsers.\n \u201cThe browser and search are just so intertwined, right?\u201d says Neeva software engineer Darin Fisher. \u201cSearch is such an important part of the UI of the browser.\u201d Fisher knows whereof he speaks: He\u2019s a 21-year veteran of the browser wars whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes Netscape and Firefox as well as Chrome from  its inception until earlier this year.\n According to Fisher, the symbiotic nature of browsing and searching can create design conundrums that put a browser/search engine company at odds with its users. For example, if you type the name of a site into the browser\u2019s address bar, will it send you right there? Or will it err on the side of directing you to a page of search results it can monetize through ads?\n With no ads, Neeva can resist such temptations. \u201cWhen I think about Neeva and that simple business model that it has\u2014if people are happy, they\u2019re paying\u2014it opens the door to not having that tension,\u201d says Fisher.\n Along with putting the Neeva search engine front and center, the company\u2019s apps and extensions allow it to implement privacy-related features it couldn\u2019t implement purely as web services. While browsing a website, you can click on an icon near its address to get a summary of the trackers it contains that monitor your browsing for advertising and other purposes; you can also turn on a feature called Tracking Prevention, which blocks such surveillance and speeds up page rendering.\n  A few days before Neeva\u2019s official debut, as I used the pre-release browser, I found that it not only foiled trackers but also eliminated advertisements all over the web. It turned out that Neeva was also surprised by the sweeping ad deletion, an artifact of its browser\u2019s reliance on core technologies from Mozilla\u2019s Firefox.

That could keep programmers who already use the company&#39;s tools satisfied and also attract new ones.\n  The system, called GitHub Copilot, draws on source code uploaded to code-sharing service GitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, as well as other websites. Microsoft and GitHub developed it with help from OpenAI, an AI research start-up that Microsoft  backed in 2019.\n Researchers at Microsoft and other institutions have been trying to teach computers to write code for decades. The concept has yet to go mainstream, at times because programs to write programs have not been versatile enough. The GitHub Copilot effort is a notable attempt in the field, relying as it does on a large volume of code in many programming languages and vast Azure cloud computing power.\n Nat Friedman, CEO of GitHub, describes GitHub Copilot as a virtual version of what software creators call  a pair programmer -- that&#39;s when two developers work side by side collaboratively on the same project. The tool looks at existing code and comments in the current file and the location of the cursor, and it offers up one or more lines to add. As programmers accept or reject suggestions, the model learns and becomes more sophisticated over time.\n The new software makes coding faster, Friedman said in an interview last week. Hundreds of developers at GitHub have been using the Copilot feature all day while coding, and the majority of them are accepting suggestions and not turning the feature off, Friedman said.\n Programming involves coming up with an idea about how to do something and then implementing it, and GitHub Copilot is good at the second part, said Greg Brockman, a co-founder of OpenAI and its chief technology officer.\n  &#34;You don&#39;t want to go read  Twilio&#39;s API documentation. It knows all that stuff. It&#39;s actually quite reliable at it,&#34; he said. Brockman calls this work last-mile programming, and he said that having computers take care of it leads to speed improvements.\n  &#34;It can save me from having to dive through a whole bunch of documentation to get a tool to do a thing that I know it&#39;s capable of doing, and that is so good for productivity,&#34; he said. &#34;I can&#39;t even tell you the number of hours I&#39;ve wasted trying to figure out the right way to do a relatively prosaic thing, just navigating the complexity of these tools.&#34;\n  &#34;It may very well be one of those things that makes programming itself more approachable,&#34; Scott said.\n It supports almost every programming language, but it&#39;s been designed to work best with JavaScript, Python and TypeScript, Friedman said.\n GitHub Copilot will first appear in Microsoft&#39;s Visual Studio Code, a free open-source product, and Microsoft plans to incorporate it into the commercial Visual Studio product in the future.\n  The model at the core of GitHub Copilot, called Codex, is a descendent of GPT-3, a powerful model that OpenAI trained on large volumes of text, Brockman said. Engineers fed the model &#34;many, many terabytes of public source code out there,&#34; Friedman said.\n This isn&#39;t the first time Microsoft has leaned on OpenAI to deliver smart software. Last month  Microsoft showed how it would update the Power Apps Studio application, which nontechnical people use to write apps, so that users could type in words describing the elements they&#39;d like to add and have GPT-3 show options for the necessary code.\n OpenAI recognizes the potential for AI models to come up with code with GPT-3, which it introduced last year. The start-up says on  its website that an online service delivering GPT-3 can handle &#34;code completion.&#34; But back when OpenAI was first training the model, the start-up had no intention of teaching it how to help code, Brockman said. It was meant more as  a general purpose language model that could, for instance, generate articles, fix incorrect grammar and translate from one language into another.\n Over the next few months, people experimented with the model to see what it could do, both useful and silly --  for instance, one engineer made a website that could design a button that looked like a watermelon. Brockman reached out to Friedman, as he was running a key destination where millions of programmers work on code and things proceeded from there.\n GitHub employees have tried to ensure that GitHub Copilot will generate secure, high-quality code. &#34;We&#39;ve built a number of safety mechanisms into Copilot that we think are cutting-edge in terms of reducing the chances of mistakes in various areas here, but they&#39;re definitely not perfect,&#34; Friedman said.\n The underlying technology won&#39;t be only Microsoft&#39;s to use. OpenAI will release the Codex model this summer for third-party developers to weave into their own applications, Brockman said.\n Microsoft could someday release a version of the product that enterprises could train to understand their programming styles, Scott said. For now, Microsoft is only offering the service that knows about code stored in public repositories.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:56", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

regulatory and governmental approvals, in a press release post-publication. It also confirmed that the price of the acquisition which will be an $800 million all-cash deal.\n The deal gives 2U,  a company that filed to go public in 2014 and continues to be one of the rare U.S. edtech companies listed on the stock market, a new wave of collaboratively-built content to its software. Plus, 2U just acquired with stronger name recognition thanks to its Ivy League backers, which some see as a branding move that could help the public company with its own chunk of the market. The company\u2019s last big acquisition was in 2019,  when it paid $750 million to acquire Trilogy education, a company that builds in-person and online bootcamps in collaboration with universities.\n  EdX was founded in 2012 amid a crop of massive open online course (MOOC) offerings, including Udacity and Coursera. The company, set up as a non-profit, had an alluring promise upon launch: it would help anyone in the world take a Harvard or MIT class, for free. The institutions, of course, have thrown in a cumulative $80 million in donations into edX to keep the operation free.  Its own launch came weeks after Coursera announced that Princeton, Stanford, UPenn, and the University of Michigan would host courses on its own online learning platform. Now, edX\u2019s acquisition comes months after Coursera went public.\n  Today, edX, led by president and professor Anant Agarwal, hosts over 3,000 courses led by 15,000 instructors and used by 35 million users. Open edX, the platform\u2019s open source platform, is used by 2,400 learning sites worldwide,  according to the organization\u2019s website.\n EdX will turn into a public benefit corporation as part of this transaction. Per sources, proceeds from the transaction will go into another non-profit managed by Harvard and MIT, and the institutions will not profit off of the transaction. That said, an MIT statement reveals. that edX took a line of credit from MIT and Harvard, and those funds will be returned to both institutions.\n \u201cBecause edX is a public charity, the proceeds from its sale can only be distributed for a purpose consistent with edX\u2019s mission, not to compensate those who contributed to the nonprofit,\u201d  the statement reads.\n Part of this transaction, which has been in the works since February 2021, is colored by the fact that edX has been transparent with its own financial woes and journey to becoming a self-sustaining business. Then MIT Provost Rafael Reif, now the president of the school, had  hinted at eventual revenue generation the program first launched, saying in 2012 that \u201cthe drive is not to make money..that said, we intend to find a way to support those activities. There are several approaches we are considering, and we don\u2019t want this project to become a drain on the budgets of MIT or Harvard.\u201d\n In 2018, the same fiscal year it  had $37 million in revenue, edX introduced  a support fee, alongside its ongoing offering that asks students to pay for a verified certification upon course completion. In announcement, the company wrote that \u201cwe believe that we need to move toward a financial model that allows edX and our partners to achieve sustainability and we acknowledge that means moving away from our current model of offering virtually everything for free.\u201d The edX board also considered other options, MIT. said,  but decided those were \u201cnot as beneficial to edX, its learners, or its partner institutions as the transaction with 2U.\u201d\n The new transaction and edX\u2019s choice to turn into a public benefit corporation might become the financial model that it itself was looking for, indicating just how. hard it may be to monetize a MOOC. While 2U has committed to continuing edX\u2019s free coursework for at least five years, as well as seeding a new non-profit, edX as it currently stands \u2013 a massive education non-profit \u2013 will no longer function as it currently does in the future.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:16:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5927\u5b66,\u7f8e\u56fd,\u6559\u5e08,programs,edx", "title": "2U\u4e3a\u9876\u7ea7\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u5b66\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b66\u4f4d\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6536\u8d2dEDX\uff0c\u6258\u7ba1\u6258\u7ba13K\u8bfe\u7a0b\u753115,000\u540d\u6559\u5e08\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u73b0\u91d1\u4e3a800\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "2U, which provides degree programs for top US universities, acquires edX, a nonprofit hosting 3K courses led by 15,000 instructors, for $800M in cash", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/2u-set-to-acquire-non-profit-edx-for-deal-north-of-600m/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5927\u5b66", "\u7f8e\u56fd", "\u6559\u5e08", "programs", "edx"]}]
