In the 1989 classic: Field of Dreams, an Iowa farmer has a vision to bulldoze a portion of his corn crop in order to create a baseball diamond in the middle of nowhere. To his credit he does it spurred on by a loving spouse. After creating the field famous baseball players start appearing, but there’s a catch they’re all imaginary. Sound familiar? The movie is romantic and inspiring, that is till you launch a product that flops.</p><p>建立它，他们会来！在1989年的经典：梦想领域，爱荷华州农民有一个愿景来推翻他的玉米作物的一部分，以便在不知名的地方创造一个棒球钻石。他的信用是，他做了一个充满爱的配偶的刺激。创建领域着名的棒球运动员开始出现，但是有一个抓住他们都是想象的。听起来有点熟？这部电影是浪漫和鼓舞人心的，这是直到你发射拖鞋的产品。</p><p> There’s a lot to   be learned from the Field of Dreams from an entrepreneurial aspect, basically don’t do it. If you build it they probably wont come. Why would they you built a baseball diamond in the middle of nowhere!</p><p> 从创业方面的梦想领域有很多东西可以从事，基本上不这样做。如果你建造它，他们可能不会来。他们为什么要在不知名的地方建造一个棒球钻石！</p><p>  I got into this because I had just started reading about the time-value of money, passive income, and entrepreneurship. I had realized early in my career that the real way to make the big bucks was to utilize a method that rewarded you non-linearly to the amount of effort you expended. It’s an appealing thought, laying on a beach as your product just prints money when you’re asleep.</p><p>  我进入了这一点，因为我刚刚开始阅读金钱，被动收入和企业家的时间价值。在我的职业生涯中，我已经在职业生涯中实现了让大型雄鹿队的真实方法是利用一种方法，这是一种奖励你的努力奖励你的努力。这是一种吸引人的想法，躺在海滩上，因为你的产品在睡着时打印钱。</p><p> From the successful founders I’ve researched they’d probably be quick to tell you that nothing is really ever passive, if you create a business that can make 1k MMR it could probably make 3k MRR with more time and effort ad nauseam, that is till you’ve saturated the total addressable market. It’s going to be hard work every step of the way in fact Jason Cohen who’s released products with over 100m MMR calls this the Technical Founder’s Dilemma basically your product gets so successful that you end up transitioning into a role you may not enjoy at later stages of growth. The point is passive is a lie it’s to sell you some course for $39.99. You could maybe hold off growing your company and milk the MRR but eventually conversions will slow, competitors will come, and your product will slowly but surely fall short in SEO rankings.</p><p> 从成功的创始人来看，我研究了他们可能很快就告诉你，如果你创造一个可以让1K MMR的企业可以让3K MRR拥有更多的时间和精力，那就是直到你已经饱和了总可卡网。事实上，这将是艰苦的工作实际上是杰森科恩的释放产品超过100米MMR呼唤这个技术创始人的困境基本上您的产品非常成功，您最终将转换为您可能不喜欢的角色生长。这一点是被动的是一个谎言，以39.99美元的价格出售你的课程。你可能会抓住贵公司和牛奶的MRR，但最终转变会慢，竞争对手会来，你的产品在SEO排名中慢慢落下。</p><p> What is failing? Is it releasing a product with 0 MRR, maybe 100 MRR or a 1k MRR? Maybe, if you’re already a successful founder who created a company that sold for X millions and your new venture only makes you a couple thousand a year that’d probably be a flop for you, however if you’re just starting out it could be an amazing success. Like all things failure is relative. To me failure is expecting an outcome, working hard to achieve that outcome, and falling short.</p><p> 什么失败了？它是否释放了0 MRR，也许100mRR或1K MRR？也许是，如果你已经成为一个成功的创始人，那些创造了一家销售X百万的公司，你的新企业只会让你一年一年，这可能是一个牌子，但是如果你刚刚开始它可能是一个惊人的成功。就像所有事情都失败是相对的。对我来说，预计会有结果，努力实现这一结果，并缩短。</p><p>  When I created my first product I just wanted to build something. I had ideas in the past and got lazy, none of them ever got shipped. I just wanted to take a side project from start to finish and release it, basically just to see what would happen. I created my app, built APIs, deployed in AWS, released it on the app store. To me just shipping was a huge victory the work was done and now I wanted my check.</p><p>  当我创建我的第一个产品时，我只是想建造一些东西。我过去有想法，懒惰，他们都没有出货。我只是想从开始完成并释放它，基本上只是看看会发生什么。我创建了我的应用程序，在AWS中部署的API，在App Store上发布了它。对我来说，运送是一个巨大的胜利，现在我想要我的支票。</p><p> It was a hard but in retrospect grateful reality that exactly 0 people downloaded my app not even my friends or family. When my family did try to download it after pushing them the app crashed on launch. I tried to drum up support in niche subreddits only to have people tell me it was basically useless that they wanted a desktop version not a mobile app. At the time I was heartbroken I had worked for months and the cumulation of all that work was $50 bucks a month in AWS bills and a shitty app which didn’t even launch. I called it quits shut the servers down and delisted the app and retreated back to my den of solitude much like I came.</p><p> 这是一个艰难的，但在回顾感激的现实中，这完全是0人下载我的应用，甚至是我的朋友或家人。当我的家人试图在推动它推出时试图下载它。我试图在利基菲德德的支持下，只有人们告诉我，他们希望桌面版本不是移动应用程序的基本无用。当我伤心的时候，我工作了几个月，所有这些工作的累积都是一个50美元的AWS账单和一个卑微的应用程序，甚至没有发布。我打电话给它退出关闭服务器，并将应用程序退回并退回到我的孤独之内，就像我来一样。 </p><p> In the beginning the goal was to ship and it felt great to actually release a product, intoxicating if I might say but it hurt that nobody found it even remotely useful. It was at this point that I learned the hard way build and they will come is utter bull. It’s around this time I did finally start to do some mucking about the process itself but I hated the idea of marketing or doing sales especially as an introverted technical guy, I thought I was better than that. So a lot of what I read and listened too fell on deaf ears but I was picking up some of it.</p><p>在开始，目标是发货，它感到很好，实际上释放了一个产品，如果我想说，令人痛苦的话，但它伤害了没有人发现它甚至远程有用。现在就是我学到了艰难的方式，他们会来的是州。这是在这个时候，我终于开始对这个过程做了一些问题，但我讨厌营销或销售的想法，特别是作为一个内向的技术人，我以为我比这更好。所以我读和听到的很多东西在聋的耳朵上掉下来，但我正在拿起一些。</p><p>  I was restless I didn’t care so much about creating a product that would actually make me money I just wanted someone to use something I built. I couldn’t shake it I just wanted users anything to know what that felt like. I had another quick eureka moment and ended up building a simple Chrome extension in a weekend, my second SaaS “product.” To my delight people used it, a lot of people used it. The downloads were small to begin with but with exactly 0 marketing in a matter of a month I had a couple hundred users. The level of excitement I felt was truly hard to describe even though only a few hundred people were using my very basic code I felt the deepest sense of satisfaction I ever had in my software career. I was obsessed with reloading the stats to see how many people downloaded it, it would be the first thing I’d do every morning.</p><p>  我不安地，我对创造一个实际赚钱的产品并不关心我只是希望有人使用我建造的东西。我无法动摇它我只是希望用户有什么可知的感觉。我有另一个快速的eureka时刻，并在周末，我的第二个Saas“产品”中结束了一个简单的铬延伸。为了我的喜爱，人们用它，很多人都用它。下载很小，以便在一个月内完成0次营销，我有几百个用户。即使只有几百人使用我非常基本的代码，我觉得我觉得的兴奋程度真的很难描述，我感受到我在我的软件职业生涯中最深刻的满足感。我沉迷于重新加载统计数据，看看有多少人下载了它，这将是我每天早上都能做的第一件事。</p><p> Then came the first review, the notification hit me right in bed, as my groggy eyes scanned my phone. It was a summary of the review and it was bad. I forget the exact wording but basically it was like “This app does not work as intended 0 stars.” It hit like a crash dummy flying into a brick wall at a crash site test. I was furious, despondent, and sad. I tried everything to get in contact with the user, I sent maybe 4 follow up emails begging for me to help him or her fix their problem and to remove their review. Nothing, crickets. The downloads stopped happening people stopped using it and then churn started to occur, people started to delete it. Again the highs led to a low and I removed the extension out of anger, knowing that basically it would never make a cent and it wasn’t worth my time updating it.</p><p> 然后是第一次评论，通知在床上击中了我，因为我的剧照眼睛扫描了我的手机。这是审查的摘要，这很糟糕。我忘记了确切的措辞，但基本上就像“这个应用程序不按预期的0星级工作。”它在碰撞现场测试时击中了一个崩溃的假人进入砖墙。我非常愤怒，沮丧，悲伤。我试图与用户联系的一切，我发送了4次跟进电子邮件乞求我帮助他或她解决他们的问题并删除他们的评论。什么都没有，蟋蟀。下载停止发生的人停止使用它然后搅动开始发生，人们开始删除它。再次高位导致了低点，我删除了愤怒的延伸，知道基本上它永远不会提高一分钱，这是值得我更新的时间。</p><p> Again I had “failed” in the sense of not making a dollar of my product but I finally released something people wanted to use. I had read YC founders Paul Graham’s essays after my first flop and the one thing that stuck with me was startups are not about coming up with ideas and then building a product,  they’re about solving problems. That stuck with me this time around and I was actively solving a problem, my problem. Again with very little discovery about the market or users but at least it was a step in the right direction. However, as much as it feels good to have people actually use your product I realized it must feel even more amazing for people to  pay for your product.</p><p> 我再次“失败”是在没有制造我的产品的意义上，但我终于释放了人们想要使用的东西。我读过YC创始人Paul Graham在我的第一次翻转之后的论文和让我困住的一件事是初创公司并不是想出想法然后建造产品，他们是解决问题。这次困住了我，我正在积极解决问题，我的问题。再次对市场或用户发现很少，但至少它是朝着正确方向的一步。然而，与人们真正使用你的产品一样好，我意识到人们必须为您的产品支付更加惊人。</p><p> In the short span of a few months I went from just ship something to understanding that I needed to build something useful. I needed to solve problems worth solving and needed to understand my customers, talk with them and build something that would  improve their lives. This was a hard lesson learned through blood and tears but there was no better way to learn. I had read that this is what I should be doing from the get-go long ago but didn’t head much to that advice, again I felt like I didn’t need all the “business” mumbo jumbo. Luckily I build my products myself because these would have been expensive lessons to learn if I had hired a development agency.</p><p> 在几个月的短期内，我从刚刚发货以了解我需要建立有用的东西。我需要解决值得解决的问题，并需要了解我的客户，与他们交谈并建立改善他们生活的东西。这是通过血液和泪水学到的艰苦课程，但没有更好的学习方式。我读到这是我很久以前从Get-Go开始做的事情，但是，我觉得我觉得我不需要所有的“商业”Mumbo Jumbo。幸运的是，我自己建造了我的产品，因为如果我雇用了一个开发机构，这些都会贵课。</p><p>  My latest and third product I think so far has been my greatest “failure” but equally the thing that has taught me more than anything. On the surface I did a lot of things “right” but in the wrong way I’d so fatefully find out. After again going through the typical rinse repeat cycle of optimism to total despair with my last product; I spent a ton of time reading, listening, and watching content on how to run a bootstrapped SaaS.</p><p>  我认为到目前为止我认为的最新和第三个产品一直是我最大的“失败”，但同样就是这样教我的东西。在地面上，我做了很多事情“对”，但以错误的方式我如此命运。再次经过典型的冲洗重复循环的乐观，与我的上一份产品完全绝望;我花了大约一定的时间阅读，听，并观察如何运行引导的SaaS。</p><p> I learned I needed to be talking to people from the get-go, understand them and learn about their problems. Again this next idea was a problem I had, but before coding a lick I started doing customer validation, or what I thought that was.</p><p> 我了解到我需要与来自Get-Go的人交谈，了解他们并了解他们的问题。下一个想法再次是我有一个问题，但在编码舔我开始做客户验证之前，或者我认为是什么。 </p><p> I was getting a list of users on my niches forums and websites. I was talking to people explicitly about my idea gathering their input again great things to do however I was doing it the wrong way.</p><p>我正在获得我的利基论坛和网站上的用户列表。我正在和人们明确与人们谈论我的想法再次收集他们的意见，但是我正在以错误的方式做到这一点。</p><p> I was literally saying to people: “I’m looking to build an X app would you find that useful”. Hundreds and hundreds or responses to my posts were enthusiastically yes I’d love to use that! I got bit by the build it bug and stopped right there in my tracks and started coding away, a huge mistake...</p><p> 我真的对人们说：“我想建立一个x应用程序，你会发现它有用”。对我的帖子的数百和数百或回应热情地是，我很乐意使用！我通过Bugit IT错误并在我的曲目中停止了，并开始编码，一个巨大的错误......</p><p> I had spent months working through a fully polished app that had many features. I was sending email updates to my list and happy to see people were engaging. Again I was at the peak of optimism, this was it this is the app that I finally release to get paid users, third time is the charm!</p><p> 我花了几个月的工作，通过一个拥有许多功能的完全抛光的应用程序。我正在向我的列表发送电子邮件更新，很高兴看到人们正在参与。我再次在乐观的高峰期，这是它这是我终于发布的应用程序，第三次是魅力！</p><p> I slowly but surely started riling up my list by sending a sequence of launch emails, engagement was great I was excited to launch.</p><p> 我慢慢地，肯定地通过发送一系列发布电子邮件来开始我的列表，订婚很棒，我很高兴能够发射。</p><p> Then I finally did it. I fired off the launch email to my list, notified the forums of my product, and almost instantaneously the users started flooding in.</p><p> 然后我终于做到了。我向我的列表中解雇了发布电子邮件，通知了我的产品论坛，几乎瞬间用户开始洪水。</p><p> It was exhilarating! In the first week I had more users than I’d ever had in all my apps, people we’re using it first a hundred, then two, then three and then it stopped…</p><p> 这很令人振奋！在第一周，我有更多的用户比我所有的应用程序，我们使用它的人第一个，那么两个，那么三，然后它停止了......</p><p> Then three hundred and ten, three hundred and twenty a few weeks later nothing. I looked at my metrics and while people we’re signing up almost nobody was actually using the product. Of course the whole time I was getting “great” feedback from my users: “The products great!”, “Great job keep working at it”, “I really like the design.” Nobody though was actually using it? Why was nobody using it? The people who did use it maybe used it for a max of ten minutes before never using it again. Why the heck was nobody using it?</p><p> 然后是三百十年，三百二十几周后几周。我看着我的指标，而我们注册的人几乎没有人实际上是使用该产品的。当然，我的用户得到了“伟大的”反馈：“产品伟大！”，“很棒的工作继续工作”，“我真的很喜欢这个设计。”虽然实际上没有人呢？为什么没有人使用它？那些使用它的人可能会用它在从不使用它之前十分钟的最大值。为什么哎呀没人用它？ </p><p> Soon I started getting feedback on forums along the lines of “The product looks interesting but I don’t really want to sign up for it without seeing the product first.” Again this was a free product at the time and all the user had to do was click the Google or Facebook OAuth button to log in, or enter their email but they refused to do so.   They didn’t trust me. I started to look deeper at my metrics and realized I had a huge bounce rate maybe over 3k or visitors at the peak and a bounce rate of 80%. I had sustained over 1k users hitting my landing page a day for the first week and only 300 users actually even signed in to use the app and when they did they almost immediately churned, again nobody trusted me enough to actually try my app to begin with or it was a problem that people just weren’t interested in solving.</p><p>很快我很快就开始反馈了“产品看起来有趣的线条”，但我真的不想先注册它而不先看产品。“这是当时这是一个免费的产品，所有用户都必须点击谷歌或Facebook OAuth按钮登录，或输入他们的电子邮件，但他们拒绝这样做。他们不相信我。我开始在我的指标深处了解，实现了我的巨额反弹率可能超过3K或游客的峰值，跳跃率为80％。我持续过1k用户击中我的登陆页，每天击中我的着陆页，只有300个用户实际上甚至登录使用该应用程序，当他们几乎立即被搅拌，再也没有人信任我，实际上尝试我的应用程序开始或者是人们对解决而不感兴趣的问题。</p><p> Of course my first thought as a technical founder was that there wasn’t enough features so I furiously started creating as many additional features as I could. I fired up my email list and told them all about the new features and why they were so awesome. Engagement was bad and it was the first time people started actively unsubscribing from email list, over 10% in my first email after launch, with more coming on each subsequent email.</p><p> 当然，我作为技术创始人的第一个想法是没有足够的功能，所以我疯狂地开始创造尽可能多的其他功能。我解雇了我的电子邮件列表，并告诉他们所有关于新功能以及为什么它们如此棒。订婚很糟糕，这是人们首次开始积极取消订购电子邮件列表，在推出后的第一个电子邮件中超过10％，更多的是每个后续电子邮件。</p><p> After getting minimal traffic for a period of a week or two after releasing the new features I realized I needed to market my app to get traffic up. I didn’t even connect the dots on my metrics perhaps it was denial, but I thought if I can just throw more proverbial shit at the fan I’d get more users, which was technically true. I started to “market” horrendously going to more sub-niches again getting a quick little spike of traffic and users to high churn and bounce. I created a Youtube channel and blog to increase SEO and started to actually get involved with learning how to market realizing its importance something I was so happy to dismiss earlier in my entrepreneurial journey much to my chagrin. My ads were useless and the bounce rate only increased after doing outbound marketing, if you could even call it that.</p><p> 在释放新功能后获得最小的流量，我意识到我需要推销我的应用程序以获得流量。我甚至没有在我的指标上连接点，也许是否认，但我以为我是否只能在粉丝扔更多的众所周知，我会得到更多的用户，在技术上是真实的。我开始“市场”可怕地向更多的子位基尔进入更多的子位基西，让您的交通和用户快速飙升，以高潮和反弹。我创建了一个YouTube频道和博客来增加SEO，并开始实际参与学习如何在我的创业旅程中解雇我的重要性，以便在我的创业旅程中驳回我的重要性。如果您甚至可以称之为，我的广告是无用的，反弹率仅在进行出境营销后才会增加。</p><p> It was then when it happened. To my credit at this time I would learn and do anything to get more users to my site, to the point where I was getting banned from multiple forums for posting after people told me to get lost. I had fully embraced marketing and was furiously reading content and trying to increase my SEO ranking for long tail keywords in the hopes of it driving traffic. It was then when I learned about backlinks and why they’re important for ranking. I put my domain in and to my surprise I had multiple backlinks quite a few in fact. Initially I was stoked! Then my heart almost left my chest, the backlinks looked sketchy and the title of some of the backlinks were offensive. I clicked on the link and it led me to a forum I had not posted on where over twenty or so people we’re just tearing both me personally and my app apart. I will refrain from summarizing but basically it was extremely hurtful. I cried.</p><p> 然后它发生了。在我的信用证下，我会学习并做任何事情来让更多用户到我的网站，到我被禁止在人们告诉我迷路后从多个论坛中禁止。我完全接受了营销，并疯狂地阅读内容，并试图增加我的SEO排名为长尾关键词，希望它驾驶交通。然后，当我了解了反向链路的时候，为什么他们对排名很重要。我把我的域名放在我的惊喜中，我有多个反向链接它的事实上很少。最初我被激怒了！然后我的心几乎留下了我的胸口，后面的背面看起来粗略，一些反向链接的标题是令人反感的。我点击了这个链接，它让我到一个我没有发布的论坛，超过二十多个左右，我们只是撕开了我个人和我的应用程序。我会避免总结，但基本上它非常伤害。我哭了。</p><p> It’s then why it clicked why the bounce rate was high and my conversion rate was low people just didn’t want to use my app, they actively hated it to the point of making blog posts about why it was such an awful idea. I felt crushed my cycle of optimism to despair was at the lowest despair I had ever felt. I was working on a blog post the night I found the backlink as I chocked back tears I kept typing telling myself they were just haters and to not give up. I couldn’t keep typing though and I stopped working on it from that day onwards.</p><p> 这就是为什么它点击了为什么反弹率很高，我的转换率低的人只是不想使用我的应用程序，他们积极讨厌它制作博客帖子的意义，这是为什么这是如此可怕的想法。我觉得我对绝望的乐观循环粉碎了我曾经感受到的最低绝望。我在博客帖子上举行的夜晚，我发现了背面链路，因为我被塞住了眼泪，我一直在打字告诉自己，他们只是仇恨而不是放弃。我无法继续打字，我从那一天开始努力。</p><p> I was hurt for a week or so, I kept the site live to see if any of my metrics would improve, a week turned into two. The metrics got worse and worse, and a few weeks laters there wasn’t a sign up in over three weeks. It’s then when I killed the product destroying all my users saved progress for anyone who had actually used the product. It was relieving since the serverless bills had racked up too close to $200 bucks.  Let me just say there is no worse fate for a creator than their product to silently be scrapped without even the most minor of eeks or anger from its users. Nobody cared it was gone, people just barely cared when it was there, but people especially did not give a fuck when it was gone.</p><p> 我受伤了一周左右，我让网站活着看看我的指标是否会改善，一周变成了两个。指标变得更糟，更糟糕，而几周的日子在三周内没有注册。它是当我杀死产品摧毁所有用户的产品时，为实际使用该产品的任何人都保存了进度。自从无服务的账单架起到达近200美元以上，它正在缓解。让我只是说创造者的命运比他们的产品默默地羞辱，甚至没有来自其用户的最小的eeks或愤怒。没有人关心它已经消失了，人们在那里几乎没有关心，但人们特别没有给出他妈的什么时候走了。</p><p> So why did it “fail”? We’ll it failed because while I got validation of my idea I was doing it the wrong way.</p><p> 为什么为什么“失败”？我们会失败，因为当我验证我的想法时，我就是错误的方式。 </p><p> Telling people: “Hey this is my app idea would you use it?” Is a clear violation of the Mom Test created by Rob Fitzpatrick a great book I’d highly recommend. In short just because users or potential customers tell you your product is something they’d use you don’t really know that’s the case without some action from that potential customer, whether its signing up for a beta, or better yet trying to pay for the product before its built.</p><p>告诉人们：“嘿，这是我的应用程序想法你会用它吗？”是一个明确的违反由Rob Fitzpatrick创建的妈妈测试的一本很棒的书，我强烈推荐。简而言之只是因为用户或潜在客户告诉你你的产品是他们使用的东西，你真的不知道这就是这种潜在客户的一些行动的情况，无论是它的签名还是更好地试图支付产品建造前的产品。</p><p> I had never really understood building a sales funnel before launching a product but after my last failure I totally get it. You want people to try and pay and use your product before you even start building it, that way at the very least when you release it you have paid customers and you also validate its a true problem that people are so frustrated with that they’d be willing to potentially pay you before its released.</p><p> 在推出产品之前，我从未真正理解建立销售漏斗，但在我的最后一次失败之后，我完全得到它。您希望人们在您开始建立它之前尝试付费并使用您的产品，即至少在您发布它时，您已经支付了客户，并且您还验证了人们如此沮丧的真正问题愿意在发布之前潜在地支付给您。</p><p> People initially told me they liked the idea because I was exposing my ego and it was easier to tell me they’d use it then telling me to buzz off. They also were looking to solve a broad goal which my product could have helped them with but the execution of which lacked to really compel the user to truly use it which would explain why people would use the product for all of two to three minutes then churn.</p><p> 人们最初告诉我他们喜欢这个想法，因为我正在暴露我的自我，而且更容易告诉我他们会用它然后告诉我嗡嗡声。他们也希望解决我的产品可以帮助他们的广泛目标，但是缺乏真正迫使用户真正使用它的行为，这将解释为什么人们将为所有两到三分钟使用该产品然后搅拌。</p><p> Another point of not building the sales funnel upfront is when I released my product people who were highly interested it my top demographic wouldn’t even sign up for it because we had not built trust. These people were in the middle of the funnel and I thought they’d just automatically close i.e. sign up once the product was out there. Some did but the majority didn’t.  If I had marketed the blog upfront and then built my funnel and sold them later even if the product wasn’t built I would have a had a much higher chance of realizing first if the product was truly worth building because I’d have real data as to whether people would buy it or not.</p><p> 另一点未提前建立销售漏斗是我释放了我的产品，这是非常兴趣的人，我的顶级人口甚至没有为此注册，因为我们没有建立信任。这些人在漏斗中间，我以为他们只是自动关闭，一旦产品出现在那里。有些人，但大多数人都没有。如果我已经销售了博客，然后建造了我的漏斗，即使产品没有建立，我也会有一个更高的机会，如果产品真的值得建立，因为我有真实的数据至于人们是否会购买它。</p><p> Also by marketing up front your building SEO months before release so you can hopefully piggy back on some of the small gains you’ve made there to keep the top of the funnel supplied once the big initial spike occurs from your email list. It’s easy to get a huge spike in engagement at launch if you have a list it’s very hard to keep that level engagement going after.</p><p> 此外，通过释放之前的SEO月份营销前面，因此您可以希望捎带在您在电子邮件列表中发生的大初始尖峰后，您可以在那里保持您在那里进行的一些小增益。如果您有一个列表，那么在发布时，很容易获得巨大的飙升，这是非常困难的，让那个级别参与追求。</p><p> Some customer validation is good but to get real results you need serious effort in understanding your customers problem and empathizing with them. You need to understand your customer intimately you should exactly know whose the type of person you’re building this for and what their trying to accomplish. You should be providing value to them ever step of the way through your funnel. This builds trust and a dialog between you and the customer, they begin to respect you and your offering and think you can help them. Then you actually do. Your product doesn’t need to be polished if it solves the customers problem accurately. This is I think is the main point lost in “ship it” culture. An MVP doesn’t need to be pretty but it absolutely must without a doubt solve your customers problem and it should not be shipped any time sooner or later than when it can accomplish that.</p><p> 一些客户验证很好，但要获得真正的结果，您需要认真努力了解您的客户问题并与他们同意。您需要亲密地了解您的客户，您应该完全了解您构建的人的类型以及他们的尝试完成。您应该向他们提供漏斗的逐步提供价值。这构建了信任和您与客户之间的对话，他们开始尊重您和您的产品，并认为您可以帮助他们。然后你真的这样做。如果它准确解决客户问题，您的产品不需要抛光。这是我认为是“船舶它”文化中丢失的主要观点。 MVP不需要很漂亮，但绝对必须毫无疑问地解决您的客户问题，而且不应该在何时完成它的情况下运送。</p><p> If you actually want to do this spend as much time reading ever resource on sales and marketing you can. Hubspot is a great resource to learn from. If you’re a technical founder let me just say code is evil and you wanting to write it is bad. This is not a side project if you just want to code something go do it but don’t expect it to sell. If you want to actually create a business you need to realize coding is both the easiest of all the things that needs to be done and also the least important. Let me say this again you can run a successful SaaS company with the simplest of Python scripts if you can market and sell that solution. Marketing and selling is the crusp of what it means to be a bootstrapper, think of yourself foremost as a marketer who knows how to code rather than a coder who knows how to market. You should be spending as little time coding and as much time marketing, building leads, and optimizing your funnel as much as possible.</p><p> 如果您实际上想这样做，那么您可以在销售和营销中读取资源。 HUBSPOT是一种伟大的资源来学习。如果你是一个技术创始人让我只是说代码是邪恶的，你想要写它很糟糕。如果你只想编写一些东西，这不是一个方面的项目，但不要指望它出售。如果您想实际创建一个业务，则需要实现编码是最容易完成的事情，也是最不重要的。让我再说一遍你可以使用一个成功的SaaS公司，如果您可以推销并销售该解决方案，可以使用最简单的Python脚本。营销和销售是成为一个盗版者意味着什么，认为自己是一个营销人员，他们知道如何代码而不是了解如何市场的编码器。您应该尽可能少的时间编码，以及尽可能多的时间营销，建造领导，以及尽可能优化漏斗。 </p><p> Lastly, features are useless if you’ve got a churn problem features wont solve it. If you got a bounce problem features wont solve it. If you have a traffic problem features wont solve it, unless you’re improving SEO. Remember code is evil.</p><p>最后，如果您有一个流失问题，功能是无用的，功能功能不会解决它。如果你有一个反弹问题，那么就会解决这个问题。如果您有交通问题功能，否则您可以改进SEO。记住代码是邪恶的。</p><p> So whats next? We all see everyone highlights real on social media and its hard not to feel bad about failure, but what do you really lose as a bootstrapper when your product flops: maybe some time and ego. I’ve learned so much so far on this journey and happy to be reminded that others have failed many more times before finally getting their “overnight success.” We all see the result but rarely do we see the messy side of how people got where they are. I’m spending a lot of time decompressing and focusing on whatever the next thing will be. Reading as much resources as I can and searching for my next opportunity. If my journey has so far showed you anything its progression. A year ago I scoffed at marketing and sales I thought it was sleazy. Today I have the utmost respect for those professions and and doing my best to learn and get good at them myself. Bootstrapping is a journey of self-actualization its so far been the hardest thing I’ve done in my life but easily the most rewarding and I haven’t even made a dime from it yet! I’m excited to build my next product, only of course after trying to sell it first.</p><p> 下一个是什么？我们都看到每个人都在社交媒体上突出真实，并且很难对失败感到难过，但是当您的产品拖波时，您真正丢失是什么：可能是一段时间和自我。到目前为止，我已经了解了这么少的旅程，很高兴提醒其他人在最终获得“一夜之间”之前失败了更多次。我们都看到了结果，但很少看到人们如何了解它们的凌乱方面。我花了很多时间减压并专注于其他一件事。阅读尽可能多的资源并搜索我的下一个机会。如果我的旅程到目前为止，你的旅程向你展示了它的进展。一年前，我嘲笑营销和销售我认为它很邋..今天，我对那些职业最有尊重，并尽力学习并自己擅长。举止是一个自我实现的旅程，到目前为止是我生命中最艰难的事情，但很容易最有价值，我甚至没有从它那里做一毛钱！我很高兴能够建立我的下一个产品，当然只有在试图先卖掉它之后。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://mmartinfahy.medium.com/my-experience-releasing-3-failed-saas-products-44e61cbde424">https://mmartinfahy.medium.com/my-experience-releasing-3-failed-saas-products-44e61cbde424</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/释放/">#释放</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/releasing/">#releasing</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/产品/">#产品</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
