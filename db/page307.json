"note_en": "Apply this three-part mental model of geospatial datasets. Many common problems happen when one of these parts is missing or out of sync.\n  Your dataset probably has some junk  coordinates.  Many data formats store &#34;null&#34; as zeroes. If your software is assuming a longitude/latitude geographic  coordinate system (GCS), then the point with  coordinates (0, 0) is where the equator crosses the prime meridian off the coast of Africa (humorously known as  Null Island). This can sometimes happen when importing from Excel and empty rows are not trimmed off.\n  Your dataset probably has its  coordinate system wrongly defined as a longitude/latitude geographic coordinate system (GCS).  This can happen if the coordinate system is missing altogether, in which case GIS software often assumes a GCS without telling you. A GCS only ranges from -180\u00b0 west to +180\u00b0 east in the X-axis and -90\u00b0 south to +90 north in the Y-axis. If the  coordinates in your dataset are out of this range then your dataset will look like it&#39;s off of the Earth.\n  Solution:  Redefine the coordinate system, i.e. change the  coordinate system but not the  coordinates, from the GCS to the  correct coordinate system.\n  Your dataset probably has the wrong  coordinate system.  This is the more general case of the previous problem. This can happen if the coordinate system is missing altogether, in which case GIS software often assumes that it is the same coordinate system as a previously loaded dataset, or the coordinate system set in the &#34;project&#34; or &#34;map document&#34;.\n  Solution:  Redefine the coordinate system, i.e. change the  coordinate system but not the  coordinates, to the  correct coordinate system.\n  Look at the two things you do know: the  attributes and the  coordinates.  A data point&#39;s  attributes gives context to where on the Earth it is located. Most GIS software will display the minimum and maximum  coordinates in the layer&#39;s properties as &#34;extent&#34; or &#34;bounding box&#34;. From these, do some detective work on the  coordinate system which you should use when  redefining your dataset.\n    If the  attributes indicate the approximate longitude,latitude where the  coordinates  should be located, try doing a reverse lookup. This iterates over every well-defined  coordinate system, unprojects the X,Y  coordinates to WGS84, and measures the error to the known longitude,latitude. Errors less than a few hundred meters denote a reasonable projection, though this isn&#39;t precise enough to  determine the GCS. You can run  this sample code yourself, or use this form:\n        If the  coordinates have X-values between -180 and 180, and Y-values between -90 and 90, then you probably want to  redefine to a longitude,latitude geographic  coordinate system (GCS) like WGS84.\n  If the  coordinates have large absolute values, try  redefining to a local  coordinate system like UTM, Gauss-Kr\u00fcger, State Plane, or a national grid. Also consider trying neighboring zones, e.g. if UTM Zone 19N is wrong, try UTM Zone 18N.\n  If the  attributes suggest the dataset is in the USA, then there might a problem converting to/from   Freedom Units  . Try multiplying/dividing a data point&#39;s  coordinates by 3.28084 to convert feet to meters/meters to feet and see if that places it in the proper location.\n  If the minimum X/Y  coordinates are both zero and the maxmimum X/Y  coordinates are both positive, then the dataset may have been exported from non-geospatial software like Photoshop or Illustrator or Inkscape. This is especially likely if the dataset is flipped vertically since those editors typically have the Y-axis increasing going down. You will need to manually georeference the dataset to use it, which changes both the  coordinates and the  coordinate system.\n  Your dataset probably has the wrong longitude/latitude geographic  coordinate system (GCS). Different GCSs define slightly different sizes/shapes of the Earth (their ellipsoids) and different positionings on the Earth (their datums). As a result, the same longitude/latitude  coordinates in two different GCSs can appear offset, although typically within tens of meters of each other. This can happen even if you are using a projected coordinate system (PCS) whose units are not degrees of longitude/latitude since PCSs have a GCS embedded within them.    Solution:  Redefine the coordinate system, i.e. change the  coordinate system but not the  coordinates, to one of the following\n  If your dataset is in the USA  , try redefining to NAD27, NAD83, or WGS84.\n  It depends on your software.  Remember, redefining means the metadata about the  coordinate system is modified but the  coordinates are not. This contrasts with reprojections and transformations, which modify both the  coordinate system and the  coordinates.\n    In QGIS, for vector datasets, use the  Assign Projection tool in the Vector General toolset,  not the Reproject Layer tool.\n  In QGIS, for raster datasets, use the  Assign Projection tool in the &#34;GDAL&#34; toolset,  not the Warp (Reproject) tool.\n  From the command line, for vector datasets, use   ogr2ogr with the  -a_srs parameter,  not the  -t_srs parameter.\n  Your dataset is probably in a non-equidistant  coordinate system.  Most GIS software stupidly calculates distances, areas, and volumes using Euclidean math in the dataset&#39;s or data frame&#39;s  coordinate system,  regardless of whether it is equidistant. Depending on the amount of distortion associated with the projection, this can lead to (wildly) incorrect measurements without you realizing. In the common case of the Mercator projection, distances are enlarged by about  1/cos(latitude).\n    Reproject your dataset (changing both the  coordinates and  coordinate system) to an appropriate &#34;local&#34;  coordinate system. A local coordinate system is tuned to offer very accurate Euclidean measurements for a constrained region of the Earth. Examples include UTM, Gauss-Kr\u00fcger, State Plane, and equidistant national grids like the Equidistant Conic.\n  Perform geodesic measurements. This unprojects the  coordinates to longitude/latitude (if projected) and then calculates precise distance along the GCS&#39;s ellipsoid. But beware: each calculation is slower than the Euclidean version, and the improvement in accuracy is marginal versus a local  coordinate  (the previous solution) unless you require sub-centimeter accuracy. This is done by default in  QGIS, can be enabled in  ArcGIS Pro and  ArcMap, and can be performed programmatically with open-source libraries like  GeographicLib.\n  Mercator is the only  conformal cylindrical map projection. Cylindrical map projections mean the whole Earth fits into a rectangle, which is very convenient for data processing algorithms that are used to working with rectangular images. Conformal means that angles and shapes are always preserved: north is always up, squares are always square, etc. Using a non-conformal projection would make things look stretched, squashed, and/or rotated when zooming in.\n      Mercator does enlarge  areas farther from the equator, but at least this distortion is the same horizontally and vertically. And it&#39;s trivial to calculate a  scale factor to correct measurements. The only time the distortion is problematic is when viewing a global-scale map with a range of different scale factors, but most maps are not global-scale and there are plenty of better projections to use for this case.\n  Good question. There are a bunch of reasons we use planar projected  coordinate systems rather than just sticking with latitude,longitude geographic  coordinate systems all the time:\n  Planar measurements are ubiquitous. Common GIS features like property boundaries, road centerlines, forests, lakes, etc. are all reckoned in Euclidean distances, areas, and volumes - not in terms of angles.\n  Planar measurements are easier to calculate. Measuring distances on a plane with the Pythagorean theorem is easier than along a sphere with the  Haversine formula and  way easier than along an ellipsoid with the  Vincenty&#39;s formulae, to say nothing of areas or volumes.\n  Longitude was hard to figure out before GNSS. Reliable means of determining longitude are  only a couple hundred years old, and GPS only a couple decades old. There is a lot of inertia in surveying and geodesy using Cartesian distances from fixed monuments.\n  Your dataset is probably measuring height above the ellipsoid instead of above sea level (geoid), or vice-versa.  Sea level follows the geoid, a surface which is lumpy because of minute regional variations in gravity. GNSS like GPS do not measure the height above the geoid but rather the idealized mathematical representation called the ellipsoid. Some GPS devices automatically convert ellipsoidal height to height above sea level (aka orthometric height aka geoidal height), but many do not.\n    Solution: Use   cs2cs in PROJ, or alternatively an older tool like  VDatum, to convert between ellipsoidal and orthometric (above sea level) heights.

Non-GAAP earnings for the quarter were $1.13 a share.\n Wall Street was expecting Shopify to report  third quarter revenue of $657.9 million with non-GAAP earnings of 51 cents a share.\n Gross merchandise volume of $30.9 billion, surged 109%, as small businesses adopted Shopify to take operations digital. Shopify said it has been adept at converting merchant free trials into paying customers.\n    Harley Finkelstein, Shopify&#39;s president, said the &#34;accelerated shift to digital commerce triggered by COVID-19 is continuing.&#34; Shopify has been adding products and services as it build out services like buy now, pay later offerings like Shop Pay Installments, Shopify Fulfillment Network and expands internationally.\n   Last quarter, I outlined several initiatives we shipped to help merchants adapt quickly to a rapidly changing retail environment triggered by COVID, getting them online fast and building resilience into their businesses at a really challenging time. We believe these changes in the landscape will endure as consumers&#39; new shopping behaviors stick and become the new normal.\n   Shopify didn&#39;t provide an outlook for the fourth quarter or 2020.

"note_en": "Over the last few years Netflix has been developing a mobile app called Prodicle to innovate in the physical production of TV shows and movies. The world of physical production is fast-paced, and needs vary significantly between the country, region, and even from one production to the next. The nature of the work means we\u2019re developing write-heavy software, in a distributed environment, on devices where less than \u2153 of our users have very reliable connectivity whilst on set, and with a limited margin for error. For these reasons, as a small engineering team, we\u2019ve found that optimizing for reliability and speed of product delivery is required for us to serve our evolving customers\u2019 needs successfully.\n The high likelihood of unreliable network connectivity led us to lean into mobile solutions for robust client side persistence and offline support. The need for fast product delivery led us to experiment with  a multiplatform architecture. Now we\u2019re taking this one step further by using  Kotlin Multiplatform to write platform agnostic business logic  once in Kotlin and compiling to a Kotlin library for Android and a native Universal Framework for iOS via  Kotlin/Native.\n   Kotlin Multiplatform allows you to use a single codebase for the business logic of iOS and Android apps. You only need to write platform-specific code where it\u2019s necessary, for example, to implement a native UI or when working with platform-specific APIs.\n Kotlin Multiplatform approaches cross-platform mobile development differently from some well known technologies in the space. Where other technologies abstract away or completely replace platform specific app development, Kotlin Multiplatform is complementary to existing platform specific technologies and is geared towards replacing platform agnostic business logic. It\u2019s a new tool in the toolbox as opposed to replacing the toolbox.\n  Our Android and iOS studio apps have a shared architecture with similar or in some cases identical business logic written on both platforms.\n Almost 50% of the production code in our Android and iOS apps is decoupled from the underlying platform.\n Our appetite for exploring the latest technologies offered by respective platforms (Android Jetpack Compose, Swift UI, etc) isn\u2019t hampered in any way.\n   As noted earlier, our user needs vary significantly from one production to the next. This translates to a large number of app configurations to toggle feature availability and optimize the in-app experience for each production. Decoupling the code that manages these configurations from the apps themselves helps to reduce complexity as the apps grow. Our first exploration with code sharing involves the implementation of a mobile SDK for our internal experience management tool, Hendrix.\n At its core, Hendrix is a simple interpreted language that expresses how configuration values should be computed. These expressions are evaluated in the current app session context, and can access data such as A/B test assignments, locality, device attributes, etc. For our use-case, we\u2019re configuring the availability of production, version, and region specific app feature sets.\n Poor network connectivity coupled with frequently changing configuration values in response to user activity means that on-device rule evaluation is preferable to server-side evaluation.\n This led us to build a lightweight Hendrix mobile SDK \u2014 a great candidate for Kotlin Multiplatform as it requires significant business logic and is entirely platform agnostic.\n  For brevity, we\u2019ll skip over the Hendrix specific details and touch on some of the differences involved in using Kotlin Multiplatform in place of Kotlin/Swift.\n  For Android, it\u2019s business as usual. The Hendrix Multiplatform SDK is imported via gradle as an Android library project dependency in the same fashion as any other dependency. On the iOS side, the native binary is included in the Xcode project as a universal framework.\n  Kotlin Multiplatform source code can be edited, recompiled, and can have a debugger attached with breakpoints in Android Studio and Xcode (including lldb support). Android Studio works out of the box, Xcode support is achieved via TouchLabs\u2019  xcode-kotlin plugin.\n   Hendrix interprets rule set(s) \u2014 remotely configurable files that get downloaded to the device. We\u2019re using  Ktor\u2019s Multiplatform HttpClient to embed our networking code within the SDK.\n  Of course, network connectivity may not always be available so downloaded rule sets need to be cached to disk. For this, we\u2019re using  SQLDelight along with it\u2019s Android and Native Database drivers for Multiplatform persistence .\n  We\u2019ve followed the evolution of Kotlin Multiplatform keenly over the last few years and believe that the technology has reached an inflection point. The tooling and build system integrations for Xcode have improved significantly such that the complexities involved in integration and maintenance are outweighed by the benefit of not having to write and maintain multiple platform specific implementations.\n Opportunities for additional code sharing between our Android and iOS studio apps are plentiful. Potential future applications of the technology become even more interesting when we consider that  Javascript transpilation is also possible.\n We\u2019re excited by the possibility of evolving our studio mobile apps into thin UI layers with shared business logic and will continue to share our learnings with you on that journey.", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:43:39", "source_domain":

"note_en": "If that entrepreneur is David Nussbaum, the founder of  PORTL Hologram, the next logical step is to build a machine that can bring the joy of hologram-based communication to the masses.\n That\u2019s the goal thanks to a new $3 million round that Nussbaum\u2019s company raised from famed venture investor  Tim Draper,   former Electronic Arts executive Doug Barry and longtime awards-show producer Joe Lewis.\n  Barry is not only backing the company, he\u2019s also coming on board as its first chief operating officer.\n  Much of this interest can be traced back to the hologram performance given posthumously by  Tupac Shakur back at Coachella about eight years ago.\n Nussbaum turned the excitement generated by that event into a business. He bought the patents that powered Tupac\u2019s beyond-the-grave performance, and used the technology to beam Julian Assange out of the Ecuadoran embassy he had been holed up in during his years in London and making dead stars live (and tour) again.\n Those visual feats were basically just an updated version of the  Pepper\u2019s Ghost technique that stage illusionists and moviemakers have been using since it was invented by John Pepper in the 19th century.\n  The projector can transmit images any time of the day or night, and using PORTL\u2019s capture studio-in-a-box means that anyone with $60,000 to spend and a white background can beam themselves into any portal anywhere in the world.\n The company has sold a hundred devices and already delivered several dozen to shopping malls, airports and movie theater lobbies. \u201cWe\u2019ve manufactured and delivered several dozen,\u201d Nussbaum said.\n Part of the selling point, beyond just the gimmick of the hologram\u2019s next-level verisimilitude, is its interactivity. Through the studio rig and PORTL hardware, users can hear what people standing around the PORTL are saying and then respond.\n For its next trick, PORTL is looking to build a miniaturized version of its system that would be about the size of a desktop computer and could be used to both record and distribute the holograms to anyone with a PORTL device.\n \u201cThe minis will have all of the features to capture your content and rotoscope you out of our background and have the studio effects that is important in displaying your realistic volumetric like effect and they will beam you to any other device,\u201d Nussbaum said.\n To build out the business, the PORTL minis will have more than just communications capabilities, but recorded entertainment as well, Nussbaum said.\n \u201cThe minis will be bundled with content like Peloton and Mirror bundled with very specific types of content. We are in conversations with a number of extremely well-known content creators where we would bundle a portal but will also have dedicated and exclusive content\u2026 [and] bundle that for $39 to $49 per month.\u201d\n It\u2019s a vision that Nussbaum admits is far more expansive than his intentions \u2014 and the person he has to thank for the more ambitious vision of the business is none other than Draper.\n \u201cWhen I started this I thought it was going to be a novelty company,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the pandemic hit he knew we needed to do much more than that.\u201d", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:23:02", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5168\u606f\u56fe,hologram,portl", "title": "\nPORTL\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u7b79\u96c6300\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b89\u88c5\u4e00\u53f0\u5168\u606f\u56fe\u673a", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tPORTL Hologram raises $3M to put a hologram machine in every home\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/portl-hologram-raises-3m-to-put-a-hologram-machine-in-every-home/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5168\u606f\u56fe", "hologram", "portl"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7d33776657a4e65551ec8fd2b2319ebb.png", "infoid": 1032197, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4ece\u67d0\u79cd\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u53bb\u5e74\u9664\u5915\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728WhatsApp\u4e0a\u4ea4\u6362\u4e861000\u4ebf\u6761\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\uff0cWhatsApp\u7684\u8ba2\u9605\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u9876\u5cf0\uff0c\u6b63\u5982\u4f60\u4eec\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u8bb0\u5f97\u7684\u90a3\u6837\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u662f\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u906d\u9047\u6545\u969c\u7684\u65f6\u5019\u3002(\u53bb\u5e74\u9664\u5915\u6ca1\u6709\u505c\u7535\uff01)\u3002\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u4e0a\uff0cWhatsApp\u53ea\u662f\u5728\u4e0e\u81ea\u5df1\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u622a\u81f32018\u5e745\u6708\uff0cFacebook Messenger\u6bcf\u5929\u4ea4\u636280\u4ebf\u6761\u6d88\u606f\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u8482\u59c6\u00b7\u5e93\u514b(Tim Cook)\u57285\u6708\u4efd\u8868\u793a\uff0ciMessage\u548cFaceTime\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u521b\u4e0b\u7eaa\u5f55\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u900f\u9732\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u5b57\u3002\u82f9\u679c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b21\u5206\u4eab\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdc\u8fdc\u843d\u540e\u4e8eWhatsApp\u5f53\u65f6\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf(\u64ad\u5ba2)\u3002\nWhatsApp\u65f6\u4efb\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u7b80\u00b7\u5e93\u59c6(Jan Koum)\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e0a\u900f\u9732\uff0c2014\u5e74\u521d\uff0cWhatsApp\u6bcf\u5929\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u4ea4\u6362\u7ea6500\u4ebf\u6761\u77ed\u4fe1\u3002\n\u5f53\u65f6\uff0cWhatsApp\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e0d\u52305\u4ebf\u3002WhatsApp\u73b0\u5728\u62e5\u6709\u8d85\u8fc720\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u5728\u5176\u6700\u5927\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5e02\u573a\u5370\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u8fd9\u6b3e\u5927\u578b\u84dd\u8272\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u5e94\u7528\u3002\nWhatsApp\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u5a01\u5c14\u00b7\u5361\u65af\u5361\u7279(Will Cathcart)\u5728\u63a8\u7279\u4e0a\u5199\u9053\uff1a\u201c\u4eca\u5e74\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u77ed\u4fe1\u4e0e\u4eb2\u4eba\u4fdd\u6301\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b8c\u6210\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\u201d\nWhatsApp\u8ba1\u5212\u4f55\u65f6\u5728\u5df4\u897f\u6062\u590d\u652f\u4ed8\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u5212\u4f55\u65f6\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u63a8\u51fa\u652f\u4ed8\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u6ca1\u6709\u6d88\u606f\u3002WhatsApp\u4e8e2018\u5e74\u5f00\u59cb\u5728\u5370\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u9879\u670d\u52a1\u3002\n\u5361\u65af\u5361\u7279\u8bf4\uff1a\u201cWhatsApp\u6bcf\u5929\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u9001\u5927\u7ea61000\u4ebf\u6761\u6d88\u606f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e3a\u6b64\u611f\u5230\u81ea\u8c6a\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9053\u8def\u611f\u5230\u5174\u594b\u3002\u201d", "note_en": "For some perspective, users exchanged 100 billion messages on WhatsApp on last New Year\u2019s Eve. That is the day when WhatsApp tops its engagement figures, and as many of you may remember, also the time when the service suffered glitches in the past years. (No outage on last New Year\u2019s Eve!)\n At this point, WhatsApp is just competing with itself. Facebook  Messenger   was being used to exchange 8 billion messages a day as of May 2018. Apple chief executive Tim Cook  said in May that iMessage and FaceTime were seeing record usage, but did not share specific figures. The last time Apple did share the figure, it was far  behind WhatsApp\u2019s then usage (podcast).\n  In early 2014, WhatsApp was being used to exchange about  50 billion texts a day, its then chief executive Jan Koum revealed at an event.\n At the time, WhatsApp had fewer than 500 million users. WhatsApp now has  more than 2 billion users and at least in India, its  largest market by users, its popularity surpasses those of every other smartphone app including the big blue app.\n \u201cThis year we\u2019ve all relied on messaging more than ever to keep up with our loved ones and get business done,\u201d  tweeted Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp.\n No word today on when WhatsApp plans to resume its  payments service in Brazil, and when it plans to launch its payments service in India, where it began  testing the service in 2018.\n \u201cWe are proud that  WhatsApp  is able to deliver roughly 100B messages every day and we\u2019re excited about the road ahead,\u201d said Cathcart.", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:22:53", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot",

"note_en": "UPDATE, 4:15 PM PT:   CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a glimpse of what changes he envisions for Section 230, the law that gives tech platforms legal immunity for the way that they moderate their content.\n In a call with analysts to discuss second quarter  , Zuckerberg said that an approach that seems to have worked in other countries, like France, is \u201cone that focuses on creating a transparent process where companies have to report how they are doing moderation, reporting on how much harmful content in different categories is visible, the portion of the content on the service, and what percent of it our content moderation systems can get to before people need to report it.\u201d\n  \u201cI think a system like that, that basically requires companies to meet certain thresholds or show improvement, basically aligns incentives in the right way,\u201d he said.\n  Lawmakers in both parties have targeted Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, and in his appearance before a Senate committee on Wednesday, Zuckerberg said that he supports a new look at the law. The tech industry as a whole have treated Section 230 as essential for their dramatic growth over the past decade.\n Zuckerberg also addressed next week\u2019s election, outlining a series of steps Facebook has taken to curb potential voter suppression and other misinformation about the electoral process. But he also said that he was worried that \u201cwith a nation so divided,\u201d \u201cthere is a risk of civil unrest in the country\u201d following the election.\n PREVIOUSLY, 1:25 PM PT: Facebook\u2019s ad revenue rose 22% in the third quarter, as it beat analyst expectations of earnings growth.\n The company on Thursday reported net income of $7.8 billion in the three months ended September 30, a rise of 29% from the same period a year earlier. That translated into $2.71 per share, beating the estimate of $1.91 per share.\n Ad revenue rose to $21.2 billion, from $17.4 billion a year earlier. Total revenue reached $21.5 billion, up 22%. The growth in ad revenue came despite an ad boycott campaign earlier in July.\n \u201cWe had a strong quarter as people and businesses continue to rely on our services to stay connected and create economic opportunity during these tough times,\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.\n  Chief financial officer David Wehner said in a note that daily active users and monthly active users declined slightly in the U.S. and Canada from levels in the second quarter. He said that the levels earlier in the year were elevated due to the COVID-19 epidemic.\n \u201cIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we expect this trend to continue and that the number of DAUs and MAUs in the U.S. &amp; Canada will be flat or slightly down compared to the third quarter of 2020,\u201d Wehner said. He said that they expect a higher ad-growth rate in the fourth quarter because of advertiser demand during the holiday season.\n Facebook was up almost 5% in trading Thursday, but the earnings were released after the markets closed.", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:22:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "facebook,\u5e7f\u544a,ad", "title":

"note_en": "\u201cAny writer worth his salt writes to please himself\u2026It\u2019s a self-exploratory operation that is endless.\u201d \u2013 Harper Lee, author of  To Kill a Mockingbird\nI often get asked if\u00a0 Dragons Abound\u00a0is available as open-source, or if I intend to make it into an app, and my standard answer is \u201c Dragons Abound\u00a0is a personal growth project.&#34;\u00a0 This posting is the longer explanation of what that means to me.  If you&#39;re anything like me, you probably find that the effort to get by in life takes up most of your time and energy.\u00a0 You spend your life working, commuting, going to the grocery store, doing the laundry, and all the other sundry tasks required to stay afloat in our modern world.\u00a0 But it&#39;s hard to live a happy and fulfilled life if all you do is what you must do to survive.\u00a0 You&#39;ve got to carve out opportunities to invest in yourself as well.\u00a0 One of the ways I do that is a life practice I think of as \u201cForever Projects.&#34;\u00a0 This idea has been part of my life for a few decades, and my approach and understanding of it has evolved over the years, so I wanted to write a bit about my idea of a Forever Project and how I think it benefits me.\u00a0 (And maybe will benefit you.)  As I suggested above, the purpose of a Forever Project is to create opportunities for you to grow in ways that you\u00a0 aren&#39;t\u00a0already afforded by your \u201cregular&#34; life.\u00a0 Whatever you do for your day job, you&#39;re already investing a huge chunk of your life in developing and using those skills and feeding that interest.\u00a0 You&#39;re probably getting about as much out of that as you can.\u00a0 Conversely, if you put even a few hours into something that&#39;s new to you, you&#39;re very likely to achieve significant growth.\u00a0 So this is the first element of a Forever Project:\u00a0 to focus on some new topic where you aren&#39;t already investing time and energy.  Of course, you&#39;re the judge of what that means.\u00a0 Maybe during the day you&#39;re programming movement routines for monsters in a first person shooter, and at night you come home and develop game sprites for an 8 bit gardening game.\u00a0 For some people, that might be repetitive and stifling.\u00a0 But maybe for you that provides ample opportunities for growth.\u00a0 The point is that a Forever Project should take you off in a new direction.\u00a0 Find a  new way to invest in yourself.  Second, a Forever Project is one that - as the name implies - you can work on forever.\u00a0 It&#39;s an open-ended topic that you can explore for a long time without running out of challenges.\u00a0 Now I&#39;m  not the first to suggest this idea, and if you&#39;re interested in personal growth there&#39;s obvious value in picking a topic that you can study a long time.\u00a0 But my focus is not so much on having an endless topic to explore, but on some of the deeper implications of what it means to work on something \u201cforever.&#34;  Much of how we think about our lives has its roots in economics.\u00a0 When you make a decision (\u201cShould I go to see a movie tonight?&#34;) much of your thinking is likely some form of economic reasoning: \u201cHow much will it cost?&#34; \u201cIs this movie worth it?&#34;\u00a0\u201cIs there something else I&#39;d rather spend my money on?&#34;\u00a0 \u201cHow far away is the theater?&#34; \u201cShould I paint the den instead?&#34;.\u00a0 All of these questions are about getting  value from how you  spend your resources.\u00a0 This sort of reasoning helps us use our time and resources in fruitful ways.\u00a0\u00a0  But an interesting thing about economic reasoning is that it breaks down completely for someone with an infinite lifetime.\u00a0 In an infinite lifetime, you&#39;ll have an infinite amount of money, so it really doesn&#39;t matter what the movie would cost.\u00a0 And you don&#39;t have to choose between seeing the movie and painting the den, because with an infinite lifetime you can do both.\u00a0 In fact, any thinking along the lines of \u201cI&#39;m wasting my time&#34; makes no sense if you live forever - you can waste an infinite amount of time and still have an infinite amount left!  Of course, you don&#39;t really have \u201cforever&#34; to work on any project.\u00a0 But you can  reason like you do, and that has some interesting implications.\u00a0 And because we don&#39;t normally reason like this, I think it can provide some great benefits.  First of all, reasoning this way removes all pressure to \u201caccomplish something.&#34;\u00a0 With an infinite amount of time on your hands, you can turn off that critic inside your head that constantly second-guesses your decisions.\u00a0 (The one that uses economic reasoning to help you maximize the benefit of every choice in your life.)\u00a0 If you&#39;re doing a regular project - say, building a rocking chair - and you get distracted into spending hours reading about how trees grow and the biology of woody plants, you&#39;ll end up thinking that was wasted time - time that did not move you closer to your goal of building a rocking chair.\u00a0 But if you&#39;re learning woodworking and you have forever to do that, then a detour into how trees grow is perfectly fine.\u00a0 Even if you detour entirely and go off to get a Ph.D. in plant biology, that&#39;s fine.\u00a0 You can always come back to woodworking a few thousand years from now.\u00a0 When you remove the judgement of whether a pursuit is \u201cworth the time&#34; you&#39;ll free yourself listen more closely to the inner voice of what interests and matters to you.     This attitude - listening to your inner voice free of the constraints of finite economics - is a powerful enabler for personal growth.\u00a0 You&#39;ll find that when you spend your time in areas that are both interesting and important to you, you&#39;ll find something to learn and be motivated to do it - and that&#39;s precisely where you&#39;re most likely to accomplish some personal growth.\n Last year I spent six months working on map borders, and I got a few questioning comments about spending so much time on that topic.\u00a0 That&#39;s a perfectly understandable reaction from someone who looks at what I&#39;m doing through the lens of limited time, and wonders why I would spend so much effort on a minor aspect of map creation.\u00a0 But I&#39;m not \u201cbuilding a map app&#34;; I&#39;m doing a Forever Project about procedural generation, computer art and many other things.\u00a0 I&#39;ve always had an interest in Celtic knots, so I spent a couple of months learning how they were drawn and how to\u00a0 implement them in\u00a0 Dragons Abound.\u00a0 I learned something new (to me), and that bit of personal growth is the reward - regardless of whether or not I ever \u201cfinish&#34;\u00a0 Dragons Abound.  I&#39;ll mention one more benefit of the Forever Project before I talk more about how I practice it.  Whatever you do to earn a living - fix cars, teach ballet, or design ground systems for satellites (me) - it&#39;s likely that you have made an effort (possibly a very big effort) to be good at what you do.\u00a0 That&#39;s a consequence of a market economy - people pay more for rare expertise.\u00a0 You&#39;ve probably seen the classic supply and demand curve:\n When there&#39;s a high demand and a low supply, the price is high.\u00a0 The better you get at a skill, the fewer people there are who are equally good at that skill, and so the value of that skill rises.\u00a0 The best quarterbacks in the NFL get paid more than the mediocre quarterbacks, and the best ballet teachers get paid more than the mediocre ballet teachers.\u00a0 So most people end up pouring their effort into being very good at  something - playing the violin, programming, selling life insurance, and so on - so that they can make a good living.\u00a0 But a relentless focus on building a single skill is not (for most people) the best formula for leading a happy life.\u00a0 In fact, many people who do that eventually crack - they have what we (deceptively) call a \u201cA Mid-Life Crisis.&#34;  We talk sometimes about the \u201cRenaissance Man&#34; - a  polymath who is good at many different pursuits.\u00a0 But why were there (seemingly) many polymaths in the Renaissance and few now?\u00a0 Part of the answer is surely that the gentlemen and courtiers of the Renaissance faced less economic pressure to specialize and were more free to do what naturally pleased them and fed their growth - to study and practice skills in many different areas.\u00a0 I suspect that many modern people would be like that given the opportunity.\u00a0 (Although the idle rich might argue otherwise.)\u00a0 Regardless, we cannot easily change the whole basis of today&#39;s society (although we should), but we can certainly recognize its limits and try to intentionally diversify our interests outside of our 9 to 5 work life.  A good Forever Project will encourage you to wander through a variety of topics.\u00a0 Many of them will be new(-ish) to you, so you&#39;ll find it easy to learn something about them.\u00a0 I spent two months on Celtic knots and came away with a better understanding of their history, the theory behind drawing them, and some notion of how to implement an algorithm to draw them.\u00a0 I&#39;m pretty sure that none of that will ever increase my salary.\u00a0 But what it did do is increase the breadth of my personal knowledge, skills and interests.\u00a0 And if you do the same, perhaps that will make you a happier, more fulfilled person.\u00a0 Possibly even a Renaissance (wo)man :-)  Now let me talk a little bit about the practical aspects of finding a Forever Project and working on it.   Choosing a Topic  The most important aspect of picking a Forever Project is to to pick a  topic and not a  goal.\u00a0 If your Forever Project is to create an Uber app to connect people in need with free rides from volunteer drivers, then you&#39;ve missed the point.\u00a0 You&#39;ve picked a specific goal, and that will short-circuit all the \u201cforever&#34; reasoning.\u00a0 (Which doesn&#39;t mean that you shouldn&#39;t spend your time doing that.\u00a0 It just means that you shouldn&#39;t expect to get Forever Project benefits out of building an app.)\u00a0 A bad Forever Project is to \u201cmake a wooden rocking chair&#34;; a good Forever Project is to \u201clearn woodworking.&#34;\u00a0 I&#39;ll talk some more about what makes a good topic a little bit later, but right now I want to talk about the challenge of giving yourself a topic rather than a goal.  If you&#39;ve never attended a graduate school, you might imagine that the biggest challenge is the difficulty of the material - mastering the highest levels of human knowledge in some subject area.\u00a0 But in fact most graduate students do fine with the actual schoolwork - after all, people don&#39;t even try graduate school unless they&#39;re pretty smart and talented in a subject.\u00a0 You&#39;d  expect them to be good at that.\u00a0 The real challenge is something else entirely.  The big difference between undergraduate education and graduate school is direction.\u00a0 As an undergraduate student, the professor directs your study (\u201cRead Chapter 4 by Thursday&#34;) and provides the framework for applying your knowledge (\u201cProve theorem 4.1 using Turner&#39;s Method&#34;).\u00a0 In graduate school (once you&#39;ve hit the research phase), you must provide your  own direction.\u00a0 You decide what to study, how to study it, and how to apply that new knowledge in some interesting way.\u00a0 For a lot of graduate students, this is a stumbling block.\u00a0 They&#39;re excellent at studying or solving problems when someone else tells them what to do, but they cannot direct themselves effectively.\u00a0 To be successful, they have to learn to provide direction from within themselves ( intrinsically) that they are used to receiving from outside themselves ( extrinsically).\u00a0 This is a difficult skill to master, and is probably the biggest reason graduate students fail.  Like graduate school, a Forever Project is inherently an intrinsic effort.\u00a0 It&#39;s something you&#39;re going to do under your own direction for your own benefit.\u00a0 You cannot rely on anyone else to tell you what to do, help you figure out how to do it, or cheerlead when you&#39;re feeling stuck.\u00a0 So you&#39;re going to need a lot of the same skills as a graduate student to succeed.\u00a0 The good news is that for several reasons this is much easier for a Forever Project than for graduate school.  In graduate school you don&#39;t really get a free choice of what to work on -- you have to match your thesis topic to an advisor, you can&#39;t do anything that&#39;s been done before, and so on.\u00a0 But in a Forever Project you can pick whatever you&#39;d like to work on.\u00a0 So you can pick something that has great personal interest to you, even if it&#39;s extremely niche and has been done twenty times before.  I talk about picking a topic of \u201cgreat personal interest,&#34; but what does that mean, anyway?\u00a0 A personal interest is something that you find fascinating for its own sake, because of who you are.\u00a0 In other words, something that you find\u00a0 intrinsically interesting.\u00a0 Not something that you think you should study because of the latest article on  Medium\u00a0about how to get ahead in your job, but something that you would feel compelled to explore regardless of whether it provides an immediate benefits or not.\u00a0 In a class I took from\u00a0 William Glass he said \u201cI don&#39;t write because I want to, I write because I have to.&#34;\u00a0 The ideal Forever Project is that sort of topic to you; like an itch that you must scratch.  If there&#39;s no topic in your life like that, fine.\u00a0 Maybe you&#39;re not at a point where you&#39;re ready to take up a Forever Project.\u00a0 Go do other things until some topic rears up and smacks you on the nose.\u00a0 Or maybe there&#39;s a topic that seems kind of interesting.\u00a0 Start exploring it; maybe it will become a Forever Project topic.\u00a0 And if not, at least you&#39;ve learned that!  On top of being intrinsically interesting to you, a Forever Project topic needs to be open-ended.\u00a0 After all, if you&#39;re going to work on something forever, it had better be a big topic.\u00a0 But when I say \u201cbig topic&#34; I don&#39;t mean one that is life-changing or of great importance, I mean one that provides many opportunities to learn new things and to explore in new directions.  Any topic has opportunities to learn skills and knowledge specific to that topic.\u00a0 I call this  direct learning.\u00a0 Some topics have more direct learning opportunities than others.\u00a0 For example, the yo-yo has some opportunities for direct learning.\u00a0 There are different techniques to be mastered, and ways to arrange those techniques into tricks.\u00a0 But on the overall scale of all possible topics, yo-yoing offers limited opportunities.\u00a0 Compare the yo-yo to (say) woodworking, where there are many more techniques to learn, and many different ways to apply those techniques.\u00a0 Ideally, you want to pick a Forever Project topic on the woodworking end of the spectrum rather than the yo-yo end. Many\u00a0 crafts\u00a0make good Forever Projects, with abundant learning opportunities.\u00a0 The reason is that crafts are  skilled work.\u00a0 To do a craft, you have to learn and master skills and this \u201clearning and practicing&#34; is exactly the point of the Forever Project.\u00a0 Another reason is that crafts are creative -- in the sense that means \u201cto create something.&#34;\u00a0 When you craft something, much of the interest is in solving the puzzle of how to use the skills you&#39;ve mastered to create the item you desire to produce.\u00a0 If you&#39;re a woodworker and want to build an end table, you have to think about what joints you will use to build the structure, how you will create the parts of the table, and so on.\u00a0 Compare that to (for example) practicing yoga, where you use your skills to follow along to the directions of your teacher.\u00a0 In both cases you have to master difficult skills, but in one case you also have to creatively apply those skills in problem-solving.\u00a0 And that&#39;s an addition level of personal growth.  Sometimes the difference between a bad and a good Forever Project topic is just in the context and conception.\u00a0 Yo-yo-ing might not be a great Forever Project itself, but if you think of it as the first step of (say)  Circus Arts then it&#39;s easier to see how you might pursue that for a long time.\u00a0 And if you really are on fire to learn the yo-yo as a Forever Project, then do it!\u00a0 But keep yourself open to unexpected learning opportunities along the way.\u00a0 If you get interested in  balance board along the way, don&#39;t turn away because \u201cit isn&#39;t yo-yo.&#34;\u00a0 Try to remember that in the Forever Project it&#39;s the forward motion that counts, not where it takes you.  Topics also have opportunities for  indirect learning.\u00a0 Indirect opportunities are detours -- side trips that can take you down new paths away from the original topic.\u00a0 For example, if your Forever Project was woodworking and you built a chair, you might decide to  cane weave the seat, learning the skills necessary to do that.   And this could lead you into  basket weaving, and the guy at the cane supplies store might show you the  Adirondack pack basket he&#39;d made, and that would get you interested in the history of animal trapping.    Some topics have more connections than other topics.\u00a0 For example, if you decide to write a chess playing program, the indirect learning opportunities are limited.\u00a0 You might get interested in some of the history of chess, or similar games, or different ways to write game-playing programs, but these topics are all pretty close to chess.\u00a0 Conversely, if you decide to write a map-drawing program, you have a wide array of diverse topics to explore:\u00a0 how land forms, how things are named, how maps are drawn, what makes art beautiful, etc.\u00a0 In other words, you want to pick a Forever Topic that has a lot of interesting distractions!  Of course, in graduate school an interesting distraction is the last thing you want.\u00a0 My Ph.D. topic was on creativity, but my adviser was very interested in the related topic of humor and that distraction caused me no end of pain.\u00a0 But this is one of the areas where having forever to work on a project turns the conventional wisdom on its head.\u00a0 You&#39;re doing this for your own personal satisfaction and growth.\u00a0 There&#39;s no such thing as a distraction as long as you&#39;re finding opportunities to grow, so in a Forever Project you actually want a topic that continually throws up interesting distractions.  And on a practical level, if you work on something for a long time (even if not actually forever) you&#39;re inevitably going to have \u201cdry&#34; periods where you are bored with the topic.\u00a0 Having a bunch of interesting distractions lets you pivot away from your dry well and do something else that is interesting and provides you with personal growth.  The lack of indirect learning possibilities was a shortcoming in one of my previous Forever Projects called  Net Prophet\u00a0which predicted college basketball games.\u00a0 This was a topic that was of great intrinsic interest to me (I&#39;ve been a college basketball fan for many years) and offered many interesting direct learning opportunities.\u00a0 But it didn&#39;t really connect to many other topics that were interesting to me, so that when I&#39;d exhausted the direct learning opportunities, I hadn&#39;t found any related topics to take up instead.   The Practice\u00a0  Once you&#39;ve selected a topic for a Forever Project, how should you pursue that?  The most important principle to remember in working on a Forever Project is that it&#39;s  not about  Getting Things Done.\u00a0 It&#39;s about moving forward in a way that is (1) interesting to you, and (2) helps you to grow.\u00a0 So throw out all the usual maxims about getting the most out of your time,  tips for finishing a project, and so on.\u00a0 All you need is a pretty simple loop:\u00a0 find something interesting in your project and then work on it until it&#39;s no longer interesting.\u00a0 Rinse and repeat.\n  There, I&#39;ve given you the secret to a rich and fulfilling life. :-)  There are a couple of practical ways I&#39;ve found to keep the queue of interesting topics full.  The most straightforward is keeping a TODO list -- which is really more of an \u201cInteresting Ideas&#34; list, but that&#3\n......", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:18:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5de5\u7a0b,project,\u65f6\u95f4", "title": "\u201c\u6c38\u8fdc\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u201d", "title_en": "The Forever Project", "transed": 1, "url": "https://heredragonsabound.blogspot.com/2020/02/the-forever-project.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5de5\u7a0b", "project", "\u65f6\u95f4"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1032194, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u90a3\u662f1996\u5e74\u3002\u4e00\u540d\u5c0f\u7537\u5b69\u5728\u9a6c\u91cc\u5170\u5dde\u4f2f\u57fa\u8328\u7ef4\u5c14\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u9ed1\u5c71\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\u5931\u8e2a\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57c3\u5229\u65af\uff0c\u4e00\u4f4d\u6709\u7740\u9ebb\u70e6\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u524d\u8b66\u5b98\uff0c\u4f60\u52a0\u5165\u4e86\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u5f53\u4f60\u9762\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u6050\u60e7\u548c\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u5973\u5deb\u65f6\uff0c\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u666e\u901a\u8c03\u67e5\u5f88\u5feb\u5c31\u4f1a\u53d8\u6210\u65e0\u7a77\u65e0\u5c3d\u7684\u5669\u68a6\uff0c\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u5973\u5deb\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u79d8\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u51fa\u6ca1\u5728\u6811\u6797\u2026\u3002\n\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u5973\u5deb\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u5973\u5deb\u7535\u5f71\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u3001\u6545\u4e8b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6050\u6016\u6e38\u620f\u3002\n\u4ece\u5907\u53d7\u597d\u8bc4\u7684\u5c42\u5c42\u6050\u60e7\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u00b7\u5deb\u5a46(Blair Witch)\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u77e5\u8bc6\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u539f\u521b\u6545\u4e8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eb2\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\u6050\u60e7\u5bf9\u5927\u8111\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\n\u5728\u4e00\u7247\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u88ab\u8bc5\u5492\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\n\u200b\u4f60\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u53bb\uff1a\u4f60\u8eab\u8fb9\u6709\u4f60\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u72d7\u72d7\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u5b50\u5f39\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u62db\u5f85\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u4ed6\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u8d70\u795e\u800c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ed6--\u4f46\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u5f85\u4ed6\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f60\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u3002\n\u5b50\u5f39\uff0c\u6700\u5fe0\u8bda\u7684\u72d7\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4ed6\u5e94\u5f97\u7684\u7231\u4e0e\u597d\u7537\u5b69\u5305\u7684\u5956\u91d1\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5b9a\u5236\u76ae\u6bdb\u3001\u773c\u775b\u989c\u8272\u548c\u8863\u9886\uff0c\u8ba9\u4f60\u52c7\u6562\u7684K-9\u53d8\u5f97\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u60c5\u4eab\u53d7Bullet\u5bf9\u60a8\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u65b0\u53cd\u5e94\u5427\u3002\u6700\u540e\u4f46\u540c\u6837\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u591a\u4e8f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u624b\u673a\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u201c\u8d85\u7ea7\u9738\u738b\u9f99\u201d-\u4efb\u4f55\u7231\u72d7\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u8ff7\u4f60\u6e38\u620f-\u7f13\u89e3\u4f60\u7684\u7d27\u5f20\u60c5\u7eea\u3002\n\u7ad9\u51fa\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u5e03\u83b1\u5c14\u5973\u5deb\u7684\u6050\u6016\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80cc\u8d1f\u7740\u8fc7\u53bb\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u4eba\u65e5\u76ca\u8870\u8d25\u7684\u7406\u667a\u3002\n\u968f\u7740\u4f60\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u68ee\u6797\uff0c\u4f60\u5bf9\u5371\u9669\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u5728\u538b\u529b\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u8ba9\u4f60\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u3002\n\u6587\u672c\uff1a\u6cd5\u8bed\u3001\u82f1\u8bed\u3001\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed\u3001\u5fb7\u8bed\u3001\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u8bed-\u897f\u73ed\u7259\u3001\u6ce2\u5170\u8bed\u3001\u8461\u8404\u7259\u8bed-\u5df4\u897f\u3001\u4fc4\u8bed\u3001\u4e2d\u6587-\u7b80\u4f53\u3001\u65e5\u8bed\u3002\n\u00ae\uff0c\u2122&amp\uff1b\u00a92020\u72ee\u95e8\u5a31\u4e50\u516c\u53f8\u3002\u7248\u6743\u6240\u6709\u3002\u8840\u8165\u00ae\uff0c\u2122&amp\uff1b\u00a92020\u5e74\u8840\u8165\u56e2\u961fS.A.\u3002(\u542b)\u3002\u548c\u8840\u8165\u5c0f\u961fNA\u3002\u7248\u6743\u6240\u6709\u3002\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56", "note_en": "It\u2019s 1996.

"note_en": "Maureen Dittmar of Rochester, New Hampshire, was sifting through junk mail one Saturday in early August when she found an envelope obviously sent by a human being. It began: \u201cThe content of this letter may be hard to hear \u2026 But you deserve to know the truth.\u201d The anonymous author was a staffer at her mother\u2019s nursing home.\n  Dittmar\u2019s rush of cortisol was familiar. Every day for months, the virus had engulfed another crop of facilities. Residents are elderly, frail, and housed in close quarters; they are sitting ducks for a pandemic. By mid-September, the nationwide death toll from long-term care facilities had reached more than  77,000  residents  and staff, 40 percent of the country\u2019s total. For some reason, New Hampshire had only lost a relatively small number, but Dittmar knew better than to believe everything she was told, or assume they were out of the woods.\n   There wasn\u2019t an outbreak, though; the letter was about staffing. Genesis HealthCare, the 357-facility nursing home chain that ran the Colonial Hill Center and by late May had already seen about 1,500 of its residents die, had slashed payroll so drastically that on many shifts, the primary unit had one nursing assistant responsible for 39 patients. Supervisors helped out on the floor whenever they could, but the last nursing manager who had gone to bat for them had been fired.\n  New Hampshire had been lucky to avoid the worst of COVID-19, but the minimum staffing requirements it imposed on nursing homes were the most lenient in the Northeast\u2014and now their residents were paying the price. \u201cIt has always been a known rule in any health care facility to NEVER mention to family or residents that we are having staffing issues,\u201d the author warned. \u201cWe feel that the current restrictions on in-house visitations from the families is allowing a veil of protection for corporate and management. Families are unable to see the full affects [sic] on their loved ones.\u201d\n  Roughly 70 percent of the nation\u2019s 15,400 nursing homes are for-profit, and the gross understaffing on display at Colonial Hill is the flip side of extreme profiteering. Hundreds of thousands of nursing home residents survived the bloodbath of 2020, only to spend the summer, no doubt, wishing the virus would come back for them. State health departments suspended Medicare inspections during the pandemic; it has been 18 months since  Colonial Hill saw one. So management is no longer even trying to avoid the most conspicuous signs of neglect: filthy clothing, odd facial hair, urine on the floor and in the air.\n  In many hard-hit homes, dead friends are being replaced with psychiatric referrals from psych wards and homeless shelters; in more selective ones, dementia sufferers are being  ejected  into psychiatric hospitals. At a facility in Pennsylvania with one certified nursing assistant for every 22 residents, eight assistants teamed up to tell the evening news their patients were going months without a bath. The average resident in one facility in suburban Illinois  lost 3.7 pounds between February and April alone, with nearly a quarter losing more than 5 percent of their body weight. The evening news in Minneapolis in late September tells us of a bird-watcher in his eighties with Lewy body dementia whose daughter takes him home after spying him through a window, disheveled and confused and so bottomlessly sad. He has bruises everywhere, an untreated infection has turned his genitalia bright red; he dies quickly.\n  Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...\n Amplifying this neglect are the  dozens of state laws passed hastily in the spring, granting the entire health care industry immunity from legal liability. \u201cDehydration, malnutrition, falling, bedsores\u2014they\u2019re saying, \u2018Look, we\u2019re not liable for any of that right now because of COVID,\u2019\u201d says Steven Levin, an Illinois trial lawyer who has spent his career suing nursing homes and is working on more than 100 wrongful-death suits right now. These laws comprise the single coherent national policy response to the nursing home bloodbath of spring 2020.\n  In the absence of an accessible long-term care system for all families, older Americans are callously warehoused in these institutions, which in the crisis have descended into death traps. But for decades before the pandemic, for-profit nursing homes have been robbing seniors of their dignity and their money. And where you find extraction of value and indifference toward horrors inflicted on human beings, you inevitably find a financier\u2019s spreadsheet.\n  THE AMERICAN NURSING home industry is a hellscape whose history is generously paved with bad intentions. I began my research under the assumption that senior care facilities were much like other private equity\u2013stripped health care institutions: bought up and saddled with debt and forced to cut costs wherever possible, leading to unconscionable outcomes for workers and residents. I assumed financial firms perverted a formerly well-intentioned system for providing vital care. The truth is almost the inverse. The private equity guys learned a lot of their tricks from the original nursing home predators. Most good people were driven out of the business generations ago, and the ones who have hung on have been mostly punished for refusing to play the game.\n  Roughly 70 percent of the nation\u2019s 15,400 nursing homes are for-profit, and gross understaffing is the flip side of extreme profiteering.\n  \u201cBad nursing homes seem to be contagious,\u201d wrote the pre-eminent nursing home muckraker Mary Adelaide Mendelson, in her 1974 expos\u00e9  Tender Loving Greed: How the Incredibly Lucrative Nursing Home \u201cIndustry\u201d Is Exploiting America\u2019s Old People and Defrauding Us All. She traced the origins of this devolution to about 1950, when an amendment to the Social Security Act allowed nursing homes to collect benefit checks and stipends from the Veterans Administration directly, on behalf of their residents, generating a small windfall for operators shrewd enough to appoint themselves middlemen between senile geriatrics and their assets. Twenty years later, of the more than 200 facilities Mendelson had personally toured, \u201cI could honestly call only one a good home.\u201d\n  As Mendelson explains, the entire nursing home system had by the late 1960s come under the near-total control of a predator class known in some corners as the Syndicate, a sprawling and incomprehensible collection of nursing home owners, front men, and ethically deficient mortgage bankers, doctors, and public officials made famous by an Orthodox Jewish rabbi who was its New York boss, Bernard Bergman. Dubbed the \u201cmeanest man in New York\u201d by the  Village Voice, Bergman by 1975 had reputedly built a nursing home fortune worth  $100 million (a lot of money in those days), according to the  memoir of one of the endless string of attorneys he retained to defend it, the then-youthful Alan Dershowitz.\n  Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...\n We think now of the inception of Medicaid and Medicare as a glorious milestone to recognizing health care as a human right. The Syndicate correctly saw a massive fire hydrant of cash with the capacity to make them all rich, though its leaders got a bit too greedy in the early years. Social Security Administration economists had forecast that Medicaid would spend $25 million to $50 million on nursing home care in its first year of coverage; when the reality turned out to be something more like $300 million, auditors began sniffing around.\n  Much of what we know about the Syndicate emerged in a probe into a gruesome nursing home on 106th Street near Central Park called the Towers, which under the ownership of a mysterious figure named Anne Weiss\u2014who turned out to be Bernard Bergman\u2019s wife (it took the health department, by its own admission, \u201cquite awhile [ sic] to figure out\u201d this little nugget)\u2014had billed Medicaid for 926 days of care for eight patients who had died or been discharged from the home. Inside the facility were flies, urine stench, and dirty beds with no sheets.\n  The ownership of the Towers and many other nursing homes had gone to dizzying lengths to conceal itself. Wherever Mendelson went she heard rumors, often from government officials, of Mafia connections\u2014who else would be so diabolical? But her digging yielded evidence of a specialized  nursing home mafia, a linked set of dons that attached itself parasitically to our most honorable social programs.\n   Two of the era\u2019s most prominent bosses were Bergman and a Rolls Royce\u2013driving former duffel bag manufacturer named Joseph Kosow, known in New England as \u201cKing of the Nursing Homes.\u201d Like Bergman, Kosow had his own endless network of associates, straw buyers, shadowy front groups, and highly placed regulatory and law enforcement officials. Kosow had some troubles with the feds, but only Bergman ever served any time, and when both died in 1984 extremely rich, prot\u00e9g\u00e9s brought their business model into the modern era.\n  Abe Gosman was a longtime associate of Joe Kosow\u2019s, probably from their days in the Boston shoe business. He was a quintessential  Bonfire of the Vanities mogul, with a 143-foot yacht named  Octopussy, an oceanfront palace in Palm Beach bought from Les Wexner that he would later  sell to Donald Trump, and assets worth nearly a half billion dollars, following a string of deals in which he repeatedly sold, bought, and repackaged the same group of nursing homes and psychiatric facilities. Bernard Bergman\u2019s lower-key prot\u00e9g\u00e9s Moshael and Daniel Straus, the sons of his old Connecticut deputy Joseph Straus, launched a nursing home chain called Multicare in 1984 that they sold for more than a billion dollars cash in 1997 to Genesis Health Ventures, another of the high-flying chains founded in the \u201980s during the Reagan era of deregulation. Daniel Straus\u2019s second act, the nursing home chain CareOne, suffered by far the worst outbreaks in their home state of New Jersey, but made lots of money doing it, as a ProPublica investigation explored.\n  Many profitable industries are incestuous and dominated by the sons and grandsons of tycoons. It\u2019s just harder to track in nursing homes, whose trade publications fill my in-box each morning with incessant announcements of the buying and selling, recapitalizing and reorganizing of assets. The New Jersey consultancy commissioned to review the state\u2019s devastating nursing home death toll  found that some changed hands \u201cmultiple times in a single week.\u201d When a registered nurse named Angela Ruckh decided to sue her old nursing home for defrauding the government, she ended up suing seven different companies. A defense attorney who tried to sue the same chain for wrongful death discovered it was spread out over 15 different entities. But all those entities originated with Formation Capital, a private equity giant founded by Arnold Whitman and his shadowy partner, Steve E. Fishman. \u201cYou could spend forever trying to untangle this stuff,\u201d said Ernie Tosh, an Austin-based attorney who runs a side business analyzing nursing home data. \u201cThe nursing home industry as a whole should not be looked at through the lens of normal corporate America. If you think of it as organized crime it will make a lot more sense.\u201d\n  WHITMAN, A FORMER college basketball player from just outside Boston who had dabbled in advertising and worked at a brokerage, entered the nursing home scene in 1984 when he was 31. Abe Gosman was bringing Joe Kosow\u2019s business model into the junk bond era, and he saw in Whitman a natural networker who could bring in deals. \u201cI was one of those guys who wanted to be in something glamorous\u2014advertising, entertainment, something along those lines,\u201d Whitman later said of his younger self. But then he went to meet Abe Gosman in the basement of one of his \u201ctotally depressing\u201d nursing homes. \u201cI remember being overcome by the indignity,\u201d he said. But \u201cI realized that, unglamorous though the nursing home industry is, it was where a good future might indeed be had.\u201d\n  A fixture of Syndicate nursing homes was an early version of what is now called the OpCo/PropCo model, wherein the nursing home\u2019s operating company (OpCo) was separated from the real estate property company (PropCo) in a series of complicated transactions that usually left the OpCo paying massive interest payments, rental payments, or both. The setup lowered taxes for both the OpCo, which appeared to be losing money, and the PropCo, which used the structure to trade the real estate back and forth between entities, collecting profits each time that were taxed as capital gains. OpCo/PropCo, also known as sale-leaseback, is today a common feature used by private equity firms to suck assets out of its portfolio companies, and keep them out of the hands of vendors, employees, and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the (likely) case that the OpCo is forced to file for bankruptcy.\n  Mendelson\u2019s digging yielded evidence of a specialized nursing home mafia, a linked set of dons that attached itself parasitically to our most honorable social programs.\n  Gosman was one of the first nursing home moguls to establish his PropCo as a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT), which didn\u2019t have to pay any taxes so long as it paid out most of its profits as dividends to investors. Gosman dispatched Whitman to find other nursing home chains interested in sale-leasebacks through the REIT, and he brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in deals before striking out on his own in 1992.\n  By the late 1990s, most nursing home OpCos were going bankrupt, done in by a destructive feedback loop of debt, austerity, and illegality. Congress had cut Medicaid reimbursement rates in many states, which caused nursing homes to slash labor and investment in their facilities. A report commissioned by former Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) revealed that reports of serious elder abuse had more than doubled between 1996 and 2000, by which point they had implicated nearly one-third of the nation\u2019s nursing homes. Litigation insurance premiums had surged as a result, especially in Florida, where lawsuit and legal costs for nursing homes had risen tenfold between 1990 and 1998.\n  Whitman saw this cycle of despair as a window of opportunity. Along with Fishman and the owners of a nursing home chain near his office in Atlanta, his company Formation devised a strategy of buying up distressed homes, with a focus on Florida, outsourcing operations to contractors and letting standards fall even further. He paid an unheard-of $27,000 a bed, virtually all of it debt, for a portfolio of 54 facilities previously owned by Beverly Enterprises. He kept going back to the strategy, buying unwanted, mostly Floridian properties for rock-bottom valuations from Genesis, Mariner Health Care, Laurel Health Care, and others.\n  Most states have minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes, though they\u2019re usually far lower than experts say they should be. But the new chain, which would come to be called Consulate Health Care, had no compunction about scheduling well below Florida\u2019s minimums. A 2018  presentation for a Formation deal with another private equity firm called Allegiant gives a sense of how these policies are pitched to investors. The new consortium promised to generate 12 percent annual returns by ending the \u201cmismanagement and spiraling costs\u201d of its \u201cinfamous\u201d previous operator, vowing to chop annual payroll $16 million a year across 18 homes.\n  Formation set a model mimicked in the  190 private equity deals in the nursing home industry since 2015, a $5.3 billion bonanza. The script, written by Arnold Whitman, is familiar: facilities saddled with debt, short-staffed and underpaid workers, residents left to rot, a lack of preparedness that looms large in a pandemic. Much of the tumult seen today is a by-product of the slash-and-burn strategy practiced by Formation and its imitators.\n  This year, thousands of infected humans have been gratuitously transferred in and out of different nursing homes, depending upon where they would be the most profitable. More than 6,400 residents found themselves evicted to homeless shelters and other facilities. In New York, 4,500 patients infected with coronavirus were  sent back to nursing homes, where they spread the disease. Others were dumped into ambulances to die in hospital parking lots, or stuffed into a closet for the police to find, for reasons unclear but possibly having to do with life insurance policies purchased in their names. Hundreds of operators seized $1,200 CARES Act stimulus checks of their patients. After the Federal Trade Commission banned the practice, some  threatened to evict residents who didn\u2019t \u201cvoluntarily\u201d hand theirs over. Dozens more residents participated in  massive amateur hydroxychloroquine experiments. Nurses were fired for wearing masks, calling out sick, or speaking to the media about how direly they needed PPE and extra help. Nursing assistants, whose pay is so abysmally low that they are more likely to work three jobs than one, shared microbes with dozens of other homes as they ferried from morning job to afternoon job to overnight job in cramped shuttle buses and Uber pools. An 88-year-old advanced dementia patient, found wandering the highways after his nursing home evicted him to make way for COVID patients, ended up spending his 89th birthday in jail after he stabbed the nephew who had taken him in with a kitchen knife. A nursing home resident in Brooklyn who died of COVID-19 was buried in a Catholic cemetery and billed $15,000 for makeup, limousine service, and $200 in rosary beads before anyone at the home informed her Jewish family\u2014which had long before informed the facility of her already-purchased family burial plot in a Jewish cemetery\u2014that she had died. A nursing home watchdog and attorney told me about nursing home bosses in Connecticut emptying one of the facility\u2019s supply closets for PPE to sell on the black market, and says that when the street value of N95 masks peaked in April, multiple investors approached her to draw up documents enabling them to discreetly sell off their inventories.\n  These borderline or sometimes flat-out criminal activities, which became front-page news during the pandemic but were a feature of the industry for years, are born of a frantic desire to feed interest and rent payments to legal loan sharks and their investors. The typical COVID-19 superspreader home was afflicted by the same problems that abuse and kill residents in ordinary times: minimal supply budgets, threadbare staffing, and \u201czero infectious disease avoidance protocols,\u201d which regularly wipe out dementia wards during flu season. When critical senior care is given over to the free market, their well-being is subordinated to the balance sheet of people like Arnold Whitman. And the would-be regulatory guardians of the elderly, housed mostly in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and focused on other matters, are at best unaware of the abuse, and at worst complicit by their negligence.\n   THERE WERE A FEW important exceptions to the radical austerity imposed over Formation\u2019s Florida homes, of course. The budget for incentivizing Medicare fraud, for example, expanded considerably. In a whistleblower suit filed by a consulting nurse who went to work coding Medicare claims at two Formation homes in 2011, spreadsheets defaulted to the highest possible \u201cultra\u201d level of care, even though no one got anything approaching that. The whistleblower\u2019s bosses schemed daily to rehire the drug-addict predecessor who\u2019d been escorted from the facility in handcuffs during his third week on the job for stealing thousands of painkillers, because nurses like him understood \u201chow to boost the bottom line.\u201d Bosses gave cash bonuses to nurses for bringing their average reimbursement levels up, while patients\u2019 open wounds went undressed for da\n......", "posttime": "2020-10-30 08:17:55", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags":

"note_en": "Is the answer as simple as our brains forming an electromagnetic &#34;cloud&#34; during our lives?\n   Could the thorny question of human consciousness be answered by simple electromagnetic waves? One improbably dualist scientist believes so, and he suggests the human mind is a combination of physical matter and electromagnetic field. This is a big question, and the proposed answer here is controversial.\n  The University of Surrey\u2019s Johnjoe McFadden \u201cposits that consciousness is in fact the brain\u2019s energy field,\u201d the university  says in a statement, making McFadden\u2019s dualism a question of matter and energy, the institution says\u2014not the classic \u201cbody and mind\u201d distinction. Throughout history, philosophers around the world have tried to account for the special-seeming nature of human beings within the world or even, some fear, the entire universe.\n From where does our robust self-awareness and sentience arise? People who believe everything is physically present and caused are called materialists, meaning there\u2019s nothing extra that can\u2019t be measured\u2014what you see and touch is what humans are. Dualists instead believe there\u2019s something extra.\n This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n  The mind, dualists say, is separate in some way. That could mean a separate, immeasurable, living soul that lives after death, or it could be as \u201csimple\u201d as the   hotly contested idea of qualia: the hint at an extra color humans can\u2019t see, for example, as that relates back to consciousness.\n  The idea of a scientific lampshade on mind-body dualism certainly isn\u2019t new, but McFadden\u2019s research, published in the journal  Neuroscience of Consciousness, is the latest to try to marry the fields.   Deep breath:\n \u201cI argue here that nearly all examples of so-called \u2018integrated information\u2019, including neuronal information processing and conventional computing, are only temporally integrated in the sense that outputs are correlated with multiple inputs: the information integration is implemented in time, rather than space, and thereby cannot correspond to physically integrated information. I point out that only energy fields are capable of integrating information in space.\u201d\n     Basically, McFadden is saying he doesn\u2019t believe the physical structures inside the brain account for how information extends through our \u201cminds\u201d and form integrated ideas. That, he says,  must be happening within the added medium of the brain\u2019s electromagnetic field.\n And all of this, McFadden claims, is supported by experiments on the nature of brain activity. This sounds wild\u2014it genuinely  is wild\u2014but McFadden is a molecular geneticist and is following a centuries-old tradition of introducing the absolute latest knowledge into a new theory of what makes us human.\n   That means as long as the human brain is alive, McFadden says, it generates an electrical glow in which the real nitty-gritty human stuff is happening. And the best part is that his theory is testable in the laboratory.\n \u201cThere are of course many unanswered questions, such as degree and extent of synchrony required to encode conscious thoughts, the influence of drugs or anaesthetics on the cemi field or whether cemi fields are causally active in animal brains,\u201d he  explains in the paper. \u201cYet the cemi theory provides a new paradigm in which consciousness is rooted in an entirely physical, measurable and artificially malleable physical structure and is amenable to experimental testing.\u201d\n   This content is created and maintained by a third party, and imported onto this page to help users provide their email addresses.

company reported a decrease in users in the U.S. and Canada but moderate revenue growth in its third-quarter earnings.\n In the U.S. and Canada,\u00a0Facebook&#39;s user base fell to 196 million daily active users from 198 million a quarter earlier.\n The StopHateForProfit\u00a0ad boycott did not seem to impact the company&#39;s advertising revenue, which was up 22% compared to a year ago.\n Facebook stock was down more than 2% on Thursday after the company reported a decrease in users in the U.S. and Canada but moderate revenue growth in  its third-quarter earnings.\n  In the U.S. and Canada,\u00a0Facebook&#39;s user base fell to 196 million daily active users from 198 million a quarter earlier. The company said its U.S. and Canada user base had been elevated during the second quarter due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The company cautioned that it expects its user base in the U.S. and Canada to remain flat or decrease in the fourth quarter.\n  Its user base in Europe remained flat at 305 million daily active users for the third consecutive quarter.\n  Facebook\u00a0said it counts 3.21 billion monthly users across its family of apps, compared to 3.14 billion in the previous quarter. This metric is used to measure\u00a0Facebook&#39;s total user base across its main app, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp.\n The StopHateForProfit\u00a0 ad boycott did not seem to impact the company&#39;s advertising business, with ad revenue up 22% compared to a year ago. Additionally, the company now has 10 million active advertisers, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an earnings call. That&#39;s up from 9 million in July. The boycott included more than 1,000 advertisers that paused ads on the social network during the month of July in protest of the company&#39;s hate speech and misinformation policies.\n Facebook expects its fourth quarter ad revenue growth rate to be higher than the third quarter, driven by holiday season demand, the company said.\n  Facebook&#39;s &#34;Other&#34; revenue came in at $249 million for the quarter, down 7% compared to last year. This includes sales of Oculus virtual reality headsets and the Portal video-chatting devices. However, the company said sales of the Oculus Quest 2 have been strong and could benefit its &#34;Other&#34; revenue in the fourth quarter.\n  Despite Apple&#39;s decision to delay ad tracking changes to iOS 14, Facebook still anticipates that it could be a problem.\n &#34;In addition, we expect more significant targeting and measurement headwinds in 2021,&#34; the company said in its earnings report. &#34;This includes headwinds from platform changes, notably on Apple iOS 14, as well as those from the evolving regulatory landscape.&#34;", "posttime": "2020-10-30 07:56:01", "source_domain":

"note_en": "Like many other students, I remember being taught during my early education that glass\u2014because the material is somewhere in between liquid and glass states\u2014is actually  flowing,\u00a0ever so slowly. Old windows, my teacher explained, are measurably thicker at the bottom than at the top.\n I remember being astonished by this fact as a child\u2014how could something that seems so physically solid actually be more like a liquid? It was an important early lesson to a curious mind that some things are not always as they seem.\n  Glass scientists, including ACerS Fellow  Edgar Zanotto, have previously  shattered the flowing glass window legend.\n But recent advances have now allowed glass scientists at Corning to take another closer look at this urban legend by calculating the rate of glass flow in medieval windows.\n The team combined glass transition theory and experimental characterization techniques, which, the scientists report, had astounding agreement. Their results indicate the highest ever direct measurement of glass viscosity at low temperatures.\n The scientists\u2014including ACerS members Ozgur Gulbiten and  John Mauro, now at Penn State University\u2014used medieval glass windows in Westminster Abbey from 1268 AD as the basis for their calculations.\n Their measurements reveal that medieval glass has a much lower viscosity than expected at room temperature\u201416 orders of magnitude less than previous estimates, which were based on soda-lime silicate glass.\n However, despite the low values, the glass\u2019s viscosity is still \u201cmuch too high to observe measurable viscous flow on human time scale,\u201d the authors write in a paper describing their findings, published in the   Journal of the American Ceramic Society.\n   The team\u2019s calculations show that the medieval glass maximally flows just ~1 nm over the course of   one billion years.\n That\u2019s just 0.000000001 nm per year\u2014which, although is  theoretically measurable, would be practically impossible to achieve.\n \u201cThis result confirms that the long-lasting myth about the flow of glasses at room temperature is still just that: a myth,\u201d the authors conclude in the paper.\n While the results are based on calculations and experiments for those specific Westminster Abbey windows, however, the results extend beyond those examples.\n \u201cThe flow rate is specific to the particular viscosity curve, which is typical for medieval cathedral glass compositions,\u201d Mauro explains in an email. Those compositions usually included higher K 2O and MgO concentrations and lower SiO 2 and Na 2O concentrations than modern window glasses. But \u201cthe glass composition would have to be changed rather dramatically to get a qualitatively different result.\u201d\n In other words, although different glass compositions will have different flow rates, the rate is still going to be too slow to account for any measurable changes. So my teacher, and many others, were definitively wrong in stating that those old glass windows were slowly seeping down toward the earth.\n However, my teacher wasn\u2019t wrong that many old glass windows are actually measurably thicker at the bottom\u2014but that difference can be traced to manufacturing inconsistencies.\n Medieval windows were typically manufactured using the  crown process, in which glass was blown into a hollow globe, flattened, and spun out into a flat disk. Glass window panes were cut from the non-uniform disks, which were thicker in the center and thinner at the edges.\n \u201cGiven non-uniform glass, it is only natural to orient the thicker part of the glass at the bottom, since it gives the appearance of being more stable,\u201d Mauro explains.\n In addition to definitively debunking the flowing glass window myth, the new  JACerS paper represent an important development in available methods for studying low-temperature dynamics of glasses, especially commercially relevant glasses, such as glasses used in flat panel display and chemically strengthened cover glass\u2014like  Gorilla Glass.\n \u201cThis work represents significant advances in both theoretical and experimental characterization of low temperature viscosity, which is also

I enthusiastically applaud them for making this change.\n  The end-to-end encryption capability arrives on the heels of their acquisition of  Keybase in earlier this year. Hiring a team of security experts and cryptography engineers seems like a good move overall.\n Upon hearing this news, I decided to be a good neighbor and take a look at their source code, with the reasoning, \u201cIf so many people\u2019s privacy is going to be dependent on Zoom\u2019s security, I might as well make sure they\u2019re not doing something ridiculously bad.\u201d\n Except I couldn\u2019t find their source code anywhere online. But they did publish  a white paper on Github\u2026\n   What follows is the opinion of some guy on the Internet with a fursona\u2013so whether or not you choose to take it seriously should be informed by this context. It is not the opinion of anyone\u2019s employer, nor is it endorsed by Zoom, etc. Tell your lawyers to calm their nips.\n More importantly, I\u2019m not here to hate on Zoom for doing a good thing, nor on the security experts that worked hard on making Zoom better for their users. The responsibility of security professionals is to the users, after all.\n Also, these aren\u2019t zero-days, so don\u2019t try to lecture me about \u201cresponsible\u201d disclosure. (That term is also  problematic, by the way.)\n    Note: I\u2019ve altered the screenshots to be white text on a black background, since my blog\u2019s color scheme is darker than a typical academic PDF. You can find the source  here.\n   It\u2019s a little weird that they\u2019re calculating a signature over SHA256(Context) || SHA256(M), considering Ed25519 uses SHA512 internally.\n It would make just as much sense to sign Context || M directly\u2013or, if pre-hashing large streams is needed, SHA512(Context || M).\n  At the top of this section, it says it uses libsodium\u2019s  crypto_box interface. But then they go onto\u2026 not actually use it.\n   The only part of the libsodium interface that\u2019s being used is   crypto_box_beforenm(), which could easily have been a call to  crypto_scalarmult()instead (since they\u2019re passing the output of the scalar multiplication to HKDF anyway).\n  Also, the SHA256(a) || SHA256(b) pattern returns. Zoom\u2019s engineers must love SHA256 for some reason.\n  Binding the ciphertext and the signature to the same context string is a sensible thing to do, it\u2019s just the concatenation of SHA256 hashes is a bit weird when SHA512 exists.\n   Here we see Zoom using the a SHA256 of a constant string (\u201c Zoombase-1-ClientOnly-MAC-SecurityCode\u201c) in a construction that tries but fails to be HMAC.\n And then they concatenate it with the SHA256 hash of the public key (which is already a 256-bit value), and then they hash the whole thing again.\n It\u2019s redundant SHA256 all the way down. The redundancy of \u201cMAC\u201d and \u201cSecurityCode\u201d in their constant string is, at least, consistent with the rest of their design philosophy.\n It would be a real shame if double-hashing carried the risk of  invalidating security proofs, or if  the security proof for HMAC required a high Hamming distance of padding constants and this design decision also later  saved HMAC from related-key attacks.\n   Wait, you\u2019re telling me Zoom was aware of HMAC\u2019s existence this whole time?\n   None of the design decisions Zoom made that I\u2019ve criticized here are security vulnerabilities, but they do demonstrate an early lack of cryptography expertise in their product design.\n After all, the weirdness is almost entirely contained in section 3 of their white paper, which describes the \u201cPhase I\u201d of their rollout. So what I\u2019ve pointed out here appears to be mostly legacy cruft that wasn\u2019t risky enough to bother changing in their final design.\n The rest of their paper is pretty straightforward and pleasant to read. Their design makes sense in general, and each phase includes an \u201cAreas to Improve\u201d section.\n All in all, if you\u2019re worried about the security of Zoom\u2019s E2EE feature, the only thing they can really do better is to publish the source code (and link to it from the whitepaper repository for ease-of-discovery) for this feature so independent experts can publicly review it.\n However, they seem to be getting a lot of mileage out of the experts on their payroll, so I wouldn\u2019t count on that happening.", "posttime": "2020-10-30 07:51:54", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u8bbe\u8ba1,design,zoom", "title": "Zoom\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u5bc6\u7684\u79bb\u5947\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9", "title_en": "Bizarre Design Choices in Zoom\u2019s End-to-End Encryption", "transed": 1, "url": "https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/?hac", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u8bbe\u8ba1", "design", "zoom"]}]
