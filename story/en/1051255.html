The street was shut down to vehicular traffic. People laid red-and-white-checked picnic blankets on the streets. Others lazily sipped gin cocktails outside Weather Up. The restaurants along the avenue, places like Olmsted, Alta Calidad, and Chuko, served plates of glistening spareribs and oversize bowls of miso ramen to packed tables of customers on sidewalks, under the glint of string lights, surrounded by umbrellas, snake plants, and beds of artificial turf.</p><p>在过去的夏天，在任何远程愉快的星期六晚上，布鲁克林的Vanderbilt大道的前景高度邻居是一个全面的街区。街上被关闭到车辆交通。人们在街上奠定了红色和白色的野餐毯子。其他人懒洋洋地啜饮杜松子酒鸡尾酒在天气之外。沿着大道的餐厅，奥尔姆斯特（Alta Calidad和Chuko）等地方，闪闪发光的Spareribs和闪闪发光的Spareribs，以及在人行道上的灯罩上的彩色墨水拉面，在弦灯灯下，被遮阳伞，蛇植物包围人造草皮的床。</p><p> A few blocks over, on Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights, it was a different story. There were plenty of open restaurants, but none were busy. Cars zoomed up and down the street. Chairs and tables were minimally stationed outside but with few decorative accents. No string lights, no artificial turf, but the food spoke for itself, from the thickly crusted jerk chicken at Peppa’s to the grilled shrimp skewers stained with tamarind sauce at  La Ñapa, a tapas bar.</p><p> 几个街区，在冠高的Nostrand大道上，这是一个不同的故事。有很多开放式餐厅，但没有人忙。汽车上下达到街道。椅子和桌子在外面驻扎在外，但用少量装饰性口音。没有字符串灯，没有人造草皮，但食物本身就发言，从佩珀的厚厚的混蛋鸡肉到烤的虾串，在拉斯巴帕斯的罗望子酱沾上罗望子酱。</p><p> “It does feel pretty dead,” Francisco Anton, chef-owner of La Ñapa, messaged me one August evening. He added that his neighbors were heading to Vanderbilt to hang out.</p><p> “它确实感到漂亮死了，”弗朗西斯科安东尼，拉伊纳帕的厨师所有者，八月晚上给了我。他补充说，他的邻居正向Vanderbilt出去玩。</p><p>  Last June, New York City’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced an outdoor dining program that’s now become a permanent fixture of the city despite the fickle opening and closing of indoor dining. For many struggling restaurants, it&#39;s been a lifeline. But not for Anton. The $10,000 he was quoted by an architect for an outdoor build-out is more than his small family-run restaurant can afford. And in November, the city sent out new guidelines requiring roadway barriers and at least two open sides for outdoor booths. Anton says the cost of an insulated, well-designed outdoor dining setup is the same as opening a second restaurant.</p><p>  去年6月，纽约市市长Bill de Blasio宣布了一个户外用餐计划，即尽管室内用餐开放和关闭，但仍成为该市的永久夹具。对于许多斗争的餐馆，它＆＃39是一个生命线。但不适合安东尼。他是一家户外建筑物的建筑师引用的10,000美元的价格超过了他的小家庭经营的餐厅。在11月，该市发出了新的准则，要求道路障碍和至少两个用于室外展位的开放方面。安东表示，绝缘精心设计的户外用餐设置的成本与第二家餐馆相同。</p><p>  There are other factors too: Anton says street cleaning doesn’t happen frequently on his block, resulting in clogged storm drain grates and dirty sidewalks. And during the heightened tensions in June,  the city removed trash cans from his block and other neighborhoods in the city to prevent people from throwing them into storefronts, which has caused an increase in street waste. Nostrand is also a major avenue with tons of traffic, and its express Select Bus Service route would make it ineligible for  Open Streets, the program that allowed restaurateurs along Vanderbilt Avenue to expand their business beyond the sidewalk. “No one is going to want to sit outside with a bunch of gray snow to eat at my restaurant,” he says. “They will go to neighborhoods that are better kept by the city.”</p><p>  还有其他因素：安东说街头清洁不会经常在他的块上发生，导致堵塞的风暴流失炉排和肮脏的人行道。在6月份的紧张局势中，该市从他的街区和城市的其他社区删除了垃圾桶，以防止人们将它们投入店面，这导致了街头废物增加。 Nostrand也是一大吨交通的主要大道，其快速选择巴士服务路线将使敞开的街道，该计划允许沿着范德比尔特大道允许restairators展开的计划，以扩展其业务超越人行道。 “没有人想要坐在外面，在我的餐厅吃一堆灰色的雪，”他说。 “他们将前往城市保持更好的街区。”</p><p>  Restaurants are an aesthetics-driven business. Design and atmosphere set the tone for a meal before any food arrives at the table. But hiring a designer means ponying up for fees and materials in an industry with single-digit margins. And in New York City, where socioeconomic divisions run deep, rents are sky-high, and  one-third of small businesses are expected to close because of the pandemic, many restaurants lack the infrastructure and financing that their high-end counterparts do. And many of those restaurants are run by immigrants and Black and brown communities and are located in under-resourced neighborhoods. Outdoor dining—and the winter—has made these inequities even worse.</p><p>  餐馆是一种美学驱动的业务。在任何食物到达桌面之前，设计和大气设置膳食的基调。但雇用设计师意味着在一个具有单位边距的行业中的费用和材料淘汰。在纽约市，社会经济划分的流量深处，租金是天空高，预计由于大流行，许多餐厅的小企业都会关闭其高端同行的基础设施和融资。许多餐馆都是由移民和黑色和棕色社区经营的，位于资源不足的社区。户外用餐 - 冬季 - 已经使这些不公平体更糟糕。</p><p>  In the 10014 zip code, which covers the affluent and  nearly 73 percent white Greenwich Village, an estimated 64 percent of restaurants are open for outdoor dining (according to data calculated by dividing the number of restaurants open in a zip code, per the Department of Transportation, over the number of restaurants in that zip code, per the NYC Department of Health). By contrast, in the 11213 zip code of Crown Heights—a majority Black neighborhood  where the average salary is $35,000—just 16 percent of restaurants are open for outdoor dining. This speaks, in part, to the lack of access to design resources that would allow owners to make their restaurants compliant with city regulations and reopen, says Sreoshy Banerjea, the assistant vice president of urban design for the  New York City Economic Development Corporation.</p><p>  在10014个邮政编码中，涵盖了富裕的白色格林威治村，估计的64％的餐厅为户外用餐开放（根据通过划分在邮政编码中的餐馆数量的餐馆数量计算的数据每纽约邮政编码的邮政编码的餐厅数量超过邮政编码）。相比之下，在皇冠高度的11213邮政编码 - 一大多数黑色社区，平均薪水为35,000美元 - 仅需16％的餐厅为户外用餐开放。纽约市经济发展公司城市设计助理副总裁SreoShy Banerjea表示，这说明缺乏允许业主允许业主将其符合城市法规和重新开放的餐厅的设计资源。 </p><p>  Banerjea helped start  Design Corps, a recent partnership between  NYCxDESIGN, a global design festival in New York City, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation to offer pro bono design assistance to restaurants. So far, 50 restaurants have applied to the program—many seeking help with weatherproof setups—and there aren’t enough volunteer architects to meet the demand.</p><p>Banerjea帮助启动设计兵团，最近纽约市的全球设计节与纽约市的全球设计节之间的伙伴关系，为餐厅提供Pro Bono设计援助。到目前为止，50家餐厅应用于该节目 - 许多寻求防风机构的帮助 - 并且没有足够的志愿者建筑师满足需求。</p><p>  Other organizations doing similar work include the Van Alen Institute’s  Neighborhoods Now, which connects design firms with businesses in neighborhoods hardest hit by the pandemic, and  Design Advocates, an organization of architects offering pro bono design services to small businesses in New York City in need, including restaurants like La Ñapa, whose setup is still in process.</p><p>  其他同类工作的组织包括van Alen Institute的社区，该社区将与大流行病最难以触及的社区的企业，以及设计倡导者的设计公司，为需要Pro Bono设计服务，为需要的小型企业提供Pro Bono设计服务，包括LaIndeñapa等餐馆，其设置仍在过程中。</p><p> Michael Chen, one of the cofounders of Design Advocates (and the founder of his own architecture firm,  Michael K Chen), says there’s a huge gap in understanding of government regulations around outdoor dining, especially among restaurateurs who can’t afford lawyers but also can’t afford to temporarily close. Often, these are small restaurants in under-resourced neighborhoods operating day-to-day, without elaborate business models. A big part of Chen’s work is just translating the legalese and coming up with solutions to help restaurants avoid receiving violations (Design Advocates is currently working on plans for plastic partitions, heated seats, and overhead electric heaters that can be made affordably and installed easily). Other barriers include language, technology, and physical street space available, adds Val Hoffman, the program director for NYCxDESIGN.</p><p> Michael Chen是设计倡导者的联合国之一（以及他自己的建筑公司Michael K Chen的创始人Michael K Chen），了解对户外用餐周围的政府法规的巨大差距，特别是在无法承担律师的餐馆老板，也是如此不能暂时关闭。通常，这些是在日常运营的社区内的小餐馆，没有精心制作的商业模式。陈的工作的一大部分是在避免接受违规的帮助餐馆的法律方面兼出了法律言，并提出了帮助餐馆的解决方案（设计倡导者目前正在制定塑料隔板，加热座椅和架空电加热器的计划，可容易地制造和安装的架空电加热器） 。其他障碍包括可用的语言，技术和物理街道空间，为NYCXDesign的节目总监Val Hoffman添加了Val Hoffman。</p><p> The outdoor dining setup that Design Advocates is currently working on for La Ñapa will definitely be a game changer, according to Anton. With 31 seats, it’ll help him to hire back many of his workers, largely immigrants who he says were unable to receive unemployment. But it’s taking time to design, and it keeps getting more expensive as winter creeps in, with the cost of heaters and air curtains. He’s not sure when the outdoor installation will be up and running and must rely on takeout and delivery in the meantime.</p><p> 根据Anton的说法，设计倡导者目前正在为La IndieNapa工作的户外用餐设置肯定会成为游戏更换者。拥有31个席位，它将帮助他雇用他的许多工人，这主要是他所说的移民无法获得失业。但它正在花时间设计，并且随着冬天的蠕变，它保持较贵，加热器和空气窗帘的成本。他不确定户外安装是否会跑步，并且必须在此期间依靠外卖和交付。</p><p>  Mouna Thiam, the owner of  Le Paris Dakar, a French Senegalese café with three locations in Bed-Stuy, says that if Design Advocates hadn’t offered to help, she wouldn’t have any outdoor dining. She was initially quoted $8,000 without the furniture for a build-out by another design firm, and her restaurants are making half the revenue they were before the pandemic. Her outdoor setup, which includes pale pink umbrellas and big bunches of daisies, brought in meaningful business over the summer, though she can’t afford heat lamps right now.</p><p>  Mouna Thiam是一家位于床上斯特赖的三个地点的法国塞内加尔咖啡馆Le Paris Dakar的所有者，他说，如果设计倡导者没有提供帮助，她就没有户外用餐。由于另一家设计公司的家具，她最初被引用了8,000美元，而且她的餐馆正在制作一半的收入，他们在大流行前的收入。她的户外设置包括淡粉色遮阳伞和大巨大的雏菊，在夏天带来了有意义的业务，虽然她现在买不起热灯。</p><p>  But access to design resources like these don’t resolve existing inequities in these communities. Even if she were offered help, Cassandre Davilmar, who owns  Lakou Café, a Haitian-American restaurant in Weeksville, Brooklyn, isn’t sure she could make outdoor dining work in her neighborhood.</p><p>  但是访问这些资源，如这些，不要解决这些社区中的现有不公平现有的。即使她提供帮助，拥有LakouCafé的Cassandre Davilmar，Brooklyn的Haitian-American Restaurant，不确定她可以在邻近做户外用餐工作。</p><p> “We are on Utica, which is a pretty congested area, and we are not one of those streets with a huge sidewalk,” she says. She initially saw outdoor dining as “a hindrance in the neighborhood, taking up parking spots in an already congested area.” Like on Nostrand, there isn’t much street cleaning along Utica. “There is a lot of trash rolling down the street,” Davilmar adds.</p><p> “我们在尤蒂卡上，这是一个非常拥挤的地区，我们不是那些带有巨大人行道的街道之一，”她说。她最初看到户外用餐作为“邻居的障碍，在已经拥挤的地区占用停车位”。“就像在Nostrand上一样，沿utica没有太多的街道清洁。 “街上有很多垃圾，”达维尔马尔补充道。 </p><p> On top of this, her neighborhood was one of those hardest hit by the COVID-19 virus. “Do I really want to encourage folks to sit outside when we were a coronavirus hot spot?” she asks. Still, she set up four tables on the sidewalk with umbrellas, plants, and tents. “We are one of the few places in the neighborhood that was a sit-down spot, so I don’t want us to just do takeout,” she says. But the wind knocked over the plants and broke the umbrellas and tents. She put in a request with Open Streets to get her street shut down to traffic on weekends, like Vanderbilt Avenue, but it was denied because of the location along a major bus line. “I was like, ‘There are bus lines on Vanderbilt,’” she says.</p><p>在此之上，她的社区是Covid-19病毒最困难的人之一。 “当我们是冠心病热点时，我真的想鼓励人们坐在外面吗？”她问。尽管如此，她还在人行道上设置了四张桌子，遮阳伞，植物和帐篷。 “我们是邻居的少数地方之一，这是一个坐下的地方，所以我不希望我们去拿东西，”她说。但风吹过植物并打破了雨伞和帐篷。她在敞开的街道上提出要求，让她的街道在周末关闭到交通，如虚空比斯特大道，但由于沿着主要总线的位置被拒绝。 “我就像，'虚栏上有公共汽车线，'”她说。</p><p> “It is hard, because we deserve nice things, too,” Davilmar explains, “but at the same time all those structural inequities cause things to hit us harder and make us be more cautious. It is a lose-lose situation.”</p><p> “这很难，因为我们应该得到美好的事情，”Davilmar解释道，“但同时所有这些结构性不公平都会导致事情更加努力，让我们更加谨慎。这是一种失败的情况。“</p><p>  James Lam’s restaurant,  Spicy Shallot, which he co-owns with his wife, Inthira Lam, is situated in Elmhurst in Queens, another area devastated by the virus. He was able to set up outdoor dining with partitions, thanks to a friend who is a contractor. But he says many people in the area aren’t able to do much more than some outdoor tables and chairs, and the neighborhood hasn’t fully recovered from being a virus epicenter. Customers outside the neighborhood are hesitant to visit. Still, the restaurant’s basic setup has been helpful—revenue is up 30 percent.</p><p>  James Lam的餐厅辛辣的青葱，他与妻子合作，他在厄尔赫岛均位于皇后区的Elmhurst，另一个由病毒摧毁的区域。由于作为承包商的朋友，他能够设立户外用餐。但他说，该地区的许多人不能超过一些户外桌椅，并且附近没有完全从病毒震中恢复过来。附近的客户犹豫不决。尽管如此，餐厅的基本设置却有用 - 收入增长30％。</p><p>  Some restaurateurs fear that setting up outdoor dining might open themselves up to unwanted scrutiny. Abigail Coover Hume, a board member at Design Advocates, has noticed that enforcement of outdoor dining guidelines has been inconsistent among different neighborhoods. Restaurants in under-resourced neighborhoods are receiving violations that she doesn’t see those in more affluent neighborhoods getting. (Joseph Yacca, the Director of Operations for the Department of Transportation’s Highway Inspections &amp; Quality Assurance unit, refuted this.)</p><p>  一些餐馆老板担心建立户外用餐可能会使自己敞开到不必要的审查。设计倡导者的董事会成员Abigail Coover Hume已经注意到户外用餐指南的执行在不同的社区之间存在不一致。资源不足社区的餐馆正在接受违规行为，她没有看到那些更富裕的社区获得的人。 （交通部公路检查部的业务总监Joseph Yacca;质量保证单位，驳斥这一点。）</p><p> At La Ñapa, Anton has put up a chain-and-post barrier to separate his restaurant from the lengthy line at the UPS store next door and to prevent people from blocking the door of his restaurant. He hasn’t even set up outdoor dining, yet the restaurant has received three violations.</p><p> 在LaIneñapa，安东尼州立了一个链条和柱子障碍，将他的餐厅分开，在隔壁的UPS商店的冗长线上分开，并防止人们阻止他的餐馆的门。他甚至没有设置户外用餐，但餐厅已收到三次违规行为。</p><p> To drum up business, he collaborated with other restaurants in the neighborhood to run a 10 percent discount across the board. Other places are discussing sharing resources such as heat lamps. But the challenges seem greater than what grassroots initiatives can accomplish.</p><p> 为了鼓起来，他与附近的其他餐厅合作，董事会享受10％的折扣。其他地方正在讨论分享资源，如热灯。但挑战似乎大于基层举措可以实现的。</p><p> “I haven’t seen anything large-scale that would really alleviate those pressures on a systemic level,” Chen says, referring to the unequal distribution of city resources across neighborhoods, the barriers to capital and funding that restaurateurs without Rolodexes of investors face. “We are cobbling together the resources we can on a case by case basis.”</p><p> “我没有看到任何大规模的大规模，真正可以缓解这些压力的全身水平，”陈说，指的是跨社区城市资源的不平等分配，资本和资金的障碍，没有投资者的rolodexes的餐厅老板。 “我们在案例基础上塑造了我们可以在案件的资源。” </p><p> Anton agrees, fearing that without government funding for small businesses and better unemployment benefits for the general public, small independent restaurants like his, which make up the backbone of the industry, will not be able to survive. And with a slumping economy, he adds, “Even if we have a beautiful, warm, and cozy structure outside, even if we have no COVID, people will not come out and spend.”</p><p>安东尼同意，担心没有政府对小企业的资金和更好的公众失业救济金，小型独立餐厅，如他的行业的骨干，将无法生存。随着经济萎缩，他补充道，“即使我们有一个美丽，温暖，舒适的结构，即使我们没有Covid，人们也不会出来花钱。”</p><p> “People like me, like my family, this is all we have,” he continues. “We don’t have money behind us, pushing a brand or pushing a book deal or pushing a TV show. We just like working every day and making the money, so we can have a decent life or whatever we can afford.”</p><p> “像我这样的人，像我的家人一样，这就是我们所拥有的，”他继续。 “我们在我们身后没有钱，推动一个品牌或推动书籍交易或推动电视节目。我们只是喜欢每天工作并赚钱，所以我们可以拥有一个体面的生活或任何我们能买得起的东西。“</p><p> Outdoor dining has become more than a way to seat more guests and make more money—it’s become a symbol of systemic inequity long ingrained in the city. And it’s no longer a design solution but a burden in itself.</p><p> 户外用餐已成为座位更多的客人，并制作更多金钱 - 它已成为城市根深蒂固的系统性不公平的象征。它不再是设计解决方案，而是本身的负担。</p><p>  “Right now, we are not caring about aesthetics,” Banerjea says, “because it is about survival.”</p><p>  “现在，我们不关心美学，”Banerjea说，“因为它是为了生存。” </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/outdoor-dining-design-inequities-in-nyc">https://www.bonappetit.com/story/outdoor-dining-design-inequities-in-nyc</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/经济/">#经济</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/outdoor/">#outdoor</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/餐厅/">#餐厅</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
