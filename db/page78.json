But as Wired  reported last week, a \u201cmuch broader phase of that experiment has quietly been underway since mid-November. That\u2019s when Signal made the same feature accessible to all of its users without fanfare, offering the ability to send digital payments far more private than a credit card transaction\u2014or a Bitcoin transfer\u2014to many millions of phones.\u201d\n  MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard told the outlet that the rollout has spurred massive adoption of the cryptocurrency, telling Wired that \u201cthere are over a hundred million devices on planet Earth right now that have the ability to turn on MobileCoin and send an end-to-end encrypted payment in five seconds or less.\u201d\n Notably, one needs to load one\u2019s wallet with the cryptocurrency first, and, as Wired notes, it is listed for sale on only a few smaller cryptocurrency exchanges, including FTX, and none yet offer it to U.S. consumers. (FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is one of many investors in MobileCoin through his quantitative trading firm and cryptocurrency liquidity provider, Alameda Research.)\n Even Americans will have access to the currency shortly, however, Goldbard told Wired, pointing to recently signed agreements, including with the cryptocurrency payment processor  Zero Hash, that should allow U.S. residents buy MobileCoin within the first few months of this year.\n  In the meantime, going worldwide has been good for MobileCoin, which last summer raised $66 million in Series B funding at a $1.066 billion valuation and, according to sources close to the company, is in the process of raising a Series C round at a valuation that one source describes as \u201cin the high single-digit billions\u201d of dollars.\n MobileCoin\u2019s growth has also raised questions about Signal and about Marlinspike, who has seemingly tried to maintain some distance between himself and MobileCoin. One apparent reason why centers on Signal employees, some of who told reporter Casey Newton last year that they viewed Signal\u2019s exploration of cryptocurrency as  risky and an invitation for bad actors to use the platform.\n A potentially bigger, but related, concern of critics is that integrating a privacy coin could cause legal headaches for Signal. As Matt Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University, told Wired last week, \u201cI\u2019m very nervous they\u2019re going to get themselves into a problematic situation by flirting with this kind of payment infrastructure when there\u2019s so much legislation and regulation around it.\u201d\n It\u2019s a valid concern. As we\u2019ve  noted\u00a0 previously, cryptocurrencies and messaging apps haven\u2019t historically mixed well owing to nervous regulators. Kik Messenger, the mobile messaging app founded by a group of University of Waterloo students in 2009, created a digital currency called Kin for its users to spend inside the platform. The project ultimately led to a years-long battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission that nearly decimated the company. Telegram, a much bigger messaging app than Signal \u2014 it claims more than 500 million monthly active users \u2014 similarly  abandoned plans to offer its own decentralized cryptocurrency to anyone with a smartphone after years of battling with the SEC.\n Even Facebook hasn\u2019t been able to gain much traction with its own cryptocurrency project, with the longtime leader of that effort, David Marcus, announcing back in November that he was  leaving the company.\n If Marcus shows up at MobileCoin, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised, but we\u2019d be even less surprised to see Marlinspike get more involved in some capacity.\n Neither Goldbard nor Marlinspike have responded to our requests today for more information, but asked if Marlinspike might consider taking over MobileCoin as CEO (the company doesn\u2019t have one), a source close to him says he is \u201cnot doing that\u201d and right now is just \u201ctaking a break.\u201d\n We\u2019ll see. We aren\u2019t promising to eat our shoes if we\u2019re wrong. (It happens!)\n For now, Marlinspike writes in his post, he will remain on Signal\u2019s board while Signal\u2019s search for a new CEO continues. Its executive chair, WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, will serve as Signal\u2019s interim CEO in the meantime.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 09:27:00", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "marlinspike,mobilecoin", "title": "Moxie Marlinspike\u6b63\u5728\u7559\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7;\u8fd9\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6000\u7591\u4ed6\u7684\u9886\u5bfc\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMoxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal; here\u2019s where we suspect he\u2019s headed and why\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/", "via": "", "real_tags": []}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5d7889e5c48566b3b4ab981b683a2f6d.jpeg", "infoid": 1072700, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u5468\u4e00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\uff0cRIVIAN\u57282021\u5e74\u5e95\u6c47\u51fa\u4e86920\u8f86\u8f66\u3002\u6839\u636e\u517612\u6708\u4efd\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u80a1\u4e1c\uff0cRIVIAN\u6709\u8d85\u8fc771,000\u201c\u9884\u8ba2\u201d\uff08\u610f\u5473\u7740\u53ef\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\uff08\u5373\u9000\u8fd8\u7684\u9884\u8ba2\uff09\u3002\n\u572812\u6708\u4efd\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u547c\u53eb\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u4e24\u6b21\u63d0\u5230\u751f\u4ea7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u5f26\u4e50\u961f\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\n\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u6807\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u6307\u51fa\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u662f\u201c\u4e3b\u8981\u6309\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5347\u7ea7\u201d\u3002\n\u4f5c\u4e3aRIVIAN\u53c2\u52a0\u5761\u9053\u7684\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u901a\u7528\u6c7d\u8f66\u548c\u798f\u7279\u6b63\u5728\u51c6\u5907\u542f\u52a8\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u3002\u798f\u7279\u8868\u793a\uff0c1\u67084\u65e5\u5c06\u57282023\u5e74\u4e2d\u671f\uff0c\u6bcf\u5e74\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u7535\u52a8F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u80fd\u529b\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f2023\u5e74\u768415\u4e07\u8f86\u3002 F-150\u96f7\u7535\u62fe\u53d6\u5361\u8f66\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4ea4\u4ed8\u9884\u8ba1\u57282022\u5e74\u6625\u5b63\u3002", "note_en": "Rivian delivered 920 vehicles by the end of 2021, according to a release issued Monday. Rivian has more than 71,000 \u201cpre-orders\u201d (meaning refundable reservations) for its R1T pickup trucks, according to its  letter to shareholders posted in December.\n Rivian had initially targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by the end of the year. Last month, company executives including CEO RJ Scaringe cut those expectations, saying it would likely fall a few hundred vehicles short due to supply chain issues and challenges of battery production.\n  During its earnings call in December, Scaringe referred to production as a complex orchestra on two occasions.\n \u201cIn ramping up a production system like this, it is, as I said before, a really complex orchestra,\u201d Scaringe said. \u201cSo you have hundreds of suppliers providing thousands of parts, thousands of robots within the production facility operating to prescribe movements, and then thousands of team members assembling and working to put the vehicles together.\u201d\n Despite that lowered target, Scaringe noted during that call that the company is \u201cramping largely as expected.\u201d\n \u201cThe battery constraint is really an artifact of just bringing up a highly automated line,\u201d he said in December. \u201cAnd as I said, that doesn\u2019t represent any long-term challenges for us.

Last year,  Porsche launched two new e-bikes that were designed with the spirit of the Taycan Cross Turismo. BMW has also released plans to produce  several e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles lately, as well, like its  all-electric CE 04 scooter.\n  Last month, Rivian shared plans to use some of the $13.7 billion it raised when it went public to  build a second factory in Georgia (its first is in Illinois) to double its production capacity and produce battery cells \u2013 cells which can ostensibly be used in batteries for other types of vehicles, as well.\n According to the filing, which was first revealed by  Rivian Forums, Rivian wants to expand the use of its trademark to include the following:\n Bicycles; bicycle structural parts; electric bicycles; electric bicycle structural parts; electric bicycle components specially adapted for electric bicycles, namely, battery packs, motor controllers, electric motors, throttle controls, pedal assist sensors, display consoles, wiring harnesses, sprockets, cassettes, chains; bicycle frames; bicycle pedals; bicycle horns; bicycle brakes; bicycle chains; bicycle gears; bicycle wheels; bicycle seats; bicycle tires; bicycle cranks; bicycle tags; bicycle mudguards; bicycle motors; bicycle saddles; bicycle pumps; bicycle bells; bicycle handlebars; bicycle trailers; bicycle kickstands; bicycle seat posts; fitted bicycle covers; bicycle wheel spokes; bicycle wheel rims; bicycle stands; bicycle pedal straps; bicycle parts, namely, derailleurs; bicycle water bottle cages; bicycle carriers for vehicles; pumps for bicycle tires; inner tubes for bicycle tires; bicycle parts, namely disk wheels; bicycle parts, namely brake shoes\n Rivian also recently filed a patent for an  integrated tailgate cargo system for automotive vehicle, which is essentially a tailgate bike rack that will allow drivers to carry a bike in their pickup without losing bed space.

I\u2019ve been programming since I was 11 years old, my first language was Lua. Since I started at a relatively young age it was never \u2018work\u2019 for me, It was more like a fun hobby with which I could express myself and create things (mostly games).\n  I got super into admin commands when I was 13 though, ignore the repeated table index. I was 13\u2026\n I never forced myself to \u2018work\u2019 really, it was just something I really enjoyed doing. It ended up becoming a daily thing where after school I would blow off my homework (to my mother\u2019s dismay) and spend hours making various games and scripts. This naturally become a problem when in late highschool I began to hate working on projects, jumping from project to project and never finishing anything. This eventually forced me to become a bit more organized in how I be productive.\n So, here\u2019s some tips I\u2019ve found that were helpful for staying productive and not resenting your projects in no particular order.\n  Seriously, write down what you hope to accomplish today. Make sure to be realistic in what you have time for, if your goal is to \u2018write a compiler\u2019 break it down into small steps. For that day, you could say your goal is to \u2018start tokenizer, implement basic tokens.\u2019 For an example, this is my day\u2019s plan:\n - Finish burnout journal entry - Implement basic constant support for pyuxncle - Call Cameron and ask about his day\n It\u2019s also nice to have some non-work related goals, like calling a friend or your significant other. This keeps you not entirely work-focused.\n  If your plan is to do something small on a project, don\u2019t work past that point! This keeps your mind focused on finishing the task you had planed and keeps you interested in your project! Overworking on a project has lead me to burnout countless times. If you keep a small steady pace, you will keep your enjoyment on the project for much longer.\n  If you\u2019re stumped when trying to plan out your day, take a break! It is completely fine to be unproductive! If you\u2019ve found that you\u2019re no longer motivated to work on your project, find another way to have a feeling of accomplishment for that day. Take a walk, read a book at a coffee shop, go hang with friends, anything you feel that would make you feel fulfilled for the day.\n Of course, these tips may not help if you\u2019re a wageslave and your job is to write code. But these are self-learned lessons that have helped me, and no one\u2019s situation is the same. Find what works for you and stick with it. Having a routine is probably the most important part.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 08:30:52", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7167\u987e,care", "title": "\u5026\u6020\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u7167\u987e\u548c\u5bcc\u6709\u6210\u6548", "title_en": "Burnout, self-care and being productive", "transed": 1, "url": "https://openpunk.com/journal/burnout/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7167\u987e", "care"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1072693, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u534e\u76db\u987f - \u8bc1\u5238\u548c\u4ea4\u6613\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u6b63\u51c6\u5907\u8feb\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u79c1\u8425\u516c\u53f8\u66f4\u52a0\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5d1b\u8d77\u7684\u79c1\u4eba\u7b79\u8d44\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76d1\u7763\u3002\n\u60a8\u5c06\u6536\u53d6$ +\u7a0e\u7387\uff08\u5982\u9002\u7528\uff09\u4e3a\u534e\u5c14\u8857\u65e5\u8bb0\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u6539\u5e10\u5355\u504f\u597d\u6216\u81f4\u7535\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u60a8\u5c06\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u66f4\u6539\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6216\u6761\u6b3e\u63d0\u524d\u901a\u77e5\u60a8\u3002\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u6765\u53d6\u6d88\u8ba2\u9605\u3002", "note_en": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing to force more transparency from big private companies, as regulators grow concerned about the lack of oversight of the private fundraising that has fueled their rise.\n  Private capital markets have become an  increasingly popular way for companies to raise money in the U.S. in recent decades, allowing firms to acquire funding from institutions and wealthy individuals without the regulatory burdens of going public.

Some have TVs or books or laptops. Some have blackout curtains or stuffed animals or bottles of pills. But, vast as human experience is, one thing is consistent: Everyone has once-worn clothes strewn on the furniture.\n Why? In one sense, it\u2019s obvious. The clothes are clean enough to wear again, but it feels wrong to put them back with the freshly washed ones. Since there\u2019s no designated place for worn-but-clean clothes, we improvise.\n But in a deeper sense, it\u2019s mystifying.  Why is there no dedicated place? No one is happy with clothes everywhere. Why isn\u2019t there a standard solution?\n I don\u2019t know. Many people think that you\u2019re supposed to wash every garment every time you wear it and some (nutcases) actually do this. Otherwise people don\u2019t think about it aside from feeling vaguely guilty.\n   You can put a coat rack in your bedroom. Or put up some hooks. Or reserve an area of your closet. Whatever you do, put your once-worn clothes there without guilt and watch a tiny percentage of the stress in your life disappear.\n Yes, the benefit of this is small, but the cost is  very small, which makes this the  kind of thing that\u2019s  worth doing.\n Are there analogous solutions\u2014\u201ccoat racks\u201d for other problems in life? Sometimes, but not always. There is an analogy here, but it\u2019s at the level of the problem, not the solution.\n         These are  desire paths. Many colleges have a story that when they were first built, the designers left grass everywhere at first and just paved over the footpaths that were organically created. As far as I can tell this never actually happened. (Would  you open a brand-new campus and let people tramp around in the mud?)\n But whatever. Much the same thing happened gradually over time. Here\u2019s what Michigan State University looks like from the air today.\n  For our purposes, what matters is the analogy: A  desire path is a sign that the way things are currently set up, the easiest thing to do isn\u2019t the \u201cright\u201d or intended thing.\n It\u2019s worth giving this situation a name because it helps to think about solutions. When you\u2019ve recognized a desire path, what should you do? In the previous example, we accepted that we were going to follow the desire path of leaving clothes out and we \u201cpaved the path\u201d by getting a coat rack.\n There\u2019s a  desire paths subreddit with a quarter of a million subscribers. The implication seems to be that desire paths should be paved. But sometimes things are like that and sometimes they aren\u2019t.\n  Many couples seem to have the same argument repeatedly with each person saying the same things that the other person doesn\u2019t want to hear.\n You can see this as a \u201cdesire path\u201d: Both people are following a strategy that they think gives them the best (albeit bad) chance at the outcome they want.\n How to get out of this situation? One solution is to agree on a set of  fair fighting rules. There are many of these. Some are intuitive (though not necessarily easy) things like not yelling. Some are  more advanced, like saying an argument should be limited to at most five rounds, each of which consists of presentation/response/reiteration/possible acceptance/acknowledgment phases.\n If both people follow these rules in good faith, they often find that it\u2019s more effective for getting what they want than what they were doing before. Since people like getting what they want, this creates an incentive to stick with it.\n Lesson: Here again we accepted that it was hard to stay on the intended path (not arguing) and instead made the desire path better (made arguments more productive).\n  For years, I thought I should vacuum. But since vacuuming wasn\u2019t fun, I only rarely did it after making a desperate effort and mostly my vacuum just served as a monument to what a failed and pathetic human being I was.\n And then, on one beautiful day, I was borrowing the apartment of a friend who was out of town. I thought I should clean before I left, and discovered she had a  cordless, battery-powered vacuum. The moment I switched it on, clouds parted and trumpets sang from the sky. It wasn\u2019t  quite as powerful as a normal vacuum, but it was  painless. After I bought one, I was suddenly able to vacuum whenever I wanted, like a real person, so easily that the entire issue lost salience when I was in the mood for self-loathing.\n Lesson: Sometimes you want to make the intended path (vacuuming) better rather than changing anything about the desire path (not vacuuming).\n  It seems like half the people I know have a copy of War and Peace on their nightstand. They\u2019re trapped in a cycle like this: They \u201cneed\u201d to finish War and Peace. Except they don\u2019t actually like reading War and Peace, so they don\u2019t. But they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to be reading it, so they don\u2019t start another book, and every night they just look at whatever the algorithms throw on their phones. Years pass without reading any books.\n Here\u2019s my advice: Stop trying to read War and Peace. If you were going to read it, you would have done it already. At the beginning of last year, I tried an experiment where I tried to read books but  only what I truly felt like reading. The result was that I abandoned most books pretty quickly, but I also  finished more books than I had in years. Some weren\u2019t very serious\u2014and really, is a post-apocalyptic young adult novel more broadening than TV? But I also finished more \u201cserious\u201d books than when I had tried to be disciplined. If you want to read more, maybe you should stop fighting with yourself.\n Lesson: Sometimes you want a hybrid path. Here, the intended path is reading Serious Books and the desire path is drooling into your phone. The solution is to create a compromise path of reading whatever books you want to read. This is similar to how  you can run more by carefully avoiding pain.\n  Many of us are addicted to the siren call of social media and the promise that if we click our glowing rectangles in the right places they might light up so that our brains produce a little hit of dopamine. Sometimes I feel like my life is a cycle of failing to work and checking Hacker News or whatever until I eventually fall asleep in existential terror at how I spent my day. Most people seem to face this problem to some degree (perhaps minus the angst).\n A couple of years ago, a friend had just taken a long flight and was amazed at how efficient he was without access to the internet. He asked, \u201cwhy can\u2019t I recreate that environment elsewhere?\u201d\n For me, this is the most effective productivity tip: Physically unplug your router and leave your phone in the basement. You aren\u2019t allowed to get them back until you\u2019ve finished a task or a fixed amount of time has expired.\n Lesson: If you don\u2019t want to go where the desire path is going, put up a wall.\n  Say you\u2019re the mayor of an American city and you have decided that you want people to drive less. One thing you can do, of course, is create more and better alternatives like busses and trains and bike lanes.\n But, assuming that you\u2019re the mayor of a city that isn\u2019t New York, there will be some destinations where driving is much more convenient, meaning that people who can afford it will get cars. But once you already have a car, it\u2019s pretty cheap and convenient to drive it places, so people tend to do that.\n What actually seems to get people to use public transit is is expensive parking. In places where parking is costly, people use public transit. This starts a cycle where more people use transit, cities are built more densely et cetera.\n Lesson: It\u2019s the  relative appeal of the two paths that determines which one you take. You can equalize these by improving the intended path (making public transit better), obstructing the desire path (making driving worse), or a combination.\n  There\u2019s one member of house Dynomight who is generally in excellent standing except for always  always ALWAYS leaving lights on everywhere and all my attempts to counter this only seem to reinforce the behavior and know they\u2019re reading this and laughing but I will have my revenge yes I will have it.\n Erm, so in this case, the first thing I tried was asking that the lights not be left on. This worked about as well as putting up a sign asking people not to take a desire path usually works: Not at all.\n A better solution is to make the desire path less attractive. So, with the consent of the offender, I tried a new policy: If I\u2019ve already had to turn off a given light source a couple of times in a day, I should instead unscrew the lightbulb.\n This was annoying for me, of course, but it changed the incentives: Turning the switch off when leaving the room is much easier than screwing a bulb back in later.\n I maintain that this theory was solid! But it didn\u2019t work at all either: The response was to happily screw the lightbulbs back in whenever needed and never mention it or appear to be even slightly annoyed about it. I\u2019ve considered motion sensors or timers but probably I should just give up?\n   Most grad students go home over the holidays promising that they will do research. But research is hard, so they stare at their computers for a couple of hours every day without working and constantly feel guilty and eventually come back from the holidays not having accomplished anything and  also not having relaxed and recharged.\n My advice is: Stop trying! You\u2019re only hurting yourself by trying to work. Enjoy the holiday and trust that the rest will help you in the future.\n Lesson: If you\u2019re going to take the desire path no matter what, blocking it is counterproductive.\n  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S., with around 53 thousand per year. If caught in the (early) localized stage, it\u2019s highly curable, with  5-year survival rates of around 90%.\n The best weapon to fight CRC seems to be colonoscopy screening. The logic is that CRC almost always develops from precancerous polyps which can be detected and removed before cancer has even formed. We don\u2019t have randomized trials that prove that colonoscopies reduce CRC mortality, but  Doubeni et al. used a fancy statistical technique (matched pairs) to try to estimate effectiveness from observational data, which suggests that colonoscopy screening reduces CRC mortality by around 70%.\n     Faecal occult blood tests reduce CRC mortality by  maybe 18% and  sigmoidoscopy reduces it by  maybe 27%. A  large-scale randomized trial for colonoscopies started in 2009 and we should produce results soon.\n Anyway, for the sake of discussion, let\u2019s assume colonoscopies are effective and worth the risks. Let\u2019s also assume that you don\u2019t like drinking oral laxatives and having a doctor run a camera up your butt so, like  31% of Americans aged 50-75, you don\u2019t get screenings. What\u2019s the solution?\n I don\u2019t think there is one. You just have to force yourself to do it.\n Lesson: Sometimes the paths can\u2019t be changed. Colonoscopies are non-fun and can\u2019t be made fun, but they are more effective than the alternatives and that\u2019s that.\n   An appealing option is to  pave the path or accept that you won\u2019t do things the \u201cright\u201d way and make what you\u2019re already doing better. Similarly, you can  improve the intended path or make it easier to do things the right way. Sometimes these are hard to distinguish.\n A less attractive option is to  block the path. It\u2019s not necessary to put up a hard wall\u2014all you need to do is make the \u201cwrong\u201d way of doing things nearly as annoying as the \u201cright\u201d way. You can think of this as an equation like\n  And sometimes, sadly, you can\u2019t change the paths. The wrong option will always be there calling to you and you just have to ignore it.\n  [Credit: I joined Team Coat Rack after reading  this essay by Rob Wiblin.

"note_en": "A 57-year-old man with life-threatening heart disease has received a heart from a genetically modified pig, a groundbreaking procedure that offers hope to hundreds of thousands of patients with failing organs.\n It is the first successful transplant of a pig\u2019s heart into a human being. The eight-hour operation took place in Baltimore on Friday, and the patient, David Bennett Sr. of Maryland, was doing well on Monday, according to surgeons at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\n \u201cIt creates the pulse, it creates the pressure, it is his heart,\u201d said Dr. Bartley Griffith, the director of the cardiac transplant program at the medical center, who performed the operation.\n \u201cIt\u2019s working and it looks normal. We are thrilled, but we don\u2019t know what tomorrow will bring us. This has never been done before.\u201d\n  Last year, some 41,354 Americans received a transplanted organ, more than half of them receiving kidneys, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit that coordinates the nation\u2019s organ procurement efforts.\n But there is an acute shortage of organs, and about a dozen people on the lists die each day. Some 3,817 Americans received human donor hearts last year as replacements, more than ever before, but the potential demand is still higher.\n Scientists have worked feverishly to develop pigs whose organs would not be rejected by the human body, research accelerated in the past decade by new gene editing and cloning technologies. The heart transplant comes just months after surgeons in New York successfully attached the kidney of a genetically engineered pig to a brain-dead person.\n Researchers hope procedures like this will usher in a new era in medicine in the future when replacement organs are no longer in short supply for the more than half a million Americans who are waiting for kidneys and other organs.\n \u201cThis is a watershed event,\u201d said Dr. David Klassen, the chief medical officer of the United Network for Organ Sharing and a transplant physician. \u201cDoors are starting to open that will lead, I believe, to major changes in how we treat organ failure.\u201d\n  But he added that there were many hurdles to overcome before such a procedure could be broadly applied, noting that rejection of organs occurs even when a well-matched human donor kidney is transplanted.\n Recent Breakthroughs :\u00a0In groundbreaking procedures, surgeons successfully transplanted\u00a0a  heart\u00a0and attached a  kidney\u00a0from genetically modified pigs to human patients.\n Solving the Shortage: Thanks to genetically engineered pigs,  the donor-organ shortage  could be a thing of the past, though considerable hurdles remain.\n Accepting New Organs : Transplant patients must take damaging anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives.  Researchers hope to trick the immune system instead.\n \u201cEvents like these can be dramatized in the press, and it\u2019s important to maintain perspective,\u201d Dr. Klassen said. \u201cIt takes a long time to mature a therapy like this.\u201d\n  Mr. Bennett decided to gamble on the experimental treatment because he would have died without a new heart, had exhausted other treatments and was too sick to qualify for a human donor heart, family members and doctors said.\n His prognosis is uncertain. Mr. Bennett is still connected to a heart-lung bypass machine, which was keeping him alive before the operation, but that is not unusual for a new heart transplant recipient, experts said.\n The new heart is functioning and already doing most of the work, and his doctors said he could be taken off the machine on Tuesday. Mr. Bennett is being closely monitored for signs that his body is rejecting the new organ, but the first 48 hours, which are critical, passed without incident.\n He is also being monitored for infections, including porcine retrovirus, a pig virus that may be transmitted to humans, although the risk is considered low.\n  \u201cIt was either die or do this transplant,\u201d Mr. Bennett said before the surgery, according to officials at the University of Maryland Medical Center. \u201cI want to live. I know it\u2019s a shot in the dark, but it\u2019s my last choice.\u201d\n Dr. Griffith said he first broached the experimental treatment in mid-December, a \u201cmemorable\u201d and \u201cpretty strange\u201d conversation.\n \u201cI said, \u2018We can\u2019t give you a human heart; you don\u2019t qualify. But maybe we can use one from an animal, a pig,\u201d Dr. Griffith recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s never been done before, but we think we can do it.\u2019\u201d\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure he was understanding me,\u201d Dr. Griffith added. \u201cThen he said, \u2018Well, will I oink?\u2019\u201d\n Xenotransplantation, the process of grafting or transplanting organs or tissues from animals to humans, has a long history. Efforts to use the blood and skin of animals go back hundreds of years.\n In the 1960s, chimpanzee kidneys were transplanted into some human patients, but the longest a recipient lived was nine months. In 1983, a baboon heart was transplanted into an infant known as Baby Fae, but she died 20 days later.\n Pigs offer advantages over primates for organ procurements, because they are easier to raise and achieve adult human size in six months. Pig heart valves are routinely transplanted into humans, and some patients with diabetes have received porcine pancreas cells. Pig skin has also been used as a temporary graft for burn patients.\n Two newer technologies \u2014 gene editing and cloning \u2014 have yielded genetically altered pig organs less likely to be rejected by humans. Pig hearts have been transplanted successfully into baboons by Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, a professor of surgery at University of Maryland School of Medicine who established the cardiac xenotransplantation program with Dr. Griffith and is its scientific director. But safety concerns and fear of setting off a dangerous immune response that can be life-threatening precluded their use in humans until recently.\n  Dr. Jay Fishman, the associate director of the transplantation center at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that using pig organs provides the ability to perform genetic manipulations, the time to carry out better screening for infectious diseases, and the possibility of a new organ at the time that the patient needs it.\n  The heart transplanted into Mr. Bennett came from a genetically altered pig provided by Revivicor, a regenerative medicine company based in Blacksburg, Va.\n The pig had 10 genetic modifications. Four genes were knocked out, or inactivated, including one that encodes a molecule that causes an aggressive human rejection response.\n A growth gene was also inactivated to prevent the pig\u2019s heart from continuing to grow after it was implanted, said Dr. Mohiuddin,who, with Dr. Griffith, did much of the research leading up to the transplant.\n In addition, six human genes were inserted into the genome of the donor pig \u2014 modifications designed to make the porcine organs more tolerable to the human immune system.\n The team used a new experimental drug developed in part by Dr. Mohiuddin and made by Kiniksa Pharmaceuticals to suppress the immune system and prevent rejection. It also used a new machine perfusion device to keep the pig\u2019s heart preserved until surgery.\n  The Food and Drug Administration worked intensely toward the end of the year, finally giving the transplant surgeons an emergency authorization for the operation on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n  \u201cThe anatomy was a little squirrelly, and we had a few moments of \u2018uh-oh\u2019 and had to do some clever plastic surgery to make everything fit,\u201d Dr. Griffith said. As the team removed the clamp restricting blood supply to the organ, \u201cthe heart fired right up\u201d and \u201cthe animal heart began to squeeze.\u201d\n When Mr. Bennett first told his son, David Bennett Jr., about the upcoming transplant, he was flummoxed.\n \u201cAt first I didn\u2019t believe him,\u201d the younger Mr. Bennett, who lives in Raleigh, N.C., said. \u201cHe\u2019d been in the hospital a month or more, and I knew delirium could set in. I thought, no way, shape or form is that happening.\u201d\n He said his father had had a pig\u2019s valve inserted about a decade ago, and he thought his father might be confused. But after a while, Mr. Bennett said, \u201cI realized, \u2018Man, he is telling the truth and not going crazy. And he could be the first ever.\u2019\u201d", "posttime": "2022-01-11 07:58:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u9057\u4f20,receives,\u79fb\u690d", "title": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7537\u4eba\u4ece\u9057\u4f20\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u732a\u63a5\u53d7\u5fc3\u810f", "title_en": "In a First, Man Receives a Heart from a Genetically Altered Pig", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9057\u4f20", "receives", "\u79fb\u690d"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0fec93369efbcdd1dd456786aa6bcfff.png", "infoid": 1072688, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea2019\u5e74\u5e95\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e\u81ea\u7533\u8bf7\u5546\u5e97\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\u4ee5\u6765\u603b\u8ba11550\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u524d\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u5df2\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u7ea6\u4e3a120\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f4\u9605\u8bfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ece2018\u5e74\u52302019\u5e74\u52302019\u5e74\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u652f\u51fa\u589e\u52a0\u4e863500\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u4ece2019\u5e74\u52302020\u5e74\u589e\u52a0\u4e86450\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n\u5728\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u516c\u53f8\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\u5176\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u5546\u5e97\u4e1a\u52a1\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u6295\u8bc9\u548c\u8bc9\u8bbc\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u6b63\u5728\u4e0a\u8bc9\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6848\u4f8b\u3002\n\u5728\u5ba3\u5e03\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2aApp Store\u8bb0\u5f55\u65f6\uff0cApple\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u5728\u5176\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u63a8\u5e7f\u548c\u547c\u5524\u592a\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u8d85\u51fa\u5176\u504f\u79bb\u6536\u76ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6ce8\u610f\u5230App Store\u5ba2\u6237\u57282021\u5e74\u7684\u5723\u8bde\u8282\u524d\u5915\u548c\u65b0\u5e74\u524d\u591c\u4e4b\u95f4\u82b1\u4e86\u201c\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u201d\uff0c\u4ece\u53bb\u5e74\u63a8\u52a8\u4e24\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002\n\u4eca\u5929\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u9075\u5faaApp Store\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u5e74\u4efd\u3002\n\u9664\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u6570\u5b57\u5916\uff0cApple\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecApple Arcade\uff0cApple Fitness +\uff0cApple Music\uff0cApple TV +\uff0cApple News +\uff0cApple Podcasts\uff0cApple Podcasts\uff0cApple Books\uff0cApple Pay\u548c\u94b1\u5305\uff0cApple\u5730\u56fe\u548cIcloud +\u3002", "note_en": "For comparison, Apple \u00a0by the end of 2019 had paid developers a total of $155 billion since the App Store\u2019s debut. The year prior,  it had said that figure was around $120 billion. Reading between the lines, that means payouts to developers jumped by $35 million from 2018 to 2019, then grew by another $45 billion from 2019 to 2020.\n  Unfortunately, the payouts number Apple shared no longer helps to provide clarity into the state of the overall App Store\u2019s economy, as the percentages paid by individual apps will vary.\n In more recent years, Apple has adjusted its commission structure to reduce its own cut of developer revenue amid increased  regulatory  scrutiny of its App Store business practices, antitrust complaints and lawsuits \u2014 including the ongoing case with Epic Games, now under appeal.\n With the launch of Apple\u2019s  Small Business Program announced in November 2020, the company reduced its commission from 30% to 15% on qualifying apps (those that earned up to $1 million per year). In 2021, Apple also  dropped commissions for select news publishers\u2019 apps if they chose to participate in its Apple News Partner Program. Apple hasn\u2019t said how many developers and publishers have actually taken advantage of these opportunities, only that a \u201cvast majority\u201d of apps would qualify for the small business discount.\n In announcing another App Store record, Apple seems to be toeing a fine line between its usual self-promotion and calling too much attention to its outsized gains. The company noted App Store customers had spent \u201cmore than ever\u201d between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve in 2021, driving double-digit growth from last year.\n  However, Apple didn\u2019t offer any hard numbers to document this milestone as it had last year, when it had then noted consumers spent $1.8 billion on digital goods and services during the week between Christmas Eve and New Year\u2019s Eve 2020, driven largely by spending on games.\n Today\u2019s figures follow what has otherwise been a transitional year for the App Store.\n The company has seen more developer pushback over App Store scams, which became  a topic for a Congressional hearing, as well as the  ongoing difficulties with the App Review process. Apple this year was also  ordered to make App Store changes that would have permitted links to third-party payment options as a result of the Epic lawsuit ruling, but was later granted  a last-minute reprieve from the court order while the case is appealed. However, Apple has had to loosen its grip over the App Store in other markets, like  Japan and  South Korea, where regulators pushed Apple to allow links to external websites and took other measures to curb its commissions.\n In addition to its App Store figures,  Apple also offered updates on its other services businesses, including Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, Apple Pay and Wallet, Apple Maps and iCloud+.\n Of note, Arcade now features more than 200 games, Apple Music now has 90+ million songs in lossless audio, Apple TV+ has won 190 industry awards, Apple Fitness+ has grown to include nearly 2,000 sessions of workout content, Apple News remains the No. 1 news app everywhere it\u2019s available, Apple Pay has reached nearly 60 countries and regions, and customers used 30 million NFC tickets in Apple Wallet in 2021.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 07:12:52", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,\u5f00\u53d1,store,app", "title": "Apple\u57282021\u5e74\u4e3aApp Store\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u652f\u4ed8\u4e86\u5927\u7ea6600\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tApple paid out around $60 billion to App Store developers in 2021\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/apple-paid-out-around-60-billion-to-app-store-developers-in-2021/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "\u5f00\u53d1", "store", "app"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "fce16028afb0f29cca60b950bde96b7c.jpg", "infoid": 1072687, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u60a8\u5982\u4f55\u8861\u91cf\u6210\u529f\u548c\u589e\u957f\uff1f\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u5730\u8868\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u544a\u8bc9\u60a8\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48 - \u6bd4\u60a8\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u3002\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u6492\u8c0e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5371\u9669\u7684\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002\n\u53ea\u6709\u5728\u60a8\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u6536\u5165\u548c\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5b83\u4eec\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u68d2\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7ec6\u5206\u6216\u5730\u7406\u5b66\u65f6\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u3002\n\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u5bf9\u8bb2\u673a\u4e0a\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6570\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u5e76\u505a\u51fa\u523b\u610f\u7684\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u4f1a\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u56de\u6765\u3002\n\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5546\u4e1a\u8f68\u9053\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u603b\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u60a8\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u60a8\u7684\u6536\u5165\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u51c0\u63a8\u52a8\u8005\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6536\u5165\u536b\u751f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u770b\u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n\u603b\u6536\u5165\u4fdd\u7559\u662f\u60a8\u80fd\u591f\u7559\u4f4f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u548c\u6536\u5165\u3002\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u521d\u671f\u6536\u5165\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97GRR\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\u51cf\u53bb\u6536\u5165\u6d41\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6b64\u671f\u95f4\u51cf\u53bb\u6536\u5165\u6536\u7f29\uff08\u4e0e\u60a8\u7559\u4e0b\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\uff0c\u4f46\u5c11\u4ed8\u94b1\uff09 - \u7136\u540e\u9664\u4ee5\u5168\u90e8\u6536\u5165\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u3002", "note_en": "Now, how do you measure that success and growth? You need to go beyond surface-level figures: You need to know the metrics that tell you what\u2019s happening in every aspect of your business \u2014 the ones deeper than just your averages. Averages lie and can be dangerously misleading.\n Consider a scenario: If Jeff Bezos walks into a bar with 100 people, suddenly, on average, the net worth of each individual in that bar is over a billion dollars. Is that useful? Would that lead you to take the right actions? No \u2014 averages hide true insights.\n It\u2019s convenient to focus only on your overall metrics and averages, like revenue and growth, especially when they look great, and even getting a little more sophisticated \u2014 looking at revenue and revenue growth by product, customer segment or geography \u2014 still paints an incomplete picture.\n Provide a recommendation in  this quick survey and we\u2019ll share the results with everybody.\n We experienced this at Intercom, where segmented metrics looked good, yet there were hidden insights that would have held us back if we hadn\u2019t found them and made deliberate changes.\n  So what deeper insights do you need to look for, and how do you find them? One of the most useful metrics you can look at for deeper insights is your revenue health by segment.\n Every business tracks and reports on total revenue, but you also need to understand the health of your revenue. Revenue health is one way to look at the ongoing value that you are delivering to your customers, in addition to metrics like Net Promoter Scores.\n  If you\u2019re a SaaS business, you track and report on your annual recurring revenue, and the best ways to measure your revenue health are gross revenue retention (GRR) and net revenue retention (NRR).\n  Gross revenue retention is your ability to retain customers and revenue from those customers. You calculate GRR by taking your total revenue at the start of the period, minus revenue churn during the period, and minus revenue contractions during the period (customers who stay with you, but pay you less) \u2014 then divide that all by total revenue at the start of the period.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 07:11:59", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "rust,\u5e73\u5747\u503c,trust,\u6536\u5165", "title": "\u4e0d\u76f8\u4fe1\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u5065\u5eb7", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDon\u2019t trust averages: How to assess and strengthen the health of your business\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dont-trust-averages-how-to-assess-and-strengthen-the-health-of-your-business/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u5e73\u5747\u503c", "trust", "\u6536\u5165"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "c58481466e15dddd3dcc1f8ad5060b0f.gif", "infoid": 1072686, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0d\u8981\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6ce8\u518c\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5230\u6536\u4ef6\u7bb1\u7684\u6700\u5927Q\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u901a\u8baf\u7248\u672c\u3002\n\u4e0e\u6b64\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5176STARSHIP\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u8f68\u9053\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u51fa\u7684\u7b79\u5907\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u672c\u5468\u5bf9\u5176\u53d1\u5c04\u5854\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5854\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6b66\u5668\u5982\u4f55\u5728HEFTing Starship\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b83\u7684\u8d85\u91cd\u52a9\u63a8\u5668\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6839\u636e\u6279\u51c6\uff0cSpaceX\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u57283\u6708\u5de6\u53f3\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u65f6\u5019\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5854\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u9053\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\n\u8fd9\u5fc5\u987b\u62e5\u6709\u7f8e\u56fd\u5b87\u822a\u5c40\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u52aa\u529b\u547c\u5438\u5bbd\u677e\u53f9\u606f\u7684\u8170\u5e26\u3002\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u9700\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e2d\u98de\u673a\u63a8\u8fdb\u5668\u70e7\u4f24\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u62cd\u6444\u4e00\u4e9b\u7167\u7247\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u9001\u56de\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\n\u9000\u6b3e\u65b0\u95fb\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u4e0d\u4e45\uff0cStarlink India\u7684Lead Sanjay Bhargava\u5ba3\u5e03\u4ed6\u4f1a\u8e29\u4e0b\u3002", "note_en": "Don\u2019t forget to sign up to get the  free newsletter version of Max Q delivered to your inbox.\n  Before the first week of the year was even out, Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 with 49 Starlink satellites from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 6, marking its first flight of the year. The company appears to be planning to keep up a quick clip when it comes to the pace of Falcon 9 flights in 2022, as it\u2019s readying for a rideshare mission as early as January 13, and another three missions planned before even the end of the month.\n  Meanwhile, it\u2019s also making progress on its preparations for the first orbital test launch of its Starship vehicle, with a test of its  launch tower this week that showed how the tower\u2019s robotic arms would operate in hefting Starship atop the Super Heavy booster that will provide it with the power to get to space. Depending on approvals, SpaceX could be ready to actually make use of that tower for an orbital test sometime around March.\n   NASA\u2019s James Webb space telescope, which should provide more detailed and distant imaging of galaxies beyond our own than ever before, has competed its final set of deployments, meaning all the parts that were supposed to unfurl and set themselves up post-launch have successfully done so.\n That\u2019s got to have the NASA scientists who\u2019ve been working on Webb breathing a sigh of relief. The telescope now just has to complete some mid-flight thruster burns in order to place it in the planned and correct orbit, and then it\u2019ll be ready to snap some photos and send them back for study.\n    Starlink ran into regulatory problems in India after it set up its own subsidiary to operate in the country. The company had to  refund preorders after the government ordered them to stop providing satellite connectivity in the country without a valid license to do so. Elon Musk has previously been relatively brazen about his view that Starlink doesn\u2019t necessarily need a license to operate in some global markets.\n Shortly after news of the refunds came out,  Starlink India\u2019s lead Sanjay Bhargava announced he\u2019d be stepping down.\n  President Biden nominated  Vice Admiral Frank Whitworth as the next director of the  National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.", "posttime": "2022-01-11 07:11:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u706b\u7bad,spacex,starship", "title": "MAX\u95ee\uff1aSpacex\u5728\u706b\u7bad\u53d1\u5c04\u4e2d\u8e22\u51fa2022", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMax Q: SpaceX kicks off 2022 in rocket launches\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/max-q-spacex-kicks-off-2022-in-rocket-launches/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u706b\u7bad", "spacex", "starship"]}]
