Really expensive. Like   hundreds-of-dollars per vial expensive. Expensive enough that some diabetes patients   can\u2019t afford their monthly dose. And now Walmart, of all companies, is stepping in to make the drug a bit more affordable.\n  The retailer   announced on Tuesday that it would be rolling out a budget version of analog insulin under its ReliOn label to adults and children with a prescription for the drug. Per Walmart\u2019s announcement, these private-label insulin vials will be available for about $73 each\u2014and pre-filled FlexPen needles for about $86 each\u2014at any Walmart pharmacy starting this week, with a wider rollout to Sam\u2019s Club pharmacies planned for mid-July. Considering how vials can cost anywhere between $150 to   nearly $400 a pop, this could provide some relief for Americans.\n Up until now, Walmart actually offered an even more budget-friendly insulin under the ReliOn label for   about $25 a vial. But this cheaper version was based on an older, less-effective insulin formula that\u2019s garnered a   fair share of criticism from doctors and diabetes advocates. More recent formulas\u2014the so-called insulin analogs, like Walmart\u2019s new product\u2014are more effective at preventing dangerous blood sugar swings among those with Type 1 diabetes,   in particular.\n     Meanwhile, the number of people across the US with both forms of the disease will only continue to skyrocket. While there are slightly more than 34 million adults living with the disease across the country   today, some researchers   theorize that number could jump to more than 41 million by the time 2030 rolls around. And as those numbers keep climbing, so does   the price of the insulin these people need to take to manage their disease. Recent numbers from the Health Care Cost Institute point out that the annual cost of insulin for people managing Type 1 diabetes in the US   nearly doubled from $2,900 in 2012 to $5,700 in 2016. Meanwhile, lawmakers on both sides have   grilled insulin manufacturers over these sky-high\u00a0prices but have done virtually nothing to help.\n         Insulin isn\u2019t expensive it\u2019s companies charging absurd amounts for it that make it the price it is. In Canada current average cost for a vial is about 35$ Canadian.

That&#39;s not a prediction, that&#39;s a fact \u2014 because  Microsoft is demanding it. As part of the rush of news surrounding its new operating system, Microsoft has declared that starting January 1, 2023, all NEW laptops running on Windows 11 will need to have a front-facing camera.\n For those concerned with privacy, this means a trip to the office supply store to grab more tape with which to cover up the pesky little lenses. And for those who&#39;ve fully immersed themselves in the world of remote work, this means an end to the days of fearing a laptop will have a bad camera, or worse, no camera.\n  The way this new policy influences the quality of cameras is found in Microsoft&#39;s camera requirements. Not only does the company demand that laptops have cameras, but it expects them to:\n  This means the days of sub-HD cameras are numbered. With a massive company like Microsoft demanding an end to objectively outdated and substandard cameras, it&#39;s only a matter of time before such inferior products cease to exist. On the flip side, it&#39;s also just a matter of time before privacy-minded individuals have one less source of security. In a world where every single machine has a camera, eyes will be everywhere, and all the Big Brothers of technology will be watching.\n Of course, this requirement only applies to  new laptops being sold by OEMs in 2023, not your existing one.\n   DOOM Eternal is officially Xbox Series X|S Optimized, and it continues to amaze with newfound support for up to 120 FPS on both consoles and even ray tracing at 60 FPS on Xbox Series X. Here&#39;s what you need to know.\n The first preview build of Windows 11 rolled out yesterday, and it turns out that almost half of our polled readers plan to run it on their primary PC.\n The new Microsoft Store for Windows 11 lets in just about any app regardless of how it is packaged.

There have been many YouTube pronouncements about its family-friendliness, yet there are few concrete details that have convinced us it will stand out in an increasingly crowded home-gaming market. And this year, public scrutiny about the $250 system (currently open for  $100 preorder &#34;down payments&#34; or  full-price preorders, which include two controllers and six pack-in games) has grown, particularly after Intellivision\u00a0joined the 2021 virtual E3-showcase fray\u2014and did so with a resounding thud.\n Thus far, the Amico has used video presentations to show what the company hopes will set this handheld apart from the pack. Those videos mostly originate from Intellivision and a few hand-picked fan YouTube channels. Until we can go hands on with live hardware ourselves, these videos leave us with question marks about dev kits and other potentially inauthentic presentations. Leaks from an Intellivision developer portal this week will have to suffice for now, as it&#39;s a great opportunity to finally take a closer look at what the heck an Intellivision Amico actually is.\n  I began closely watching the Amico once I noticed that  its E3 2021 presentation video included unclear footage of how the device actually works. These &#34;live gameplay&#34; videos hint at Amico&#39;s central gimmick: gameplay happens primarily on a TV screen, but the device can also integrate content on an LCD screen embedded in every controller (controllers resemble  Nintendo&#39;s Wii U, albeit with smaller gamepads). However, the E3 video cuts and pans so much that we can&#39;t tell if the Amico controllers are legitimately interacting with\u00a0the nearby TV set. Older Amico videos have shown apparent lag between controller input and TV display\u2014when those videos haven&#39;t hidden the controller from view altogether, that is. This recent E3 presentation did nothing to reduce concern on that front.\n      The E3 presentation included multiple stock images of happy families playing with Amico, and Intellivision CEO Tommy Tallarico later confirmed those images were doctored\u2014DualShock-like controllers were digitally replaced with Amico&#39;s touchscreen-filled pads.  Tallarico defended the promotional choice on Twitter\u00a0by saying, &#34;That is exactly what stock photos are meant for and why they exist.&#34;\n Next to the stock photos was direct-feed footage of apparent Amico gameplay that looked simplistic and sometimes stuttering. It didn&#39;t inspire confidence in a price category that includes competent $200 to $300 options like the Nintendo Switch and Apple TV 4K. To picture it, imagine an online Flash gaming portal full of mostly flat, 2D game designs with a few 3D twists and visual flourishes, and you get some idea of Amico&#39;s visual aesthetic.\n Perhaps a different sizzle-reel approach would have done a better job selling the Amico concept, and I don&#39;t envy any marketing department dealing with a pandemic-related expo drought where a physical demo might fill in these gaps. But for a console that revolves around  the lukewarm Wii U concept of &#34;gameplay on TV, extra screen in your hand,&#34; whose last announced launch date was October 10, 2021, it sure seems like time to release more details. This is especially true for a new, unproven hardware maker, since the Intellivision brand name was acquired in 2018 by an entirely new team.\n \u201cSmart Display 200\u201d doesn\u2019t sound as cute as \u201cAmico\u201d\n Intellivision has been frank that Amico was built with budget-priced gaming in mind.\u00a0 Its official &#34;specs&#34; page makes that clear, with performance numbers that resemble lower-powered Android smartphones. But this recent leak from Intellivision&#39;s online &#34;developer&#34; portal provided concrete specifics about how much hardware power this $250 system and its controllers will eventually deliver.\n      The Intellivision developer portal was recently publicly available online, no password needed, for long enough to have the details\u00a0 saved at archive.org earlier this month. Sources with knowledge about Amico have confirmed to Ars Technica that the leaked specs we&#39;ve seen were legitimate.\u00a0While the specs were live as recently as June 14 and line up with Amico&#39;s own official specs page, they could still change between now and the system&#39;s launch.\n The Intellivision developer portal includes precise specs for various system elements in order to help game makers begin building Amico software before they receive official dev kits.\u00a0Before listing all of its specs, Intellivision&#39;s own comparison makes the point more simply:\n We&#39;ve found the ZTE ZMax Pro Z981 (Snapdragon 617, Adreno 405) is a good benchmark test and runs just a little slower than the Amico hardware.\n This model of ZTE smartphone debuted in 2016 at a budget price point of $100 unlocked\u2014and that included a 13 MP camera sensor, a 6-inch, 1080p display, and a\u00a03,400 mAh battery. In comparison, Amico works as a set-top box for your TV while embedding a 3.2-inch, 240p capacitive touchscreen into each of its controllers (two will be included in the box).\n The developer portal calls out Qualcomm&#39;s Smart Display 200 platform\u2014and specifies its &#34;APQ8053-Lite&#34; model, which includes a 1.8GHz Snapdragon 624, an Adreno 506 GPU, 2GB of LPDDR3 DRAM, 16GB of Flash storage, and built-in controllers for interfaces like HDMI, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth (but not Ethernet). While prices on bulk-manufactured SoC motherboards can vary for many reasons, this one appears to be available in bulk orders at rates near $38 per board (though that one includes a camera sensor, which Amico will not have in either its primary box or its controllers).", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u6cc4\u6f0f,intellivision,amico", "title": "\u54ce\u5440\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u529bamico\uff1f \u63a7\u5236\u53f0\u7684\u6cc4\u6f0f\u6d41\u95e8\u6237\u7f51\u7ad9\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d0\u793a ", "title_en": "What the heck\u2019s an Intellivision Amico?

Google  detailed YouTube TV&#39;s  &#34;4K Plus&#34; subscription add-on, which costs an extra $20 on top of the standard $65-per-month plan, for a total of $85 per month. 4K Plus might sound like it will simply provide a resolution bump, but subscribing to the higher tier will also unlock a new offline playback feature and unlimited simultaneous streaming over home Wi-Fi. The latter feature is otherwise limited to three streams per account. The one no-extra-cost feature of today&#39;s announcement is 5.1 audio support, which is rolling out to all YouTube TV members.\n  YouTube TV is Google&#39;s US-only pay-per-month service meant to replace a cable TV subscription. For the base price of $65 a month, you get access to a bundle of major cable TV channels, like ESPN,\u00a0CNN, MTV, Cartoon Network, Discovery, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, TBS, TNT, USA, NFL Network, and more. The major US TV networks\u2014CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox\u2014are all included. In addition to paying extra for 4K, you can also tack on other premium add-ons like cable TV movie channels such as HBO, Stars, Showtime, and Cinemax. Sports packages, including NFL Red Zone, are available as well.\u00a0Just like cable, YouTube TV is quite expensive and keeps getting more expensive. Google just  raised the price to $65 last year. Even if you pay the extra $20, it sounds like 4K content will be hard to come by. Google says that &#34;4K playback is available on select live and on-demand content from these networks: Discovery, ESPN, FOX Sports, FX, Nat Geo, NBC Sports, and Tastemade.&#34; The lack of 4K content isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s fault, though. While Internet streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube have all been on the 4K content train for some time, cable TV networks are still primarily producing content in 720p or 1080p. YouTube TV is essentially cable, and there&#39;s just not that much 4K content available.\n     Google&#39;s support page says that 4K playback will require an Internet connection that&#39;s at least 15Mbps. Most 4K-capable smart devices seem compatible, but Google calls out the 4K Apple TV and PlayStation 4 Pro as having iffy 4K support, saying these two devices are only compatible with &#34;select content&#34; and that &#34;some programs may have lower resolution.&#34; It sounds like\u00a0this is an AV1 video codec problem. AV1 is the next big video codec that devices will need to support, and it offers better image quality at lower bitrates, with no royalty fees. Google is a big booster of the codec, a stance that has led to  disputes over support on Roku devices. The Apple TV and the PS4 Pro both don&#39;t support AV1, so it sounds like this support note is just indicating that those devices won&#39;t be able to play exclusive AV1 4K content.\n  Offline playback might be the most interesting of YouTube TV&#39;s two new features. The offline feature will let you download DVR recordings if you&#39;re forking over $85 a month for YouTube TV with the 4K Plus package. The one big downside is that offline playback requires the YouTube TV\u00a0 app,\u00a0so that means it works on phones and Chromebooks but not on anything that would typically use a browser, like Windows, Mac, or Linux. To try to get users hooked on the $20 extra add-on, YouTube is offering an introductory price of $10 per month extra for the package for the first year.

The Columbus Dispatch  wrote. With a June 30 deadline looming, Ohio&#39;s House and Senate approved the budget and sent it to Gov. Mike DeWine for final approval on Monday night, the Dispatch wrote.\n  As we wrote  earlier this month, the Ohio Senate approved a version of the budget containing an  amendment that would have forced existing municipal broadband services to shut down and prevented the formation of new public networks. The proposed law was  reportedly &#34;inserted without prior public discussion,&#34; and no state senator publicly sponsored the amendment. It was approved in a party-line vote as Democrats opposed the restrictions in municipal broadband.\n The House version did not contain the amendment, and it was dropped during negotiations between the House and Senate.\n  Lawmakers apparently relented to public pressure from supporters of municipal broadband and cities and towns that operate the networks.\u00a0People and businesses from Fairlawn, where the city-run FairlawnGig network offers fiber Internet, played a significant role in the protests. FairlawnGig itself  asked users to put pressure on lawmakers, and the subscribers did so in great numbers.\n &#34;We had a real grassroots movement here in Fairlawn. We are thrilled our residents, subscribers, and businesses came together and helped us defeat this amendment,&#34; Fairlawn Service Director Ernie Staten said yesterday,  according to an article by\u00a0the Community Networks team at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). &#34;We appreciate that the State of Ohio recognizes that municipal broadband has a place in this state and we hope to continue this great endeavor.&#34;\n Fairlawn subscribers sent more than 700 emails telling lawmakers, &#34;Don&#39;t take this (municipal broadband) away!&#34; Staten said.\n    The proposed law would have let cities and towns provide broadband service only to unserved areas and used a definition of &#34;unserved&#34; that would reportedly have made over 98 percent of the state ineligible for municipal broadband. The proposed law defined &#34;unserved areas&#34; as those without access to service with download speeds of at least 10Mbps and upload speeds of at least 1Mbps, which isn&#39;t even half as fast as the 25Mbps/3Mbps broadband threshold the Federal Communications Commission  adopted over six years ago.\n  Staten also pointed out that &#34;municipalities only enter the broadband space when forced to by the inaction of the private sector,&#34;  according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n There are  about 30 public broadband providers in Ohio. Besides Fairlawn, examples of local governments running broadband networks include Hudson, Medina County, and Wadsworth.\u00a0&#34;We&#39;re thrilled that communities like Fairlawn and Hudson can keep serving their communities,&#34; Summit County Executive Ilene Shapiro said after learning that the budget amendment was dropped, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.\n Cleveland City Council President Kevin Kelley previously\u00a0 said the city would sue the state\u00a0if it restricted municipal broadband.\n Until a few months ago,  19 US states had laws restricting municipal broadband, passed for the benefit of private Internet providers that don&#39;t want to face competition from public networks. Washington state lawmakers have since  killed their anti-municipal broadband law, and Arkansas\u00a0 ended many of its restrictions\u00a0on municipal broadband as well.\n  Though it isn&#39;t banning public networks, at least for now, Ohio&#39;s legislature is apparently not letting municipal networks apply for a new round of funding.\n &#34;While Staten celebrated the removal of the budget amendment, he called the victory &#39;bittersweet,&#39; as municipalities and electric cooperatives in the state do not have access to the proposed $250 million broadband expansion grant program that will be established when, and if, Gov. Dewine signs the budget into law,&#34; the ILSR wrote.\n The outcome of that isn&#39;t certain yet. &#34;We have been asking for a small definition change to add municipalities and electric coops, but unless they changed the language, I believe the House version stands,&#34; Staten told the ILSR. But the biggest news is the legislature dropping the plan that would have forced networks to shut down. &#34;Being able to continue [providing service] is much more important,&#34; Staten said.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:53:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5171\u548c\u56fd,gop,\u5bbd\u5e26", "title": "\u4fc4\u4ea5\u4fc4\u5dde\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u5171\u548c\u56fd\u653f\u5e9c\u5728\u62b5\u6297\u5c45\u6c11\u6297\u8bae\u540e\u7981\u6b62\u5e02\u653f\u5bbd\u5e26 ", "title_en": "Ohio GOP ends attempt to ban municipal broadband after protest from residents", "transed": 1, "url": "https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/ohio-gop-ends-attempt-to-ban-municipal-broadband-after-protest-from-residents/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5171\u548c\u56fd", "gop", "\u5bbd\u5e26"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "52fe1b1c0a3112af1c5e229c6f85d4f8.png", "infoid": 1068689, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aPrivacyShark\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u62a5\u544a\u6b64\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5df2\u4ece\u4e0b\u9762\u7684LinkedIn\u83b7\u53d6\u4e86\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\n \u636e\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u79cd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LinkedInBreac\u533a\u66b4\u9732\u4e86700\u7c73\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7756\u4e07\u7528\u6237\u768492\uff05\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u5728\u6697\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u51fa\u552e\uff0c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u7535\u8bdd\u53f7\u7801\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5730\u5740\uff0c\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5de5\u8d44\u3002\n \u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u5df2\u53d1\u5e031M\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u65e2\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u6700\u65b0\u7684...\n  RestorePrivacy\u62a5\u544a\u79f0\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ee5\u7528\u5b98\u65b9LinkedIn API\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57284\u6708\u4efd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002\n 6\u670822\u65e5\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ece7\u4ebf\u4e2aLinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u9500\u552e\u5e7f\u544a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bba\u575b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5305\u542b100\u4e07LinkedIn\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u68c0\u67e5\u4e86\u8be5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\n  \u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u90fd\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5e76\u4e0e\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7528\u6237\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8868\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u6700\u65b0\u7684\uff0c\u6765\u81ea2020\u52302021\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u76f4\u63a5\u5411\u7528\u6237\u81f4\u7535\uff0c\u8be5\u7528\u6237\u5728\u9ed1\u5ba2\u8bba\u575b\u4e0a\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4ed6\u58f0\u79f0\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LinkedIn API\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0a\u4f20\u5230\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u3002 \n\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u542b\u5bc6\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ad9\u70b9\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u8eab\u4efd\u76d7\u7a83\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u4fe1\u670d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u9493\u9c7c\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u81ea\u5df1\u7528\u4e8e\u83b7\u53d6LinkedIn\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u767b\u5f55\u51ed\u636e\u3002\n \u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0cLinkedIn\u786e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86500M\u8bb0\u5f55\u5305\u62ec\u4ece\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u58f0\u79f0\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6e90\u3002 Privacyshark\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6b64\u65f6\u53d1\u8868\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9648\u8ff0\uff1a\n \u867d\u7136\u6211\u4eec\u4ecd\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u4eceLinkedIn\u522e\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u6765\u6e90\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u662fLinkedIn\u6570\u636e\u8fdd\u7ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u786e\u5b9a\u6ca1\u6709\u66b4\u9732\u79c1\u4ebaLinkedIn\u6210\u5458\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6765\u81eaLinkedIn\u7684\u522e\u64e6\u6570\u636e\u662f\u8fdd\u53cd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6761\u6b3e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u65ad\u52aa\u529b\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4f1a\u5458\u9690\u79c1\u53d7\u5230\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002\n \u67d0\u4eba\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u522e\u767e\u4e07\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f7f\u7528API\u200b\u200b\u8fd8\u662f\u5176\u4ed6\uff0c\u8fd9\u7edd\u5bf9\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e......\n  \u60a8\u6b63\u5728\u9605\u8bfb9To5MAC  -

The database is for sale on the dark web, with records including phone numbers, physical addresses, geolocation data, and inferred salaries.\n The hacker who obtained the data has posted a sample of 1M records, and checks confirm that the data is both genuine and up-to-date \u2026\n  RestorePrivacy reports that the hacker appears to have misused the official LinkedIn API to download the data, the same method used in  a similar breach back in April.\n On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from 700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a sample of the data that includes 1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n No passwords are included, but as the site notes, this is still valuable data that can be used for identity theft and convincing-looking phishing attempts that can themselves be used to obtain login credentials for LinkedIn and other sites.\n With the previous breach, LinkedIn did confirm that the 500M records included data obtained from its servers, but claimed that more than one source was used.  PrivacyShark notes that the company has issued a similar statement this time:\n While we\u2019re still investigating this issue, our initial analysis indicates that the dataset includes information scraped from LinkedIn as well as information obtained from other sources. This was not a LinkedIn data breach and our investigation has determined that no private LinkedIn member data was exposed.

Coming in at a $10 billion market capitalization would make SentinelOne the most valuable cybersecurity IPO to date.\n A source said that the road show has been stronger than anticipated, in part because of the strength of one of its competitors, CrowdStrike, which is publicly traded and currently sitting at a  market cap of $58 billion.\n  The other reason for the response is a slightly grimmer one: Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue for businesses of all sizes, public organizations, governments and individuals. \u201cNo one wants to see another SolarWinds, and there is no reason that there shouldn\u2019t be more than one or two strong players,\u201d a source said.\n As is the bigger trend in cybersecurity, Israel-hatched, Mountain View-based  SentinelOne\u2018s approach to combat that is artificial intelligence \u2014 and in its case specifically, a machine-learning-based solution that it sells under the brand  Singularity that focuses on endpoint security, working across the entire edge of the network to monitor and secure laptops, phones, containerised applications and the many other devices and services connected to a network.\n Last year, endpoint security solutions were estimated to be around an $8 billion market, and analysts project that it could be worth as much as  $18.4 billion by 2024 \u2014 another reason why SentinelOne may have moved up the timetable on its IPO (last year the company\u2019s CEO Tomer Weingarten had told me he thought the company had one or two years left as a private company before considering an IPO, a timeline it clearly decided was worth speeding up).\n SentinelOne  raised $267 million on a $3.1 billion valuation led by Tiger Global as recently as last November, but it has been expanding rapidly. Growth last quarter was 116% compared to the same period a year before, and it now has more than 4,700 customers and annual recurring revenue of $161 million, according to its  S-1 filing. It is also still not profitable, posting a net loss of $64 million in the last quarter.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:33", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

to grow our understanding of the company beyond  our EC-1.\n First, we\u2019ll explore the growth of Duolingo\u2019s total user base, how much money it makes per active user, and how effectively the company has managed to convert free users to paid products over time. The numbers will set us up to understand what else can be learned about Duolingo\u2019s business beyond our original deep dive into the company\u2019s finances \u2014 specifically underscoring the pressure cooker it finds itself in when looking for new revenue sources.\n Starting with  Duolingo\u2019s growth in total active users, guess how fast they rose from 2019 to 2020. Hold that number in your head.\n The actual numbers are as follows: In 2019, Duolingo closed the year with 27.3 million monthly active users (MAUs); it wrapped 2020 with 36.7 million MAUs. That\u2019s a gain of 34%. If we narrow our gaze to Q1 2021 numbers compared to Q1 2020, we can see that Duolingo\u2019s MAUs rose from 33.5 million to 39.9 million, or growth of around 19%.\n  The bulk of Duolingo\u2019s growth, then, came in early 2020 when we consider its pandemic bump. Put more simply, the company scaled from 27.3 million MAUs at the end of 2019 to 33.5 million MAUs at the end of Q1 2020; from then, the company added 3.2 million more MAUs throughout 2020 and 6.4 million during the next four quarters.\n Another lens through which to view the numbers is simply a recognition that first-quarter results at Duolingo appear to be stronger than results in the rest of the year, perhaps due to New Year\u2019s resolutions to learn a new language or brush up on a second language learned in high school.\n Next, let\u2019s examine  Duolingo\u2019s monetization efforts regarding converting free users to paying users.\n Here we can see a very different growth story. While the company\u2019s MAUs rose 34% from 2019 to 2020, the company\u2019s paying users rose from 900,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million at the end of 2020. That is a far-sharper gain of 84% on a year-over-year basis.\n So, while Duolingo did see material user growth during 2020, it saw turbo-charged expansion in the users it was able to shake revenue from. Improved monetization, more than acceleration in user growth, was the pandemic\u2019s effect on Duolingo.\n What can we see in the company\u2019s more recent results? From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, Duolingo\u2019s paid subscribers rose from 1.1 million to 1.8 million, a gain of around 64%. That was a slower pace than the company managed more generally in 2020, which matches Duolingo\u2019s slower revenue growth in Q1 2021 than it recorded in 2020.\n The number is still strong, we think. But not as impressive as the more than 100% revenue expansion that the company put on the board last year.\n In percentage terms, 3.3% of Duolingo\u2019s MAUs were paid subscribers in 2019. That figure rose to 4.4% in 2020. And in Q1 2021, it reached 4.5%. Duolingo rounds that number to 5% in its S-1, which feels somewhat aggressive to us, given the somewhat modest pace at which the metric is improving. Here\u2019s the wording:\n As of March 31, 2021, approximately 5% of our monthly active users were paid subscribers of Duolingo Plus. Our paid subscriber penetration has increased steadily since we launched Duolingo Plus in 2017 and, combined with our user growth, has led to our revenue more than doubling every year since.\n  Next, let\u2019s chat about  revenue per MAU. To get consistent numbers, we\u2019ll divide quarterly revenues by MAU figures from the same period. So, we\u2019ll compare Q4 2019 revenue at Duolingo with its year-end MAU figure. We\u2019ll do the same for 2020, and for Q1 2021 we\u2019ll use both numbers from that period.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:52:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u589e\u957f,depicts,duolingo", "title": "Duolingo\u7684S-1\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u6bdb\u9aa8\u609a\u7136\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\u8ba4\u8bc1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDuolingo\u2019s S-1 depicts heady growth, monetization, new focus on English certification\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/duolingos-s-1-depicts-heady-growth-monetization-new-focus-on-english-certification/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u589e\u957f", "depicts", "duolingo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068686, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6211\u4eec\u4f9d\u9760\u60a8\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff1a\u60a8\u662f\u5426\u77e5\u9053\u60a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6bcf\u67083\u7f8e\u5143\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684Phoronix\u4fdd\u8d39\uff1f\u4eca\u5929\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b83\u6765\u67e5\u770b\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e0a\u7684\u7f51\u7ad9\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u867d\u7136\u6536\u76ca\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u591a\u7684Linux\u786c\u4ef6\u8bc4\u8bba\u3002 Linus Torvalds\u521a\u521a\u5c06Linux 5.13\u5185\u6838\u53d1\u5e03\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u53ea\u662f\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u4e86\u3002\u5185\u6838\u5728\u65b0\u7684\uff06\uff0334\u4e0b\u8fd0\u9001;\u6e38\u884c\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd;\u4e0a\u5468\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4ee3\u53f7\u3002\r   Linux 5.13\u4e3aApple M1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u672c\u652f\u6301\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u52a0\u901f\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u71a8\u70eb\u524d\u65b9\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u3002\u8fd8\u6709\u65b0\u7684Linux 5.13\u5b89\u5168\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982Landlock LSM\uff0cClang CFI\u652f\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u5730\u968f\u610f\u5730\u968f\u673a\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u5185\u6838\u5806\u6808\u504f\u79fb\u91cf\u3002\u8fd8\u6709AMD\u6709\u8da3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u56f4\u7ed5FreeSync HDMI\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u521d\u59cbAldebaran\u4fc3\u9500\u7b49\u7b49\u3002\u82f1\u7279\u5c14\u5728Alder Lake\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u548c\u66f4\u591a\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u5e26\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002 Linux 5.13\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5IO_\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u7528USB\u663e\u793a\u9a71\u52a8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\u542f\u7528\u3002\r   \u8bf7\u53c2\u9605Linux 5.13\u6216\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Linux 5.13\u529f\u80fd\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u9876\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u3002\r     \u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u4e0eLinux 5.14\u5468\u671f\u548c\uff0339; s\uff06\uff0339;\u5728Linux 5.14\u4e0a\u671f\u5f85\u7740\u8bb8\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u66f4\u65b0\uff1aLinus Torvalds\u73b0\u5df2\u53d1\u5e035.13\u516c\u544a\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u81eaRC7\u4ee5\u6765\u4e00\u76f4\u5f88\u5e73\u9759\u7684\u4e00\u5468\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6ca1\u6709\u7406\u7531\u5ef6\u8fdf5.13\u3002\u672c\u5468\u7684\u77ed\u8def\u662f\u5c0f\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u670988\u4e2a\u975e\u5408\u5e76\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u548c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u53ea\u662f\u6062\u590d\uff09......\u5f53\u7136\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0a\u5468\u5c0f\u800c\u4e14\u5e73\u9759\uff0c\u603b\u4f535.13\r\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u76f8\u5f53\u5927\u3002\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b83\u548c\uff0339;\uff06\uff0339;\u8f83\u5927\u76845.x\u7248\u672c\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc716k\u7684\u63d0\u4ea4\uff08\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5408\u5e76\u8d85\u8fc717k\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u8d85\u8fc72k\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u3002\u4f46\u5b83\uff06\uff0339; s\u4e00\u4e2a\uff06\uff0334;\u5927\u5168\uff06\uff0334;\u4e00\u4ef6\u4e8b\u60c5\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u7279\u522b\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\uff06\uff0334; ", "note_en": "We Rely On Your Support: Did you know that you can get  Phoronix Premium for under $3 per month?

Linus Torvalds has just released the  Linux 5.13 kernel as stable.\r   Linux 5.13 was just  tagged and is ready to go. The kernel is shipping under the new &#34;Opossums on Parade&#34; codename that was put in place last week.\r   Linux 5.13 brings initial but still early support for the Apple M1 with basic support but not yet accelerated graphics and a lot more to iron out moving ahead. There are also new Linux 5.13 security features like the Landlock LSM, Clang CFI support, and optionally randomizing the kernel stack offset at each system call. There is also AMD fun this cycle around FreeSync HDMI support, initial Aldebaran bring-up, and more. Intel has more work on Alder Lake, a new cooling driver, and more discrete graphics bring-up. There are also other changes for Linux 5.13 around faster IO_uring, a generic USB display driver, and other new hardware enablement.\r   See  the top features of Linux 5.13 or the complete  Linux 5.13 feature overview.\r     Now it&#39;s onward to the Linux 5.14 cycle and already  many features to look forward to with Linux 5.14.   Update: Linus Torvalds has now posted his 5.13  announcement, &#34; So we had quite the calm week since rc7, and I see no reason to delay 5.13. The shortlog for the week is tiny, with just 88 non-merge commits (and a few of those are just reverts)...Of course, if the last week was small and calm, 5.13 overall is\ractually fairly large. In fact, it&#39;s one of the bigger 5.x releases, with over 16k commits (over 17k if you count merges), from over 2k developers. But it&#39;s a &#34;big all over&#34; kind of thing, not something particular that stands out as particularly unusual.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:43", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "linux,\u53d1\u5e03,apple,released,\u652f\u6301", "title": "Linux 5.13 kernel\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u5305\u62ecApple M1\u652f\u6301\uff0cClang CFI\u548cLineux\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u5757 ", "title_en": "Linux 5.13 Kernel Released, Includes Apple M1 Support, Clang CFI, and Landlock's Linux Security Module", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.13-Released", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "\u53d1\u5e03", "apple", "released", "\u652f\u6301"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7e2dd72d1344aaf19b9a913a9227a5c5.jpg", "infoid": 1068685, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u666e\u7f57\u7ef4\u767b\u65af\uff08AP\uff09 - \u5f53\u7f8e\u56fd\u6267\u6cd5\u5b98\u5458\u9700\u8981\u7f29\u5c0f\u51c0\u8d44\u6599\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u8f6c\u5411\u5927\u578b\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u5e9e\u5927\u6570\u5b57\u6c60\u5858\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u7ecf\u6302\u94a9\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u4e16\u754c\u5404\u5730\u7684\u4eba\u3002\n \u7531\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u7f16\u5236\u7684\u6570\u636e\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6267\u6cd5\u8bf7\u6c42 - \u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7167\u7247\uff0c\u8d2d\u7269\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u9a7e\u9a76\u8def\u7ebf\u548c\u66f4\u591a - \u81ea2015\u5e74\u4ee5\u6765\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u6709\u4e24\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u8b66\u65b9\u4e5f\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7cbe\u660e\u5173\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u66f2\u76ee\uff0c\u4ee5\u514d\u8b66\u60d5\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u3002\n \u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u63ed\u793a\uff06\uff0339\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u662f\uff0c\u7279\u6717\u666e\u65f6\u4ee3\u7f8e\u56fd\u53f8\u6cd5\u90e8\u8981\u6c42\u6765\u81ea\u82f9\u679c\uff0c\u5fae\u8f6f\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u56fd\u4f1a\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u52a9\u624b\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u8bb0\u8005\u5728\u6cc4\u9732\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d - \u7136\u540e\u8ffd\u6c42\u7981\u6b62\u8fd9\u4e9b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6cd5\u9662\u547d\u4ee4\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\n   \u57282020\u5e74\u7684\u4e0a\u534a\u5e74 - \u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6570\u636e -  Apple\uff0cGoogle\uff0cFacebook\u548cMicrosoft\u4e00\u8d77\u5171\u540c\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5f53\u5730\uff0c\u5dde\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b98\u5458\u7684112,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u516c\u53f8\u540c\u610f\u5728\u5176\u4e2d85\uff05\u7684\u6848\u4ef6\u4e2d\u4ea4\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u3002 Facebook\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176Instagram\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5360\u62ab\u9732\u6700\u591a\u7684\u62ab\u9732\u3002\n  \u8003\u8651\u7ebd\u6ce2\u7279\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbf\u6d77\u57ce\u5e0224,000\u4e2a\u5c45\u6c11\uff0c\u5438\u5f15\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u590f\u5b63\u6e38\u5ba2\u3002\u5c11\u4e8e100\u540d\u519b\u5b98\u5de1\u903b\u57ce\u5e02 - \u4f46\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e3a\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5468\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u3002\n \u90a3\u4e2a\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "PROVIDENCE\u00a0(AP) \u2014 When U.S. law enforcement officials need to cast a wide net for information, they&#39;re increasingly turning to the vast digital ponds of personal data created by Big Tech companies via the devices and online services that have hooked billions of people around the world.\n Data compiled by four of the biggest tech companies shows that law enforcement requests for user information \u2014 phone calls, emails, texts, photos, shopping histories, driving routes and more \u2014 have more than tripled in the U.S. since 2015. Police are also increasingly savvy about covering their tracks so as not to alert suspects of their interest.\n That&#39;s the backdrop for recent revelations that the Trump-era U.S. Justice Department sought data from Apple, Microsoft and Google about members of Congress, their aides and news reporters in leak investigations \u2014 then pursued court orders that blocked those companies from informing their targets.\n   In just the first half of 2020 \u2014 the most recent data available \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft together fielded more than 112,000 data requests from local, state and federal officials. The companies agreed to hand over some data in 85% of those cases. Facebook, including its Instagram service, accounted for the largest number of disclosures.\n  Consider Newport,\u00a0a coastal city of 24,000 residents that attracts a flood of summer tourists. Fewer than 100 officers patrol the city \u2014 but they make multiple requests a week for online data from tech companies.\n That&#39;s because most crimes \u2014 from larceny and financial scams to a recent fatal house party stabbing at a vacation rental booked online \u2014 can be at least partly traced on the internet. Tech providers, especially social media platforms, offer a &#34;treasure trove of information&#34; that can help solve them, said Lt. Robert Salter, a supervising police detective in Newport.\n  &#34;Everything happens on Facebook,&#34; Salter said. &#34;The amount of information you can get from people&#39;s conversations online \u2014 it&#39;s insane.&#34;\n As ordinary people have become increasingly dependent on Big Tech services to help manage their lives, American law enforcement officials have grown far more savvy about technology than they were five or six years ago, said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n  That&#39;s created what Cohn calls &#34;the golden age of government surveillance.&#34; Not only has it become far easier for police to trace the online trails left by suspects, they can also frequently hide their requests by obtaining gag orders from judges and magistrates. Those orders block Big Tech companies from notifying the target of a subpoena or warrant of law enforcement&#39;s interest in their information \u2014 contrary to the companies&#39; stated policies.\n Of course, there&#39;s often a reason for such secrecy, said Andrew Pak, a former federal prosecutor. It helps prevent investigations getting sidetracked because someone learns about it, he said \u2014&#34;the target, perhaps, or someone close to it.&#34;\n Longstanding opposition to such gag orders has recently resurfaced in the wake of the Trump-era orders. Apple in 2018 shared phone and account data generated by two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, but the politicians didn&#39;t find out until May, once a series of gag orders expired.\n Microsoft also shared data about a congressional aide and had to wait more than two years before telling that person. Brad Smith, Microsoft&#39;s president, last week called for an end to the overuse of secret gag orders, arguing in a Washington Post opinion piece that &#34;prosecutors too often are exploiting technology to abuse our fundamental freedoms.&#34;\n  Critics like Cohn have called for revision of U.S. surveillance laws drawn up years ago when the police and prosecutors typically had to deliver warrants to the home of the person being targeted for searches. Now that most personal information is kept in the equivalent of vast digital storehouses controlled by Big Tech companies, such searches can proceed in secret.\n &#34;Our surveillance laws are really based on the idea that if something is really important, we store it at home, and that doesn&#39;t pass the giggle test these days,&#34; Cohn said. &#34;It&#39;s just not true.&#34;\n  Many tech companies are quick to point out that the majority of the information they are forced to share is considered &#34;non-content&#34; data. But that can include useful details such as the basic personal details you supply when you register for an account, or the metadata that shows if and when you called or messaged someone, though not what you said to them.\n Law enforcement can also ask tech companies to preserve any data generated by a particular user, which prevents the target from deleting it. Doing so doesn&#39;t require a search warrant or any judicial oversight, said Armin Tadayon, a cybersecurity associate at advisory firm the Brunswick Group.\n If police later find reasonable grounds for conducting a search, they can return with a warrant and seize the preserved data. If not, the provider deletes the copies and &#34;the user likely never finds out,&#34; Tadayon said.\n  In Newport, getting a search warrant for richer online data isn&#39;t that difficult. Salter said it requires a quick trip to a nearby courthouse to seek a judge&#39;s approval; some judges are also available after hours for emergency requests. And if a judge finds there is probable cause to search through online data, tech companies almost always comply.\n &#34;Most of the companies do play ball,&#34; Salter said. &#34;We can speak with people, get questions answered. They&#39;re usually pretty helpful.&#34;\n Nearly all big tech companies \u2014 from Amazon to rental sites like Airbnb, ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft and service providers like Verizon \u2014 now have teams to respond to such requests and regularly publish reports about how much they disclosed. Many say they work to narrow overly broad requests and reject those that aren&#39;t legally valid.\n  Some of the most dramatic increases in requests have been to tech companies that cater to younger people. As the messaging app Snapchat has grown in popularity, so have government requests for its data. Snap, the company behind the app, fielded nearly 17,000 data requests in the first six months of 2020, compared to 762 in the same period of 2015.\n Salter said the fact that we&#39;re all doing so much online means police detectives need to stay tech-savvy. But training courses for how to file such requests aren&#39;t hard to find.\n For those worried about the growing volume of online data sought by law enforcement, Salter said: &#34;Don&#39;t commit crimes and don&#39;t use your computer and phones to do it.&#34;\n &#34;Judges are not going to sign off on something if we don&#39;t have probable cause to go forward,&#34; he said. &#34;We&#39;re not going to look at people&#39;s information without having something to go on.&#34;\n But Cohn said more tech companies should be using encryption technology to make all personal information, including metadata, virtually impossible to decipher without a user key to unlock it.\n Until then, she said, police can short circuit constitutional protections against unreasonable searches &#34;by just going to the company instead of coming directly to us.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:43:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3,requests", "title": "\u201c\u76d1\u89c6\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3\u201d\uff0c\u8b66\u65b9\u57286\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u63d0\u51fa112,000\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u8981\u6c42 ", "title_en": "'Golden Age of Surveillance', as Police Make 112,000 Data Requests in 6 Months", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.newportri.com/story/news/local/2021/06/27/newport-police-use-big-tech-social-media-aid-investigations/5334035001/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u9ec4\u91d1\u65f6\u4ee3", "requests"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "ba188861a0e659785786f8568f21e7d7.jpg", "infoid": 1068684, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa\u201c\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u201d\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\u3002\n \u4ed6\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u8bba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5176\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u5e01\u3002\n    Coinbase Ceo Brian Armstrong\u4eca\u5929\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u8ba1\u5212\u5217\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e0a\u5141\u8bb8\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u63d0\u9192Coinbase\u5982\u4f55\u5217\u51fa\u8d44\u4ea7\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5217\u51fa*\u6bcf\u4e2a*\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u5b83\u662f\u5408\u6cd5\u7684\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u53d1\u4e86\u63a8\u6587\u3002\n \u963f\u59c6\u65af\u7279\u6717\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ea4\u6613\u6240\u4e0d\u5f97\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u786c\u5e01\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u7279\u6b8a\u5f85\u9047\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u4e0a\u5e02\u6807\u51c6\u4e4b\u5916\uff08\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168/\u5408\u6cd5\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5c31\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u610f\u89c1\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u662f\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u8bba\u8005\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u76f8\u4fe1\u81ea\u7531\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5bc6\u7801\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;

We are asset agnostic, because we believe in free markets and that consumers should have choice in the cryptoeconomy. This is how we&#39;ll have the most innovation,&#34; he said.\n The CEO suggested that, over time, the exchange will introduce ways for its users to review or rate each asset. In theory, this would be to provide other consumers with information to make more educated decisions, he said.\n The exchange has certainly picked up the pace when it comes to listing new assets. In 2017, the exchange offered just four cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, and bitcoin cash. At the time, a Coinbase listing was a big occasion, often pumping a coin&#39;s price on the announcement that it was coming to the exchange \u2014 something that became known as &#34;The Coinbase Effect.&#34;\n Now the exchange lists 63 cryptocurrencies, from stablecoins like tether (USDT) to well-known coins like cardano (ADA) and even more obscure coins like NKN (NKN), which ranks 166th on CoinMarketCap.\n In January, Coinbase said that it was  considering 44 cryptocurrencies that it may choose to add. It has already added a few of them, including ankr (ANKR), curve (CRV) and skale (SKL). Just three days ago, the exchange added more tokens including barnbridge (BOND), livepeer (LPT) and quant (QNT) to its roster.\n But with thousands more assets out there, it still has a long way to go if it truly wants to list every cryptocurrency.\n   \u00a9 2021 The Block Crypto, Inc.

General counsel Dev Stahlkopf is leaving for the top legal role at another company, a move expected to be announced later on Tuesday.\n  Two of Microsoft&#39;s other top lawyers will add the title of general counsel. Lisa Tanzi will lead a new team that oversees how policies are implemented by engineering and sales teams around the globe, while 23-year Microsoft veteran Hossein Nowbar will be in charge of the corporate legal team, including intellectual proprty,  litigation, compliance, and competition teams.\n Former FTC commissioner and Microsoft chief privacy officer Julie Brill will add oversight of the company&#39;s responsible AI, digital safety, accessibility compliance and regulatory governance efforts.\n Between the lines: While Microsoft spent much of the 2000s fighting with regulators, Smith says this time around Microsoft is working to anticipate and embrace new sets of rules, rather than lead the charge against them.\n Although Microsoft has not been at the top of the list of companies that legislators seek to rein in, Smith said he expects that the company will be significantly affected by the wave of legislation to come.\n &#34;While I think it is easy for people to focus just on antitrust law and just the U.S., what is happening is much bigger and broader than that,&#34; Smith said.\n In the internal memo announcing the reorganization, Smith included a map of countries where new regulation of the tech industry has been proposed. That map has most of the globe colored in.\n  The big picture: Smith said he anticipates the new rules will impact not just Microsoft and other tech companies, but ultimately also their corporate customers, who will be subject to laws covering issues ranging from privacy to AI ethics.\n &#34;This is a sweeping set of changes,&#34; he said. &#34;The wise course in our view is to start to prepare what it takes.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:41:49", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "microsoft,\u5fae\u8f6f,\u4eca\u5e74,grow,axios", "title": "\u5fae\u8f6f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u5c06\u5728\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u5e74\u6d6a\u6f6e\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6cd5\u5f8b\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u4e8b\u52a1\u4eba\u5458\u8fbe\u523020\uff05 ", "title_en": "Microsoft says it will grow its legal and corporate affairs staff by 20% this year in anticipation of a multiyear wave of increased tech regulation globally", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.axios.com/microsoft-legal-team-expands-regulation-6bc0d5b9-e4a7-4131-ad4d-8d3030d0d7ab.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["microsoft", "\u5fae\u8f6f", "\u4eca\u5e74", "grow", "axios"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "92460ad72a85980b01b640c4549009f2.png", "infoid": 1068681, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u5730\u5ba3\u5e03\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u7684\u65e0\u5e7f\u544a\u79c1\u4eba\u8ba2\u9605\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002\u6ce8\u518c\u5e76\u514d\u8d39\u83b7\u5f97\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6bcf\u6708\u53ea\u97004.95\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\n \u5f53\u524d\u641c\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u88ab\u6253\u7834\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0d\u518d\u4e3b\u8981\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u544a\uff0c\u5c06\u6709\u673a\u641c\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\u63a9\u76d6\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6298\u53e0\u3002\u4ee5\u5584\u610f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e16\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u826f\u597d\u65b9\u5f0f\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u9879\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8d27\u5e01\u5316\u70b9\u51fb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u3002\n NEEVA\u662f\u641c\u7d22Reimagined  -

And by connecting Neeva to email accounts, calendars, and cloud storage platforms, users can surface information that is most valuable to them without sacrificing privacy.\n Moreover, we support the content ecosystem. Rather than being a toll collector for the web\u2019s content, we are strongly pro-publisher and are committed to creating revenue opportunities for content creators. We will share at least 20% of our topline revenue with content creator partners when their content is used to directly answer a Neeva user\u2019s query.\n \u201cNeeva was built on the premise that search should focus on the consumer, and only the consumer, not advertisers,\u201d said Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO, and Co-Founder, Neeva. \u201cSearch results should always prioritize finding the best answer to a consumer\u2019s query \u2014 not on selling ads or tracking behavior online. Today\u2019s launch of our subscription-based model is the first step in providing a viable search alternative for consumers, built on trust and transparency.\n We put the user at the center of everything. From online shopping to searching old emails, every feature is designed with the user in mind.\n Ad-free: Up to 40% of search results on the major search engine are advertisements. We deliver 100% ad-free, real search results, allowing users to find what they want, without ads getting in the way.\n  Browse safely and privately: Our browser extension, compatible with all major browsers, prevents trackers from following consumers. We never sell or share user data with anyone. It\u2019s part of our  privacy promise. And users can search anonymously in incognito mode.\n  Customize search results: Users can choose the retailers they love and news sources they want to see results from. Neeva users can stay up-to-date on everything from stock picks to the status of packages for delivery on their homepage.\n  Get expert recommended shopping results: We allow users to discover the very best products aggregated in one place, and easily read through reviews from reputable sites and verified customers.\n  Search the web \u2014 and personal accounts: To make searching even more convenient, Neeva users can sync personal email, calendar, and documents so they can find everything they need from one search bar.\n  Support content creators with search queries: We are committed to sharing at least 20% of our topline revenue with content creator partners when their content is used to directly answer a Neeva user\u2019s query. Not only are we committed to paying content creator partners, but we are also working on a set of features to make it easy for content creators to establish direct relationships with Neeva users. For example, Neeva users will be able to easily subscribe to email newsletters directly from a search results page. We are already working with Medium and Quora and in the process of establishing robust and diverse partnerships from news to food to travel and beyond.\n  We provide a browser-based extension, compatible with all major browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Safari. It runs across all devices and is available via an  iOS app.\n  Neeva is the world\u2019s first private, ad-free search engine, committed to showing you the best result for every search. We will never sell or share your data with anyone, especially advertisers. Go to  neeva.com for a free three-month trial.

", "note_en": "SQL Joins are the quintessential database operation. A join allows the user to slice and dice multiple disparate data sets, e.g., combining transaction data with product SKUs or customer information with purchase history. Similar results could be created without joining but require wide flat tables and possibly heavy pre and post-processing. Properly executed, joins provide flexibility, increase performance and allow for a wide range of data exploration.\n However, joins are, by definition, expensive. A join combines the columns from one or more tables into a new table using one or more predicates to match rows. It is instructive for programmers to think of a JOIN operation semantically equivalent to a  for loop. Given the following query, which combines the records from table  t1 and table  t2 using the predicate column  a in table  t1 equal to column  b in table  t2, we can write a pseudocode  for  loop as follows: \u200d\n   Such an operation has complexity N * M, where N is the number of records in  t1 and M is the number of records in  t2. For small tables, this is trivial (particularly on GPUs). Nevertheless, for large tables or complicated join predicates, we quickly exceed the computational ability of even the most powerful single server systems. Join optimization is a well-studied area of database research, and many well-known approaches mitigate the \u201cN squared\u201d problem detailed above. One common approach is to leverage a hash table data structure to reduce the number of match tests required between the two tables. This method builds a hash table over one of the tables, and the loop is augmented with a lookup into the hash table to obtain the potential set of matching rows: \u200d\n  While the loop structure remains similar to our first example, the hash table can significantly reduce the number of searches in the second loop. In the best case, the hash table can provide both constant time lookup and strict equality guarantees, reducing the loop to: \u200d\n   OmniSciDB supports hash joins with on-the-fly construction of hash tables on both CPU and GPU. Multiple hash functions are supported depending on the complexity of the join\u2019s equality predicate and/or size. Today, we will consider accelerating geospatial join queries using hash joins.\n We define a geospatial join query as one which uses a geospatial operator as the join predicate. A user might have a table of geocoded tweets with longitude and latitude and want to determine what zipcode the tweet falls in -- possibly coloring tweets by zipcode on a rendered map in Immerse. Such a query might look like the following: \u200d\n   (note that left join preserves tweets with no match in the zipcodes datasets, meaning a tweet will be included with a \u201cNULL\u201d color if it has no corresponding zip code, rather than excluded)\n To determine whether a tweet is inside a given zipcode, we need to check the tweet location point against each zipcode polygon exhaustively. Most algorithms require a check of each vertex of the zipcode polygon (there are a few methods for doing this; we use the  winding method) against each point. Assuming we have 1 million tweets and 33,144 zipcodes, comparing each point to each polygon would result in 33 billion comparisons. Since the median zipcode has 166 vertices, we add more zeros for 5,501,904,000,000 total comparisons (5.5 trillion operations). This does not account for the operations required to load data, check boundary conditions, and more, so we can consider it a lower bound. The latest Ampere GPUs have nearly ten teraflops, which executes the above operation in about 500ms, but if we increase our tweets table to 100M, we see time to compute increase to 6 minutes. Most OmniSci customers use data in the range of 500M to the low billions, and most queries in OmniSci run in milliseconds. So, we need to employ some optimization to make geojoins interactive.\n While it may not be readily apparent, we can apply the same hash table technique discussed above to the zipcodes table. We require two conditions; first, we need a suitable hash function to build our hash table. Moreover, we need an expression to hash over that has the following property: ST_Contains is true if the hash join expression is also true. We introduce a new operator called Overlaps, which satisfies this property.\n    We define Overlaps( b,a) or  a overlaps  b to be true if the bounding box of object  a overlaps the bounding box of object  b. Note that this operator may be better named  ApproxOverlaps; we will stick with Overlaps for the rest of this article for brevity. For a point, we consider the bounding box to collapse to the point. So, if  a is a point and  b is another geospatial object, Overlaps returns true if point  a is inside the bounding box surrounding the object  b. Now we will prove ST_Contains is true if and only if Overlaps is true. Assume we have a point  a and a geospatial object  b and a bounding box  b_box. Assume ST_Contains( b, a) is true (that is, the geospatial object  b contains the point  a) and assume Overlaps( b, a) is false (that is,  a does not overlap  b). The bounding box  b_box contains  b by definition. So, if  b contains  a, then  a must be inside the bounding box for  b. Therefore  a overlaps  b. However, we assumed Overlaps( b, a) was false, so we have a contradiction and, if ST_Contains( b, a) is true, then Overlaps( b, a) must also be true.\n We can use this property to replace the expression ST_Contains( b, a) in the query with the binary predicate Overlaps( b, a) AND ST_Contains( b, a). We will then build a hash table over the expression Overlaps( b, a) and use the hash table to reduce the number of comparisons in the join. To do that, we need a hash function. Consider the bounding boxes of the geospatial objects b. If we take the union of all bounding boxes, make it a rectangle, and then subdivide this region into individual bins, each of the same size, we can create a function that spatially maps any point  a into a bin. One such function assigns an integer identifier to each bin, computed by dividing the point coordinates by the corresponding bin dimension and taking the floor.  Space-filling curves are another option. We opted for the simple hash function because our input data is not sorted or ordered, and queries typically target a single bucket, not a range of buckets. The memory locality properties of space-filling curves are an area of future exploration. To build a hash table for this function, we take the bounding box for each polygon, determine the bin(s) the bounding box overlaps, and write an identifier for the polygon into each bin.\n    Putting it all together, we combine the new expression Overlaps( b,a) AND ST_Contains( b,a) with the hash table over Overlaps( b,a). For a given point  a, we first check the hash table to see which bin the point belongs to by applying the hash function to the point. We read the list of polygon IDs from the bin. This operation computes Overlaps for the point  a and all polygons  b (note that the condition is a bit weaker, in that a point could be in the same bin as a polygon but the two could not overlap, but it is sufficient for our purposes as any polygon not in the bin cannot possibly contain the point -- see figure 1 ). This process constrains the total number of comparisons for ST_Contains to only polygons which  might contain the given point. If the bins are low occupancy, we can significantly reduce the number of comparisons required for each point. The following pseudocode illustrates this process: \u200d\n   We started with an expression, ST_Contains( b,a), and rewrote the expression to an equivalent expression, Overlaps( b,a) AND ST_Contains( b,a). We can then use the hash join framework with an appropriate hash function and hash table to constrain the search space of the expression and improve performance. So, how do we choose appropriate bin sizes when building the hash table?\n Hash table sizing is a tradeoff between the size of the hash table and the number of records in each bin. The fewer records in each bin, the less work we have to do per bin; this means fewer expensive ST_Contains operations in our example above. However, as bins get smaller, more bins must cover the same area, increasing the time to build the hash table and its size. Our algorithm (see figure 2) searches for a hash table with low bin occupancy, capped to a maximum size. We parameterize the search over the &#34;bin threshold,&#34; the minimum bin size we will allow in the hash table. The tuner initializes the bin size by iterating over all the bounding boxes we want to add to our hash table and determine the size of the bounding box in each dimension; if that bounding box size is less than the current bin threshold but greater than the current is chosen bin size, we take that as the new bin size. By lowering the bin size threshold, we can systematically search across both hash table size and bin occupancy.\n    We will walk through one step of the tuning process in detail. Each step computes a set of one-dimensional bin sizes (the framework currently only supports two-dimensional bins but is built to support arbitrary dimensionality). We can calculate the total hash table size and a metric for average bin occupancy from the computed bin sizes. We use the calculated size and occupancy to decide whether to continue tuning. First, we look to see if the hash table is too large. If the hash table has grown too big, we use the previously determined threshold value/bin sizes. However, if no previous value exists, we have likely overshot the bin size and need to pick a more significant threshold. In this case, the algorithm reverses itself and picks larger bins until we have a hash table under the size threshold. The remaining two cases are straightforward. Keys per bin is a measure of bin occupancy, i.e., how many bounding boxes overlap a given bin (in aggregate). If the keys per bin are increasing, or if we have reached the keys per bin threshold, we terminate the algorithm, assuming that the size costs of a larger hash table will outweigh any further occupancy gains, and use the values from the previous iteration.\n   We have run several experiments to demonstrate the algorithm search process and tradeoff between bin occupancy and hash table size. The experiments below use a left-hand side table with geotagged records from Twitter&#39;s public API (the &#34;tweets&#34; table). We used an AMD Threadripper 2950X with dual NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPUs. The tweets were loaded with the standard fragment size (32M rows per fragment), split evenly across both GPUs. No additional optimizations were applied. We used three polygon tables; counties in the United States (3,233 rows with 7,944,863 total vertices across all polygons), zipcodes in the United States (33,144 rows with 52,210,207 total vertices), and census blocks in the United States (220,740 rows with 67,581,813 total vertices. The query was a left join between the tweets table and the relevant polygon table, with the first run excluded to eliminate the initial disk fetch of the data. We used a single count aggregate with no filters in the projection. Data for each experiment are in the figures below.\n     All experiments consisted of setting a target key per bin parameter and determining the resulting hash table size, build time, and execution time of the query utilizing the hash table. Using these figures, we can understand how the algorithm behaves in various settings and what the tradeoff between hash table size and bin occupancy means for hash table build time and query execution.\n Generally, results show that as the hash table gets larger, the build time becomes much more expensive, and the execution time can either moderately decrease, remain the same, or even increase. The US Counties in Tweets figure displays time on the y-axis; we see that the build time oscillates wildly at relatively low keys per bin, left of the red dotted line. We also see corresponding oscillations in the hash table size. Figure 4 (below) plotted the chosen bin thresholds against the same target keys per bin as in Figure 3(b). As one would reasonably expect, the largest hash table corresponds to the smallest bin size. However, occupancy and hash table size do not seem to be correlated at these small bin sizes. \u200d\n    To understand this correlation (or lack of correlation), we return to the tuning algorithm; to make tuning decisions, we must select new bin sizes for each step. Reducing the previous bin size by a fixed step and finding the largest bounding box dimension under the new threshold determines the new bin size per dimension. In this way, the algorithm moves through the different-sized bounding boxes, ensuring that at least one bounding box fits roughly within a bin. In practice, this avoids bin sizes scaled by a fixed size that does not match the underlying geometry (mainly since the units of the underlying geometry can vary by the coordinate system). By combining the bin size chooser with hash table size and keys per bin metrics, we can minimize execution time (by maximizing hash table size) using keys per bin to keep build times in check. Indeed, the default solution is either at or relatively close to optimal in Figure 2.\n What happens when the bins get smaller? A slight variation in bin size at small scales results in a dramatic difference in hash table size. The small bin size is typically the result of many steps because the algorithm searches through bin sizes based on existing data and selects smaller bounding boxes at each iteration with a fixed step size. The keys per bin occupancy metric change as we work through bounding boxes of similar sizes. Suddenly, we jump to a much smaller bounding box; this causes the hash table size to increase dramatically and change the occupancy, which terminates the algorithm at the previous iteration (see Figure 4b). Essentially, the bin occupancy metric prevents us from \u201cfalling through\u201d bounding boxes to one which is much smaller than the \u201caverage\u201d bounding box size in the dataset.\n In summary, our experiments show that the occupancy metric helps the tuning algorithm avoid dramatic changes in hash table size due to &#34;slipping down&#34; to the next group of bounding boxes, which may be much smaller than our experimentation group. By combining an experimentally determined minimum occupancy threshold with occupancy trend, we can abort tuning right at the edge of a reasonably large hash table (giving low bin occupancy and good performance) without falling into an unstable region where the hash table size can increase by orders of magnitude or oscillate wildly across similar occupancy metrics. While this algorithm produces strong results, additional optimizations are possible. We want to solve the optimization problem to maximize hash table size for a given occupancy threshold and pick an occupancy threshold that maximizes query execution time without creating an unreasonable build time. Consider this our first attempt at approximating a solution.\n Even though we are looking at additional optimizations to increase parallelism and performance of our overlaps join approach, it already has shown to be of immense benefit for bringing big geo-joins to be interactive or near-interactive performance levels. On a machine, with 2 Nvidia RTX 3090 GPUs, overlaps join increased performance over loop join between 200 to 1,200X on various examples, at the most extreme increasing a join of US tweets to US census block groups from 11.3K lookups per second with loop join to 22.38M lookups per second with overlaps join.\u00a0 Finally, we believe there are additional speedups possible. For example, experiments leveraging space-filling curves to order and hash the data suggest the potential to gain an additional 3-4X in performance by increasing spatial locality and lowering execution divergence during the probe phase of the hash join, so stay tuned for more on this front.\n Point in polygon joins are just one example application of the techniques described above. The generic OVERLAPS operator applies to various queries, including spatial and temporal queries (or combinations of the two). In general, two broad applications emerge; queries requiring an algorithm to construct the hash table and queries that dictate the construction of the hash table based on the predicate defining the OVERLAPS relationship in the query. We have implemented distance joins between geospatial points as an example of the latter type; if a user requests all points within N units of each other, we can construct the hash table such that a simple search of neighboring bins is always guaranteed to return the points which might be within N units of each other. While we are in the early stages of productionizing these techniques, the point in polygon join is available in OmniSci as of version 5.6 across all product modalities, including desktop, OmniSci Free, and the Enterprise Edition.", "posttime": "2021-06-30 01:39:48", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u5730\u7406,geospatial,\u8fde\u63a5", "title": "\u5728\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u5236\u4f5c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a0\u5165\u4e92\u52a8 ", "title_en": "Making geospatial joins interactive at scale", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.omnisci.com/blog/making-geospatial-joins-interactive-at-scale", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5730\u7406", "\u8fde\u63a5"]}]
