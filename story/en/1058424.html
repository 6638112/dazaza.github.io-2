The who’s who of 2003, like Elton John, Howard Stern, Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and Lindsay Lohan would supposedly be attending. Some guy named Nick Hurley owned the mansion, apparently, and to get through the door, everyone had to pass a vibe check by answering a question, like: would you rather have a cat that acts like a dog or a dog that acts like a cat?</p><p>自星期五开始以来，我第一次跳到主要内容，我有大星期五的夜晚计划：唯一的贵重豪宅。谁是2003年，就像埃尔顿约翰，霍华德·斯特恩，巴黎希尔顿，布兰妮·皮尔斯和林赛·罗汉就会据说。有些人命名的尼克·赫利拥有大厦，显然是通过门来通过回答一个问题来通过氛围，就像：你宁愿有一只像狗或一只一样行动的狗猫？</p><p> So I stayed up late — midnight on the East Coast — and got ready to attend. I donned my usual sweatpants and hoodie, got into bed, pulled up my comforter, and opened the Clubhouse app on my phone. That night, the social audio app greeted me with a page of chat room possibilities. I could join the lullaby room where musicians would sing in their softest voices to coo me to sleep, or I could join a trivia game with model Amber Rose and hosted by Jigsaw, the murderer clown from  Saw. I could, in what’s basically a room archetype at this point, debate the merits of Clubhouse. I popped into those three rooms as a warmup to the mansion party and my real Friday night plans. This was Clubhouse’s shot to show me it could become my entertainment — I skipped my Netflix time for this.</p><p> 所以我熬夜 - 东海岸午夜 - 准备参加。我和我的平常的运动裤和连帽衫一起睡在床上，拉起我的舒适者，然后在手机上打开了Clubhouse应用程序。那天晚上，社交音频应用程序用一页迎接我的聊天室可能性。我可以加入摇篮曲的房间，音乐家会在他们柔软的声音中唱歌，让我睡觉，或者我可以加入一款与模型琥珀色玫瑰的琐事游戏，由锯的小丑从锯子中举办七棱镜。我可以在这一点上基本上是一个房间原型，辩论俱乐部院的优点。我突然进入这三个房间，作为豪宅派对的热身，我真正的周五夜间计划。这是Clubhouse的拍摄，向我展示它可能成为我的娱乐 - 我跳过了我的netflix时间。</p><p> Clubhouse has turned millions of people onto the idea of spending their time talking to strangers. The invite-only app, which is only accessible through iOS devices, debuted in March 2020, exactly when people started mandatorily staying at home. Now, even as places open up more broadly, the app continues growing, although seemingly at  a much slower pace than before. More than ten million people have reportedly downloaded it from around the world, and  Bloomberg  reports it’s valued as high as $4 billion.</p><p> Clubhouse已经将数百万人变成了花时间与陌生人交谈的想法。仅限于IS IOS设备的INVITE的应用程序，于2020年3月在3月20日首次亮相时，何时在人们开始在家中留下来。现在，即使是更广泛的地方开放，该应用程序也在继续增长，尽管看似比以前更慢的步伐。据报道，已有超过一百万人从世界各地下载，而彭博会报告其价值高达40亿美元。</p><p> I first logged on this past January, despite hearing about Clubhouse for months. My first impression came from stories about rooms being  anti-Semitic and  adversarial to the media. As a Jewish journalist, those are two things that would immediately disqualify me from having a good time. And even now, after spending much time in the app, I find many of the rooms boring, chaotic, self-indulgent, or, at worst, scammy. Some rooms, for example, are “silent” with the idea being that you join and follow everyone. They’ll then follow you back. Other rooms peddle vague ideas about entrepreneurship and becoming a millionaire, likely hosted by someone who isn’t actually a millionaire.</p><p> 尽管有几个月的俱乐部，我曾经首次登录过1月份。我的第一印象来自关于房间的故事是对媒体的反犹太主义和对抗性的。作为犹太人的记者，这些是两件事会立即取消我玩得开心的事情。甚至现在，在应用程序中花费很多时间后，我发现很多房间都很无聊，混乱，自我放纵，或者在最糟糕的诈骗。例如，有些房间是“沉默”，与您加入并关注每个人的想法。然后他们会跟着你回来。其他房间戴上了关于企业家精神的模糊的想法，并成为一个百万富翁，可能是由不是实际百万富翁的人主持。</p><p>  But still, even with these turnoffs, I was determined to learn what made Clubhouse addictive to so many people, and why it’s valued at billions of dollars. One frequent user described the app as the “airport bar of the internet,” which felt accurate in describing both my experience using Clubhouse and my questions of why anyone would ever enjoy that. To be clear, I’ve had some fun on Clubhouse, but almost exclusively when I find something unexpected and not for the reasons venture capitalists tout the app.</p><p>  但是，即使在这些营业局，我也决心了解为这么多人提出上瘾的俱乐部房间，以及为什么它在数十亿美元中有价值。一个频繁的用户描述了该应用程序作为“互联网的机场酒吧”，这在描述我使用Clubhouse的经验和我对为什么曾经享有过的问题的准确性。要清楚，我在俱乐部馆玩得很开心，但几乎完全在我发现意外而不是原因，而不是风险资本家推出该应用程序。</p><p> The app’s grabbing headlines with appearances from the kinds of people VCs love — Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg — and its vibe of SXSW meets TED Talk meets staring at your phone. But the most compelling instance for me — the moment I knew something truly weird was happening — wasn’t hearing a Tesla founder talk about Tesla stuff. It was when I finally dropped in on that mansion party and discovered that Howard Stern was, in reality, some rando named Matthew Friend. And that every celebrity there was an imposter — well, an impressionist — and what I had stumbled into was not a mansion party but a bizarre roleplay of a mansion party, where people were perfecting their fake voices. Deep down I knew these stars couldn’t possibly be in one room, but the revelation surprised me nonetheless. (They were very convincing!)</p><p> 该应用程序抓住了来自各种人员VCS爱情的头条新闻 -  Elon Musk，Bill Gates，Mark Zuckerberg  - 及其氛围遇到了TED谈话，举行盯着您的手机。但我最引人注目的实例 - 我知道真正奇怪的事情发生了 - 没有听到特斯拉的创始人谈论特斯拉的东西。这是我终于在那个大厦派对上掉了一下，发现霍华德斯特恩在现实中，一些兰多名为马修的朋友。而且每个名人都有一个冒名顶替塞 - 嗯，一个印象主义者 - 我跌跌撞撞的是不是一个豪宅派对，而是一个豪宅的奇怪角色扮演豪宅的角色扮演，人们正在完善他们的假声。深入了解，我知道这些明星可能不可能在一个房间里，但是启示令让我感到惊讶。 （他们非常令人信服！）</p><p> The VCs might love the platform’s self-aggrandizing “entrepreneurial” spirit. But the thrill of Clubhouse right now is in all the rooms where users are dating, playing, experimenting — where you can watch people try to figure out what the hell Clubhouse is in real time. These users have dedicated hours to the app, almost turning it into a full-time job. Many hope this is their chance to get in on the ground level of the next big platform and find success — something that’s almost impossible to do on the big, established platforms.</p><p> VCS可能喜欢平台的自我刺激“企业家”精神。但是现在的俱乐部愉快的俱乐部是在用户约会的所有房间里，玩耍，试验 - 你可以观看人们试图弄清楚地狱俱乐部好的时间。这些用户对应用程序有专用的时间，几乎将其转化为全职工作。许多人希望这是他们在下一个大平台的地面上获得的机会，找到成功 - 在大型建立的平台上几乎不可能做的事情。 </p><p> Clubhouse isn’t without its problems, however, although these are the natural growing pains of any social network. If anything, they demonstrate how authentic of a platform Clubhouse actually is and that it’s likely to stick. The biggest issue facing Clubhouse now is the race to innovate and beat its competitors, most of whom already commend sizable user bases and massive engineering teams. Twitter, for one, has already launched its social audio competitor Spaces on both iOS and Android with plans to bring it to the web, beating Clubhouse to Android devices. Facebook is reportedly putting its offering together, although it debuted an app called  Hotline that fuses live audio with video.  Slack,  Discord,  LinkedIn, and  Spotify have all also announced their plans for similar products and functionality. Social audio is clearly here to stay, even when the pandemic wanes, but will Clubhouse make it through? And will these users, who’ve put hundreds of hours into the app see no future return from it, except the friends they’ve made along the way?</p><p>然而，俱乐部房间并非没有问题，虽然这些是任何社交网络的自然增长。如果有的话，他们展示了平台俱乐部的真正真正的真实性是如何，它可能会坚持。 Clubhouse的最大问题现在是创新和击败其竞争对手的比赛，大多数人已经赞扬了大量的用户基地和大规模的工程团队。为一个推特已经在iOS和Android上推出了其社交音频竞争对手空间，计划将其带到Web，击败Clubhouse到Android设备。据报道，Facebook据据据据报道，它借助了一个名为热线的应用程序，这些应用程序融合了视频。 Slack，Discord，Linkedin和Spotify都宣布了他们的类似产品和功能计划。社交音频显然是为了留下来，即使大流行的航徒，还会俱乐部呢？这些用户会将数百小时放入应用程序中，除了他们沿途的朋友，没有将来退回它？</p><p> “The way I think about it is that every social media platform has a particular kind of archetype that’s going to thrive and do well there, which is how you see it map out,” says Maceo Paisley, who has over 80,000 followers on Clubhouse. Visual artists do well on TikTok and Instagram, for example, while writers prefer Twitter, he says. “And then you have Clubhouse, which is for people that were good in dialogue and that was their medium.” That could be community leaders, mentors, or just people who consider themselves conversationalists.</p><p> “我认为的方式是，每个社交媒体平台都有一种特殊的原型，它将在那里茁壮成长，做得好，这就是你认为它的地图如何映射，”在俱乐部院有超过80,000名粉丝的Maceo Paisley说。他说，视觉艺术家在Tiktok和Instagram上做得好，而作家喜欢Twitter。 “然后你有俱乐部，这是对对话中善于善的人，这是他们的媒介。”这可能是社区领导者，导师，或者只是考虑自己的会话主义者的人。</p><p> “I wanted to get out of there and get back on Clubhouse so quickly, you have no idea.”</p><p> “我想离开那里，然后快速地回到俱乐部，你不知道。”</p><p> And luckily for Clubhouse, it came about during the pandemic when everyone craved an interaction with someone,  anyone, outside their immediate home. Talking to a celebrity would be cool, too.</p><p> 很幸运的是，对于俱乐部院，它在大流行期间，当每个人都渴望与某人的互动，任何人，在他们的直接家里。与名人交谈也会很酷。</p><p> “In some cases, you can hop on stage with Malcolm Gladwell and ask him a question about his work, and he has nowhere to go,” Paisley says. “He’s like, ‘Well I’ve never thought of that,’ and you’re like, ‘You’re Malcolm Gladwell, you’ve never thought of it? That’s what you do, you’re a thought leader.’”</p><p> “在某些情况下，你可以用马尔科姆的舞台上跳上舞台，并问他一个关于他的工作的问题，他无处可去，”佩斯利说。 “他就像，”好吧，我从未想过那样，'你就像，“你是马尔科姆·兴趣，你从未想过它？这就是你所做的，你是一个思想领袖。'“</p><p> The pandemic eventually gave way to a second, critical factor for the app’s success: screen fatigue. Most people would do anything to not stare at a screen more than they already do. We’re almost always looking at them, and any time we might have had away prior to the pandemic is now severely limited, if it exists at all. For me, walks in my neighborhood are some of my only respite, but even then, I’m usually on the phone or listening to a podcast — anything to keep me from being, god forbid, alone with my thoughts.</p><p> 大流行最终让道路达到了一秒钟的应用程序的成功：筛选疲劳。大多数人会做任何事情，而不是屏幕比他们所做的更多。我们几乎总是看着它们，如果我们在大流行之前，我们可能已经在大流行之前已经受到了限制了。对我来说，在我的社区散步是我唯一的暂停，但即便如此，我通常在电话或听播客 - 任何让我免于，上帝禁止，独自一人。</p><p> The real question for Clubhouse is whether it’ll maintain its appeal after the pandemic. Can it compete with brunch plans, weddings, and real-life parties? From my conversations, it seems like yes. People can’t pull themselves away, even when IRL plans are available.</p><p> Clubhouse的真正问题是它是否会在大流行后保持吸引力。它可以与早午餐计划，婚礼和现实生活派对竞争吗？从我的谈话来看，似乎是的。即使可用的IRL计划，人们也不能把自己拉开。 </p><p> Comedian Leah Lamarr, who has 195,000 followers on the app, did her first live show since the pandemic in early February where she got to schmooze with other comics  in person. But throughout the night, a thought kept nagging at her. “I wanted to get out of there and get back on Clubhouse so quickly, you have no idea,” she tells me.</p><p>在APP上有195,000名粉丝的喜剧演员Leah Lamarr在二月初以来，她的第一个现场表演是她的第一个现场表演，她在那里施密到Schmooze与其他漫画。但整个夜晚，一个思想抱怨着她。 “我想从那里离开，这么快地回到会所，你不知道，”她告诉我。</p><p> Lamarr’s built a loyal following on Clubhouse where she hosts a variety of rooms, including live standup sets, and has found fans through the app. She and her friend Nicole Behnam, who has 156,000 followers, tell me they even work together to bring friends onstage during these comedy rooms where they specifically instruct them to unmute their mics only to laugh or clap.</p><p> Lamarr在Clubhouse建立了一个忠诚的关注，她在那里举办各种房间，包括现场立场套装，并通过应用程序找到了粉丝。她和她的朋友尼科尔Behnam，谁拥有156,000名粉丝，告诉我他们甚至共同努力，在这些喜剧室里带上朋友在舞台上，他们专门指导他们只能笑或拍打他们的麦克风。</p><p>  I asked her how long she spent on the app daily, and she says it’s a triggering question. “I get anxiety when I’m not on it. I have Clubhouse FOMO.”</p><p>  我问她每天花了多长时间，她说这是一个触发问题。 “当我不在它时，我会得到焦虑。我有Clubhouse Fomo。“</p><p> She’s not the only one that’s hooked. She says friends of hers “blew out their vocal cords” from talking so much. Behnam tells me she had to cut back on her app time from an initial 12 to 14 hours per day to just four to six.</p><p> 她不是唯一一个被迷住的人。她说，她的朋友们“吹灭了他们的声带”从谈论这么多。 Bechnam告诉我，她必须每天从最初的12到14小时开始削减她的应用程序时间，只需四到六个。</p><p> “I definitely realized that it could become an addiction for anybody,” she says. “When I realized that, I started meditating and going in nature more. There was one point, it’s funny, but I hadn’t listened to music in so long, I finally turned Clubhouse off and listened to music, and I literally felt like I was in another world.”</p><p> “我肯定意识到它可能会成为任何人的成瘾，”她说。 “当我意识到这一点时，我开始冥想并进入大自然。有一个点，它很有趣，但我没有听音乐这么久，我终于休息了俱乐部，听到音乐，我觉得我在另一个世界上觉得自己觉得。“</p><p> But Clubhouse isn’t always a great time. In Lamarr’s case, she says she’s asked big-name comedians, like Tiffany Haddish, to participate in her biweekly stand-up room only to be turned down because of concerns over joke stealing. (Joke stealing is already a problem on Twitter, which has a searchable, written history. Now imagine how that could happen on a live app with no native recording function or archive.) Paisley adds that people even steal room ideas, which recently culminated in two different feuds. In one, a group of Black users claim they pioneered the concept of  “shoot your shot” rooms where someone can get onstage and ask another user out, but that the idea only got widespread attention when white NYU students imitated it.</p><p> 但俱乐部房屋并不总是很棒。在Lamarr的案例中，她说她已经问过大名喜剧演员，就像蒂芙尼哈迪什一样，只有在笑话偷窃的担忧时才被拒绝拒绝她的双周站立的房间。 （笑话偷窃已经是Twitter的问题，它有一个可搜索的书面历史。现在想象一下，没有本机录制函数或存档的现场应用程序如何发生。）佩斯利补充说，人们甚至窃取房间的想法，最近偷了房间的想法两个不同的仇恨。在一个中，一群黑人用户声称他们开创了“拍摄你的射门”的概念，有人可以获得船上并询问另一个用户，但是当白纽斯学生模仿它时，这个想法只会受到普遍的关注。</p><p> “HOW INTERESTING is it that after months of black people hosting shoot your shot rooms and getting suspended for it, Clubhouse gives a bunch of white NYU girls the ‘shoot your shot’ club &amp; they get monetized. joke,” one person tweeted.</p><p> “经过几个月的黑人举办射击房间并暂停它，俱乐部会给一群白纽约女孩'拍摄你的射击'俱乐部＆amp;他们被货币化。笑话，“一个人推文。 </p><p> In  a separate incident, a group claims it came up with the original concept for a “whale moaning room” where people, of course, moaned like whales. But, it says, the idea was co-opted, again from users of color, and used by white influencers to gain power and reach on the platform.</p><p>在一个单独的事件中，一群人声称它提出了一个原始的概念，为“鲸鱼呻吟室”，当然是鲸鱼的人。但是，它说，这个想法再次选择，再次从颜色的用户中再次选择，并被白色的影响者使用，以获得电力并达到平台。</p><p>  Room stealing might seem trivial, but it’s the closest thing the app has to intellectual property. A brilliant format could draw in listeners and mint a new way for the app to function. This happened most famously in December when a group of users came together to put on a rendition of  The  Lion King. They popularized the idea of “PTR,” or pull to refresh, meaning room attendees could pull down on their screen to see profile photos change to different scenes and characters. Now, PTR is regularly referenced in rooms. I PTR’d during the mansion party to see which celebs people would impersonate next, for example, and I PTR’d during a live art auction in which artists changed their photos to the art they were selling. The first room like this sold $10,000 worth of art, says Casey McBride, who hosts and started the auctions.</p><p>  房间窃取可能看起来很琐碎，但这是应用程序对知识产权的最接近的事情。辉煌的格式可以在听众和薄荷中绘制一个新的应用程序来运作。当一群用户聚集在一起时，这发生了最着名的是，这是一群用户聚集在一起露出狮子王。他们普及“PTR”的想法或拉动刷新，意大观房间与会者可以在他们的屏幕上拉下来，看看档案照片更改为不同的场景和字符。现在，PTR经常在房间里引用。我在大厦派对期间看到哪些名人会在接下来的情况下冒充哪些名人，而且我在一个现场艺术拍卖期间，艺术家将照片改为他们销售的艺术品。凯西麦克布莱德说，这是一个如此销售价值10,000美元的艺术品，他举办并开始拍卖。</p><p> Then, there are the scammers — and the community policing them. Rahaf Harfoush, who has 133,000 followers, chronicles the scams she and her club members find weekly as part of the “anti-grift squad,” as they refer to themselves. They’ve found plenty to keep them busy. One example Harfoush tells me about is a “startup” room where people pitch their ideas for a business. The people running the rooms might feign interest, but in actuality, they go and buy the domain names associated with the ideas, essentially ensuring that the entrepreneurs have to pay them to own it. Other scams include people claiming that users have to pay for a Clubhouse moderator badge — that’s not true — or rooms that attempt to sell a product, like consulting packages. The hosts of the product room will bring supposedly enthusiastic users onstage to hype up the item, but in reality, they profit from any sales made.</p><p> 然后，有诈骗者 - 社区政权。 Rahaf Harfoush有133,000名粉丝，编年史，她和她的俱乐部会员在每周找到“反蔓延队”的一部分，因为他们指的是他们自己的一部分。他们发现很多让他们忙碌。一个例子，哈菲犬告诉我是一个“启动”房间，人们为企业推出他们的想法。运营房间的人可能会使兴趣感兴趣，但实际上，他们去购买与思想相关的域名，基本上确保企业家必须支付他们拥有它。其他诈骗包括声称用户必须支付俱乐部主持人徽章的人 - 这不是真实的 - 或者试图销售产品的房间，如咨询包。产品房间的主机将带来热情的用户在舞台上炒作该物品，但实际上，他们从任何销售中获利。</p><p> “It’s fascinating to me because it’s just the iteration of all the scams that exist elsewhere,” Harfoush says. She notes that misinformation is also rampant with people spreading conspiracy theories and anti-vax rhetoric. Her group doesn’t mention scammers’ names specifically because coordinated harassment campaigns are already happening, too. The scammers have retaliated by getting a group together to report a user en masse, resulting in a Clubhouse ban. (Those reporting tools themselves  were created as a result of harassment on the platform with no way for members to insulate themselves.)</p><p> “这对我而言，因为它只是在其他地方存在的所有存在的骗局的迭代，”Harfoush说。她指出，误导性也猖獗，人们传播阴谋理论和反vax修辞。她的小组没有特别提及诈骗者的名字，因为协调的骚扰运动也已经发生了。诈骗者通过将一个小组聚集在一起来报告用户en masse，导致俱乐部禁令。 （那些报告工具本身是由于骚扰平台上的骚扰而无法为成员隔离自己。）</p><p> One person pretended to be Brad Pitt talking about climate change for over an hour</p><p> 一个人假装是布拉德皮特谈论气候变化超过一个小时</p><p> All of this is to say, Clubhouse is starting to experience many of the same problems as its biggest competitors, like Facebook and Twitter. There are scammers, moderation issues, problems with accreditation, and even impersonation. Yes, the celebrity impersonators from the mansion room were obviously doing a bit, but other people have attempted to straight-up dupe people. One person  pretended to be Brad Pitt talking about climate change for over an hour and only copped to it when someone asked him point-blank whether he was really Brad. He even had the username @bradpitt. (Clubhouse doesn’t have any sort of verification system, like blue checkmarks, meaning you have to hope the person you’re seeing on the app is who they say they are.)</p><p> 所有这一切都说，俱乐部屋开始体验许多与其最大的竞争对手相同的问题，如Facebook和Twitter。有诈骗者，审核问题，认证问题，甚至冒充。是的，来自大厦房间的名人模仿者显然有点做，但其他人试图直接欺骗人。一个人假装是Brad Pitt谈论气候变化超过一个小时，只有当有人问他被剥夺了他真的是布拉德的时候，只有那样的冲击。他甚至有用户名@bradpitt。 （Clubhouse没有任何类型的验证系统，如蓝色选中标记，这意味着你必须希望你在这个应用程序上看到的人是他们所说的。）</p><p> Clubhouse attempts to address these issues weekly during a town hall, where its co-founders announce product changes and answer users’ questions. Now that it’s facing competition from seemingly every major tech company, however, its problems are more dire. A new social app is always exciting — a wacky world to explore is where the internet really thrives — but as Clubhouse matures, it loses that initial creative energy and replaces it with bad actors, boring normies, and the dreaded brands. Twitter and Facebook already know how to anticipate the problems Clubhouse faces. They’ve dealt with these issues on their own platforms and hired accordingly. Clubhouse isn’t even widely available, let alone staffing entire moderation teams.</p><p> Clubhouse在一个城镇大厅期间每周解决这些问题，其联合创始人宣布产品变更并回答用户的问题。现在它面临似乎每个主要技术公司的竞争，然而，它的问题越来越可怕。一个新的社交应用程序总是令人兴奋 - 探索的古怪世界就是互联网真正茁壮成长的地方 - 而是随着俱乐部的成熟，它失去了初步的创造性能量，并用坏行动者，无聊的规范和可怕的品牌取代它。 Twitter和Facebook已经知道如何预测俱乐部脸部的问题。他们已经在自己的平台上处理了这些问题并聘用了相应的招聘。俱乐部屋甚至没有广泛使用，更不用说员工整理促进团队。 </p><p>  The onslaught of the brands could be the worst of Clubhouse, though. Branded rooms could sanitize Clubhouse of the fun it once had and replace it with forced conversation and promotion — like a radio station that only plays commercials. Entire agencies are even popping up to help Clubhouse influencers connect with brands, and already, companies like IHOP are using the platform. In IHOP’s case, it’s  hosting a day-long room where people can hear the sound of sizzling bacon on repeat.</p><p>但是，品牌的冲击可能是最糟糕的俱乐部。品牌的房间可以消毒俱乐部的乐趣曾经拥有并用强制对话和推广更换它 - 就像只播放商业广播电台。整个机构甚至突破，帮助俱乐部影响者与品牌联系，并且已经像ihop这样的公司正在使用该平台。在IHOP的情况下，它在举办一天长的房间，人们可以在重复中听到培根的声音。</p><p> Also take, for example, The Cotton Club. Lots of stories mention the group, which hosts a weekly room that pretends to be the famous jazz bar in Harlem. Users change their photos to black and white images of jazz musicians and come onstage to chat. A bartender mixes drinks and changes their profile photo to match what they’re making. It’s genuinely inventive, and the creator of the club, Bomani X, was even the app’s icon for a while.</p><p> 例如，也要采取棉花俱乐部。很多故事提到了这一组，其中一个托管每周的房间，假装成为哈莱姆着名的爵士酒吧。用户将照片更改为爵士音乐家的黑白图像，然后沿着舞台聊天。调酒师混合饮料并改变他们的个人资料照片以匹配他们所做的。这是真正的创造力，俱乐部的创造者Bumani X甚至是App的图标。</p><p>   But now, The Cotton Club has been branded. I joined the room once in February only to see it advertising the Hulu movie  The United States vs. Billie Holiday. The partnership makes sense; it’s brilliant, actually, but hearing the hosts shout out a hashtag felt wrong. Why are they advertising Twitter on Clubhouse? They also brought director Lee Daniels onstage and asked about the film. Maybe that’s interesting to some people, but it pushes the boundaries of how much promotion people really want to hear.</p><p>   但现在，棉花俱乐部已被品牌。我在2月份加入了这间房间，只看到它广告Hulu电影美国与Billie Holiday。伙伴关系有意义;实际上是辉煌的，但听到主人喊出一个哈希特感觉不对劲。他们为什么在俱乐部休息室广告推特？他们还将李丹尼斯主任举行，并询问了这部电影。也许这对某些人来说很有意思，但它推动了人们真正想听的促销的界限。</p><p> Prior to my mansion party, I stopped into the  Saw-themed trivia room. Kiarash Behain impersonates the movies’ murderous clown three times a week and, to get into character, he turns the starry lights in his at-home recording studio red and ominous. He hooks his phone up to his computer so he can control his voice through a soundboard, which allows him to use effects. He’s devised a wide list of ways he could “put people in the dirt,” aka send them back to the audience when they miss a question, and outlines the show ahead of time.</p><p> 在我的豪宅派对之前，我停止了锯主题的琐事室。 Kiarash Behain每周三次冒着杀麦克劳尔的杀戮，并进入角色，他在他的家庭录音室红色和不祥地区转变了星光灯。他把手机挂在一起，所以他可以通过声板控制他的声音，这让他能够使用效果。他设计了各种方式，他可以“把人放在泥土中”，又名在错过问题时送他们回到观众，并提前概述了节目。</p><p> His show’s been copied in different ways, and he doesn’t sweat it. “My job is just to create a really, really great experience to the point where maybe it can’t be matched,” he says.</p><p> 他的秀是以不同的方式复制，而且他没有汗流。 “我的工作只是为了创造一个真正的，真正的经验到可能无法匹配的地方，”他说。</p><p>  And when he thinks about the possible branding deals or scammers that come to the platform, cementing the app’s place in the digital creator ecosystem, he says Clubhouse has a key advantage.</p><p>  并且当他思考到平台的可能品牌交易或诈骗者时，在数字创建者生态系统中巩固了应用程序的位置，他说俱乐部院有一个关键的优势。</p><p> “You can really read somebody’s voice as if it’s like DNA,” he says. “So if somebody is lying you can tell. If somebody is pure and has great intentions, you can tell through their voice and Clubhouse really, really sells that dynamic very well.”</p><p> “你可以真正读到某人的声音，就像它就像DNA一样，”他说。 “所以，如果有人撒谎，你可以告诉。如果有人是纯粹的并且有很大的意图，你就可以通过他们的声音和俱乐部讲述，真的很好地卖得那么好。“ </p><p> I loved the  Saw trivia room when I dropped in, but I wonder how long the novelty will last, particularly as Clubhouse becomes more of a corporatized machine. I can imagine a world, for example, where the owners of the  Saw franchise issue a takedown request against Behain for using their intellectual property — if the shtick doesn’t get old by then. Maybe the thousands of people who join the room might actually want to go to trivia at a real bar when this pandemic ends. Or perhaps the platform gets eaten by Facebook or Twitter. It’s easy to envision these possibilities when various platforms have already played out the trajectory. They all set out to change how we communicate, and ultimately, their stories end up sounding exactly the same.</p><p>当我辍学时，我喜欢锯的琐事室，但我想知道新颖性将持续多久，特别是随着俱乐部房间变得更多的公司化机器。 例如，我可以想象一个世界，例如，锯特许经营者的业主发出了灭亡要求，以利用他们的知识产权 - 如果什氏底没有变老。 也许加入房间的成千上万的人实际上想在这种大流行结束时在一个真正的酒吧去琐事。 或者也许平台被Facebook或Twitter吃掉了。 当各种平台已经播放轨迹时，很容易设想这些可能性。 他们全都旨在改变我们的沟通方式，最终，他们的故事最终会出现完全相同。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/程序/">#程序</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/celebrity/">#celebrity</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/俱乐部/">#俱乐部</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
