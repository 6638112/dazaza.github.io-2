European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n Google generated $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world, with ads including search, YouTube and Gmail accounting for the bulk of its overall sales and profits.\n About 16% of its revenue came from the company&#39;s display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.\n &#34;We will also be looking at Google&#39;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition,&#34; Vestager added.\n  &#34;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day. They choose them because they&#39;re competitive and effective,&#34; a Google spokesperson said.\n The Commission said its investigation would span Google services, including Display &amp; Video 360 (DV360) and Google Ads to buy online display advertisements on YouTube, Google Ad Manager which is used by publishers to auction ad space, and AdX which is one of several marketplaces which can manage auctions.\n Google&#39;s plan to remove browser cookies and also to stop tracking Android users via a tool known as an advertising identifier will also be looked at.\n Reuters reported exclusively last week that the EU competition enforcer would investigate Google\u2019s digital advertising business before the end of the year.\n Google&#39;s adtech business is also under fire in the United States, with the Justice Department, joined by some states, suing last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house.\n A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google&#39;s ad empire. According to market researcher eMarketer, Google could control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display.\n While the figures may not appear to represent a monopoly at first glance, advertisers and rivals contend that Google&#39;s various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:40:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e7f\u544a,google,\u8c37\u6b4c,rust,\u6b27\u76df", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u5341\u5b57\u67b6\u518d\u6b21\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u67e5\u8be2 ", "title_en": "Google in EU Crosshairs Again With Advertising Antitrust Inquiry", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-antitrust-regulators-investigate-googles-adtech-business-2021-06-22/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e7f\u544a", "google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "rust", "\u6b27\u76df"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "946e85c8d7f2005e83094b6b28180910.png", "infoid": 1067460, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u60a8\u5728\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u6587\u6863\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\uff06\uff0339;\u5f53\u60a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7acb\u5373\u83b7\u5f97\u6240\u6709\u5b83\u4eec\u3002 Firecode\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "When you have millions of documents in a collection, you can&#39;t just get all of them at once as your machine&#39;s memory will explode. Firecode&#39;s configurable traverser objects let you do this in a simple, intuitive and memory-efficient way using batching.\n Firecode is an extremely light, well-typed, zero-dependency library that is useful in a variety of scenarios. You can use it in database migration scripts (e.g. when you need to add a new field to all docs) or a scheduled Cloud Function that needs to check every doc in a collection periodically or a locally run script that retrieves some data from a collection.\n     Firecode is designed to work with the  Firebase Admin SDK so if you haven&#39;t already installed it, run\n     Suppose we want to send an email to all our users. We have a  users collection that needs to be traversed. The following piece of code uses a Firecode traverser to do this simply and efficiently.\n import  {  firestore  }  from  &#39;firebase-admin&#39; ; import  {  createTraverser  }  from  &#39;@firecode/admin&#39; ; const  usersCollection  =  firestore ( ) . collection ( &#39;users&#39; ) ; const  traverser  =  createTraverser ( usersCollection ,  {  // We want each batch to have 500 docs. Obviously, the size of the very last batch may be less than 500  batchSize:  500 ,  // We want to wait before moving to the next batch  sleepBetweenBatches:  true ,  // We&#39;ll wait 500ms before moving to the next batch  sleepTimeBetweenBatches:  500 , } ) ; const  { batchCount , docCount  }  =  await  traverser . traverse ( async  ( snapshots )  =&gt;  {  const  batchSize  =  snapshots . length ;  const  sendEmailToEachUserInBatch  =  ( )  =&gt;  Promise . all (  snapshots . map ( async  ( snapshot )  =&gt;  {  const  { email , firstName  }  =  snapshot . data ( ) ;  await  sendEmail ( {  to:  email ,  content:  `Hello   ${ firstName }!`  } ) ;  } )  ) ;  await  sendEmailToEachUserInBatch ( ) ;  console . log ( `Successfully emailed   ${ batchSize } users in this batch.` ) ; } ) ; console . log ( `Traversal done! We emailed   ${ docCount } users in   ${ batchCount } batches!` ) ;\n  Pass that reference to the  createTraverser() function and create the traverser with our desired configuration\n Invoke  .traverse() with an async callback that is called for each batch of document snapshots\n This pretty much sums up the core functionality of this library! The  .traverse() method returns a Promise that resolves when the entire traversal finishes, which can take a while if you have millions of docs. The Promise resolves with an object containing the traversal details e.g. the number of docs you touched.\n   const  projectsCollection  =  firestore ( ) . collection ( &#39;projects&#39; ) ; const  migrator  =  createBatchMigrator ( projectsCollection ,  {  batchSize:  250  } ) ; const  { migratedDocCount  }  =  await  migrator . update ( &#39;isCompleted&#39; ,  false ) ; console . log ( `Successfully updated   ${ migratedDocCount } projects!` ) ;\n  type  UserDoc  =  {  firstName:  string ;  lastName:  string ; } ; const  usersCollection  =  firestore ( ) . collection ( &#39;users&#39; )  as  firestore .

The company claims the P550&#39;s processors are the fastest RISC-V cores on the market and beat Arm&#39;s Cortex-A75 chips in terms of area efficiency. Perhaps not so surprisingly, Intel, which has reportedly  offered $2 billion to buy the plucky startup, also announced that it would adopt the designs for use in its future 7nm Horse Creek platforms.  Intel hasn&#39;t shared many details of its Horse Creek development platform yet, but given that it uses the company&#39;s yet-to-be-released 7nm process, we expect the test chips to arrive  in the 2022/2023 time frame. Intel will incorporate its own leading-edge interface IP, like DDR and PCIe, into the chip and notes that the 7nm Horse Creek platform is &#34;a valuable and expandable development vehicle for cutting-edge RISC-V applications.&#34; As such, we imagine the project could expand to other connectivity options in the future, like the accommodations needed for 3D, chiplet, or tile-based processor designs.  Intel also says that it plans to &#34;showcase to mutual customers&#34; the P550 design incorporated into its Horse Creek platform. It&#39;s rational to think Intel could eventually productize a design as part of the  company&#39;s pledge to produce RISC-V chips based on SiFive&#39;s designs through its new\u00a0 IDM 2.0\u00a0initiative that will find Intel operating as a third-party foundry for other chip companies (much like TSMC).\n   RISC-V is most commonly used in microcontrollers and small, simple chips, which has earned it quite the industry uptake. SiFive&#39;s Performance series is an application processor-class design, meaning the chips have a memory management unit (MMU) that enables running an operating system \u2014 in this case, Linux (albeit that doesn&#39;t mean as a general-purpose machine). This is preferable to the stripped-down real-time operating systems (RTOS) commonly used for embedded applications.  SiFive claims that its new Performance P550 core is the highest-performance RISC-V processor on the market, delivering a SPECINt 2006 score of 8.65/GHz that&#39;s comparable to existing proprietary application processors. The P550 scales up to four cores that can be crammed into the same amount of silicon area as a single Arm Cortex-A75 core, yet SiFive says it beats the A75 in performance metrics. The P550 comes with SiFive&#39;s U84 microarchitecture with a thirteen-stage, triple-issue, out-of-order pipeline.  The Performance P270 slots in as the lower-performance eight-stage, dual-issue, in-order processor that supports RISC-V Vector Extension v1.0, which SiFive says makes it an ideal candidate to replace SIMD architectures. SiFive also offers its Recode software to translate existing SIMD software from existing &#39;legacy&#39; architectures to RISC-V vector assembly code.  RISC-V is evolving into more expansive use cases as the architecture matures. The RISC-V organization plans to evolve the standard to accommodate  faster chips for high-performance applications in the future.  SiFive revealed the broad strokes of its new Performance platform today, but there&#39;s still much more to learn as it works its way to market. That starts with a July 14th webinar that will expand on the details.

"Times Insider  explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n We were part of The New York Times\u2019s team (with the Washington correspondent Helene Cooper) that broke the story of the Pentagon\u2019s long-secret unit investigating unidentified flying objects, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, in December 2017.\n Since then, we have reported on  Navy pilots\u2019 close encounters with U.F.O.s, and last week, on the current revamped program, the  Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force and its official briefings \u2014 ongoing for more than a decade \u2014 for  intelligence officials, aerospace executives and Congressional staff on reported U.F.O. crashes and retrieved materials.\n We\u2019re often asked by well-meaning associates and readers, \u201cDo you believe in U.F.O.s?\u201d The question sets us aback as being inappropriately personal. Times reporters are particularly averse to revealing opinions that could imply possible reporting bias.\n But in this case we have no problem responding, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t  believe in U.F.O.s.\u201d\n  We admire what the great anthropologist Margaret Mead said when asked long ago whether she believed in U.F.O.s. She called it \u201ca silly question,\u201d writing in Redbook in 1974:\n \u201cBelief has to do with matters of faith; it has nothing to do with the kind of knowledge that is based on scientific inquiry. \u2026 Do people believe in the sun or the moon, or the changing seasons, or the chairs they\u2019re sitting on? When we want to understand something strange, something previously unknown to anyone, we have to begin with an entirely different set of questions. What is it? How does it work?\u201d\n That\u2019s what the Pentagon U.F.O. program has been focusing on, making it eminently newsworthy. And to be clear: U.F.O.s don\u2019t mean aliens. Unidentified means we don\u2019t know what they are, only that they demonstrate capabilities that do not appear to be possible through currently available technology.\n In our reporting, we\u2019ve focused on how the Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Intelligence and members of two Senate committees are engaged with this topic. Current officials are now concerned about the potential threat represented by the very real, advanced technological objects: how close they can come to our fighter jets, sometimes causing a near miss, and the risk that our adversaries may acquire the technology demonstrated by the objects before we do.\n So if U.F.O.s are no longer a matter of belief, what are they and how do they do what they do?\n And if technology has been retrieved from downed objects, what better way to try to understand how they work?\n Our previous stories were relatively easy to document with Department of Defense videos of U.F.O.s and pilot eyewitness accounts backed up by Navy hazard reports of close encounters with small speeding objects.\n But our latest article provided a more daunting set of challenges, since we dealt with the possible existence of retrieved materials from U.F.O.s. Going from data on a distant object in the sky to the possession of a retrieved one on the ground makes a leap that many find hard to accept and that clearly demands extraordinary evidence.\n Numerous associates of the Pentagon program, with high security clearances and decades of involvement with official U.F.O. investigations, told us they were convinced such crashes have occurred, based on their access to classified information. But the retrieved materials themselves, and any data about them, are completely off-limits to anyone without clearances and a need to know.\n  We were provided a series of unclassified slides showing that the program took this seriously enough to include it in numerous briefings. One slide says one of the program\u2019s tasks was to \u201carrange for access to data/reports/materials from crash retrievals of A.A.V.\u2019s,\u201d or advanced aerospace vehicles.\n Our sources told us that \u201cA.A.V.\u201d does not refer to vehicles made in any country \u2014 not Russian or Chinese \u2014 but is used to mean technology in the realm of the truly unexplained. They also assure us that their briefings are based on facts, not belief.\n Ralph Blumenthal was a Times reporter from 1964 to 2009.

", "note_en": "For cybercriminals looking to launder illicit gains, bitcoin has long been the payment method of choice. But another cryptocurrency is coming to the fore, promising to help make dirty money disappear without a trace.\n While bitcoin leaves a visible trail of transactions on its underlying blockchain, the niche \u201cprivacy coin\u201d monero was designed to obscure the sender and receiver, as well as the amount exchanged.\n As a result, it has become an increasingly sought-after tool for criminals such as ransomware gangs, posing new problems for law enforcement.\n The rise of monero comes as authorities race to crack down on cyber crime in the wake of a series of audacious attacks, notably the hack on the Colonial Pipeline, a major petroleum artery supplying the US east coast.\n \u201cWe\u2019ve seen ransomware groups specifically shifting to monero,\u201d said Bryce Webster-Jacobsen, director of intelligence at GroupSense, a cyber security group that has helped a growing number of victims pay out ransoms in monero. \u201c[Cyber criminals] have recognized the ability for mistakes to be made using bitcoin that allow blockchain transactions to reveal their identity.\u201d\n Russia-linked REvil, the notorious ransomware group believed to be behind the attack this month on meatpacker JBS, has removed the option of paying in bitcoin this year, demanding monero only, according to Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft.\n Meanwhile, both DarkSide, the group blamed for the Colonial Pipeline hack, and Babuk, which was behind the attack on Washington DC police this year, allow payments in either cryptocurrency, but charge a 10 to 20 percent premium to victims paying in riskier bitcoin, experts say.\n Justin Ehrenhofer, a cryptocurrency compliance expert and member of the monero developer community, said that at the beginning of 2020, its use by ransomware gangs was \u201ca rounding error.\u201d Today he estimates that about 10 to 20 percent of ransoms are paid in monero, and that the figure will probably rise to 50 percent by the end of the year.\n     Monero was launched as an open-source project in 2014 by a user of a bitcoin forum with the pseudonym \u201cthankful_for_today.\u201d Its original white paper argued that bitcoin\u2019s traceability was a \u201ccritical flaw,\u201d adding that \u201cprivacy and anonymity are the most important aspects of electronic cash.\u201d\n Ehrenhofer is among those who argue that bitcoin\u2019s visibility should be rejected in favour of a fully private financial system. \u201cThe main goal is transaction indistinguishability\u2014to make private and fungible money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make monero as similar to cash as possible, where one $10 bill is the same as another and the merchant doesn\u2019t know where they came from.\u201d\n While the currency has enjoyed a more than fivefold rise in price since the beginning of 2020, tracking the wider cryptocurrency rally, its overall market capitalisation remains a sliver of that of bitcoin: nearly $5 billion compared with $727 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\n Still, it has inspired a loyal following among privacy idealists and anti-establishment cryptography hobbyists such as Ehrenhofer, who are dedicated to maintaining its code and using advanced mathematics to try to ensure its transactions remain untraceable. It now has the third-largest community of developers of any cryptocurrency, behind bitcoin and ethereum, data show.\n But monero has also attracted controversy since its inception, thanks to its association with illicit payments and money laundering. Dr Tom Robinson, chief scientist and cofounder of blockchain intelligence group Elliptic, said an increasing number of marketplaces on the dark web exclusively accepted monero for sales of everything from guns to drugs. \u201cThat\u2019s been a big shift over the past year.\u201d\n Meanwhile, ransomware negotiators, who are typically hired by victims to help handle extortion payments, have also begun contacting monero developers in order to understand how the cryptocurrency works, according to Ehrenhofer. The negotiators aimed to \u201cbuild out the liquidity relationships\u201d needed to facilitate payment in the event of a monero ransom demand, he said.\n     The absence of a digital trail for monero is proving increasingly problematic for law enforcement, which typically works with private sector cryptocurrency analytics groups to trace suspect transactions on bitcoin\u2019s digital ledger.\n Europol, in a 2020 report, placed privacy coins among the factors that had \u201crendered cryptocurrency investigations more challenging and [that] we can expect these to feature more prominently in future investigations.\u201d\n In September last year, the US Internal Revenue Service offered a bounty of $625,000 for any contractors able to develop tools to help trace monero. It has since awarded the contract to cryptocurrency forensics group Chainalysis and data analysis group Integra FEC.\n Other cryptocurrency forensics groups have also quietly been attempting to do the same. CipherTrace chief executive Dave Jevans said his company had started working on the currency more than two years ago under a contract with the US homeland security department, and had filed patent applications as part of the work, but would not share further details.\n Some experts say it is unlikely that ransomware gangs will switch to demanding monero exclusively, because difficulty in sourcing it could make victims less likely to pay up.\n Many point to challenges around its liquidity and availability, meaning only smaller transactions may be possible. \u201cIf you pick a currency that\u2019s too obscure, the very act of purchasing the currency can make [it] more expensive to purchase. That creates levels of unpredictability in a negotiation,\u201d said Eric Friedberg, co-president of Aon-owned cyber security group Stroz Friedberg.\n Others note that given its opaqueness, it is impossible to ascertain whether or not your transactions are with sanctioned entities\u2014which could risk severe penalties.\n Multiple experts say US legislators are so far steering away from singling out any particular cryptocurrency when drafting relevant legislation. Still, many big cryptocurrency exchanges have shied away from listing privacy coins for fear of attracting regulatory scrutiny, as authorities increasingly insist on higher know-your-customer and money-laundering standards.\n  \u201cIf a client wants to do anything in a privacy coin, we don\u2019t support it,\u201d said Bill Siegel, chief executive of Coveware, one of the most popular ransom negotiator companies. \u201cWe understand what the attitude is from a regulatory standpoint and we want to be helpful to law enforcement.\u201d\n \u00a9 2021 The Financial Times Ltd.

", "note_en": "This is part of the idea behind NuvoAir, which uses both an app to listen to your night-time coughing and other health data to do just that.\n The Boston-based startup has now raised $12 million in a Series A funding led by London-based AlbionVC,\n  Perhaps because the COVID-19 pandemic made people more aware of respiratory complaints, NuvoAir claims it experienced 500% growth in the first quarter of 2021.\n The round was also participated in by KAYA (formerly Enern), Amino Collective and existing shareholders Spiltan, Industrifonden and Novartis Pharma AG (dRx Capital).\n How NuvoAir ai works is by combining the data from a Bluetooth-enabled spirometer that remotely monitors lung function; a sensor that attaches to asthma and COPD inhalers; and an integration with Fitbit devices. It also includes data from  NuvoAir Cough, which assesses changes in nighttime coughing.\n Its business model is enabling health plans, insurance companies, and healthcare systems to reduce the cost of managing their most severe respiratory patients, and also managing the care they provide.\n Furthermore, it\u2019s able to be used in the clinical trial business, where it licenses the technology to pharma companies or contract research organizations on a per user basis.\n NuvoAir says over 500 million people globally suffer from chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). And it costs around $300 billion a year to manage these conditions.\u00a0 The company claims its solution reduces urgent consultations by more than 39%.\n In some way, NuvoAir is comparable to companies like\u00a0Livongo (tracks Diabetes, raised $235M) and\u00a0Omada Health (tracks chronic illness, raised $256.5M). All these companies are using increasing amounts of data about our health to manage ongoing illnesses.\n The funding will be used to accelerate the expansion of the NuvoAir digital care platform in the US and Europe; advance the development of new products and services; and support NuvoAir\u2019s partner and customer base for decentralized clinical trials around the world.\n Lorenzo Consoli, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of NuvoAir told me: \u201cAs a child, I suffered from severe asthma. I was hospitalized a few times and my parents were really scared when that happened. My grandmother died because of COPD and other family members, unfortunately, had severe respiratory conditions as well. On top of that, my young son has asthma. So I have naturally been drawn to respiratory health and have always felt the current health systems are not designed to help patients on a day-to-day basis, but only when patients end up in the hospital, which is always too late. But honestly, it was only when, by chance, in 2012 I joined the digital health team of Novartis Respiratory Franchise that I realized how much technology and healthcare were meant to be together. It was an eye-opener for me to realize that certain digital biomarkers could tell whether patients were responding to treatment or predict whether they might be hospitalized\u2026 Equipped with those insights and with my prior experience as a patient, I decided in 2016 to take on the challenge of improving respiratory health, and NuvoAir was born.\u201d\n Dr. Christoph Ruedig, Partner at AlbionVC said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be able to support NuvoAir, one of the few digital health companies active in both Europe and the US. The company has built an impressive respiratory disease management ecosystem with strong clinical evidence and a scalable care model that benefits patients, payers and providers.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:59:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u547c\u5438,respiratory,nuvoair", "title": "\u7531\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u7684\u7ae5\u5e74\u54ee\u5598\u542f\u53d1\uff0cNuvoair\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861200\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u547c\u5438\u75be\u75c5 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tInspired by founder\u2019s childhood asthma, NuvoAir raises $12M to tackle respiratory illnesses\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/inspired-by-founders-childhood-asthma-nuvoair-raises-12m-to-tackle-respiratory-illnesses/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u547c\u5438", "nuvoair"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "6eba7922e477e6858453489281ae5c38.jpg", "infoid": 1067455, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u521b\u59cb\u4ebaIsa Watson\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053\u4e16\u754c\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u591a\u4e45\u3002\u5979\u5b8c\u5168\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b49\u5f85\u6062\u590d\u6b63\u5e38\u3002\n \u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u5c0f\u961f\u91cd\u65b0\u542f\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u52a0\u6df1\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eb2\u5bc6\u670b\u53cb\u5708\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002 Squad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec5\u9650\u97f3\u9891\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u522b\u62c5\u5fc3 -

Instead of waiting for a return to normalcy, she shifted the scope of the app entirely.\n Today,  Squad relaunches as an audio-based social app that aims to help users deepen their relationship with their existing circle of close friends. Squad is an audio-only app, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s not another Clubhouse wannabe. Instead, it functions as a news feed of voice message updates from your closest friends, which expire after 24 hours.\n  You can add up to twelve friends to your \u201csquad,\u201d and once you post an update, your squad members can emoji react or send a private voice message in response \u2014 these also expire after a day, encouraging users to be more open about what they share. Soon, Squad will support phone calls, but there currently isn\u2019t functionality for group calls or group audio messaging. But, users might be incentivized to talk on the phone via Squad rather than a typical call, since you can add a title to your call. That way, your squad member knows why you\u2019re calling before they pick up.\n  \u201cThere\u2019s a big gap in the social landscape, because most of the tools are discovery platforms, broadcast platforms, and personal branding platforms,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to come in and help people maintain stronger connections with the people that they enjoy the most.\u201d\n Posting a voice update feels more genuine than a curated Instagram shot or a crafted Facebook status update (and  Facebook is decidedly uncool among Gen Z and millennials). As the popularity of apps like  Dispo show, young people are responding well to ephemeral, authentic social media experiences. But the audio-only medium could be a hard sell for people who aren\u2019t already sending voice messages on WhatsApp or iMessage. However, while Squad\u2019s initial rollout will be domestic, there\u2019s great potential for an app like this outside of the US, where  voice messaging is more popular.\n \u201cA lot of the conversations that would happen on text message are now happening in an asynchronous audio type of way,\u201d Watson added. \u201cSo we expect that to continue to penetrate further into our habits.\u201d\n Watson raised a $3.5 million seed round in 2019, and she was  featured on TechCrunch with advice on raising venture capital as a woman of color in Silicon Valley. Despite changing the direction of her app, her investors \u2014 which include Michael Dearing (Harrison Metal), Aaron Levie (Box), Katrina Lake (StichFix), Jen Rubio (Away), and Stewart Butterfield (Slack) \u2014 remain supportive. Watson secured another million dollars of funding after the seed round, bringing Squad\u2019s funding to a total of $4.5 million to date.\n \u201cOne thing [the investors] said to me was, \u2018Isa, you\u2019ve been talking about this shift in social for years now, and people told you you were crazy, that social was all figured out and there was nothing that was going to happen,\u2019\u201d Watson said. \u201cNow, people are buying into that change.\u201d\n  Even though Squad isn\u2019t a Clubhouse competitor, the rise of audio-only media is a good sign for the app\u2019s ability to crack a saturated social market (so many social apps are trying to compete with Clubhouse, it\u2019s a miracle we don\u2019t yet have audio-only Tinder speed dating). In Squad\u2019s beta test, 87.5% of users completed the onboarding process. Still, Squad falls victim to the same accessibility issues that plague Clubhouse and many of its clones. As of yet, Squad doesn\u2019t support captioning, though Watson says this is something the company has discussed and hopes to implement down the road. Not only could captioning broaden Squad\u2019s audience, but it could also further differentiate the app from messaging giants like iMessage and WhatsApp.\n Still, if you\u2019re someone who loves to send voice messages in your group chats, you might want to get your friends on Squad. Currently, the app is invite-only with a waitlist. Once you\u2019re off the waitlist, you get three invites. If you post for five days straight, you get three more invites, and if someone you invited signs up, you get two more invites as well. This continues until you round out your twelve-member squad.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:59:38", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Alloy, and Little Spoon.\n Bilt has two main pieces, a rewards platform and a credit card, powered by Mastercard.\n  On the rewards side, Bilt has partnered with estate owners and property managers including the Blackstone Group, The Related Companies and Equity Residential. Folks who rent with these entities can now earn rewards each time they pay their rent, with the opportunity to earn even more rewards for things like lease renewals or lease signing bonuses.\n The co-branded  Bilt Mastercard credit card allows renters at those properties, or any other renter, to pay their rent with the credit card. As a renter myself, and as one that is still forced to pay by check via snail mail, this is a welcome offering.\n Folks who use the Bilt Mastercard will earn 2x points on rent payments and one point per dollar spent on the card elsewhere.\n These points, whether earned through spending on the card or by paying rent at Bilt-partnered properties, can be used toward travel with airlines and hotels, as well as other perks like group fitness classes. But perhaps the most significant option for spending points is to use them toward a mortgage payment.\n Bilt worked with regulators, as well as Fannie Mae and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, to gain approval for using rewards points toward a mortgage. So not only can people use their rewards points toward their down payment on a home, but folks using the Bilt Mastercard can also build their credit score and earn rewards at the same time, bringing down the rates on their mortgage.\n On the revenue side, Bilt takes a cut of the transaction fee alongside Mastercard for purchases made through the Bilt credit card. The startup also generates revenue by charging property managers for the points they distribute to their tenants.\n \u201cThree years ago, if you asked us if we could bring together an alliance of property owners to work together under one unified rewards program, it would have been hard to imagine,\u201d said Jain. \u201cIf you think about getting payment networks to collaborate on a credit card or fees on rent, most people would have said that\u2019s not possible. Getting regulatory approval from the U.S. government was a huge hurdle we had to overcome. Building out every airline and hotel partnership was huge. That\u2019s why it\u2019s taken three years. This has been the hardest project we\u2019ve worked on.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:59:22", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u8ba1\u5212,program,bilt", "title": "\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u79df\u91d1\u4ed8\u6b3e\uff1f \u89c1\u9762 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tA rewards program for your rent payments?

They\u2019ll be offered as part the studio\u2019s Epic Online Services suite, which is available to use with any game engine and supports Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android.\n The new voice chat service is cross platform and supports both one-on-one and party chat in lobbies and during in-game matches. When using the service, voice data is relayed through Epic\u2019s back-end servers, and the technology handles all scaling and quality of service features. Epic says the technology has already been \u201cintegrated and battle-tested in  Fortnite,\u201d which provides some assurance that it can handle millions of players at once.\n  Alongside voice chat, Epic Online Services is also adding support for Easy Anti-Cheat, a service designed to root out and boot cheaters from online games. Easy Anti-Cheat has previously been available  for third-party developers to license for their games, but it\u2019s now free as part of Epic Online Services and should allow many more developers to make use of it. Epic argues anti-cheat software like this is increasingly important as more games offer cross-play between PCs and other platforms, since cheating software is often more readily available on PC.\n Like other anti-cheat software, Easy Anti-Cheat can occasionally  cause issues for non-cheaters and  label innocent software as malicious, so it\u2019s far from a perfect solution. But with cheating still  plaguing many of the world\u2019s biggest games, it\u2019s hard to argue against developers having another tool in their arsenal.\n Epic is including both services as part of its Epic Online Services suite, which isn\u2019t tied to its own game engine or storefront. In an FAQ  on its website the company says it offers the services for free \u201cwith the goal of encouraging wider adoption of all of Epic\u2019s offerings\u201d and to build a bigger cross-platform account base for the company and its partners.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:51:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u514d\u8d39,\u5f00\u53d1,games,\u670d\u52a1", "title": "EPIC Games\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u804a\u5929\u548c\u53cd\u4f5c\u5f0a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e0e\u6240\u6709\u4e3b\u8981\u5e73\u53f0\u517c\u5bb9 ", "title_en": "Epic Games says it will offer free voice chat and anti-cheating tools for developers as part of its Online Services suite, compatible with all major platforms", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22544447/epic-games-anti-cheat-voice-chat-online-services-free?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u514d\u8d39", "\u5f00\u53d1", "games", "\u670d\u52a1"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8a03a3bff828347164c7300548169a8b.png", "infoid": 1067451, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u65b0\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u90e8\u5206\u5373\u5c06\u63a8\u51fa\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u6839\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5229\u76ca\u627e\u5230\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\n  \u706b\u79cd\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u8ff7\u604b\u3002\u5728\u7ed9\u4e32\u884c\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u540e\uff0c\u4e0a\u79cb\u5b63\u89c6\u9891\u804a\u5929\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u73b0\u5728\u8ba9\u6210\u5458\u6dfb\u52a0\u591a\u4e2a\u526a\u8f91\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d44\u6599\u3002\u4ece\u4eca\u5929\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5c06\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u624b\u673a\u5230\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u706b\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5f55\u5236\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\uff06\uff0334;\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u8868\u8fbe\u81ea\u5df1\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u706b\u79cd\u671f\u671b\u5176Gen Z\u7528\u6237\u5728Tiktok\u548cYouTube\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4f7f\u7528Aplomb\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be5\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5360\u5176\u5168\u7403\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u768450\uff05\u3002\n \u89c6\u9891\u53ea\u662f\u5728\u706b\u79cd\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u65b0\u589e\u7684\u65b0\u589e\u542b\u91cf\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u81ea\u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6539\u53d8\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\uff06\uff0334;\u70ed\u5e26\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u65b0\u901f\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4f1a\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u53f3\u4fa7\u6216\u5de6\u4fa7\u6ed1\u52a8\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8c08\u8bba\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u3002\u5f53\u8ba1\u65f6\u5668\u8017\u5c3d\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\uff06\uff0339;

After giving serial daters the  ability to video chat last fall, the app is now letting members add multiple clips to their profile. Starting today, users will be able to edit and upload up to nine recorded videos from their phone to their Tinder profile. This, the company says, offers members a more &#34;authentic way to express themselves.&#34; In particular, Tinder expects its Gen Z users raised on TikTok and YouTube to take to the feature with aplomb. The demographic makes up 50 percent of its global user base.\n Video is just one of several new additions included in Tinder&#39;s latest update, which it hails as one of the biggest changes to its app since launch. It&#39;s also introducing a new speed dating-style social feature called &#34;Hot Takes&#34; that lets unmatched users talk in short spurts before swiping right or left. When the timer runs out, you&#39;ll be able to choose whether to match with the person or move on to another session. Hot Takes will be available from 6pm to midnight on weekdays and marks the first time Tinder users have been able to chat before they match. It actually sounds similar to  Spark, the dedicated speed dating app Facebook launched in April.\n   Finally, Tinder is also debuting a new section called Explore as a way for singletons to connect based on their shared interests, and as a showcase for its live events like Hot Takes. You&#39;ll be able to find potential matches based on their &#34;Passions&#34; like activism, binge watching or thrill seeking. The Explore section will launch later this summer.

", "note_en": "Personal data will continue to flow unimpeded from the EU to the UK, the bloc&#39;s member states have agreed in a unanimous decision that will relieve many businesses on both sides of the Channel of spending much time and money on complex legal paperwork.\n All 27 member states\u00a0 voted in favor of granting the UK an adequacy decision\u00a0\u2013 a special status that recognizes that the country&#39;s data laws do as good a job as the European GDPR at protecting personal information.\n     Countries that are granted adequacy gain the right to receive and process the personal data of EU citizens, which many organizations rely on to do business.\n  The UK&#39;s departure from the EU has meant that the country has ceased to be protected by the GDPR, and instead relies on domestic laws to manage citizens&#39; personal data. Those laws had to be assessed by EU regulators to ensure that they meet the bloc&#39;s standards on data protection.\n Without an adequacy decision, organizations would have had to design special contracts called Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), to ensure that they were lawfully processing the data of European citizens. Economists estimate that the total cost of implementing those new contracts to keep data flowing legally could amount to \u00a31.6 billion ($2.14 billion), with smaller firms hit the hardest.\n Achieving adequacy, therefore, was a key part of Brexit negotiations. Earlier this year, the European Commission\u00a0 published a draft document outlining the details of an adequacy decision for the UK, which determined that UK laws do indeed provide a level of data protection that is equivalent to the GDPR.\n   The decision was approved by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in April and has now been green-lighted by member states, meaning that adequacy is on course to be implemented. Unsurprisingly, organisations and businesses across the EU and the UK have welcomed the announcement.\n &#34;A positive decision on data adequacy is a huge relief for thousands of businesses across the UK \u2013 over half of businesses surveyed by the DMA just before Brexit stated this was important for the future of their business,&#34; says Chris Combemale, the CEO of the Data and Marketing Association (DMA). &#34;The government estimated that without adequacy the UK economy could lose up to \u00a385 billion, so this announcement is a significant boost after a challenging year.&#34;\n The volume of personal data that is exchanged between the UK and the EU is significant and spans virtually all industries \u2013 think legal and financial services, but also e-commerce, human resources, and even healthcare.\n The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM), for example, stressed that the delivery of cross-border health and social care for thousands of European citizens relies on data flowing without restrictions with the UK. Health data transfers are also key to advance scientific research.\n &#34;With this (adequacy) decision, the EU and the UK can continue to benefit from the continued secure flow of personal data to facilitate the development of new treatments and to improve patient safety and care across Europe,&#34;\u00a0 said FEAM in a statement.\n While adequacy has been granted to the UK for the time being, however, the decision only applies to UK data law as it is written now. Also known as the &#34;UK GDPR&#34;, the country&#39;s domestic rules are currently modelled on European law and as such, provide a high level of data protection for citizens. But if that were to change, the EU has made clear that it could re-evaluate the decision and withdraw the agreement.\n The issue might become a point of contention. Over the past few months, the UK has repeatedly sent signals that it aims to\u00a0 seize the Brexit opportunity to diverge from the standards set by the bloc&#39;s GDPR\u00a0in an effort to boost growth and innovation.\n &#34;Adequacy was received on the basis that the UK would not diverge and not change the level of protection,&#34; Estelle Mass\u00e9, senior policy analyst and data protection lead at digital rights organisation Access Now, tells ZDNet. &#34;If the UK government were to follow through with this, then the whole legal system on which the EU has based its adequacy determination will no longer be in place and will need to be re-evaluated.&#34;\n     Just days before the EU member states voted in favor of adequacy,\u00a0 a government taskforce submitted a report to the UK prime minister with recommendations to reform the country&#39;s regulatory landscape\u00a0\u2013 including some changes to the UK GDPR.\n Describing the GDPR as &#34;out of date&#34;, the taskforce called for the government to leverage its &#34;newfound regulatory freedom&#34; to replace GDPR with a new UK-made framework for data protection.\n According to the report, GDPR compliance can cost businesses up to 30 working days-worth of time a year, and as such constitutes a significant barrier to innovation and growth. To create a more business-friendly environment, said the taskforce, the UK should implement data laws that are more proportionate, and place lower compliance burdens on smaller organisations.\n In particular, the report&#39;s authors called for the removal of a GDPR provision that lets citizens refuse to be subjected to a decision based solely on an automated decision-making system \u2013 which means that organisations must always have an alternative, human-based process in place to use as an alternative.\n  Instead, the taskforce suggested that automated decisions should be subjected to a test determining whether they are in the public&#39;s interest, and whether they meet critical fairness and transparency criteria.\n The authors also pointed to the GDPR&#39;s restrictions on using data for any purposes other than those for which it was collected, and argued that this means that organisations cannot experiment with data to understand its potential value in new applications.\n The report&#39;s recommendations are yet another red flag for some in the EU. &#34;If this is removed, it could potentially mean that the UK wants to be able to develop the use of automated decision-making systems in the public and private sectors in a way that people couldn&#39;t say no,&#34; says Mass\u00e9.\n &#34;The UK is completely free to take that path is they find it is more beneficial for them. But there will be consequences: if the UK chooses to diverge a lot from the EU, then it will lose its adequacy, and all the industries that rely on exchanging data between the EU and the UK will be in trouble.&#34;\n The next few months are likely to reveal how far the UK wishes to go in transforming the country&#39;s domestic rules on data protection \u2013 and crucially, how much leeway the EU will be willing to give. On both sides, says Mass\u00e9, the outcome of the strategy is still unclear.\n &#34;It&#39;s really quite incomprehensible to work so much to secure this adequacy and when just about to get it, to also give indication to the EU that it may change,&#34; she says. &#34;It&#39;s a really hard diplomacy game \u2013 almost as if the UK is testing the limits of the EU.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:46", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u82f1\u56fd,uk", "title": "\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u6279\u51c6\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u548c\u82f1\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u963b\u788d\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u82f1\u56fd\u7684\u6cd5\u89c4\u4e0eGDPR\u4e00\u6837\u597d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f01\u4e1a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6587\u4e66\u5de5\u4f5c ", "title_en": "EU member states approve unimpeded data flows between EU and UK, deciding UK's regulations are as good as GDPR, avoiding complex legal paperwork for businesses", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-major-international-data-flow-problem-just-got-resolved-but-another-row-is-already-brewing/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u82f1\u56fd", "uk"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f661bb20457881646e764591f17c9fbc.png", "infoid": 1067449, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Snir\uff06\uff0339;\u6295\u8d44\u529e\u516c\u684c\u662f\u4e00\u5bb6\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u901a\u8baf\u3002\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u662f\u5e38\u7eff\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u6d89\u53ca\u6295\u8d44\uff0c\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u3002\n      \u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u662f\u57282021\u5e74\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d8b\u52bf\u79d1\u76ee\uff0c\u5b83\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8fd1\u671f\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4ef7\u683c\u6307\u6570\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5347\u6e29\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u301c5\uff05\u7684\u5347\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u8054\u50a8\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u80c0\u9884\u671f\u3002\n \u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u7316\u7357\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u672c\u6587\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u975e\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5047\u8bbe\u60a8\u5bf9\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u4e8e\u4f20\u5165\u901a\u80c0\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u60a8\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u51b2\u5b83\u3002\n \u786e\u5b9a\u60a8\u8ba4\u4e3a\u7684\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u51b3\u5b9a\u60a8\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u7ec4\u5408\u5c06\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u7684\u5bf9\u51b2\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\uff06\uff0339;

The subjects are evergreen and deals with the essence of investing, mental models, and concepts.\n      Inflation has been a trending subject for the past few months of 2021, and it gets all the more heated as we see recent Consumer Price Index measurements that show ~5% rise, along with higher inflation expectations from the Fed.\n Whether inflation will go rampant or not is a very complex subject beyond this article. This article assumes you did your own research and got some conclusions on incoming inflation, and you want to know how best to hedge against it.\n Determining how much inflation you think is coming and managing this risk is a crucial step. It will decide how much of your portfolio will be devoted to inflation hedges and how you&#39;ll pay for &#34;opportunity cost&#34; - for example, whether you should pull out 20% or 100% off of a promising growth company you&#39;re invested in.\n  When looking at asset allocation statistically, the details are often hiding behind big numbers. So, for example, a statement like &#34;gold is a great inflation hedge&#34; is factually accurate but might not be right at certain times.\n What if everyone already fears inflation, and the media pumped gold as a hedge so much so that gold at this point had a huge run-up that makes it an overprices hedge that will be counter-productive?\n Another example might be real estate - it is generally a good vehicle against inflation. But if there&#39;s a particular housing crisis in California that got their real estate prices too high already, buying a house there won&#39;t be a good investment regardless.\n You might be competing with much bigger players than you like  most institutional investors are now buying real estate in masses.\n  While we can&#39;t say that all stocks suffer from inflation, the data shows more volatility and more downturns for stocks with inflations.\n I collected all the data since 1928 about inflation and the S&amp;P 500 (or its equivalent) returns. Here&#39;s a visualization of the results:\n   As inflation rises above 3.5%, we see much more downturns, while times of stable inflation, 1-2%, have much fewer downturns.\n This doesn&#39;t mean that the stock market will go down with inflation, but it means that there are significantly higher chances of that happening and higher chances for individual stocks to suffer.\n  Understanding what is in inflation that harms productive companies is vital for the bigger picture.\n Inflation impact different businesses in different ways, and covering it all is impossible. Instead, I&#39;ll cover some common cases to give you an idea and a framework of thought when analyzing other companies:\n  Let&#39;s say you have a lemonade stand, and your capital expenditure is mostly lemons. In the first year, you buy 1,000$ lemons to produce 1,100$ worth of lemonade that you sell.\n That&#39;s a 10% margin on regular days. Next year, you can choose to reinvest and expand your business, buying 1,100$ worth of lemons to sell 1,210$ of lemonade.\n  You&#39;ve got 1,100$ after the first year. But since inflation this year was 10%, those 1,100$ buys you the same amount of lemons as 1,000$ used to buy the year before. So inflation ate up all your margins.\n This is an oversimplification, but it effectively demonstrates the effect rising prices have on businesses. But, of course, there are caveats - when will you raise the lemonade price, whether you can raise it at all in the face of competition, etc. All affecting the outcome, but the story remains the same.\n  Many growth companies today are losing money as a strategy. Often for every 1$ they spend on marketing, bring back a customer that buys for &gt;1$ through the customer&#39;s lifetime with the company, making it worthwhile to spend as much as possible now to grab as much of the market earlier.\n Inflation will not stop these otherwise great companies, but it will require an adjustment to the growth models.\n Marketing platforms and sales processes are getting affected by inflation almost instantaneously. That means that these companies will have to spend more on marketing in an inflationary environment to get the same results.\n All while their pricing power is limited. Customers have contracts pre-signed for years often, with limited optionality for price uplifts even when the current contract ends (as these are enterprise contracts for the most part).\n Higher expenses to grow, with lower real-value income from all existing recurring customers, will harm the growth of the growth companies. However, they will still grow, albeit slower, and it needs to be accounted for.\n   Why inflation is bad news for SASS, money-losing, but great, growth companies  Super-quick thoughts \ud83e\uddf5 $SNOW  $MNDY  $ASAN  $PLTR\n\u2014 Snir David (long term investing) (@snird)  June 18, 2021\n  The last example is delayed inflation, which is somewhat demonstrated in the example above for growth companies.\n Sometimes, prices that a company pays to produce their products (including wages) rise before the company can raise their product prices, creating disparity.\n Stranded in a long-term agreement with predetermined prices, or a crowd that isn&#39;t accustomed to the new price tag, so it avoids the product.\n Furniture company selling to offices in a catalog price for a year, while lumber prices jump 3x on them in the meantime.\n Hairdresser pays higher rent and other living costs, while the crowd prefers to cut their hair at home, as paying 10$ more for a haircut sounds exaggerated to them.\n   Gold is well known for being a good inflation hedge. It&#39;s under limited supply, has underlying value for real-world usage, and has been historically good storage of value, so people trust it.\n I collected the prices of gold through time compared to inflation to visualize how this kind of asset if working:\n   As you can see, gold prices are rising just before inflation increases - as the market always trades on the future, so the action is always slightly before reality.\n But it also typically fall right after the highs of inflation. Thus, making timing a crucial step if you want to trade gold. The market always overprices, both in the ups and the downs of unproductive assets.\n But over time, gold keeps its value and corrects itself. Thus, making it a good hold against inflation, but a total 0% real return if you hold it for the long-term, and not just temporarily as an inflation hedge.\n The same story is told for any other commodity. However, right now, we see other craziness in prices of things like lumber and tomato that has more to do with turbulence in the global shipping and production system rather than a reaction to inflation alone.\n    To drive the point forward that commodities are similar to gold, here are the lumber prices in the 1980s inflation spike:\n    The behavior is very similar to gold. It rises until ~1980 then it drops. While in the long-term, it keeps its underlying value against inflation.\n  There is something to be said about Bitcoin, but I&#39;ll keep it short, even though I know I&#39;ll get a lot of heat for that.\n Unproductive assets like gold and commodities are not like Bitcoin for a simple reason: they have intrinsic, underlying value. There are industrial uses for gold and obviously for lumber. Bitcoin doesn&#39;t have any use other than its existence.\n We can&#39;t compare Bitcoin to gold, but it doesn&#39;t mean it invalidates Bitcoin as a whole. It just invalidates the usage of Bitcoin as an unproductive asset to hedge against inflation. Whether there are other reasons for Bitcoin to take the world by storm is another discussion.\n  If we take the lessons from stocks (productive companies) and gold, commodities (unproductive assets), we can see why real estate is considered the best investment for inflation.\n Real estate is productive through rent with minimal capital expenditure. So you will produce more money following inflation without harming the production by the need to put more money in.\n Real estate is limited and real, like gold. Any real asset, as we saw, is rising in price alongside inflation.\n Real estate is the best against inflation  overall. In the short term, when inflation initially rises, commodities will go higher much faster. But as we saw, they fall back down after. Real estate increases more moderately but doesn&#39;t have the fallback later, making it overall more stable and delivering higher returns in the long term.\n Here&#39;s a graph from an  excellent research paper from state street that demonstrates the performance of assets in different inflation quantiles (the higher quantile, the higher the inflation).\n    REITs perform very well in every quantile, making them the best hedge against inflation for the long-term, providing good returns.\n P.S - I lied. There is something better than real estate - farms. For the same reasons, just better in every step. But as individual investors, we usually can&#39;t buy farms, unlike  Bill Gates that went on a massive purchase extravaganza, making him the biggest farmland owner in America.\n  There are other options, of course. However, I focused on the most prominent and reasonable ones for individual investors.\n Things like TIPS (bonds that follow inflation) naturally protect against inflation, but they come with a 1% coupon these days. Irrelevant. So as government bonds and others, all affected by the extremely low interest rate, I didn&#39;t touch here either.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:50:02", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0,assets", "title": "\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u6f14\u6297\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0\u8d44\u4ea7 ", "title_en": "Best performing assets against inflation", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.the-investing-desk.com/blog/best-investments-for-inflation", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u901a\u8d27\u81a8\u80c0", "assets"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "06b661eea79be7f1260fc1574148c93f.jpg", "infoid": 1067448, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Bumble\uff0c\u5987\u5973\u8d1f\u8d23\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e3e\u63aa\u7684\u7ea6\u4f1a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u672c\u5468\u6682\u65f6\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\uff0c\u4ee5\u6253\u51fb\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u6240\u7684\u538b\u529b\u3002\n  \u5728Twitter\u4e0a\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4e3b\u7ba1\uff0c\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u60e0\u7279\u5c3c\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u725b\u5fb7\u5236\u4f5c\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\uff06\uff0334;\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8054\u7cfb\u7740\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u5026\u6020\uff06\uff0334;\n Bumble\u6bd4\u5927\u591a\u6570\u516c\u53f8\u90fd\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fd9\u788c\u7684\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u80a1\u5e02\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7528\u6237\u53f7\u7801\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e4\u6708\uff06\uff0334\u5ba3\u5e03;\u6240\u6709\u7684\u7b28\u62d9\u5458\u5de5\u90fd\u4f1a\u5728\u516d\u6708\uff06\uff0334\u7684\u4e00\u5468\u5047\u671f\u6709\u4e00\u5f20\u5df2\u4ed8\u8d39\u7684\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u8131\u673a;\n Bumble\u7684\u53d1\u8a00\u4eba\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9047\u5230\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5458\u5c06\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5458\u5de5\u4f11\u5047\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4ed6\u4eec\u4f11\u5047\u4e00\u5468\u3002\n  \u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u671f\u95f4\uff0cBumble\u5728\u9501\u5b9a\u671f\u95f4\u9677\u5165\u56f0\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u5237\u65b0\u4ee5\u67e5\u627e\u62fe\u53d6\u7684\u6bd4\u8d5b\u3002\n \u6839\u636e\u5176\u6700\u65b0\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e0e3\u67083\u65e5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u671d\u9c9c\u5927\u9ec4\u8702\u548cBadoo\u7684\u4ed8\u8d39\u7528\u6237\u6570\u76ee\u5212\u5206\u4e3a30\uff05\uff0c\u6bd4\u53bb\u5e743\u670831\u65e5\u76f8\u6bd4\u3002 \n\u6c83\u5c14\u592b\u7267\u7fa4\u5973\u58eb\u4e5f\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u5973\u6027\uff0c\u572831\u5c81\u65f6\uff0c\u57282\u6708\u4efd\u4e3e\u884c\u5927\u9ec4\u8702\uff06\uff0339;

These employees will then be given time off to make sure they take a whole week of leave.\n  Bumble has grown in popularity during lockdown as boredom set in and swiping to find a match picked up.\n The number of paid users across Bumble and Badoo, which Bumble also owns, spiked by 30% in the three months to 31 March, compared with the same period last year,  according to its most recent set of results.\n Ms Wolfe Herd also became the youngest woman, at 31, to take a company public in the US when she oversaw Bumble&#39;s stock market debut in February.\n  She rang the Nasdaq bell with her 18-month-old baby son on her hip and in her speech she said she wanted to make the internet &#34;a kinder, more accountable place&#34;.\n     Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd&#39;s quest to make the internet a &#34;kinder&#34; place extends to the company&#39;s head office. And then some.\n Back in 2017, the firm unveiled its new headquarters in Texas. Saturated in Bumble&#39;s signature yellow, wall mirrors are emblazoned with messages such as &#34;you look bee-autiful honey&#34;. Even the light switches have slogans, telling people to &#34;shine bright like a diamond&#34;.\n It also boasts a &#34;Mommy Bar&#34; - described as a &#34;private lactation space&#34; by Ms Wolfe Herd - as well as fortnightly manicures, hair trims and &#34;blowouts&#34; which the founder said showed &#34;appreciation for our busy bees&#34;.\n  Working hours? Not nine to five apparently. Employees can choose the hours they want, just as long as the work gets done.\n Could the UK see the same sort of office environment here? With many people spending so much time at home recently, perhaps companies will follow through on making changes to working life. Just don&#39;t hold out for free manicures though.\n  Workers in other industries have complained about working long hours and the effect on their well-being.\n Earlier this year, a group of younger bankers at Goldman Sachs warned they would be forced to quit unless conditions improved. They said they were working an average of 95 hours a week and slept five hours a night.\n A spokeswoman for the investment bank said at the time: &#34;A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that&#39;s why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them.&#34;\n Prior to Covid, one of the most high-profile examples of overwork emerged in when Antonio Horta-Osorio, then the relatively new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was forced to take a leave of absence. After joining the bank in January 2011, Mr Horta-Osorio took eight weeks off from November after  prolonged insomnia led to exhaustion.\n  Following his return, Mr Horta-Osorio - now chairman of Credit Suisse - led a re-evaluation at the bank on the importance of mental health.\n  Bumble made its announcement after several tech companies have unveiled their plans for remote working as the economy reopens.\n Twitter has said that it expects a majority of its staff to spend some time working remotely and some time in the office.  That&#39;s despite its boss Jack Dorsey initially saying that employees could work from home &#34;forever&#34;.\n And Google rejigged its timetable for bringing people back to the workplace. As of 1 September, employees wishing to work from home for more than 14 days a year would have to apply to do so.\n But Apple employees have launched a campaign pushing back against boss Tim Cook&#39;s plans for a widespread return to the office, according to media reports earlier in June.\n It followed an all-staff memo in which the Apple chief executive said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September.\n   The key to coping with burnout is control, according to experts. &#34;Not everyone has the option of leaving their job but it&#39;s about doing what you can with the things you can control,&#34; says Siobhan Murray, author of &#39;The Burnout Solution&#39;.\n Cary Cooper, president of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and professor of organisational psychology and health at the University of Manchester, says it is &#34;important that individuals take control of their environment to manage the hours they work and ensure that they&#39;re socially connected.&#34; He advises:\n  But companies must play their part too, says Trades Union Congress health and safety officer, Shelly Asquith. Stress is an &#34;occupational hazard&#34; she says and it &#34;requires risk assessment and management to protect the wellbeing of staff&#34;.\n  Other companies, such as accountancy firm KPMG, have introduced new measures to combat the fatigue some workers might feel after more than a year of working in a less-than-ideal home set-up.\n Voice-only meetings, for example, are now required on Fridays to reduce the need for video calls.\n It is in stark contrast to comments made by KPMG&#39;s UK chairman, Bill Michael, in February when he told colleagues to &#34;stop moaning&#34; during a virtual meeting discussing the pandemic and possible cuts to their pay, bonuses and pensions.\n According to the Financial Times, Mr Michael also told employees to stop &#34;playing the victim card&#34;. Mr Michael has since apologised and resigned.\n  How has working during coronavirus affected you? Are you feeling burnt-out? Is your company doing anything to help?

", "note_en": "I\u2019ve worked with a number of clients on Elixir projects and I\u2019ve onboarded myself, I\u2019ve been onboarded and I\u2019ve onboarded others. And compared to my experiences with PHP/Python/Javascript and my limited experience with C#/.Net I have experienced quite a difference.\n Elixir projects tend to be very consistently laid out. Especially Phoenix-based web projects. The basic Phoenix generators provide a fair number of opinions on where things go. Even without that the general shape of an Elixir project is surprisingly stable.\n So across a few different clients I\u2019ve seen a number of Elixir projecs that have a few years on them and while there were variations such as not actually utilizing the module hierarchy and putting all of it in the widest possible namespace or overriding some common conventions, overall even the old projects were very reasonable to explore. They tend to flow from the mix.exs projects file and from there you can logically follow what parts of the system are started as you run the application. That will let you figure out what routes it exposes, what work it does in the background and much more. The Elixir supervision tree (inherited from Erlang) makes the shape of the application more clear to you as a developer.\n My first onboarding onto an Elixir project was a project that essentially predated Phoenix having a stable release and so it was built right on top of Cowboy and WebSockets. I was pretty familiar with Elixir already. The guy who introduced me to the system and product on the other hand, was doing some Elixir, but was primarily doing other work. I estimated some work for this client, around a 100 hours, for the initial engagement of adding some API endpoints to provide some new functionality for external parties. And then I built it. Knowing Elixir but with no experience of this particular system and without the strong conventions of Phoenix I successfully over-delivered with some added niceties at a couple of hours shy of the estimate. I like to think I\u2019m competent at what I do but I\u2019m not convinced I would have that turnaround on a similarly sized Python or PHP project. The compounding complexity tends to be much higher.\n Comparatively the same work in a PHP client\u2019s code base would likely have taken me around twice the time. Why? Mostly due to clarity. Elixir is a functional programming language with a very strong pragmatic streak. It makes it easy to write clear code, rather than clever code. Comparing two codebases is of course anecdotal but it lines up with all my experiences of dynamic OOP code bases vs Elixir code bases. The consequences of making changes are much clearer, the data you have access to and how it gets passed around is plain to see. It removes a lot of guess-work.\n Same Elixir code base, a number of months later I\u2019m the person who will onboard a new developer. He has been doing PHP for a long time, no Elixir experience. No real issues, he certainly spent some time delving in and picking up the syntax and concepts of the language. He is at the time of writing productively the main maintainer of the code base. I think we had two video pairing sessions to introduce the concepts and how the thing was set up. It really didn\u2019t take more.\n Another client, a significant fintech code base in Elixir. A few different services, some with Phoenix, some without. I was brought on, given help to get things set up and started. Due to the strong conventions around how Elixir and Phoenix is used that mostly entailed giving me credentials and answering some questions on specifics. I believe I had my first commit the same week. My first major contribution was probably the next week and then we were off to the races.\n So bringing on people that know Elixir tends to go well in my experience and I\u2019ve even had good luck bringing on an experienced PHP dev that didn\u2019t know Elixir. How about less experienced folks?\n I\u2019ve introduced at least three coding school students to Elixir during their internships or part time work with me. They typically knew some PHP, some Python and some Node.js at that point but hadn\u2019t really used any of them in anger. One is presently working professionally with a production Elixir application and another is currently working with me as an assistant developer and doing well using Elixir on client work.\n I haven\u2019t found much difficulty in teaching Elixir or training people into the language. There are some Functional Programming concepts to work through and some habits to break. Thankfully Elixir does not look or feel incredibly different from your typical OOP languages. Most of it will be familiar to any developer. It simply brings some very different powers to the table.\n One of the things I find makes onboarding easier is that you can effectively approach Elixir both bottom-up and top-down depending on what you are trying to do. If you want to get a foundational overview of what the application is and how it hangs together, look at the supervision tree, the dependencies and you can absorb the shape of the system. And the moment you need to implement a small change or add something, you can figure out the place where those things happen in the system and work there, in relative isolation and you don\u2019t have to know everything about the surrounding system to be productive. Immutability and no shared state makes your system easier to reason about in separate parts. And that means you need to know less to make useful changes.\n I\u2019ve picked up another client\u2019s Phoenix project without any guidance or real introduction to the code and been able to provide changes on the same day. Just by knowing my way around the conventions. Certainly this will vary by person and experience but it isn\u2019t just due to some stroke of brilliance on my part. Strong conventions and a clear language where code is easy to reason about.\n All in all, I\u2019ve found onboarding in Elixir to be ridiculously straight-forward compared to a lot of other projects and I think that\u2019s an important factor and I believe it says something about the long-term ease of development as well. A lot of Elixir developers tend to describe \u201cboring\u201d Elixir projects that just keep working and are easy to maintain.\n Boring is a rare and powerful property in software systems. Especially when they can achieve exciting outcomes such as near real-time, strong concurrency and parallelism with distributed computing just baked in. Nothing quite like it.\n  If you want to hear me (and others!) go on about Elixir in further detail I\u2019d suggest  BEAM Radio but if you\u2019d rather get more variety in topics I\u2019d suggest the  Regular Programming podcast or my  newsletter.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 21:49:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "onboarding,elixir", "title": "onboarding\u5230Elixir.
