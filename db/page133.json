", "note_en": "On May 17, the City Council of Mesa, Arizona, approved the  $800 million development of an enormous data center -- a warehouse filled with computers storing all of the photos, documents and other information we store \u201cin the cloud\u201d -- on an arid plot of land in the eastern part of the city.\n But keeping the rows of powerful computers inside the data center from overheating will require up to 1.25 million gallons of water each day, a price that Vice Mayor Jenn Duff believes is too high.\u201cThis has been the driest 12 months in 126 years,\u201d she said, citing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cWe are on red alert, and I think data centers are an irresponsible use of our water.\u201d\n   Duff was the only Mesa City Council member to vote against  the development. But she\u2019s one of a growing number of people nationwide raising concerns about the proliferation of data centers,  which guzzle electricity and water while creating relatively few jobs, particularly in drought-stricken parts of the United States.\n  The spike in use of data-intensive cloud services such as video conferencing tools, video streaming sites like Netflix and YouTube and online gaming, particularly as people quarantined during the pandemic, has increased demand for the computing power offered by data centers globally. And this means more data centers are being built every day by some of America\u2019s largest technology companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Google and used by millions of customers.  According to the Synergy Research Group, there were about 600 \u201chyperscale\u201d data centers, massive operations designed and operated by a single company that then rents access to cloud services, globally by the end of 2020. That\u2019s double the number there were in 2015. Almost 40 percent of them are in the United States, and  Amazon, Google and Microsoft account for more than half of the total.\n The U.S. also has at least 1,800 \u201ccolocation\u201d data centers, warehouses filled with a variety of smaller companies\u2019 server hardware that share the same cooling system, electricity and security, according to  Data Center Map. They are typically smaller than hyperscale data centers but,  research has shown, more resource intensive as they maintain a variety of computer systems operating at different levels of efficiency.\n Many data center operators are drawn to water-starved regions in the West, in part due to the availability of solar and wind energy. Researchers at Virginia Tech estimate that one-fifth of data centers draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds, mostly in the Western United States, according to a  paper published in April.\n  Typically, where data centers are located is based on proximity to customers and infrastructure, the cost of land, the tax incentives offered by local governments and access to low-cost electricity, the researchers said.\n \u201cI am not sure the degree to which environmental considerations are in the decision-making process,\u201d said Landon Marston, lead author of the paper.\n All centers need some form of cooling technology, typically either computer room air-conditioning systems -- essentially large units that cool air with water or refrigerant -- or evaporative cooling, which evaporates water to cool the air. Evaporative cooling uses a lot less electricity, but more water. Since water is cheaper than electricity, data centers tend to opt for the more water-intensive approach.\n The growth in the industry shows no signs of slowing. The research company Gartner predicts that spending on global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion this year, an increase of 6 percent from 2020, followed by 3-4 percent annually over the next three years. This growth comes at a time of record temperatures and drought in the United States,  particularly in the West.\n  \u201cThe typical data center uses about 3-5 million gallons of water per day -- the same amount of water as a city of 30,000-50,000 people,\u201d said Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University.\n  Although these data centers have become  much more energy and water efficient over the last decade, and don\u2019t use as much water as other industries such as agriculture, this level of water use can still create potential competition with local communities over the water supply in areas where water is scarce, he added.\n But some tech companies like Google say they are trying to address their water use.\n \u201cAs part of our water stewardship efforts, we\u2019re working to utilize water more efficiently and exploring ways to incorporate circularity,\u201d said Gary Demasi, senior director of energy and location operations at Google. \u201cWe have a site-specific approach where we work within the constraints of the local hydrological environment to find the best solutions.\u201d\n He added that \u201cmany arid environments provide an abundant supply of carbon-free solar and wind energy,\u201d which explains why data centers are drawn to those areas.\n  Sergio Loureiro, vice president of core operations for Microsoft, said that the company  has pledged to be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030, which means it plans to replenish more water than it consumes globally. This includes reducing the company\u2019s water use and investing in community replenishment and conservation projects near where it builds facilities.\n    In recent years,  tensions over water use by data centers have flared in communities across the United States. In 2017, conservation groups in South Carolina  criticized Google over its request for a permit to draw 1.5 millions of gallons of water per day from a depleted aquifer to cool its expanding data center in Goose Creek. The facility already required 4 million gallons of tap water each day, and residents and conservation groups were concerned about the company\u2019s  impact on the dwindling groundwater supply. After a two-year battle with the South Carolina Coastal Conservation league over the plans, Google reached an agreement to use only groundwater under limited conditions, for example, during maintenance work or as a backup during drier months, and instead pay for an alternative source of surface water from the Charleston Water System.\n  Google spokeswoman Mara Harris said that the company partnered with local community stakeholders and water conservation experts to assess the data center\u2019s impact and conducted studies that showed that even in an \u201cextreme worst-case scenario\u201d the data center\u2019s water use in the area would be sustainable.\n Both companies and consumers need to start treating water conservation as seriously as reducing carbon emissions, experts say.\n   \u201cWe are going to experience a drier and more water-scare future, and every drop of water counts,\u201d said Newsha Ajami, director of urban water policy at Stanford\u2019s Woods Institute for the Environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not just Amazon, Microsoft and Google causing these water footprints. But it\u2019s you and me, searching and needing data that ends up in these data centers.\u201d\n Ajami said that water has been historically undervalued as a resource in part because it has been cheap for companies to purchase. While many industries have taken great leaps in reducing their electricity use and carbon footprints, they lag behind in water efficiency throughout their supply chains, she said.\n  \u201cWe often overlook the communities impacted, who are often disadvantaged,\u201d she added. \u201cIf it was a wealthy community, maybe they wouldn\u2019t allow the data centers to be built in their backyard.\u201d\n   Water conservation experts say that a key challenge has been the lack of alignment between cities\u2019 economic development plans and their resource conservation efforts. Often the promise of attracting a household-name technology company to build a billion-dollar data center that will bring jobs and investment to the region will override concerns over the water supply.\n  \u201cCities don\u2019t want to tell tech companies that they can\u2019t come to their city because of lack of water,\u201d said Cora Kammeyer, a senior researcher with the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on water conservation.\n   \u201cWhen it comes to economic development, I don\u2019t think we are fully transparent about the water concerns,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to keep the image that we are a great place to invest and start a business. But we don\u2019t like to talk about the water.\u201d The Mesa project approved on May 17, which was submitted under the name of a developer called Redale LLC, has been shrouded in secrecy. The name of the company that will run the data center has only been supplied to the city under a nondisclosure agreement, although one Mesa city source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the deal and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said it was Facebook. The specialist news site  Data Center Dynamics also reported that it was likely to be Facebook based on similarities in the planning specifications to its other data centers. Facebook declined to comment, and Redale did not respond to a request for comment. The proposed data center will employ an estimated 150 people across three buildings and pay the city millions of dollars in sales tax on the construction and utilities.\n Duff added that even though data centers don\u2019t use as much water as other industries, they are \u201cstill depleting water in the desert, and that is a concern.\u201d\n She noted that this is the \u201ceighth or ninth\u201d data center project in Mesa. The city previously approved a Google facility, currently under construction, that will consume up to 4 million gallons of water per day,  as reported by Bloomberg. The Redale project represents a significant milestone to Mesa\u2019s water supply as it\u2019s the first where the city required the developer to obtain water credits from the Salt River Project to use groundwater in the event that the city can\u2019t meet the data center\u2019s demand for water.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we could say we had enough water for the business,\u201d Duff said.\n  Surface water supplies that Arizona uses from Lake Mead, America\u2019s largest reservoir, and the Colorado River that feeds it, have already  dwindled to their lowest levels ever, according to the Bureau of Reclamation, a federal water management agency. The water level is so low that federal restrictions are likely to be triggered on Arizona\u2019s water allocation from the reservoir, which could happen at the start of 2022. S ix other states in the West could also face such restrictions.\n As that happens, Duff said, more companies will start to draw on their \u201cwater credits\u201d to use groundwater supplies. However,  according to research by Arizona State University, these water credits are over allocated, meaning that if everybody started using them at the same time, there wouldn\u2019t be enough water to go around.\n \u201cWe are very resourceful, but I think we need to wake up,\u201d Duff said. \u201cThe analysis shows our safeguards aren\u2019t there and we need to come up with a concrete plan instead of a hope and a prayer.\u201d\n   To the south of Mesa, the city of Chandler, Arizona, has taken a different approach. In 2015 the city passed an ordinance that restricted new water-intensive businesses from developing unless they aligned with the city\u2019s plan for economic development. It effectively deters businesses that use a lot of water but don\u2019t create many jobs, including data centers, in favor of those that create thousands of jobs,  such as semiconductor plants.\n  The city\u2019s water resource manager, Gregg Capps, said the ordinance, the first of its kind in the U.S., was introduced as a direct result of discovering in 2013 how much water one of the data centers in the city was using after the company started requesting additional water connections. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know a whole lot about them back then, but that brought our attention to their water use,\u201d he said.\n His team took their concerns to the City Council, which spent months developing the ordinance. Since it was adopted in 2015, there have been no new data center developments in Chandler.\n \u201cWater is a strategic resource. It\u2019s important to us,\u201d Capps said.\n   The Silicon Valley technology companies that dominate the hyperscale data center market -- Amazon, Google and Microsoft -- are conscious of the business and reputational risk associated with data centers\u2019 thirst. All of them have made some progress in reducing their data centers\u2019 water footprint through innovative cooling strategies. These include free-air cooling, which uses fresh outdoor air to cool a space, and immersion cooling, where servers are submerged in a liquid that boils at a lower temperature than water, taking the heat with it. However, free-air cooling only really works in cooler climates, and immersion was just used  for the first time in a commercial setting by Microsoft in April.\n  Some companies,  including Microsoft have developed underwater or partially submerged data centers that rely on large bodies of already cool water to disperse heat.\n Google\u2019s Demasi said that the company cooled its data centers using seawater in Finland, industrial canal water in Belgium and recycled wastewater in the United States, at its site in Douglas County, Georgia.\n  Switching over to new technologies can be extremely costly, and data center operators are more likely to wait until the end of the lifecycle of the existing equipment than retrofit cooling systems, said Todd Boucher, founder of the data center design firm Leading Edge Design Group.\n   In Mesa, Duff is thinking about the legacy of the decisions her city, and others, are making about water now. \u201cI am 61 years old, and I know that in whatever lifetime I have left I will not see the total impact of what we are doing today,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our children and their children will, and we have to take responsibility for that.\u201d\u201cI hope the next generation does not look back at ours and say, \u2018What were you thinking?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to think we saw the warnings and started taking aggressive measures in order to preserve our planet and our lives.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:59:19", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "Babis Anagnostopoulos had claimed robbers killed Caroline Crouch, 20, who was found dead next to her baby\n    Greeks have been left reeling after the husband of a British-born student confessed and was charged with her murder, a crime he had previously blamed on a robbery.\n In a dramatic twist to a case that has gripped the country since Caroline Crouch was strangled next to her baby daughter, investigators announced late on Thursday that Babis Anagnostopoulos had admitted to the murder.\n  \u201cThe culprit is her 33-year-old husband who has confessed to the act,\u201d the Greek police tweeted.\n Anagnostopoulos, who appeared in court on Friday handcuffed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was charged with intentional homicide and abuse of an animal, after the family dog was also found killed. Crouch, who had met the man she would go on to marry as a teenager on the Greek island of Alonissos where her parents have long lived, was 20.\n Initially the helicopter pilot had blamed his wife\u2019s death on ruthless \u201cforeign\u201d robbers who had broken into the couple\u2019s suburban Athens home, a version of events he had maintained for more than five weeks. He claimed he had been blindfolded and tied to a bed, drifting in and out of consciousness as he watched the crime unfold.\n \u201cEverything was staged for the crime scene to look like the scene of a robbery,\u201d Costas Hassiotis, the director of the greater Athens homicide division, told reporters, adding that the suspect had tied his own hands and those of his dead wife.\n Speaking outside court, Vassilis Spyrou, Anagnostopoulos\u2019s lawyer, confirmed that his client had confessed to the crime, adding that he had expressed remorse for his actions.\n \u201cHe\u2019s in a very bad psychological state,\u201d Spyrou had earlier told Alpha TV. \u201cHe knows what he has done, he has admitted to the crime.\u201d\n Nikos Rigas, the deputy chairman of the police officers\u2019 association of Athens, told state TV that examination of mobile devices, a smartwatch, and cameras had established a timeline that revealed inconsistencies in the pilot\u2019s account.\n \u201c(The suspect) tried to create a crime scene environment that looked convincing: the dog was killed, and his baby was placed next to the body of the murdered mother,\u201d Rigas said.\n Anagnostopoulos, who was in Alonissos attending a memorial service for Crouch at which he was photographed hugging the victim\u2019s mother, was arrested after being flown to the Greek capital on a police helicopter on Thursday. When police initially picked him up he was told a suspect had been identified, but not that it was him.\n It was not the first time he had been called to the police headquarters to give testimony. But this time the police had evidence \u2013 in the form of data gleaned from Caroline\u2019s smartwatch and the pilot\u2019s mobile phone \u2013 that Anagnostopoulos had killed his wife. A pulse monitor on the watch showed she was dead at a time before he claimed the raid had taken place, while a fitness app on his phone proved he was moving around the house at the time he said he had been blindfolded and tied up.\n In both cases, the findings conflicted with the timeline of events the professional pilot had previously given. A memory card removed at 1.20am from the security camera of the couple\u2019s home, several hours before 4.30am when he claimed the thieves had broken in, provided further evidence.\n Presented with the new data, Anagnostopoulos admitted to the murder, telling the detectives their relationship had grown increasingly stormy and he had killed Crouch in a fit of rage after she had threatened to leave him, police said.\n \u201cI had to appear persuasive and so I strangled the dog too,\u201d he was reported as saying in extracts of testimony released by police to the Greek media.\n  Few crimes in living memory have outraged Greeks so deeply and for 37 days the pilot had appeared distraught, telling police he had \u201cbegged for their lives\u201d as the thieves pointed a pistol at Lydia, his daughter\u2019s temple, and telling the press he hoped no family had to experience the same ordeal. \u201cThey were so happy, so in love,\u201d Alonissos\u2019 mayor Petros Vafinis told the Guardian at the time. \u201cThe shock in our little community is immense.\u201d\n  Athens\u2019 citizens protection minister, Michalis Chrysohoidis, said within hours of the 11 May murder being made public: \u201cWe rarely encounter such brutality in Greece, both in Greek society and in crime.\u201d\n In a rare step, the government declared a \u20ac300,000 reward for information that might lead to the capture of the culprits.\n Images of Anagnostopoulos attending his wife\u2019s funeral cradling their 11-month-old baby resonated far and wide.\n So, too, did his heartrending eulogy given by Caroline\u2019s graveside. \u201cI am lucky that I met you, very lucky that you loved me and even more lucky that you are the mother of my child,\u201d he had said. \u201cLydia will grow up not remembering her wonderful mother, but Caroline who was the joy of life will always be near me, through Lydia.\u201d\n His confession was quick to elicit rage. Overnight Greeks flooded social media with messages of condemnation and calls for justice, while the mainstream media expressed shock not only at the hypocrisy of \u201cthis accomplished actor\u201d but the willingness of so many, including senior Greek justice officials, to go along with his story that hardened \u201cAlbanian and Georgian\u201d criminals were to blame for the murder.\n \u201cThe pandemic of sympathy for the professional, respected father who, tied up, saw his young wife being murdered in front of his child has collapsed like a tower of cards,\u201d the leftwing newspaper Efsyn wrote in an editorial. \u201cAlong with it the far-right propaganda about foreign thieves committing heinous crimes has collapsed too.\u201d\n On Friday, the case was being likened to that of Oscar Pistorius, the South African sprinter who was convicted in 2015 of fatally shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in his Pretoria home.\n \u201cWe have experienced the Greek version of the Pistorius case, it has almost the same characteristics,\u201d Giorgos Kalliakmanis, who heads the union of police employees in west Attica told state-run TV.\n From the outset, he said, investigators had suspected the pilot but were flummoxed by the lack of DNA, or other evidence, that pointed to his culpability.\n \u201cThe Pistorius crime shocked people across the world. And this crime has caused ripples beyond the Greek borders,\u201d he said, adding that investigators had followed a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d approach to ensure they would obtain the proof that would allow them to ensnare the perpetrator.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:53:12", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u624b\u673a,\u667a\u80fd,lies,\u544a\u8bc9", "title": "\u5982\u4f55\u7531\u4ed6\u7684\u624b\u673a\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u8868\u66b4\u9732\u51f6\u624b\u7684\u8c0e\u8a00 ", "title_en": "How a Murderer's Lies Were Exposed by His Cellphone and a Smartwatch", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jun/17/greek-husband-confesses-to-of-british-woman", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u624b\u673a", "\u667a\u80fd", "lies", "\u544a\u8bc9"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "51ccc39be54934eba67eff9d55cfe0b6.png", "infoid": 1066936, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Phabricator\u662f\u4e00\u7ec4\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002 \u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u5e93\u6258\u7ba1\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002  GitHub\u662f\u8d85\u8fc76500\u4e07\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5851\u9020\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u57fa\u672c\u7684\u7ef4\u57fa\u514b\u9686\u5982\u6b64\u6f02\u4eae\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f60\u4f1a\u60f3\u77e5\u9053\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ef4\u57fa\u3002  \u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9\u5b83\u6bcf\u5929\u8c08\u8bdd\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u95f2\u901b\u3002  \u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u96c6\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002 \u4e3a\u56e2\u961f\u5408\u4f5c\uff0cDEVOPS\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5236\u4f5c\u3002  Microsoft\u56e2\u961f\u662fMicrosoft 365\u4e2d\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u96c6\u7ebf\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u56e2\u961f\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002  Gitter\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u804a\u5929\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u53d1\u73b0\u6765\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6210\u957f\u548c\u8fde\u63a5\u793e\u533a\u3002 \nTutanota\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6700\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u79c1\u5bc6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002  \u5c06\u516c\u5171Web\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u514d\u8d39\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002  Outlook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\u7ba1\u7406\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u8ba9\u60a8\u7ba1\u7406\u60a8\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e5\u5386\uff0c\u8054\u7cfb\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002  LucidChart\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u56fe\u793a\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f7f\u56e2\u961f\u805a\u96c6\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u51b3\u7b56\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u672a\u6765\u3002  \u4eceJira\uff0cBitbucket\uff0cSonarqube\u6536\u96c6\u654f\u6377\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u53d1\u9001\u5230\u5f39\u6027\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5728Kibana\u4e2d\u53ef\u89c6\u5316  CLI\u5de5\u5177\u4eceJIRA\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u672c\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fe\u8868\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff06amp;

Consequently, it has become important to pay attentionto these footprint metrics of a model as well, not just its quality. We presentand motivate the problem of efficiency in deep learning, followed by a thoroughsurvey of the five core areas of model efficiency (spanning modelingtechniques, infrastructure, and hardware) and the seminal work there. We alsopresent an experiment-based guide along with code, for practitioners tooptimize their model training and deployment. We believe this is the firstcomprehensive survey in the efficient deep learning space that covers thelandscape of model efficiency from modeling techniques to hardware support. Ourhope is that this survey would provide the reader with the mental model and thenecessary understanding of the field to apply generic efficiency techniques toimmediately get significant improvements, and also equip them with ideas forfurther research and experimentation to achieve additional gains.", "posttime": "2021-06-20 03:52:08", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com",

"note_en": "It took the programming community a couple of decades to appreciate Python. But since the early 2010\u2019s, it has been booming \u2014 and eventually surpassing C, C#, Java and JavaScript in popularity.\n But until when will that trend continue? When will Python eventually be replaced by other languages, and why?\n Putting an exact expiry date on Python would be so much speculation, it might as well pass as Science-Fiction. Instead, I will assess the virtues that are boosting Python\u2019s popularity right now, and the weak points that will break it in the future.\n   Python\u2019s success is reflected in the  Stack Overflow trends, which measure the count of tags in posts on the platform. Given the size of StackOverflow, this is quite a good indicator for language popularity.\n  While R has been plateauing over the last few years, and many other languages are on a steady decline, Python\u2019s growth seems unstoppable. Almost 14% of all StackOverflow questions are tagged \u201cpython\u201d, and the trend is going up. And there are several reasons for that.\n  Python has been around since the nineties. That doesn\u2019t only mean that it has had plenty of time to grow. It has also acquired a large and supportive community.\n So if you have any issue while you\u2019re coding in Python, the odds are high that you\u2019ll be able to solve it with a single Google search. Simply because somebody will have already encountered your problem and written something helpful about it.\n  It\u2019s not only the fact that it has been around for decades, giving programmers the time to make brilliant tutorials. More than that, the syntax of Python is very human-readable.\n For starters, there\u2019s no need to specify the data type. You just declare a variable; Python will understand from the context whether it\u2019s an integer, a float value, a boolean or something else. This is a huge edge for beginners. If you\u2019ve ever had to program in C++, you know how frustrating it is your program won\u2019t compile because you swapped a float for an integer.\n And if you\u2019ve ever had to read Python and C++ code side-by-side, you\u2019ll know how understandable Python is. Even though C++ was designed with English in mind, it\u2019s a rather bumpy read compared to Python code.\n  Since Python has been around for so long, developers have made a package for every purpose. These days, you can find a package for almost everything.\n Want to crunch numbers, vectors and matrices? NumPy is your guy. Want to do calculations for tech and engineering? Use SciPy. Want to go big in data manipulation and analysis? Give Pandas a go. Want to start out with Artificial Intelligence? Why not use Scikit-Learn.\n Whichever computational task you\u2019re trying to manage, chances are that there is a Python package for it out there. This makes Python stay on top of recent developments, can be seen from the surge in Machine Learning over the past few years.\n  Based on the previous elaborations, you could imagine that Python will stay on top of sh*t for ages to come. But like every technology, Python has its weaknesses. I will go through the most important flaws, one by one, and assess whether these are fatal or not.\n  Python is slow. Like, really slow. On average, you\u2019ll need about 2\u201310 times longer to complete a task with Python than with any other language.\n There are  various reasons for that. One of them is that it\u2019s dynamically typed \u2014 remember that you don\u2019t need to specify data types like in other languages. This means that a lot of memory needs to be used, because the program needs to reserve enough space for each variable that it works in any case. And lots of memory usage translates to lots of computing time.\n Another reason is that Python can only execute one task at a time. This is a consequence of flexible datatypes \u2014 Python needs to make sure each variable has only one datatype, and parallel processes could mess that up.\n In comparison, your average web browser can run a dozen different threads at once. And there are some other theories around, too.\n But at the end of the day, none of the speed issues matter. Computers and servers have gotten so cheap that we\u2019re talking about fractions of seconds. And the end user doesn\u2019t really care whether their app loads in 0.001 or 0.01 seconds.\n  Originally, Python was dynamically scoped. This basically means that, to evaluate an expression, a compiler first searches the current block and then successively all the calling functions.\n The problem with dynamic scoping is that every expression needs to be tested in every possible context \u2014 which is tedious. That\u2019s why most modern programming languages use static scoping.\n Python tried to transition to static scoping, but messed it up. Usually, inner scopes \u2014 for example functions within functions \u2014 would be able to see and change outer scopes. In Python, inner scopes can only see outer scopes, but not change them. This leads to a lot of confusion.\n  Despite all of the flexibility within Python, the usage of Lambdas is rather restrictive. Lambdas can only be expressions in Python, and not be statements.\n On the other hand, variable declarations and statements are always statements. This means that Lambdas cannot be used for them.\n This distinction between expressions and statements is rather arbitrary, and doesn\u2019t occur in other languages.\n   In Python, you use whitespaces and indentations to indicate different levels of code. This makes it optically appealing and intuitive to understand.\n Other languages, for example C++, rely more on braces and semicolons. While this might not be visually appealing and beginner-friendly, it makes the code a lot more maintainable. For bigger projects, this is a lot more useful.\n Newer languages like Haskell solve this problem: They rely on whitespaces, but offer an alternative syntax for those who wish to go without.\n  As we\u2019re witnessing the shift from desktop to smartphone, it\u2019s clear that we need robust languages to build mobile software.\n But not many mobile apps are being developed with Python. That doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be done \u2014 there is a Python package called Kivy for this purpose.\n But Python wasn\u2019t made with mobile in mind. So even though it might produce passable results for basic tasks, your best bet is to use a language that was created for mobile app development. Some widely used programming frameworks for mobile include React Native, Flutter, Iconic, and Cordova.\n To be clear, laptops and desktop computers should be around for many years to come. But since mobile has long surpassed desktop traffic, it\u2019s safe to say that learning Python is not enough to become a seasoned all-round developer.\n  A Python script isn\u2019t compiled first and then executed. Instead, it compiles every time you execute it, so any coding error manifests itself at runtime. This leads to poor performance, time consumption, and the need for a lot of tests. Like, a lot of tests.\n This is great for beginners since testing teaches them a lot. But for seasoned developers, having to debug a complex program in Python makes them go awry. This lack of performance is the biggest factor that sets a timestamp on Python.\n   Rust offers the same kind of safety that Python has \u2014 no variable can accidentally be overwritten. But it solves the performance issue with the concept of ownership and borrowing. It is also the most-loved programming language of the last few years, according to  StackOverflow Insights.\n Go is great for beginners like Python. And it is so simple that it\u2019s even easier to maintain the code. Fun point: Go developers are among the  highest-paid programmers on the market.\n Julia is a very new language that competes head-on with Python. It fills the gap of large-scale technical computations: Usually, one would have used Python or Matlab, and patched the whole thing up with C++ libraries, which are necessary at a large scale. Now, one can use Julia instead of juggling with two languages.\n While there are other languages on the market, Rust, Go, and Julia are the ones that fix weak patches of Python. All of these languages excel in yet-to-come technologies, most notably in Artificial Intelligence. While their market share is still small, as reflected in the number of StackOverflow tags, the trend for all of them is clear: upwards.\n  Given the ubiquitous popularity of Python at the moment, it will surely take half a decade, maybe even a whole, for any of these new languages to replace it.\n Which of the languages it will be \u2014 Rust, Go, Julia, or a new language of the future \u2014 is hard to say at this point. But given the performance issues that are fundamental in the architecture of Python, one will inevitably take its spot.\n This article was written by \u00a0 Rhea Moutafis\u00a0and was originally published on \u00a0 Towards Data Science.
