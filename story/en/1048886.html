But, I think often companies like Commodore, and Atari, and Tandy don’t get nearly enough credit for the role that they played.  Let’s take a look at the Commodore PET!</p><p>当您观看关于早期计算机创新的纪录片，特别是70年代末，20世纪80年代初，大多数纪录都倾向于专注于Apple和Microsoft，也许是IBM作为大型创新者。但是，我觉得通常像商品一样的公司和Atari，而且Tandy并没有获得足够的信誉，以获得他们所扮演的角色。让我们来看看Commodore Pet！</p><p> Most of my readers are familiar with the Commodore 64, one of the best selling computers of all time. Well renowned for its great graphics and sound, but Commodore history didn’t start with this machine. So, let’s go back a little bit to the late 1970s and figure out where it all started!</p><p> 我的大多数读者都熟悉Commodore 64，所有时间最好的销售电脑之一。众所周知的是它的伟大的图形和声音，但是Commodore历史并没有从这台机器开始。所以，让我们回到20世纪70年代后期，并弄清楚全部开始的地方！</p><p>    It all began in 1974 when Chuck Peddle and a group of engineers started up a chip fabrication company called MOS Technology. Most of these guys had worked at Motorola on the 6800 processor, and so they set out to develop a compatible CPU known as the 6501 that could simply be substituted for the much more expensive Motorola CPU. As you might imagine, Motorola sued and to make a long story short, the 6502 was born, which was pretty much the same chip but changed just enough that it was no longer completely compatible with the 6800.</p><p>    这一切都始于1974年，当夹头贩车和一群工程师开始叫做MOS技术的芯片制造公司。这些家伙中的大多数人在6800个处理器上曾在摩托罗拉工作，因此他们旨在开发一个称为6501的兼容CPU，可以简单地代替更昂贵的摩托罗拉CPU。正如您可能想象的那样，摩托罗拉起诉并缩短了长话，6502出生，这几乎是相同的芯片，而是足够改变，它不再与6800完全兼容。</p><p>  Since the chip was no longer compatible with the 6800, customers would need some way to test the chip. In 1976 Chuck Peddle also designed the KIM-1 development computer. This was a single board computer that used the 6502, and could be programmed in machine language from the keypad on the top. However, later it was possible to connect a dumb-terminal display and actually run BASIC. Programs could be saved to a cassette tape. The computer proved to be popular with hobbyists as well as engineers.</p><p>  由于芯片不再与6800兼容，因此客户需要某种方式来测试芯片。 1976年，Chuck Paddle还设计了Kim-1开发计算机。这是一个使用6502的单板计算机，可以从顶部的键盘上以机器语言编程。但是，稍后可以连接愚蠢的终端显示并实际运行基本。程序可以保存到盒式磁带上。计算机被证明是与合人作主和工程师一起受欢迎。</p><p> The 6502 would go on to be a huge success and eventually found its way into the Apple II series, the Atari 2600, the Nintendo Entertainment System, the entire line of Atari 8-Bit computers, the BBC Micro, and of course the entire line of Commodore 8-Bit machines. But back to 1976 for the moment. MOS Technologies was bought up by Commodore Business Machines, who at this point was primarily in the calculator business. Chuck Peddle managed to convince Commodore boss Jack Tramiel that calculators were a dead-end business and that they needed to produce a computer to compete with the upcoming Apple II.</p><p> 6502将继续取得巨大的成功，最终发现了它进入Apple II系列，Atari 2600，任天堂娱乐系统，Atari 8位计算机，BBC Micro，当然是整个线路商品8位机器。但又回到了1976年。 MOS技术由Commodore Business Machines购买，此时此线主要在计算器业务中。 Chuck Peddle设法说服Commodore Boss Jack Tramiel，计算器是一个死锁的业务，并且他们需要生产计算机以与即将到来的Apple II竞争。</p><p>  In 1977 the Commodore PET 2001 was born, using much of the same design as the KIM-1. Much like the Apple II, the PET was all inclusive, having an integrated monitor, keyboard, and cassette tape storage device. 1977 was a big year for the personal computer revolution. With the market introduction of the big 3, the Apple II, Commodore PET, and TRS-80 computer, it was the first time that a regular person could buy an affordable computer without having to assemble it themselves.</p><p>  1977年，商品宠物2001年出生，使用与Kim-1相同的设计。与Apple II一样，宠物全包，具有集成的监视器，键盘和盒式磁带存储装置。 1977年是个人计算机革命的一个重要年份。随着市场推出的大3，Apple II，Commodore Pet和TRS-80计算机，这是第一次普通人可以购买实惠的计算机，而无需组装它。</p><p>  The cool thing about the PET is that it was actually designed by the same guy who designed the 6502 processor. If you look at the prices of the big 3, you’ll see the PET was competitively priced. Although the Apple II did have superior hardware, which we’ll get into shortly, the PET did have the advantage that it came with a monitor and tape drive, where the Apple II required those as separate purchases.</p><p>  关于宠物的很酷的是，它实际上是由设计6502处理器的同一个人设计的。如果你看出大3的价格，你会看到宠物竞争力地定价。虽然Apple II确实有优越的硬件，我们将很快进入，但宠物确实具有带有监视器和磁带驱动器的优势，苹果II需要那些单独购买。 </p><p>  Let’s take a closer look at the design of the Commodore PET. The first thing I want to draw your attention to is the keyboard. It’s insane, and it will drive you insane if you actually try to type on it. One thing that isn’t communicated well by video and pictures is just how small this keyboard is. The main part, excluding the number pad measures just 6in. by 2.75in. Just to put that into perspective, my iPhone 6 will essentially cover the entire keyboard. The Apple mini keyboard is actually huge by comparison.</p><p>让我们仔细看看Commodore PET的设计。我想引起您注意的第一件事是键盘。这太疯狂了，如果您实际尝试在其上打字，它将使您发疯。视频和图片无法很好地传达一件事，就是该键盘太小。主要部分（不包括数字键盘）仅为6英寸。 2.75英寸只是为了说明这一点，我的iPhone 6实际上将覆盖整个键盘。相比之下，Apple mini键盘实际上很大。</p><p>  The keyboard size isn’t the only problem. They layout is crazy. While the keys are technically in a QWERTY arrangement, normally the rows are offset creating diagonal lines. Not so on the PET. They are squared up. The weirdness doesn’t end there. The space bar is tiny! Normally you would expect numbers across the top row of keys, but there aren’t any. Instead you have just symbols. If you want to type a number, you have to use the number pad.</p><p>  键盘大小不是唯一的问题。他们的布局太疯狂了。尽管键在技术上处于QWERTY排列中，但通常行会偏移以创建对角线。 PET则不是。他们摆平了。怪异不止于此。空格键很小！通常情况下，您会期望键的第一行有数字，但是没有数字。相反，您只有符号。如果要输入数字，则必须使用数字键盘。</p><p>  What is even more infuriating is the symbols. For example, if I want to type a Dollar sign or a number sign, I would instinctively press shift before the key. However, when I do that I wind up with a totally different character instead of the one I wanted. Then there’s the cursor keys. Notice that there are only 2 of them. One key cursors down, and the other key cursors right. If you want to reverse that, you have to hold down the shift key. So by using the combination of the cursor keys and shift you can cursor anywhere on the screen.  The little back arrow? You might think that’s a backspace key. But, it’s not. It actually prints that character on the screen, and so when you make a mistake, and believe me you will, you’re going to go to push this key and it’s not going to fix your mistake and you’re going to go even more insane than you were before. The actual delete key is all the way over at the other side of the number pad.</p><p>  更令人气愤的是这些符号。例如，如果要输入美元符号或数字符号，则本能地在键之前按Shift。但是，当我这样做时，我得到的角色却完全不同于我想要的角色。然后是光标键。请注意，其中只有2个。一个键向下移动，另一个键向右移动。如果要撤消该操作，则必须按住Shift键。因此，通过使用光标键和Shift键的组合，您可以在屏幕上的任意位置光标。小后退箭头？您可能会认为这是一个退格键。但是，不是。它实际上会在屏幕上打印该字符，所以当您犯了一个错误并相信我会的时，您将按此键，它将无法解决您的错误，并且您将走得更远比以前更疯狂。实际的删除键一直位于数字键盘的另一侧。</p><p> To be fair, when this computer came out in 1977, most of the customers had never even used a personal computer before or a computer of any kind and so they didn’t have any pre-conceptions for what a keyboard layout should be – like we do today. It probably wasn’t quite as weird for them as it would be for us.</p><p> 公平地讲，当这台计算机于1977年问世时，大多数客户甚至从未使用过个人计算机或任何类型的计算机，因此他们对键盘布局应该没有任何先入之见，例如我们今天做。对于他们来说，这可能不像对我们那样奇怪。</p><p>  Let’s take a look inside the PET, it opens like the cab of a semi truck, and even gives you a little kick stand to hold it open. Looking at these 16 RAM chips, you might think the PET came with a lot of RAM. But, you’d be wrong. The original PET only came with 4K of RAM. These are 1K by 4-bit static RAM chips. Being that cost was such a consideration for this computer, you might be wondering why they didn’t use the cheaper dynamic RAM, or DRAM? Well, static ram was and still is today much more expensive than dynamic RAM. However, DRAM has one drawback, it requires that it is refreshed every so often, which requires additional circuitry to handle that. When you’re dealing with only 4K, it actually ended up being cheaper just to use static RAM.</p><p>  让我们看一下PET的内部，它像半卡车的驾驶室一样打开，甚至还提供了一个小脚踢支架以将其保持打开状态。查看这16个RAM芯片，您可能会认为PET带有很多RAM。但是，你会错的。原始的PET仅带有4K RAM。这些是1K x 4位静态RAM芯片。出于成本考虑，这台计算机就是如此，您可能想知道为什么他们不使用便宜的动态RAM或DRAM？好吧，静态ram过去比现在更昂贵。但是，DRAM有一个缺点，它需要经常刷新一次，这需要额外的电路来处理。当您只处理4K时，实际上仅使用静态RAM就会便宜。</p><p>  OK. So 4K is a ridiculously small amount or RAM, but it’s worse than that because the operating system actually needs at least 1K of that, leaving about 3K left over for the user. So how much is 3K of RAM? Well, the screen on the pet is 40-characters by 25-lines, meaning you need 1,000 bytes of RAM, or almost an entire kilobyte just to store one screen full of text. Essentially you had enough RAM for about 3 screens of text! To be fair though, the Apple II and TRS-80 only had 4K when they came out as well.</p><p>  好的。因此4K的数量或RAM少得可笑，但比这更糟，因为操作系统实际上至少需要1K的空间，剩下大约3K留给用户。那么3K的RAM是多少？好吧，宠物上的屏幕是40个字符乘25行，这意味着您需要1,000字节的RAM，或者几乎一个整字节就只需要存储一个充满文本的屏幕。本质上，您有足够的RAM来存储大约3个屏幕的文本！公平地说，Apple II和TRS-80上市时也只有4K。</p><p>  This particular PET has been upgraded a little daughter board. It’s an aftermarket 32K RAM expansion module, and that’s why it shows 31K available to BASIC on the boot screen. Let’s take a closer look at this cassette drive. This was actually just an off-the-shelf cassette recorder that Commodore bought and slightly modified. You can see the whole unit is actually mounted, in a rather clunky way in my opinion. The cassette drive was really the only storage device available for the PET at first. And with 4K of RAM, this wasn’t much of a problem.</p><p>  这个特殊的PET已经升级了一个小子板。这是一个售后市场的32K RAM扩展模块，这就是为什么它在启动屏幕上显示BASIC可用的31K的原因。让我们仔细看看这个盒式磁带驱动器。这实际上只是Commodore购买并稍加修改的现成的盒式录音机。在我看来，您可以看到整个单元实际上已经安装好了。最初，盒式磁带驱动器实际上是唯一可用于PET的存储设备。有了4K RAM，这并不是什么大问题。 </p><p>  It wasn’t until 1979 that Commodore came out with a matching disk drive. Since the PET was never really designed to use a disk drive, they decided to use the IEEE-488 parallel port as a means to connect the disk drive.  Unlike the Apple II, the Commodore PET has no card slots inside so there’s nowhere to add a floppy disk controller card. So, what they had to do was essentially design an entire computer inside the floppy drive unit, which would handle controlling the floppy drives as well as an entire disk operating system.</p><p>直到1979年，Commodore才推出了匹配的磁盘驱动器。由于从未真正将PET设计为使用磁盘驱动器，因此他们决定使用IEEE-488并行端口作为连接磁盘驱动器的方法。与Apple II不同，Commodore PET的内部没有卡槽，因此无处可添加软盘控制器卡。因此，他们要做的实际上是在软盘驱动器单元内设计一台整个计算机，该计算机将处理对软盘驱动器以及整个磁盘操作系统的控制。</p><p>  Indeed if you take a look inside the disk drive, you’ll see it’s quite sophisticated, having it’s own 6502 processor, RAM, ROM, and I/O controllers. The PET didn’t really interact with information on the disks directly, rather it would send commands to the disk drive, such as telling it to fetch a file, and then the disk drive would take care of all of the work of finding the right data on the disk. In fact, it could even copy files or even entire disks from one drive to the other all by itself, just with a single command.</p><p>  确实，如果您看一下磁盘驱动器内部，就会发现它非常复杂，它拥有自己的6502处理器，RAM，ROM和I / O控制器。 PET并没有真正直接与磁盘上的信息进行交互，而是会向磁盘驱动器发送命令，例如告诉它获取文件，然后磁盘驱动器将负责寻找正确磁盘的所有工作。磁盘上的数据。实际上，它甚至可以通过一个命令将文件甚至整个磁盘从一个驱动器复制到另一个驱动器。</p><p> The PET was popular with schools and found its way into many computer labs. And while the disk drive was expensive, one of these floppy drive units could actually be connected to multiple PETs at the same time, thus saving space and money. In fact, you can see this arrangement being used in this photo from a computer lab where each table has 8 PETs connected to a single floppy drive and printer.</p><p> PET在学校很受欢迎，并进入了许多计算机实验室。尽管磁盘驱动器很昂贵，但是这些软驱驱动器之一实际上可以同时连接到多个PET，从而节省了空间和金钱。实际上，您可以在计算机实验室的这张照片中看到这种安排，其中每个表都有8个PET连接到单个软盘驱动器和打印机。</p><p>   Let’s talk about the screen on the PET. The original model here is black and white. A lot of people assume it’s green, but that actually wasn’t until later models. The original one was black and white. In fact, there’s not even any grayscale. It’s just literally two colors, black and white. The screen was controlled by a clone of the Motorola 6845 CRT controller, which was also used in the IBM CGA card, among other computers. However, there was no circuitry here for color.</p><p>   我们来谈谈PET上的屏幕。这里的原始模型是黑白的。许多人认为它是绿色的，但实际上直到后来的型号才出现。原始的是黑白的。实际上，甚至没有任何灰度。它实际上是黑色和白色两种颜色。该屏幕由Motorola 6845 CRT控制器的克隆控制，该控制器也用于IBM CGA卡以及其他计算机中。但是，这里没有彩色电路。</p><p>  There are also no graphics modes. I mean, literally  none. There is no way to put graphics on this machine at all. And what’s worse is that the character set is in ROM and it cannot be moved, so there’s no way to modify what the characters look like. So, you are pretty much stuck with putting characters on the screen and only the characters that came built into ROM. And that’s it.</p><p>  也没有图形模式。我的意思是，实际上没有。根本无法在该计算机上放置图形。更糟糕的是，字符集位于ROM中，无法移动，因此无法修改字符的外观。因此，您几乎只能将字符放在屏幕上，而只能将ROM中内置的字符放在屏幕上。就是这样。</p><p>  However, there are 256 characters using a special character set called PETASCII or later just shortened to PETSCII. The character set contains a lot of custom symbols and can be used together to create rudimentary graphics. There are also a set of 16 block character patterns that can be used to create rudimentary pixels. In fact,</p><p>  但是，有256个字符使用特殊字符集PETASCII或以后简称为PETSCII的字符集。字符集包含许多自定义符号，可以一起使用以创建基本图形。还有一组16个块字符模式，可用于创建基本像素。实际上，</p><p>  I wrote a program a while back called PETDraw, which actually runs on the PET. It allows you to pick characters and place them wherever you want on the screen. Of course, you don’t actually need a special program to do this because the different characters are on the keyboard itself, all you have to do is use the SHIFT key to type them. However, my program makes it easier, especially if you’re using an emulator with a regular computer keyboard. Plus it has a special pixel draw mode that automatically figures out which of the 16 block characters to use and allows you to freely draw in a matrix of 80 x 50 pixels. This program is available for free on my website  here. The PET actually does have two character sets. I’ve been showing you the default, but if you type POKE 59468,14 then it will switch to an upper/lower case set, which looks better for typing, but has fewer graphics characters.</p><p>  我不久前写了一个叫做PETDraw的程序，它实际上在PET上运行。它使您可以选择字符并将其放置在屏幕上的任何位置。当然，您实际上不需要特殊的程序来执行此操作，因为键盘本身上有不同的字符，您所要做的就是使用SHIFT键输入它们。但是，通过我的程序，它变得更容易，尤其是当您使用带有常规计算机键盘的仿真器时。此外，它还具有特殊的像素绘制模式，可自动找出要使用的16个块字符中的哪一个，并允许您自由绘制80 x 50像素的矩阵。该程序可在我的网站上免费获得。 PET实际上确实有两个字符集。我一直在向您显示默认值，但是如果您输入POKE 59468,14，则它将切换为大写/小写字母集，虽然看起来更好，但图形字符较少。 </p><p>  The PET also had no sound.. I mean, like literally none. There is no speaker and there’s no audio output anywhere. However, early PET users figured out that they could use two wires on the user-port, which connected to a handshake register on one of the I/O controllers and it could essentially operate as a one-voice square wave generator. Soon after, many software programs started using this method as the default method for sound production on this computer. Interestingly enough, the same concept will actually work on any of the Commodore 8-Bit machines user port. However it was generally not needed because all of these machines already have a sound synthesizer built in.</p><p>宠物也没有声音......我的意思是，就像字面上没有。没有扬声器，没有任何音频输出任何地方。然而，早期宠物用户想出，它们可以在用户端口上使用两根电线，该电线连接到一个I / O控制器上的握手寄存器，它可以基本上作为一个语音方波发生器运行。很快，许多软件程序使用此方法开始作为此计算机上的声音生产的默认方法。有趣的是，相同的概念实际上将在任何Commodore 8位机器用户端口工作。然而，通常不需要，因为所有这些机器都有一个内置的声音合成器。</p><p>   Eventually Commodore redesigned the PET. This 4016 model has a very similar look, but you’ll notice the screen is quite a bit larger, and now uses a green phosphor display instead of the black and white of the original model. The keyboard is redesigned so that it’s easier to type on, however most of the weird key arrangement I mentioned earlier still remains. The cassette drive is gone. At this point you’d have to use an external cassette drive or a floppy drive. The case opens in a similar manner, but the stand is in a different place. Also the case is now plastic, instead of the metal found on the original PET. Also, they have included a speaker inside the computer so it can produce sound without needing to connect anything to the user port.</p><p>   最终成功重新设计了宠物。这4016型号具有非常相似的外观，但您会注意到屏幕相当大，现在使用绿色磷光体显示器而不是原始模型的黑白。键盘重新设计，以便更容易输入，但是我前面提到的大多数奇怪的密钥排列仍然存在。盒式磁带机消失了。此时，您必须使用外部盒式磁带驱动器或软盘驱动器。这种情况以类似的方式打开，但展台处于不同的地方。此外，案件现在是塑料，而不是原始宠物上的金属。此外，它们包括计算机内的扬声器，因此它可以产生声音而无需将任何内容连接到用户端口。</p><p> Notice this is a 4016, which basically means it has a 40 column display with 16 kilobytes of RAM. Although this one has been upgraded to 32K, which seemed to be the standard on later PETs. But they also had several different models in this numbering scheme, with the high end models having 80 columns display and as much as 96K of RAM. There were also some other weird variations including one called a SuperPET. The PET would later evolve into Commodore’s CBM line of business computers which kept a similar form factor, but much more ergonomic with a detachable keyboard. I’ve never actually seen any of the CBM line in person as I think they were mostly sold in Europe. However, the 40-column PETs seem to have the most software available for them. And, generally speaking, software designed for the 40-columns won’t run on the 80-columns and vice-versa.</p><p> 请注意这是一个4016，基本上意味着它有一个40列显示器，具有16千字节的RAM。虽然这个已经升级到32k，但似乎是后来的宠物上的标准。但它们在该编号方案中也有几种不同的型号，具有80列显示器的高端型号，高达96K的RAM。还有一些其他奇怪的变化，包括一个被称为超统计的。宠物后来将进入Commodore的CBM系列商业计算机，这保持了类似的形状因素，但与可拆卸键盘更具符合人体工程学。我从未见过任何CBM系列，因为我认为他们大多在欧洲出售。但是，40列宠物似乎对它们提供了最多的软件。并且，一般来说，为40列设计的软件无法在80列上运行，反之亦然。</p><p>   Next I want to talk about a cool feature of Commodore BASIC. Using the screen editor, if I press the reverse key, it will change the text to reverse. I can press shift and reverse to disable that feature. Pressing the clear/home key by itself, it will return the cursor to the top of the screen. If I hold down shift and press that key, it will clear the screen.</p><p>   接下来我想谈谈Commodore Basic的很酷。使用屏幕编辑器，如果我按反向键，它将将文本更改为反向。我可以按SHIFT并反向禁用该功能。按下清除/主页键本身，它将将光标返回到屏幕顶部。如果我按住Shift并按该键，则会清除屏幕。</p><p> If I use these commands in a BASIC program. Once I type quotation marks, when I press the clear key, it just leaves a little symbol. Then, I can type some text and maybe use the reverse key. It leaves another little symbol. I can even use the cursor keys. When I go to execute this program, it will actually remember all of the screen commands, which is cool because it makes formatting text in your BASIC programs very simple!</p><p> 如果我在基本程序中使用这些命令。一旦我键入引号，当我按下清除键时，它就会离开一点符号。然后，我可以键入一些文本，也许可以使用反向密钥。它离开了另一个小象征。我甚至可以使用光标键。当我去执行这个程序时，它将实际上记得所有屏幕命令，这很酷，因为它使您的基本程序中的格式文本非常简单！</p><p>  Speaking of BASIC, the PET used Microsoft BASIC right from the beginning. And while the Apple II and TRS-80 did eventually offer Microsoft BASIC, they both used proprietary forms of BASIC during the first year or two on the market. And being that Microsoft BASIC was only designed in 1975, just 2 years before this machine came on the market, you could pretty easily make the case that this was probably the first mass-market computer that actually shipped with Microsoft BASIC.</p><p>  说到基本，宠物从一开始就使用了Microsoft Basic。虽然Apple II和TRS-80最终提供了Microsoft Basic，但它们在第一年或市场上使用了专有的基本形式。并作为Microsoft Basic仅在1975年设计，只需2年就在这台机器上市，您可以很容易地使这可能是Microsoft Basic与实际发货的第一个大众市场计算机。</p><p> In the early PET models, if you typed in WAIT 6502,1 it would show an Easter egg from Microsoft. In fact, if you change the second argument in the command to a different number, it will display the Microsoft logo that many times. I’ve actually looked at the code and it is clear that Microsoft essentially encrypted their name into this so that it could not be easily found. Apparently Commodore was furious about this, mostly because space was very limited on this machine and those Easter egg routines took up precious space on a machine where every byte counts.</p><p> 在早期的宠物模型中，如果您输入的等待6502,1，它将显示来自微软的复活节彩蛋。实际上，如果将命令中的第二个参数更改为不同的数字，则它将显示多次的Microsoft标志。我实际上看了代码，很明显，微软基本上是加密他们的名字，以便无法轻易找到。显然成功对此感到愤怒，主要是因为空间对这台机器非常有限，而那些复活节彩蛋病程在每个字节计数的机器上占据了宝贵的空间。 </p><p>   Despite the limited graphics and sound capabilities, there are no shortage of games for the PET. Most of the games were designed for the 40-column version of the PET and there seems to be a lot of incompatibilities between PETs with different keyboard types as well. Millipede is surprisingly playable and enjoyable. As is Space Invaders. Some of these graphics are so cleverly designed using the built in character set, that you could almost be tricked into thinking these were bit-mapped graphics. My friend Robin Harbron ported his RPG style game Minimae over to the PET as a fun project. There’s also a pretty good version of Tetris available and it even uses digitized sounds, but it requires a digital-to-analog converter connected to the user port similar to the Covox system that was available for the IBM platform.</p><p>尽管图形和声音能力有限，但宠物没有缺乏游戏。大多数游戏都是为宠物的40柱版本设计的，并且似乎与不同键盘类型的宠物之间似乎有很多不相容。千足德令人惊讶地扮演和愉快。像空间入侵者一样。这些图形中的一些是如此巧妙地使用内置字符集设计，您几乎可以欺骗思考这些是映射的图形。我的朋友罗宾·哈里克将他的RPG风格游戏最小的游戏更为流向宠物作为一个有趣的项目。还有一个非常好的TETRIS版本，它甚至使用数字化声音，但它需要连接到类似于IBM平台可用的Covox系统的用户端口的数模转换器。</p><p>  The Commodore PET has also made it into the demo scene a few times. Most notably this demo by ORB, which exploits a new found way to display graphics on the PET. What they’re doing here is using some critical timing to reset the video chip every scan line so that it only displays the top line of every character. So by carefully using characters who’s top row of pixels more or less match up with what they need, they can almost do pixel-perfect bitmaps. This demo also exploits the use of a SID chip if you happen to have one installed in your PET. Of course, Commodore never put SID chips in the PET, but it is possible to wire one in yourself if you want. Not that there’s a lot of software that will support it, though.</p><p>  商品宠物还将其进入演示场景几次。最值得注意的是，ORB的这个演示，它利用了一种新的发现方法来在宠物上显示图形。他们在这里在这里使用的是，使用一些关键时机来重置每个扫描线的视频芯片，以便它只显示每个角色的顶线。因此，通过仔细使用顶部像素的角色或多或少地匹配他们所需要的，它们几乎可以做像素完美的位图。如果您碰巧安装在您的宠物中，此演示也会利用SID芯片的使用。当然，Commodore永远不会把SID筹码放在宠物中，但如果你愿意，可以在自己身上融合。不过，不是有很多软件，它将支持它。</p><p>   So, one mantra I’ve always had when talking with inexperienced computer users who are afraid to try things on their computer. I’ll always tell them “Look, there’s nothing you can do. Nothing you can type on this keyboard or click with your mouse that can possibly damage the computer. The worst thing you could do is erase or corrupt some data, and that can always be restored.” However, it turns out in the case of the Commodore PET that that advice is not always true! It was discovered that on certain models if you typed the command POKE 59458,62 it would throw the CRT display out of sync, and after a short time could actually damage some of the circuits and burn out the display. This was referred to as the KILLER POKE. I think I’ll go ahead and test the killer poke right here on this machine. After all, this isn’t mine, it actually belongs to  The Obsolete Geek. Surely he won’t mind!</p><p>   所以，我一直在与缺乏经验的计算机用户交谈时一直在害怕在他们的电脑上尝试。我会一直告诉他们“看，你无能为力。您可以在此键盘上键入任何内容或单击可能会损坏计算机的鼠标。你能做的最糟糕的事情是删除或损坏一些数据，并且可以始终恢复。“但是，它就在商品宠物的情况下，这种建议并不总是如此！被发现，在某些模型中，如果您输入命令普朗59458,62，它将抛出同步的CRT显示屏，并且在短时间内实际上会损坏一些电路并烧掉显示屏。这被称为杀手戳。我想我会继续测试这台机器上的杀手戳。毕竟，这不是我的，它实际上属于过时的极客。他肯定不会介意！</p><p> Steve Gray decided to modify his PET so that it could display color on an external monitor… and eventually integrated the color CRT inside of the PET. This required extensive modifications to the logic board and Kernal ROMs to make this possible, but it is certainly a neat project.</p><p> 史蒂夫格雷决定修改他的宠物，以便它可以在外部监视器上显示颜色......最终集成了宠物内部的颜色CRT。这需要对逻辑板和核rom的大量修改，以使其成为可能，但肯定是一个整洁的项目。</p><p>  The Commodore PET has also been featured in countless movies and TV shows. Just to show a few of my favorite, you can see one in Star Trek II, the wrath of Khan. It’s apparently part of Captain Kirk’s antique collection. You can also clearly see one in many episodes of the IT crowd. Apparently Steven Hawking used one as shown in the movie The Theory of Everything. At the end of Terminator 3, when they arrive at the fallout shelter, you can clearly see a Commodore PET behind John Connor. And in the movie Wayne’s World, the local TV station has a Commodore PET in the office.</p><p>  Commodore Pet也在无数电影和电视节目中得到特色。只是为了展示我最喜欢的一些，你可以在汗的愤怒中看到星际雷克里克二世。它显然是凯尔克船长的古董系列的一部分。您还可以在IT人群的许多剧集中清楚地看到一个。显然史蒂文抱怨使用了一个如电影中所示的一切。在终结者3结束时，当他们到达掠夺者庇护所时，您可以清楚地看到John Connor背后的Commodore Pet。在电影Wayne的世界中，当地电视台在办公室有一个成功的宠物。</p><p>   The PET makes a great collector’s item. And, if you have room for one in your house, they make a great thing to put on display. It’s definitely a good conversation starter when people come over to visit. But truth be told they’re really not that great of computers to actually use. I know a lot of vintage computer enthusiasts. Of those, I don’t know anybody who really wants to spend hours on end sitting in front of a PET. I mean, they’re pretty cool to look at and they have a really cool place in history, but they’re not really all that much fun to actually use!</p><p>   宠物制作了一个伟大的收藏品。而且，如果你家里有一个房间，他们会展示一件好事。当人们过来访问时，这绝对是一个很好的谈话启动。但是，真相被告知他们真的不是那么大的电脑实际使用。我知道很多老式计算机爱好者。其中，我不知道任何真正想要花几个小时的人坐在宠物前。我的意思是，他们看起来非常酷，他们在历史上有一个非常酷的地方，但他们实际上并不是那么多乐趣！</p><p>  In the next few articles and episodes I’m going to be covering the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, the Plus/4, the Commodore 128, etc. ne of the things that you’re going to see about those designs is that they were not revolutionary, rather they were evolutionary from the PET. You’re going to see a lot of technology carried over to those machines. And many of the characteristics of these machines can be traced back to their origins at the PET or perhaps even further back all the way to the KIM-1!</p><p>  在接下来的几篇文章和剧集中，我将覆盖Commodore VIC-20，Commodore 64，加上/ 4，Commodore 128等。那些你将看到这些设计的事情他们不是革命性的，而是他们从宠物进化。您将看到大量技术运往这些机器。这些机器的许多特征可以追溯到宠物的起源，或者甚至可能进一步回到金-1！ </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.the8bitguy.com/4839/commodore-history-part-1-the-commodore-pet/">http://www.the8bitguy.com/4839/commodore-history-part-1-the-commodore-pet/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/宠物/">#宠物</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/准将/">#准将</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/commodore/">#commodore</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/计算机/">#计算机</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
