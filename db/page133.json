Free community support is available through the Rocky Linux  Mattermost,  IRC, and  forums. Paid commercial support is currently available through CIQ.\n        Corporations come and go, their interests as transient as they are self-serving. But a community persists, and that\u2019s who we dedicate Rocky Linux to: you.\n Rocky is more than the next free and open, community enterprise operating system. It\u2019s a community. A commitment to an ideal bigger than the sum of its parts, and a promise that our  principles\u2014embedded even within our repositories and ISOs\u2014are immutable.\n We\u2019d like to extend a special thanks to our sponsors and our partners, whose contribution of resources, financial backing, software, and infrastructure were all critical in supporting our efforts:\n  Each one brings something special to the community, and we\u2019re grateful for their support.\n  This is just the beginning, and the RESF is more than just Rocky Linux\u2014it\u2019s a home for those that believe that open source isn\u2019t just a switch that can be toggled at will, and that projects that many rely on not be subject to the whims of a few. To this point, you can easily find all of our sources, our build infrastructure, Git repositories, and everything else anyone would need to fork our work and ensure that it continues if need be. Expect more from the RESF in the coming weeks and months.\n When we announced our release candidate, we asked you to come build the next free, open, community enterprise operating system with us. Now we\u2019re asking you for more: join us as we build our community.\n \u201cWe set out to develop a free, open, community enterprise operating system that is bug-for-bug compatible with the upstream Enterprise Linux standard. What we built is so much more: a community.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:58:25", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "linux,cky,rocky,\u793e\u533a", "title": "cky\u3043x x 8.4 ", "title_en": "Rocky Linux 8.4 GA", "transed": 1, "url": "https://rockylinux.org/news/rocky-linux-8-4-ga-release/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["linux", "cky", "rocky", "\u793e\u533a"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "8faf5f62b1df039655505e713891eaba.webp", "infoid": 1067286, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u6839\u636e\u5a92\u4f53\u62a5\u9053\uff0c\u56db\u5ddd\u5f53\u5c40\u8ba2\u8d2d\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u77ff\u5de5\u201c\u6e05\u7406\u5e76\u7ec8\u6b62\u201d\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8fd0\u8425\u3002 ", "note_en": "Sichuan authorities have ordered bitcoin miners to 'clean up and terminate' their operations, according to media reports.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:53:50", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01,crypto,steps,\u56db\u5ddd", "title": "\u5728\u52a0\u5165Crypto Mining\u7684\u9547\u538b\u540e\uff0c\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u7ffb\u6eda11\uff05 ", "title_en": "Bitcoin tumbles 11% after China steps up crackdown on crypto mining", "transed": 1, "url": "https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-price-btc-china-mining-crackdown-sichuan-cryptocurrencies-ether-2021-6-1030538480", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01", "crypto", "steps", "\u56db\u5ddd"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "b9bb29785d49ea49679fc70ca4622d2a.jpg", "infoid": 1067285, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5f53\u4eba\u4eec\u51b2\u6d17\u65e7\u7684\u5904\u65b9\uff08\u6216\u8131\u79bb\u5904\u65b9\uff09\u836f\u7269\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u5316\u5408\u7269\u603b\u662f\u8fdb\u5165\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u6c34\u57df\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\u6392\u5c3f\u6c61\u6c34\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5316\u5408\u7269 - \u4eceprozac\u5230\u53ef\u5361\u56e0 - \u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6c34\u751f\u751f\u7269\u7684\u4f53\u5185\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5316\u5b66\u7269\u8d28\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b83\u4eec\uff1a\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u51fa\u751f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u8fdb\u5165\u6c34\u540e\u5f71\u54cd\u9752\u86d9\u7e41\u6b96\u3002\n \u6211\u4eec\u4ee3\u8c22\u6211\u4eec\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u6c34\u5904\u7406\u5382\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4f11\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6c34\u91ca\u653e\u5230\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u6e56\u6cca\u548c\u6eaa\u6d41\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u6d53\u5ea6\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u7559\u4e0b\u3002\n \u5230\u76ee\u524d\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u592a\u591a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6709\u7684\u8bdd\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u662f\u53ef\u5361\u56e0\u548c\u5404\u79cd\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6c34\u751f\u751f\u547d\uff0c\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u8868\u793a\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u4e9b\u836f\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u9ebb\u70e6\u3002\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6297\u6291\u90c1\u836f\uff0c\u897f\u666e\u62c9\u59c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u5c0f\u9f99\u867e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\u66f4\u5927\u80c6\u3002\n \u6570\u636e\u6765\u81eaa.j.\u4f5b\u7f57\u91cc\u8fbe\u5927\u5b66\u571f\u58e4\u548c\u6c34\u79d1\u5b66\u7cfb\u52a9\u7406\u6559\u6388 -  2017\u5e74\u524d\u5f80Care\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7684\u961f\u4f0d\u3002\u8be5\u8bbe\u65bd\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u6eaa\u6d41\u6a21\u4eff\u81ea\u7136\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5141\u8bb8\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u9762\u73af\u5883\u3002 Reisinger\uff06\uff0339;

The same is true even when people using these chemicals urinate them into the sewage system. Once there, these compounds\u2014from  prozac to  cocaine\u2014can end up in the bodies of aquatic creatures. And, research suggests, the chemicals can impact them:  birth control, for instance, affects frog breeding after it enters the water.\n We metabolize many of the drugs we take, and water treatment plants remove some of rest. But some concentration can still remain as the water is released to the surrounding lakes and streams.\n So far, there&#39;s not been much research into how, if at all, other drugs like cocaine and  various opioids, affect aquatic life\u2014but scientists say negative effects are not wholly impossible. And there is now some evidence that at least some classification of drugs do cause trouble.  New research suggests that a common antidepressant, citalopram, can change the behavior of crayfish, making them bolder than they would be otherwise.\n The data come from A.J. Reisinger\u2014assistant professor in the Soil and Water Sciences Department at the University of Florida\u2014and his team, which travelled to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in 2017. The facility has several artificial streams that mimic natural conditions but allow researchers to control different aspects of the environment. Reisinger&#39;s team went out into the field and collected rocks, bugs, leaves, and crayfish and put them into the artificial streams.\n Crayfish were chosen because they can reach high biomasses in aquatic ecosystems and will &#34;eat anything they can get their claws on. They&#39;ll eat bugs, they&#39;ll eat algae, they&#39;ll eat leaves, they&#39;ll eat juvenile fish, even,&#34; Reisinger told Ars.\n     The researchers brought their subjects to the Cary Institute and began their experiment after setting up each stream as close to reality as possible using the rocks and other material from the crayfish&#39;s normal environment. They set up a quarter of the streams to have neither citalopram\u2014a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant\u2014nor crayfish as a control. In a second quarter of the streams, they added crayfish but no citalopram. In a third quarter, they had only the SSRI\u2014in concentrations that have been found in nature\u2014and in the fourth, they added both.\n From there, the researchers let the experiment run for two weeks before removing individual crayfish and putting them in new tanks. These tanks had mazes in the middle, and Reisinger&#39;s team initially introduced the crayfish to them via a small shelter at one end. At the opposite side of the maze, the team placed either a substance that smelled like food (sardine gelatin, in this case) or another crayfish. The researchers wanted see how their subjects would react.\n The crayfish that were exposed to citalopram left their shelters faster, and they spent more time moving toward the food, compared to their peers who didn&#39;t get the SSRI. They didn&#39;t show any more interest in moving toward the other crayfish, however.\n &#34;That tells us they&#39;re more bold. They&#39;re more likely to leave their shelter in their real environment,&#34; Reisinger said.\n That boldness could potentially have a broader impact on the environment. The team found that the streams containing crayfish saw an increase an algal biomass and organic matter. However, this wasn&#39;t dependent on the crustaceans being exposed to the antidepressant.\n According to Reisinger, the bolder crayfish that had been exposed to citalopram might have had a different effect on the streams if the researchers had run the experiments for longer than two weeks. There were likely lags between the addition of the drug and the crayfish&#39;s altered behavior as well as between that and the crayfish having a different impact on their environment. &#34;We think that, if we had run the study for a little bit longer, we might have seen a difference,&#34; he said.\n     Alex Ford, a professor of biology at Portsmouth University in the UK, ran one of the earliest studies on the effects on prozac, another antidepressant, on shrimp. Much like Reisinger&#39;s work, Ford&#39;s suggested that the drug made them more reckless and active. Since then, his team has looked into a  slew of other substances in aquatic organisms, including other SSRIs and benzodiazepines.\n Ars asked Ford if it&#39;s possible for shrimp and other aquatic species to become intoxicated (or otherwise have their behaviors changed) as a result of recreational or medicinal psychoactive substances reaching the waterways. He said, &#34;Theoretically, yes. Not just with cocaine, but with the whole suite of drugs out there\u2014the illegal ones.&#34;\n Ford noted that, in the past, he and various colleagues studied if low amounts of cocaine would affect shrimp behavior, but it did not appear to. However, they simply looked at swimming speed among shrimp, and it&#39;s possible that other behaviors would&#39;ve changed. The concentration of the drugs\u2014which usually appears in water in low but continuous levels\u2014is also a factor.\n Hypothetically, say there&#39;s a small village that used a lot of fentanyl, an incredibly potent opioid. This hypothetical village also doesn&#39;t have the best water treatment plant, and the river into which wastewater flows is tiny. Under these conditions there could, theoretically, be an effect.\n Last month, Ford and around 30 international authors penned  a report suggesting that regulating bodies should consider potential changes to behavior in aquatic organisms before greenlighting a new chemical. Currently, they are tested for their effects on growth and reproduction. &#34;When we assess the impact of chemicals on the environment, we need to consider behavior, because at the moment, most chemicals only go through quite simple tests before they go on the market,&#34;

Rocky Linux 8.4 is binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, making it possible to run apps designed and tested only for RHEL without RHEL itself.   One of the questions we&#39;ve gotten repeatedly since first covering CentOS Linux&#39;s deprecation is &#34;why not just use [my favorite distro]?&#34; Linux and BSD users tend to be so accustomed to the same software working on multiple distributions, with similar package names and installation procedures, that they forget what using and installing proprietary software is frequently like. Rocky Linux and competitor  AlmaLinux (which released its own binary-compatible RHEL 8.4 clone in March) aren&#39;t simply &#34;Linux distros&#34; or even &#34;Linux distros which closely resemble RHEL.&#34; They&#39;re built from the same source code as RHEL 8.4, which guarantees that a wide array of proprietary software designed with nothing but RHEL 8.4 in mind will &#34;just work,&#34; regardless of how obscure a feature (or bug!) those packages depend upon in RHEL 8.4 might be.\n Rocky Linux and AlmaLinux aren&#39;t the only RHEL-compatible options out there, of course. Last December, we published a partial  list\u00a0of binary-compatible alternatives to RHEL, including RHEL&#39;s own CentOS Stream (which is only available as a rolling release) and Oracle Linux, as well as Rocky, Alma, and Alma&#39;s parent distro, CloudLinux.\n What makes Rocky Linux\u2014and AlmaLinux\u2014special is that both distros were created specifically to fill the void left by CentOS&#39;s deprecation. Their specific goal is to be available for anyone who needs them with commercial support also available. That latter point is in contrast with, for example, Springdale Linux\u2014which is another long-running &#34;RHEL rebuild&#34; which should &#34;just work.&#34; But it was primarily intended for and supported by a relatively small academic community.\n  Like any other Linux distro, you can simply  download an ISO of Rocky Linux and install it from scratch. But since Rocky Linux is specifically intended to serve as an easy replacement for similar distributions, it comes with easy-to-use conversion scripts as well.\n    There is no supported migration path from one of Rocky Linux&#39;s earlier release candidate (RC) builds to today&#39;s production build\u2014but interested users of other RHEL 8.4 binary-compatible distributions can use the free  migrate2rocky tool for convenient, in-place migration to Green Obsidian that should not mess up existing users, installed software, etc. The following distributions are supported by  migrate2rocky:\n  The Rocky Linux team warns that while migrations from other point releases &#34;may work,&#34; the only supported migration sources are those specifically built from RHEL 8.4 source. There are also issues with  Katello and some error messages associated with migrations beginning with RHEL 8.4 itself. We strongly recommend interested users carefully read the full  migrate2rocky release notes prior to attempting a migration\u2014and, as always, have tested and working backups available before proceeding!\n  Although Rocky Linux 8.4 is offered as a production-ready distribution today, one notable feature isn&#39;t available yet\u2014support for Secure Boot, which the Rocky team describes as a &#34;non-trivial process&#34; to get going on a new distribution.\n The process of enabling Secure Boot with Rocky is underway, however, and the team expects a second set of ISOs with Secure Boot support to be built and released relatively soon. Until then, potential Rocky Linux users who can&#39;t wait for Secure Boot support should consider AlmaLinux 8.4, which received its own Secure Boot support this May.\n Although there is always some element of risk when doing in-place migrations, it&#39;s worth noting that installing AlmaLinux (or another 8.4 compatible distro) with Secure Boot today does not mean you can&#39;t shift over to Rocky Linux later\u2014the  migrate2rocky\u00a0tool referenced in the last section should typically work simply, relatively quickly, and reliably if you need Secure Boot today but still prefer Rocky Linux once its Secure Boot support becomes available.\n  In the words of the Rocky Linux team, &#34;this is just the beginning, and the [Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation] is more than just Rocky Linux.&#34; The team goes on to describe the RESF as &#34;a home for those that believe that open source isn&#39;t just a switch that can be toggled at will.&#34;\n In order to put its money where its mouth is, the RESF didn&#39;t stop with making Green Obsidian&#39;s source code available\u2014the build infrastructure, Git repos, and &#34;everything else anyone would need to fork our work&#34; is easy to find.\n Although the RESF hasn&#39;t specified any other projects by name, it says that users should expect more in the coming weeks and months\u2014strongly implying that it may assist in hosting software and projects from like-minded developers and communities in the near future.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 04:17:42", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

Amazon&#39;s warehouse in Dunfermline, Scotland. The footage showed laptops, TVs, jewelry, headphones, books, and face masks being loaded into crates marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n  An anonymous former Amazon employee told ITV that workers at the warehouse were given a weekly target of 130,000 items to destroy. This was corroborated by an internal memo viewed by ITV, which showed that during one week in April, 124,000 items were marked &#34;destroy.&#34;\n      &#34;There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 COVID (face) masks still in their wrappers,&#34; the ex-employee told ITV. About half of the items marked for destruction were still in their shrink-wrap, while the other half were returned items in good condition, they said.\n An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that Dunfermline handles all products marked for destruction for the entire UK.\n  If 130,000 is a weekly average, that would translate to more than 6 million products marked for destruction every year. In 2019, undercover reporters in France found that Amazon destroyed  over 3 million products in one year.\n     ITV filmed the boxes of products marked &#34;destroy&#34; being loaded into trucks and driven to recycling centers, as well as to a landfill site.\n In a statement to Insider, the Amazon spokesperson said the landfill site mentioned by ITV was also a recycling center.\n &#34;We are working toward a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations, or recycle any unsold products. No items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero,&#34; the spokesperson said.\n In 2019, the  Mail on Sunday sent undercover reporters into a different UK warehouse where they witnessed unsold products being placed in a so-called &#34;destruction zone.&#34; The Mail then tracked the products from that warehouse as they were loaded into trucks and taken to a waste-disposal site and a landfill.\n     Amazon&#39;s spokesperson did not comment on whether the company had changed its infrastructure since the Mail&#39;s 2019 investigation.\n  By clicking \u2018Sign up\u2019, you agree to receive marketing emails from Insider as well as other partner offers and accept our  Terms of Service and  Privacy Policy.\n          Two crossed lines that form an &#39;X&#39;.
