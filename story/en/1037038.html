Anthropologists at Washington State University (WSU) have examined one such ancient turkey-feather blanket and determined it took thousands of those feathers, wrapped around nearly 200 yards to yucca fiber, to make, according to  a new paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.</p><p>美国西南部的土著普韦布洛人—今天的霍皮人，祖尼人和里奥格兰德·普韦布洛部落的祖先—通常用动物皮，毛皮和火鸡羽毛编织毯子，斗篷和葬礼包裹。根据《考古科学杂志》上发表的一篇新论文，华盛顿州立大学（WSU）的人类学家研究了一种这样的古老火鸡毛毯，并确定花了成千上万根羽毛，包裹了约200码以丝兰纤维。 ：报告。</p><p> &#34;Blankets or robes made with turkey feathers as the insulating medium were widely used by Ancestral Pueblo people in what is now the Upland Southwest, but little is known about how they were made because so few such textiles have survived due to their perishable nature,&#34;  said co-author Bill Lipe, emeritus professor of anthropology at WSU. &#34;The goal of this study was to shed new light on the production of turkey feather blankets and explore the economic and cultural aspects of raising turkeys to supply the feathers.&#34;</p><p> “以火鸡羽毛为绝缘材料制成的毯子或长袍被祖先的普韦布洛人广泛使用，如今在西南高地地区，但人们对其制作方式知之甚少，因为这种纺织品由于易腐烂的性质而幸存下来，”华盛顿州立大学人类学名誉教授比尔·利普（Bill Lipe）说。 “这项研究的目的是为土耳其羽毛毯的生产提供新的思路，并探讨饲养土耳其以供应羽毛的经济和文化方面。”</p><p> For their study, Lipe and his WSU colleague and co-author, Shannon Tushingham, studied a blanket framework on display at the Edge of the Cedars State Park Museum in Blanding, Utah. Although insects had devoured the original feather vanes and barbs, the shafts were still visible, wrapped around yucca fiber cords. They were also able to look at a second, smaller blanket which still had most of its feathers intact. Both blankets roughly date to the early 1200s CE.</p><p> 对于他们的研究，Lipe和他的WSU同事兼合著者Shannon Tushingham在犹他州布兰丁的雪松州立公园博物馆的边缘研究了一个毛毯框架。尽管昆虫吞噬了原始的羽毛叶片和倒钩，但仍可见轴，包裹在丝兰纤维绳上。他们还能够查看第二条较小的毯子，该毯子的大部分羽毛仍然完好无损。两条毯子大约可以追溯到公元1200年代初。</p><p> According to the authors, such blankets were likely made from the body feathers that cover the breast and back of turkeys. Such feathers have a visible &#34;after feather,&#34; as well as a downy portion—a key factor in how feathers keep turkeys and people warm. Both the distal tips and the quills at the base are typically overwrapped during the weaving process, with the downy portions exposed. They are held together by rows of nonwrapped yucca fiber cords, which comprise the weave of the blanket. They measured the length of the cordage used to make the  warps and wefts, the two components in weaving used to turn thread or yarn into fabric (lengthwise yarns are called warp; crosswise yarns are called weft).</p><p> 这组作者说，这种毯子很可能是用覆盖鸡胸和火鸡背部的身体羽毛制成的。这样的羽毛具有可见的“后羽毛”以及柔软的部分，这是羽毛如何保持火鸡和人们温暖的关键因素。通常，在编织过程中，远端的尖端和基部的被子都被包裹起来，而柔软的部分则暴露在外。它们由成排的无包裹丝兰纤维帘线固定在一起，构成了毯子的编织。他们测量了用于制作经线和纬线的绳索的长度，即用于将线或纱线转变为织物的编织过程中的两个组成部分（纵向纱线称为经线;横向纱线称为纬线）。</p><p>     The blanket might have been created all at once, but the authors surmise that additional lengths of cordage and feather batches were probably added over time. However, they do think the feathers were added to the full warp cord before the final blanket took shape, &#34;before the cord was repeatedly doubled back on itself to form the individual warp segments,&#34; they wrote.</p><p>     毯子可能是一次创建的，但作者推测，随着时间的流逝，可能还会增加其他长度的绳索和羽毛批次。但是，他们确实认为，羽毛是在最终毯子成形之前就被添加到了整个经线上的，“他们在线被反复加倍成自身形成单独的经纱段之前”。</p><p> They also counted the number of individual feather shafts on several segments of the warp cords. However, it wasn&#39;t possible to examine the quills or ends of the feathers, or the distal tips, since they had been overwrapped by adjacent feathers. Ultimately, the researchers estimated that approximately 11,500 turkey feathers would have been needed to make the blanket. &#34;This estimate would of course change if different lengths of feather were used,&#34; they wrote, depending on the feathers that were available and on the personal preferences of whoever wove the blanket.</p><p> 他们还计算了经线几段上单个羽毛轴的数量。但是，由于羽毛被相邻的羽毛包裹，因此无法检查羽毛或羽毛的末端或远端。最终，研究人员估计制作毯子大约需要11500根火鸡羽毛。他们写道：“如果使用不同长度的羽毛，这个估计当然会改变。”这取决于可用的羽毛以及编织毯子的人的个人喜好。</p><p>  Next, the researchers obtained the pelts of two adult male wild turkeys from Idaho hide and fur dealers, the better to estimate how many adult turkeys would be needed to provide 11,500 or so feathers. They concluded such pelts would yield a little over 2,700 feathers from an adult male turkey. From that, they extrapolated that a blanket-maker would need to collect feathers from 4.26 adult males. But since only 1,200 feathers per bird were in the preferred size range, it may have taken as many as 9.6 adult birds to collect enough feathers for the blanket. The good news: &#34;Once a blanket was made, it likely would have lasted for a number of years,&#34; the authors wrote.</p><p>  接下来，研究人员从爱达荷州皮革和毛皮交易商那里获得了两只成年雄性野火鸡的毛皮，可以更好地估计需要多少只成年火鸡来提供11500支羽毛。他们得出结论，这样的毛皮可以从成年雄性火鸡身上产生2700多根羽毛。据此，他们推断出毯子制造商将需要收集4.26名成年男性的羽毛。但是，由于每只鸟只有1200根羽毛处于优选的大小范围内，因此可能需要多达9.6羽成年鸟来收集足够的羽毛来盖毯。好消息是：“一旦盖好毯子，它可能会持续数年，”作者写道。</p><p> Turkey feathers likely began to replace strips of rabbit skin for blankets sometime during the first two centuries CE. &#34;As ancestral Pueblo farming populations flourished, many thousands of feather blankets would likely have been in circulation at any one time,&#34;  said Tushingham. &#34;It is likely that every member of an ancestral Pueblo community, from infants to adults, possessed one.&#34;</p><p>在公元前两个世纪的某个时候，土耳其的羽毛很可能开始代替兔子的毛毯。图辛厄姆说：“随着祖先的农耕业蓬勃发展，成千上万的毛毯可能随时都在流通。” “祖先的普韦布洛社区的每个成员，从婴儿到成人，都有可能拥有一个。”</p><p>    As for how the feathers were collected, Lipe and Tushingham cited three possibilities: the birds were killed and their feathers harvested; feathers were collected during the birds&#39; natural molting season; or people selectively plucked mature feathers from living turkeys. Turkeys didn&#39;t become a major food source in this region until between 1100 and 1200 CE, and even then, they were typically killed before they were a year old—too soon to harvest mature feathers. Furthermore, &#34;Killing turkeys for their feathers is a wasteful strategy, because it removes the possibility of harvesting feathers as a sustainable food source,&#34; the authors wrote.</p><p>    至于羽毛的收集方式，利普和图辛汉列举了三种可能性：杀死鸟类并收获羽毛；在鸟类的自然蜕皮季节收集羽毛；或人们从火鸡中有选择地采摘成熟的羽毛。直到公元1100年至1200年之间，土耳其才成为该地区的主要食物来源，即使在那时，它们也通常在一岁之前就被杀死-太早收获成熟的羽毛。此外，作者写道：“为火鸡杀死羽毛是一种浪费的策略，因为它消除了将羽毛作为可持续食物来源的可能性。”</p><p>  As for collecting feathers during the natural molting season, this typically occurs gradually over weeks or months. If the turkeys were roaming freely, it would be difficult to collect the best feathers, and if they were penned, the feathers would be trampled in the ground—no doubt also littered with turkey droppings. (The authors note that modern wild turkeys produce 2.5 pounds of &#34;fresh manure&#34; per bird each week.) Thus, the authors conclude that the most likely practice was to selectively pluck feathers from live birds, which can be done quite easily once feathers have matured.</p><p>  至于在自然蜕皮季节收集羽毛，通常会在数周或数月内逐渐发生。如果火鸡能自由漫游，就很难收集到最好的羽毛，如果将它们用笔扎好，这些羽毛将被踩在地面上-毫无疑问，火鸡的粪便也会乱扔垃圾。 （作者指出，现代野火鸡每周每只鸟会产生2.5磅“新鲜粪便”。）因此，作者得出结论，最可能的做法是有选择地从活禽中拔出羽毛，一旦羽毛掉下，这很容易做到。成熟了</p><p> &#34;When the blanket we analyzed for our study was made, we think in the early 1200s CE, the birds that supplied the feathers were likely being treated as individuals important to the household and would have been buried complete,&#34;  Lipe said. &#34;This reverence for turkeys and their feathers is still evident today in Pueblo dances and rituals. They are right up there with eagle feathers as being symbolically and culturally important.&#34;</p><p> 利佩说：“当我们做研究用的毯子制成时，我们认为在公元1200年代初期，提供羽毛的鸟很可能被视为对家庭重要的个体，因此会被完全埋葬。” “今天，在普韦布洛的舞蹈和仪式中，对火鸡及其羽毛的崇敬仍然很明显。它们正以鹰羽毛为代表，在象征和文化上都很重要。”</p><p> &#34;Turkeys were one of the very few domesticated animals in North America until Europeans arrived in the 1500s and 1600s,&#34; Tushingham added. &#34;They had and continue to have a very culturally significant role in the lives of Pueblo people, and our hope is this research helps shed light on this important relationship.&#34;</p><p> “土耳其是北美极少数驯养的动物之一，直到欧洲人在1500和1600年代到来为止，”图辛厄姆补充说。 “他们在普韦布洛人的生活中曾经并且继续扮演着非常重要的文化角色，我们希望这项研究有助于阐明这一重要的关系。”</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/how-many-turkey-feathers-does-it-take-to-make-an-ancient-blanket-11500/">https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/how-many-turkey-feathers-does-it-take-to-make-an-ancient-blanket-11500/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/毯子/">#毯子</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/feathers/">#feathers</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/羽毛/">#羽毛</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
