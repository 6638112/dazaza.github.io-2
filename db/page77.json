 \r\tCM-1 T-shirt\n   Thirty years after its launch in 1987, a CM-2 is on exhibit as part of the show:  \r &#34; Thinking Machines: Art and Design in the Computer Age, 1959-1989&#34; \rMoMA NY, November 13, 2017 - April 8, 2018\n  I participated in a panel discussion at MoMA on Nov. 14, 2017: \r &#34; Thinking Machines: An Evening with Beryl Korot, Zabet Patterson, and Tamiko Thiel&#34; \rWatch the recording  &gt; here\n  See also the pages on the  CM-1/CM-2 Design Legacy, and the untold story of how \r the Connection Machine  changed Steve Jobs sense of the potential of design.\n       The  Connection Machine CM-1 was the first commercial supercomputer designed expressly for problems of Artificial Intelligence (AI). A massively parallel supercomputer with 65,536 processors, it was the brainchild \r of Danny Hillis, conceived in the early 1980s while he was a doctoral student with\r Marvin Minsky at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, and built at his start-up Thinking Machines Corporation. Departing from conventional computer \r architecture of the time, the CM-1 was modeled on the structure of a human brain: rather than relying on a\r single powerful processor to perform calculations one after another, the data was distributed over the\r tens of thousands of simple 1-bit processors, all of which could perform calculations simultaneously, an architecture known as Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD).\n  What enabled the processors to communicate faster than previous SIMD designs was the internal network, a 12-dimensional boolean n-cube structure suggested by Nobel Prize physicist  Richard Feynman, who spent his summers working with us. Within this hardwired physical structure, the software data\r structures for communication and transfer of data between processors could change as needed depending \r on the nature of the problem. The connections between processors were more important\r than the processors themselves, hence the name &#34;Connection Machine.&#34;\n  In 1987 the CM-1 was superceded by the more powerful CM-2 in the same package and similar architecture. In 1991 the CM-1/CM-2 hypercube design was superceded by the  CM-5, with a very different form and architecture. Each in their day won the prestigious  Gordon Bell Prize as the most powerful supercomputers in the world, the CM-2 in 1989 and the CM-5  in 1993.\n      From 1983-1985 I directed the packaging and industrial design of the \rConnection Machine CM-1 at Thinking Machines Corporation, working with industrial design consultants\r  Allen Hawthorne and  Gordon Bruce, and mechanical engineering consultant Ted Bilodeau. The CM-2, released\rin 1987, was a more advanced successor (including floating point hardware) contained in the same physical package.\n  The form of the machine was to express both its function and the passions of its creators: \rthe dream of producing a &#34;Machina Sapiens,&#34; a new genus of living, thinking machines. For a description of the design history, theory and concepts behind the visual design, see my article:\n  Thiel, Tamiko. &#34;The Design \r of the Connection Machine,&#34; ( pdf or  html) in Design Issues, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, Vol. 10, No. 1, Spring 1994. pp. 5-18.    \r Republished in \r\rthe book &#34;The Designed World: Images, Objects, Environments.&#34; Editors: Richard Buchanan, Dennis Doordan and Victor Margolin, 2010.\n    My old friend  Joanna Hoffman was marketing manager for the first Macintosh and the NeXT computer, and Steve Jobs&#39; &#34;right hand,&#34; as depicted by Kate Winslet in the film &#34; Steve Jobs.&#34; In 1986, when the Connection Machine came out, Jobs asked her to get its designer to create his new  NeXT computer as well. To which Joanna replied, &#34; Too late, Tamiko has gone to Europe to become an artist!&#34; But the machine made a lasting impression on him, and from that point on, Jobs&#39; designs were not merely useful - they were visually sublime.\n        &#34;There have even been heroes of computer design: The CM-1 and CM-2 parallel supercomputers of the 1980s, designed by a team headed by Tamiko Thiel, were elegant and fascinating. At Yale, visitors stopped by the machine room often to admire the thing just as sculpture.&#34; \r Gelernter, David. &#34; Beyond the Grey Box,&#34; ID Magazine, Vol. 45 #2, March/April 1998, page 60.\n        In the early/mid 1980s both AI and parallel processing were considered of interest only for ivory tower academics, not for real world computing and problem solving. Danny Hillis&#39; radical new approach to computing, however, attracted scientists to Thinking Machines who saw the value and the promise of a computing paradigm that focused on the structures required by the data itself, rather than faster and faster serial processors.\n  Today&#39;s History of AI timelines omit the work that Danny and other scientists did at Thinking Machines and on the Connection Machines. Their contributions have been forgotten. But my interviews with several colleagues reveal how the ideas, the programming techniques, the software and the hardware shaped the technology of the world today. A few examples:\n  Nobel physicist Richard Feynman used the Connection Machine to work on his seminal ideas for a new field:  quantum computing.\n  Brewster Kahle talks about his term &#34;Big Data&#34; and how he used the Connection Machine to develop the first natural language search engine.\n  Danny Hillis talks about how Google became the world&#39;s premiere search engine and AI company, first using parallel programming techniques that Sergey Brin learned on a Connection Machine, and then with the acquisition of Danny&#39;s subsequent company MetaWeb - whose CTO John Giannandrea is now Google&#39;s head of AI.\n  Even the hardware enabling Deep Learning today consists of chips that are in essence miniature Connection Machines, as are the GPUs built by nVidia that enable the success of virtual reality now, 30 years later.\n            At its height, I have heard there were various Connection Machines (CM-1, CM-2, CM-2a, CM-200 and the successor CM-5 in a completely different package design) at 70 installations around the world. The following machines\r have been preserved in museum collections. Machines are not always on exhibit - see notes.\n  CM-2a:  Mus\u00e9e Bolo, Lausanne, Switzerland  (Permanent exhibit)  \r (\r The CM-2a is a single cube package by Mark Harrison.)", "posttime":

been put up for sale online, making this one of the largest LinkedIn data leaks to date. And after making contact with the seller, we have updated this article with more information, including how the data was obtained and the possible impact on LinkedIn users.\n Many people trust LinkedIn with all sorts of private data, hoping and trusting that the information remains in safe hands. But is this trust warranted? So far in 2021, we have already seen two separate incidents where bad actors have exploited the professional networking platform to harvest vast amounts of user data.\n The implications of this are far-ranging, from identity theft to phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, and more. Before we dive into the consequences of this leak, let\u2019s first examine what happened.\n  On June 22nd, a user of a popular hacker advertised data from  700 Million LinkedIn users for sale. The user of the forum posted up a  sample of the data that includes  1 million LinkedIn users. We examined the sample and found it to contain the following information:\n   The user claims that the complete database contains the personal information of 700 Million LinkedIn users. Since LinkedIn has 756 million users, according to its website, this would mean that  92% of all LinkedIn users can be found in these records.\n Below is a small section of the sample we examined to show you how much information one record can contain:\n  Based on our analysis and cross-checking data from the sample with other publicly available information, it appears all  data is authentic and tied to real users. Additionally, the data  does appear to be up to date, with samples from 2020 to 2021.\n While we did not find login credentials or financial data in the samples we examined, there is still a treasure trove of information for bad actors to exploit for financial gain, as we\u2019ll explain more below.\n  We reached out directly to the user who is posting the data up for sale on the hacking forum. He claims the data was obtained by  exploiting the LinkedIn API to harvest information that people upload to the site.\n  We have also reached out to LinkedIn for comment on this latest data leak, but have not yet heard back.\n  While this latest LinkedIn leak did not contain any financial records or login credentials, there are still serious consequences. This is because it puts 700+ million people at risk of:\n  Cybercriminals can use the information found in the leaked files with other data in order to create  full detailed profiles of their potential victims. Additionally, bad actors can use the available data, particularly usernames, emails, and personal information, to gain access to other accounts.\n Above all else, this information exposes LinkedIn users to a higher risk of exploitation by bad actors.\n   This leads us to an interesting question. Should companies be held liable when user data is exploited by bad actors? In this specific case, it does not appear that LinkedIn servers were hacked or there was a full \u201cbreach\u201d in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, however, the  data was harvested through LinkedIn\u2019s own API ( application program interface) by threat actors.\n   We\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again: any business, individual, or entity that has control over your private data puts you at risk. Whether this risk is minimal or vast depends on the data, who is securing it, and the consequences of it being lost.\n To minimize this risk, you need to  limit the amount of data that is available to others.\n This could include getting off of all social networks entirely, or limiting the information you share. Using products and services that don\u2019t harvest your personal information for profit is also crucial. We have reviewed some of the best options with:\n Secure browsers that respect your privacy and don\u2019t collect your data for advertising networks\n Secure and private email services that don\u2019t sell access to your inbox or comb through your emails\n And of course, you should remain vigilant to all potential attacks while continuing to safeguard your personal information.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:38", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u6570\u636e,data", "title": "\u65b0\u7684LinkedIn\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u8ba9700M\u7528\u6237\u66b4\u9732 ", "title_en": "New LinkedIn Data Leak Leaves 700M Users Exposed", "transed": 1, "url": "https://restoreprivacy.com/linkedin-data-leak-700-million-users/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u6570\u636e", "data"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "5b900a719c231f0a2f757c286159e04f.jpeg", "infoid": 1068512, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u6211\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u67d0\u79cd\u9b45\u529b\u6ce1\u6cab\u4e2d\u793e\u4ea4\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u53ea\u80fd\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u559c\u6b22\u65b0\u7684QR\u7801\u9910\u5385\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u4eba\u4e2d\u542c\u5230\u3002\u6211\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u662f\u597930\u5c81\u7684\u5355\u8eab\u5973\u58eb\uff0c\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u5979\u559c\u6b22\u73b0\u5728\u8981\u6c42\u5ba2\u6237\u67e5\u770b\u83dc\u5355\uff0c\u8ba2\u5355\u548c\u652f\u4ed8\u7684\u9910\u9986\u901a\u8fc7QR\u7801\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u804c\u8d23\u3002 \uff08\u8fd9\u79cd\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u81ea\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u4ee5\u6765\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9910\u5385\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u6211\u4f1a\u6109\u5feb\u5730\u652f\u4ed8\u4e00\u5bb6\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u4eba\u5458\u9910\u5385\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u652f\u4ed8\u751f\u6d3b\u5de5\u8d44\u3002\uff09\u6211\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u4eec\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u540c\u4e8b\u4eec\u8bf4\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7fa4\u670b\u53cb\u4eec\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u7528\u5206\u88c2\u652f\u7968\u6597\u4e89\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u4e0e\u5173\u4e8e\u8c01\u5728\u8c01\u83b7\u5f97\u8d26\u5355\u7684\u4f19\u8ba1\u4eec\u7684\u5c34\u5c2c\u8c08\u8bdd\u3002\n      \u6211\u60f3\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u770b\u5230\u5979\u6765\u81ea\u54ea\u91cc\u3002\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u675f\u7684\u7cdf\u7cd5\u65e5\u671f\u6216\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u7b49\u5f85\u6536\u5230\u5e76\u652f\u4ed8\u652f\u7968\u53ef\u4ee5\u611f\u5230\u53ef\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0d\u5750\u5750\u4e0b\u7684\u9910\u9986\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4ed6\u4eec\u60f3\u8981\u4e00\u987f\u4ee5\u6781\u5ea6\u4fbf\u5229\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u996d\u83dc\u3002\u968f\u7740\u51e0\u540d\u9910\u5385\u5de5\u4eba\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u671f\u95f4\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff0c\u9910\u5385\u51fa\u4e8e\u70ed\u60c5\u70b9\u8bc4\u3002\u5bf9\u6211\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u83dc\u5355\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u56f0\u6270\u7684\u4e50\u8da3\u662f\u5bf9\u7528\u9910\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6211\u8ba9\u6211\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u665a\u5bb4\u4e0a\u6a21\u4eff\u5b83\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u521a\u521a\u62e5\u6709\u6700\u5b64\u7acb\uff0c\u5c4f\u5e55\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u4e00\u5e74\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u719f\u6089\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u66f4\u6709\u5f62\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8f83\u5c11\u51b7\u9177\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u5e26\u8d70\u5b83\u3002 ", "note_en": "Before the pandemic, I\u2019d shudder at the sight of a restaurant table full of people all staring at their phones. I was always happy not to be them or be sitting with them.  I always kept the lively conversation flowing at my table.  I had good boundaries between my on- and offline lives. But now, restaurants around the world have nonconsensually turned us all into the people I used to judge. I hate it. And it\u2019s time for us to go back.\n    It all started when outdoor dining resumed after initial waves of mandated closures last spring. Wary of wayward coronaviruses lingering on physical menus, restaurants taped QR codes to their tables and outsourced the act of menu delivery to the diner and her smartphone. This might have made sense when it still seemed possible that the coronavirus was largely spreading through surface transmission. But we now know that the risk of infection via a contaminated surface  is low. In tons of communities across the U.S., vaccination rates are high and COVID-19 case rates are low. People are attending indoor concerts, grinding at dance clubs, and heading back to the office. And yet, even as we eat and slobber and sneeze in restaurants seated at full capacity, in many of those establishments, we\u2019re still obliged to use our own smartphones to figure out what we want to eat. Why? Why should we be scared to go back to touching a communal piece of paper when we\u2019re already breathing one another\u2019s theoretically more dangerous air?\n        The obvious pitfalls of the QR code menu were well worth the aggravation as a temporary public health measure, and I truly feel for restaurant owners and workers who\u2019ve been forced to redesign their businesses every few months in response to changing municipal regulations and public health findings. But the QR code\u2019s continued ubiquity well into the era of the low surface transmission consensus and the full reopening of public spaces has me worried that digital-only menus will be one pandemic modification that becomes a permanent element of public life. Maybe restaurant owners will welcome the demise of physical menus as a way to eliminate one small but constant expense. Maybe their employees will relish their newfound freedom from the hassle of reprinting menus every time there\u2019s a new seasonal entree on offer. Maybe it will free servers from patrons who always seem to want to order the one dish that\u2019s out of stock. (It can be easily deleted from a digital menu as soon as it runs out.) Maybe diners who already love scrolling on their phones at restaurants will be more than happy to check out the menu there, too. Other customers may be content to touch one less surface that might be stained with food or invisibly smeared with another person\u2019s snot.\n      Not I! I\u2019m tired of having to navigate a new digital platform every time I eat out. I despise spending the first 10 minutes of a social engagement on my phone. I never again want to encounter, as I did last week, a QR code that leads to a website where  each of the seven menu pages is a separate PDF that must be clicked, zoomed in on, and closed before moving on to the next.\n  If you think I\u2019m being overdramatic, let me ask you this: Have you gone to a restaurant with your boomer parents during the pandemic? If not, have you ever had to teach your boomer parents how to set up a Roku or connect their printer to Bluetooth? Same tedious, excruciating, relationship-straining thing. One of my family members is in his late 70s, loves dining out, and only owns a flip phone with no internet connectivity. He\u2019s already excluded from much of our increasingly digital society; before the pandemic, the American restaurant was one of the few places left where he was entirely comfortable with the mores and knew exactly what was expected of him when he walked through the door. Now, he never knows what to anticipate or what he\u2019ll be asked to do when he goes out for lunch.\n      Default-digital menus are alienating for other kinds of customers, too. Critics have rightly noted that the  cashless trend in food and retail is prohibitive for customers who don\u2019t have bank accounts. Likewise, for a customer who doesn\u2019t have a smartphone or robust data plan\u2014including about  one-quarter of adults with household incomes below $30,000 per year\u2014a QR code menu means having to ask for special accommodations she never used to need. Ditto foreign travelers, whose smartphones may not work on U.S. soil. QR codes also  open the door for easily executed scams, malware, and digital surveillance. There is no good reason to add an exclusionary, risky, socially deadening digital step to an analog system that was working just fine before the pandemic hit.\n    Some restaurants have taken it even further, digitizing not just the menu but the entire dining experience. Two months ago, I ate outdoors at a Basque restaurant that used to have fantastic service on its outdoor patio. This time, it required diners to page through an extensive website that held its menu options. We had to place food and drink orders on an online platform and punch in our credit card information on our tiny phone keyboards with our big, dumb fingers. Then, we had to wait for a notification on our phones to tell us our drinks were ready to pick up indoors. When we decided to order a second bottle of cider midway through the meal, we had to place a whole new order online. It felt more like ordering takeout or shopping on Amazon than dining out.\n      It is possible that I socialize in some kind of Luddite bubble, but I\u2019ve only ever heard from one person who loves the new QR code restaurant experience. My colleague, a single woman in her 30s in D.C., said she likes the restaurants that now require customers to view the menu, order,  and pay via QR code, fully eliminating most of a server\u2019s responsibilities. (This mode of operation may make sense for restaurants that have faced  staffing shortages since reopening. I will happily pay higher prices at an adequately staffed restaurant that pays a living wage.) Since each diner orders and pays on her own, my colleague said, it\u2019s made it easier to dine with groups of friends who might have otherwise struggled with splitting a check, and it\u2019s preempted awkward conversations with guys on dates about who\u2019s getting the bill.\n      I suppose I can see where she\u2019s coming from. During a bad date or a social interaction that\u2019s reached its natural end, the wait to receive and pay the check can feel interminable. But people don\u2019t visit sit-down restaurants because they want a meal marked by extreme convenience and speed. As several restaurant workers have told me during the pandemic,  diners come to restaurants for hospitality. For me, the pleasure of poring over a physical menu is so integral to the experience of dining out that I  made my friends mimic it during an early-pandemic dinner over Zoom. We\u2019ve all just had the most isolated, screen-mediated year of our lives. If there\u2019s an opportunity for us to make a familiar social interaction more tangible and human, and less coldly transactional, let\u2019s take it.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u83dc\u5355,menus,\u9910\u5385", "title": "\u5e26\u56de\u83dc\u5355\uff0cQR\u7801\u662f\u53ef\u6015\u7684 ", "title_en": "Bring back menus, QR codes are terrible", "transed": 1, "url": "https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/06/bring-back-menus-end-qr-codes.html?via=rss", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u83dc\u5355", "menus", "\u9910\u5385"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4ac7b3fafb966aad80cfb00e4b0a8b41.png", "infoid": 1068511, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9Wioguard VPN\u96a7\u9053\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u5f7c\u6b64\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5728\u5bb6\u91cc\uff0c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u3002\n  Wiretrustee\u4f7f\u7528\u5728PION / ICE\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684WebRTC Ice\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u8bbe\u5907\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u63a5\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002\n  \u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u5bf9\u7b49\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7528Wioguard\u952e\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u67e5\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u8def\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5171Wiguard\u952e\u3002\n \u5076\u5c14\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684NAT\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7ea7NAT\uff09\uff0cNAT-Traversal\u662f\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b64\u4e8b\u9879\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u56de\u9000\uff08\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u5b89\u5168\u7684Wireguard\u96a7\u9053\u3002 Coturn\u662f\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u548c\u7ffb\u8f6cWiretrustee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\n  Wioguard\u5bc6\u94a5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u7b49\u952e\u5e76\u5728WireTrustee\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n \u5bf9\u7b49\u5730\u5740\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u914d\u7f6eWiretrustee\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u5fc5\u987b\u6307\u5b9a\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u672c\u5730\u5730\u5740\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c10.30.30.1/24\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n                      \u5bf9\u4e8eWindows Systems\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728PowerShell\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u547d\u4ee4\u5c06WireTrustee\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\uff1a \nCD C\uff1a\\ path \\ to \\ wiretrustee \\ bin\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1--help\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1\u5b89\u88c5\uff03\u8fd9\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6743\u9650\u624d\u80fd\u5b89\u88c5\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunurls stun\uff1astun.wiretrustee.com\uff1a3468\uff0cstun\uff1astun.l.google.com\uff1a19302 \\ --turnurls\uff06lt;\u8f6c\u52a8\u7528\u6237\uff06gt ;:\uff06lt;\u6253\u5f00\u5bc6\u7801\uff06gt;

At home, the office, or anywhere else.\n  Wiretrustee uses WebRTC ICE implemented in  pion/ice library to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between devices.\n  Contents of the messages sent between peers through the signaling server are encrypted with Wireguard keys, making it impossible to inspect them.The routing of the messages on a Signalling server is based on public Wireguard keys.\n Occasionally, the NAT-traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT).For that matter, there is support for a relay server fallback (TURN) and a secure Wireguard tunnel is established via TURN server. Coturn is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in Wiretrustee setups.\n  Wireguard key management. In consequence, you need to generate peer keys and specify them on Wiretrustee initialization step. This feature is on the roadmap.\n Peer address management. You have to specify a unique peer local address (e.g. 10.30.30.1/24) when configuring Wiretrustee. This feature is on the roadmap.\n                      For Windows systems, we can use the service command to configure Wiretrustee as a service by running the following commands in Powershell:\n cd C: \\path \\to \\wiretrustee \\bin. \\wiretrustee.exe service --help. \\wiretrustee.exe service install   # This will prompt for administrator permissions in order to install a new service\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302 \\ --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468 \\ --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000 \\ --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24 \\ --log-level info\n  . \\wiretrustee.exe init   `  --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302  ` --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468   `  --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000  ` --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24   `  --log-level info\n It is important to mention that the  wgLocalAddr parameter has to be unique across your network.E.g. if you have Peer A with  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.1/24 then another Peer B can have  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.2/24\n If for some reason, you already have a generated Wireguard key, you can specify it with the  --wgKey parameter.If not specified, then a new one will be generated, and its corresponding public key will be output to the log.A new config will be generated and stored under  /etc/wiretrustee/config.json\n       sudo wiretrustee up --log-level info   # orsudo wiretrustee up --log-level info  &amp;   # to run it in background\n         This will launch the Signal server on port 10000, in case you want to change the port, use the flag --port.\n  We have packed the Signal server into docker image. You can pull the image from Docker Hub and execute it with the following commands:\n  The default log-level is set to INFO, if you need you can change it using by updating the docker cmd as followed:\n   Under infrastructure_files we have a docker-compose example to run both, Wiretrustee Signal server and an instance of  Coturn, it also provides a turnserver.conf file as a simple example of Coturn configuration.You can edit the turnserver.conf file and change its Realm setting (defaults to wiretrustee.com) to your own domain and user setting (defaults to username1:password1) to  proper credentials.\n The example is set to use the official images from Wiretrustee and Coturn, you can find our documentation to run the signal server in docker in [Running the Signal service](#Running the Signal service) and the Coturn official documentation  here.\n Run Coturn at your own risk, we are just providing an example, be sure to follow security best practices and to configure proper credentials as this service can be exploited and you may face large data transfer charges.\n Also, if you have an SSL certificate you can modify the docker-compose.yml file to point to its files in your host machine, then switch the domainname to your own SSL domain. If you don&#39;t already have an SSL certificate, you can follow  Certbot&#39;s official documentationto generate one from  Let\u2019s Encrypt, or, we found that the example provided by  BigBlueButton covers the basics to configure Coturn with Let&#39;s Encrypt certs.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u7f51\u72b6,wireguard,wiretrustee", "title": "WireTrustee\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eWioguard\u7684\u7f51\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc ", "title_en": "Wiretrustee: WireGuard-Based Mesh Network", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u7f51\u72b6", "wireguard"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068509, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86javascript\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd\uff06\uff0339;\u865a\u62dfDom\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u7684\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u793a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u6bd4\u771f\u6b63\u7684dom\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u56e0 - \u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u95ee\u4e86\u5728\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62dfDOM\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5feb\u901f\u5feb\u901f\u3002\n    \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u6e32\u67d3\uff08\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6b64\u7b80\u5355\u7684React\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\n    ...\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684 - \u4ee3\u8868\u9875\u9762\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u865a\u62dfDOM\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u60a8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff06\uff0339;

It&#39;s a surprisingly resilient meme \u2014 for example people have asked how Svelte can be fast when it doesn&#39;t use a virtual DOM.\n    In many frameworks, you build an app by creating  render() functions, like this simple  React component:\n    ...but the result is the same \u2014 an object representing how the page should now look. That object is the virtual DOM. Every time your app&#39;s state updates (for example when the  name prop changes), you create a new one. The framework&#39;s job is to  reconcile the new one against the old one, to figure out what changes are necessary and apply them to the real DOM.\n   Misunderstood claims about virtual DOM performance date back to the launch of React. In  Rethinking Best Practices, a seminal 2013 talk by former React core team member Pete Hunt, we learned the following:\n This is actually extremely fast, primarily because most DOM operations tend to be slow. There&#39;s been a lot of performance work on the DOM, but most DOM operations tend to drop frames.\n  But hang on a minute! The virtual DOM operations are  in addition to the eventual operations on the real DOM. The only way it could be faster is if we were comparing it to a less efficient framework (there were plenty to go around back in 2013!), or arguing against a straw man \u2014 that the alternative is to do something no-one actually does:\n   React is not magic. Just like you can drop into assembler with C and beat the C compiler, you can drop into raw DOM operations and DOM API calls and beat React if you wanted to. However, using C or Java or JavaScript is an order of magnitude performance improvement because you don&#39;t have to worry...about the specifics of the platform. With React you can build applications without even thinking about performance and the default state is fast.\n    Not exactly. It&#39;s more like &#39;the virtual DOM is usually fast enough&#39;, but with certain caveats.\n The original promise of React was that you could re-render your entire app on every single state change without worrying about performance. In practice, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s turned out to be accurate. If it was, there&#39;d be no need for optimisations like  shouldComponentUpdate (which is a way of telling React when it can safely skip a component).\n Even with  shouldComponentUpdate, updating your entire app&#39;s virtual DOM in one go is a lot of work. A while back, the React team introduced something called React Fiber which allows the update to be broken into smaller chunks. This means (among other things) that updates don&#39;t block the main thread for long periods of time, though it doesn&#39;t reduce the total amount of work or the time an update takes.\n   Most obviously,  diffing isn&#39;t free. You can&#39;t apply changes to the real DOM without first comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous snapshot. To take the earlier  HelloMessage example, suppose the  name prop changed from &#39;world&#39; to &#39;everybody&#39;.\n Both snapshots contain a single element. In both cases it&#39;s a  &lt;div&gt;, which means we can keep the same DOM node\n We enumerate all the attributes on the old  &lt;div&gt; and the new one to see if any need to be changed, added or removed. In both cases we have a single attribute \u2014 a  className with a value of  &#34;greeting&#34;\n Descending into the element, we see that the text has changed, so we&#39;ll need to update the real DOM\n Of these three steps, only the third has value in this case, since \u2014 as is the case in the vast majority of updates \u2014 the basic structure of the app is unchanged. It would be much more efficient if we could skip straight to step 3:\n  (This is almost exactly the update code that Svelte generates. Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Svelte is a compiler that knows at  build time how things could change in your app, rather than waiting to do the work at  run time.)\n   The diffing algorithms used by React and other virtual DOM frameworks are fast. Arguably, the greater overhead is in the components themselves. You wouldn&#39;t write code like this...\n  ...because you&#39;d be carelessly recalculating  value on every update, regardless of whether  props.foo had changed. But it&#39;s extremely common to do unnecessary computation and allocation in ways that seem much more benign:\n function  MoreRealisticComponent ( props )  {  const  [selected , setSelected ]  =  useState ( null ) ;  return  (  &lt;div &gt;  &lt;p &gt;Selected  {selected  ? selected .name  :  &#39;nothing&#39; } &lt; /p &gt;  &lt;ul &gt;  {props .items . map ( item  =&gt;  &lt;li &gt;  &lt;button onClick = { ( )  =&gt;  setSelected (item ) } &gt;  {item .name }  &lt; /button &gt;  &lt; /li &gt;  ) }  &lt; /ul &gt;  &lt; /div &gt;  ) ; }\n Here, we&#39;re generating a new array of virtual  &lt;li&gt; elements \u2014 each with their own inline event handler \u2014 on every state change, regardless of whether  props.items has changed. Unless you&#39;re unhealthily obsessed with performance, you&#39;re not going to optimise that. There&#39;s no point. It&#39;s plenty fast enough. But you know what would be even faster?  Not doing that.\n  The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to &#39;death by a thousand cuts&#39; with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it&#39;s time to optimise.\n    It&#39;s important to understand that virtual DOM  isn&#39;t a feature. It&#39;s a means to an end, the end being declarative, state-driven UI development. Virtual DOM is valuable because it allows you to build apps without thinking about state transitions, with performance that is  generally good enough. That means less buggy code, and more time spent on creative tasks instead of tedious ones.\n But it turns out that we can achieve a similar programming model without using virtual DOM \u2014 and that&#39;s where Svelte comes in.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:01:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u865a\u62df,dom", "title": "\u865a\u62dfDOM\u662f\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff082018\uff09 ", "title_en": "Virtual DOM is pure overhead (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u865a\u62df", "dom"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0cfce70aa621e219e9420dd61ad18913.png", "infoid": 1068508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51faGithub Copilot\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002 github copilot\u4ece\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7ed8\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6574\u884c\u6216\u6574\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0API\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5f53\u60a8\u952e\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7b26\u5408\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n GitHub Copilot\u4e0eOpenai\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7531Openai\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u7535\u3002 Openai Codex\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684GPT-3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u57f9\u8bad\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u5927\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002 GitHub Copilot\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u5bf9\u4e8ePython\uff0cJavaScript\uff0cCyperscript\uff0cRuby\u548cGo\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u3002\n \u5728GitHub CopIlot\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u7684\u6591\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4eca\u5929\u6ce8\u518c\uff01 ", "note_en": "Today, we are launching a technical preview of  GitHub Copilot, a new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code.

There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. Andyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when Iwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.  One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you&#39;llhave to work very hard. I wasn&#39;t sure of that as a kid. Schoolworkvaried in difficulty; one didn&#39;t always have to work super hard todo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed todo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hardwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.There isn&#39;t.  The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had lowstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do thingseffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.  Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural abilitytoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but todo the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot  and to be trying very hard.  [  1]  Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in businessin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. &#34;I nevertook a day off in my twenties,&#34; he said. &#34;Not one.&#34; It was similarwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youthcoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent buthis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probablyget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I hadto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no oneever worked harder. At 74, he wrote with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one&#39;s toes and makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases twenty times.\nSounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds evenmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had aboutas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they alsoworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.  That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hardto grasp. There&#39;s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comespartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, andpartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talentand great drive are both rare, then people with both are raresquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have lessof the other. But you&#39;ll need both if you want to be an outlieryourself. And since you can&#39;t really change how much natural talentyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reducesto working very hard.  It&#39;s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some techniqueto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, andnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of disciplineseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they wantit.  What I&#39;ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goalsthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You&#39;llprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.  The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be workingwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarmbells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m workinghard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and itfeels awful. [  2]  There wasn&#39;t a single point when I learned this. Like most littlekids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or didsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling ofdisgust when I wasn&#39;t achieving anything. The one precisely dateablelandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age\u00a013.  Several people I&#39;ve talked to remember getting serious about workaround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started tofind idleness distasteful, he said I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday.\nPerhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.  Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious aboutwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was beforeI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, becauseeven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entiredepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of realwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they&#39;dbeen made for each another.  I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they canlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in  A Mathematician&#39;sApology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any  passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively.\nHe didn&#39;t learn what math was really about till part way throughcollege, when he read Jordan&#39;s  Cours d&#39;analyse. I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant.\nThere are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn todiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kindHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they&#39;readapted to be taught to kids \u2014 often so distorted that they&#39;renothing like the work done by actual practitioners. [  3]The otherkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some typesof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.  There&#39;s a kind of solidity to real work. It&#39;s not all writing the Principia, but it all feels necessary. That&#39;s a vague criterion,but it&#39;s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot ofdifferent types. [  4]  Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how manyhours a day to spend on it. You can&#39;t solve this problem by simplyworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there&#39;s apoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.  That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.I&#39;ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits weredifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing orprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was runninga startup, I couldwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I&#39;dkept going much longer, I&#39;d probably have needed to take occasionalvacations. [  5]  The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate asensitivity to the quality of the work you&#39;re doing, and then you&#39;llnotice if it decreases because you&#39;re working too hard. Honesty iscritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you&#39;rebeing lazy, but also when you&#39;re working too hard. And if you thinkthere&#39;s something admirable about working too hard, get that ideaout of your head. You&#39;re not merely getting worse results, butgetting them because you&#39;re showing off \u2014 if not to other people,then to yourself. [  6]  Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work andyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to beconstantly judging both how hard you&#39;re trying and how well you&#39;redoing.  Trying hard doesn&#39;t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.There may be some people do who, but I think my experience is fairlytypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I&#39;mstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That&#39;swhen I&#39;m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, Itend to keep going.  What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was workingon Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinatedat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beastby doing it, why wait?  [  7]Whereas what drives me now, writingessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. Butonce I get started on one, I don&#39;t have to push myself to work,because there&#39;s always some error or omission already pushing me.  I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Manyproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuffat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to theextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you&#39;llonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you shouldalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.  The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of theseproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at thecenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones atthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved inworking on a specific problem, you&#39;ll occasionally have to makebig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward thecenter \u2014 toward the most ambitious problems.  By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the currentconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems aremost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specificfields. If you disagree with it, and you&#39;re right, that couldrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.  The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but althoughyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treatdifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If youdiscover some ambitious type of work that&#39;s a bargain in the senseof being easier for you than other people, either because of theabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you&#39;vefound to approach it, or simply because you&#39;re more excited aboutit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done bypeople who find an easy way to do something hard.  As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure outwhich kind you&#39;re suited for. And that doesn&#39;t just mean figuringout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn&#39;tmean that if you&#39;re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. Whatyou&#39;re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps evenmore on your interests. A   deep interest in a topic makes peoplework harder than any amount of discipline can.  It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start tobe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is asubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerfulsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you reallyinterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you&#39;ll makea lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,or because your parents want you to? [  8]  The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormouslyfrom one person to another. That&#39;s one of the most important thingsI&#39;ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get theimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do isfigure out what it is. That&#39;s how it works in movies, and in thestreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that wayin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children andjust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlesslyfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identifyone as their calling \u2014 we can wish Newton spent more time on mathand physics and less on alchemy and theology \u2014 but this is an  illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.  So while some people&#39;s lives converge fast, there will be otherswhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out whatto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoingpart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For thesepeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: alongwith measuring both how hard you&#39;re working and how well you&#39;redoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working inthis field or switch to another. If you&#39;re working hard but notgetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simpleexpressed that way, but in practice it&#39;s very difficult. You shouldn&#39;tgive up on the first day just because you work hard and don&#39;t getanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how muchtime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops goingwell? How much time do you give yourself then? [  9]  What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.If you&#39;re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may noteven know what good results look like. History is full of examplesof people who misjudged the importance of what they were workingon.  The best test of whether it&#39;s worthwhile to work on something iswhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerouslysubjective measure, but it&#39;s probably the most accurate one you&#39;regoing to get. You&#39;re the one working on the stuff. Who&#39;s in a betterposition than you to judge whether it&#39;s important, and what&#39;s abetter predictor of its importance than whether it&#39;s interesting?  For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.Indeed, that&#39;s the most striking thing about the whole question ofworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest withyourself.  Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It&#39;s a complicated,dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. Youhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kindyou&#39;re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as youcan, accurately judge at each moment both what you&#39;re capable ofand how you&#39;re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you canwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is toocomplicated to trick. But if you&#39;re consistently honest andclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, andyou&#39;ll be productive in a way few people are.             Notes  [  1]In &#34;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&#34; I said the three ingredientsin great work work were natural ability, determination, and interest.That&#39;s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interestyield practice and effort.  [  2]I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You&#39;ll oftenget somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution toa problem comes to you while taking a   shower, or even in your sleep,but only because you were working hard on it the day before.  It&#39;s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,I like to learn new things. I wouldn&#39;t like just sitting on a beach.  [  3]The thing kids do in school that&#39;s most like the real versionis sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games playedin schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactlywhat adults do.  In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretendingto do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.Arguably the latter is no worse.  [  4]Knowing what you want to work on doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be ableto. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on thingsthey don&#39;t want to, especially early on. But if you know what youwant to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.  [  5]The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution tothe problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switchto harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.  [  6]Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. Idon&#39;t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of somethingimportant and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doingthings that don&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t know enough to say for sure whetherit&#39;s net good or bad, but my guess is bad.  [  7]One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is thatstartups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be bothdecisive and conspicuous.  [  8]It&#39;s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You needto solve the money problem somehow, and there&#39;s nothing wrong withdoing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I supposeit would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you&#39;re conscious of yourmotivations. The thing to avoid is  unconsciously letting the needfor money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find mostinteresting.  [  9]Many people face this question on a smaller scale withindividual projects. But it&#39;s easier both to recognize and to accepta dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of workentirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like aSpanish Flu victim, you&#39;re fighting your own immune system: Insteadof giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And whocan say you&#39;re not right?

Early in the development of new technologies, the first category tends to get more attention, but it\u2019s the second that ends up having more impact on the world.\n Doing old things better tends to get more attention early on because it\u2019s easier to imagine what to build. Early films were shot like plays \u2014 they were effectively plays with a better distribution model \u2014 until filmmakers realized that movies had their own visual grammar. The early electrical grid delivered light better than gas and candles. It took decades before we got an electricity \u201capp store\u201d \u2014 a rich ecosystem of appliances that connected to the grid. The early web was mostly digital adaptations of pre-internet things like letter writing and mail-order commerce. It wasn\u2019t until the 2000s that entrepreneurs started exploring \u201cinternet native\u201d ideas like social networking, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, crowdsourced knowledge bases, and so on.\n The most common mistake people make when evaluating new technologies is to focus too much on the \u201cdoing old things better\u201d category. For example, when evaluating the potential of blockchains, people sometimes focus on things like cheaper and faster global payments, which are important and necessary but only the beginning. What\u2019s even more exciting are the new things you simply couldn\u2019t create before, like internet services that are  owned and operated by their users instead of by companies. Another example is business productivity apps architected as web services. Early products like Salesforce were easier to access and cheaper to maintain than their on-premise counterparts. Modern productivity apps like Google Docs, Figma, and Slack focus on things you simply couldn\u2019t do before, like real-time collaboration and deep integrations with other apps.\n Entrepreneurs who create products in the \u201cbrand new things\u201d category usually spend many years deeply immersed in the underlying technology before they have their key insights. The products they create often  start out looking toy-like,  strange, unserious, expensive, and sometimes even dangerous. Over time, the products steadily improve and the world gradually embraces them.\n It can take decades for this process to play out. It\u2019s clear that we are early in the development of emerging technologies like cryptocurrencies, machine learning, and virtual reality. It is also possible we are still early in the development of more established technologies like mobile devices, cloud hosting, social networks, and perhaps even the internet itself. If so, new categories of native products built on top of these technologies will continue to be invented in the coming years.\n Views expressed in \u201ccontent\u201d (including posts, podcasts, videos) linked on this website or posted in social media and other platforms (collectively, \u201ccontent distribution outlets\u201d) are my own and are not the views of AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

known for leaking the latest Apple products on YouTube or via his new website Front Page Tech - has published the allegations on  his website.\n  The article - which isn&#39;t actually penned by Prosser, but rather Corina Garcia - confronts Apple with the accusation of spying on its own employees in order to prevent these leaks. Which doesn&#39;t sit well with a company that positions itself as a defender of privacy.\n    According to the Front Page Tech article, some employees now have to wear cameras on their bodies &#34;to ensure that its hardware trade secrets stay out of the hands of leakers like our very own, Jon Prosser.&#34; It is said that this is a camera similar to the Axon Body 2, which is used by the US police.\n  The manufacturer describes the Axon Body 2 the ideal video solution for emergency services worldwide. It offers HD recording, advanced audio and easy upload to Evidence.com.\n  Front Page Tech indicates that Apple has only implemented this recording technology with some of its teams, and only in the past few weeks: &#34;To clarify, specific Apple teams only. Not all Apple employees are being made to wear the sophisticated tech&#34;.\n  Apple has recently targeted Apple leakers such as Kang and concept artist Concept Creator Jermaine. Read:  Apple threatens leakers with legal action.\n  The irony is that of all people the leaker to whom Apple no longer wanted to pass on information was the first to bring information of these drastic measures to the public.\n  So far, this accusation has not been confirmed by any other source, which is why quite a lot of questions remain unanswered. If the accusation is correct, can the employees who are allegedly forced to wear these cameras also switch them off if necessary? Like when they go to the toilet? Does such a camera actually prevent leaks? After all, employees could also spread the leaks simply from home.\n    Despite these extreme moves, you can understand Apple&#39;s actions: It must be extremely frustrating if the latest products and ideas come to the public long before the official presentation at an Apple event. It is not surprising that people like Prosser are not exactly among Apple&#39;s favourite people. Most recently, for example, thanks to Prosser, rendered images circulated showing the design of the AirTags and the new iMacs before they launched, making the impact of their launch smaller.\n  However, we would argue that people want to read about rumours and leaks and they do read this stuff. Reporting the rumours creates lots of chatter about a new product - and a lot of interest in the products launch. Without this interest in a new product running up to the launch it may not get the attention that it would get otherwise.\n  The only acceptable concern, we believe, is that these secrets could get to Apple&#39;s competitors who might copy new features. This reminds us of the Apple vs Samsung case, which began in 2011 and eventually saw a US court order Samsung to pay $539m (\u00a3403m) in damages to Apple for copying features of the original iPhone.\n    For more information about all the Apple leakers read  Who Is The Best Apple Leaker? and  Which Apple Leakers Is Worth Following.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:59:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u76f8\u673a,apple,\u4f69\u6234,employees,\u82f9\u679c", "title": "Apple\u4f7f\u5458\u5de5\u4f69\u6234\u8f66\u8eab\u76f8\u673a\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u6cc4\u6f0f ", "title_en": "Apple Makes Employees Wear Body Cameras to Control Leaks", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apple-employees-wear-cameras-3806157/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u76f8\u673a", "apple", "\u4f69\u6234", "employees", "\u82f9\u679c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "22c5234eea20fc4caa13187851de03ad.jpg", "infoid": 1068503, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u51b2\u51fb\u8005\u8ba1\u5212\u514d\u8d39\u8d60\u9001\u5982\u4f55\u514d\u8d39\u5236\u4f5c\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u7684\u6307\u793a\u3002 ", "note_en": "These biohackers plan to give away their instructions for how to make insulin for free.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:59:28", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u51b2\u51fb,aim,\u514d\u8d39", "title": "\u751f\u7269\u51b2\u51fb\u8005\u7784\u51c6\u5927\u578b\u5236\u836f\u7684\u8840\u7f18\u83cc\u7d20\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20 ", "title_en": "Biohackers take aim at big pharma\u2019s stranglehold on insulin", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.freethink.com/shows/just-might-work/how-to-make-insulin", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u51b2\u51fb", "aim", "\u514d\u8d39"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "1cdb23c6ae6f962ae669af6b1e38af29.jpg", "infoid": 1068502, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "r\u5e38\u5e38\u5f88\u6df1\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4ee4\u4eba\u6cae\u4e27\u7684\u4e8b\u60c5\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5b83\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u9ed1\u767d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u80a4\u8272\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u5c11\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u5b83\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u634d\u536b\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\uff08\u6697\u6591\u7684\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\uff09\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7d2b\u5916\u7ebf\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ef4\u751f\u7d20D\uff08\u6d45\u8272\u76ae\u80a4\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u76ca\u4f5c\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u8d8a\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u7956\u5148\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u8d64\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ae\u80a4\u82cd\u767d\u7684\u82cd\u767d\u53d1\u5c55\u6210\u4e3a\u3002\n  \u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u90fd\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u975e\u6d32\u7684\u7956\u5148\uff0c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u5927\u9646\u624d\u8ffd\u6c42\u3002\u4eca\u5929\u5927\u591a\u6570\u975e\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u90fd\u6d3b\u7740\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u5927\u7ea660\u4e07\u5e74\u524d\u6beb\u65e0\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u95ef\u5165\u7684\u975e\u6d32\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u7956\u5148\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u82f1\u56fd\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u6700\u53e4\u8001\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4ed6\u975e\u6d32\u7956\u5148\u7684\u9ed1\u76ae\u80a4\u3002\u975e\u6d32\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u957f\u5927\u7684\u5730\u65b9 - \u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u5929\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u9057\u4f20\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n \u521a\u521a\u5f00\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u6d32\u9057\u4f20\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u52aa\u529b\u3002\u8fdf\u5230\u603b\u6bd4\u4e0d\u5230\u597d\u3002\u4e09\u767e\u4e07\u975e\u6d32\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\uff083\uff09\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u9646\u7684\u52aa\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4e3a\u8be5\u5730\u65b9\u4e3a\u6b27\u6d32\uff0c\u5317\u7f8e\u548c\u4e9a\u6d32\u90e8\u4f4d\u505a\u4e9b\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u5373\u76ee\u5f55\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4f4f\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u662f\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u8ff7\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9610\u660eH.

In most parts of the world it is literally a matter of black and white. A person\u2019s skin colour, however, has little biological significance. It is merely a balance between defending the lower layers of the dermis from cancer-causing ultraviolet light (which favours dark skin) and promoting the beneficial role of ultraviolet in the synthesis of vitamin D (which favours light skin). The farther someone\u2019s ancestors lived from the equator, the paler their skin evolved to be.\n  Go back far enough, though, and everyone\u2019s ancestors lived in Africa, the continent where  Homo sapiens originated. Most non-Africans alive today trace the bulk of their ancestry to Africans who burst forth on an unprepared world about 60,000 years ago. Indeed, the oldest representative of the species yet found in Britain retained the dark skin of his African forebears. Africa is where humanity grew up\u2014and where the bulk of human genetic diversity is found to this day.\n Only now is a serious effort beginning to explore Africa\u2019s genetic richness. Better late than never. The  Three Million African Genomes (3 ) project, a continent-wide endeavour, proposes to do for the place what has already been done for Europe, North America and parts of Asia\u2014namely to catalogue and analyse the genetic diversity of those who live there. That will be scientifically fascinating, for it will help elucidate how  H. sapiens evolved. But it will be medically important, too. It may even help erode that black-and-white excuse for racism.\n  Genetic diversity brings with it diversity of genetic disease. Cystic fibrosis\u2014in any case rarer in Africa than in Europe\u2014is often caused there by a different mutation from the one involved in the European version, and is thus missed by tests developed in the West. A mutation responsible in Ghana for 40% of inherited deafness is unknown in South Africa. And so on. It also brings a diversity of genetic response to disease. Some of the molecular details of the immune system, for example, vary with geography. Understanding that variation in Africa will improve understanding of immunity to infection, helping Africans and non-Africans alike.\n  More genetic information will also cast light on evolution. Early  H. sapiens migrants from Africa encountered other species of human being on their travels. These were descendants of previous migrations out of Africa of archaic members of the genus. At least two of these other types of human, the Neanderthals and the Denisovans, interbred with the newcomers, and some of their genes are still found in modern Asians and Europeans, doing various jobs including protecting them from disease. Preliminary analysis suggests that those who remained behind in Africa similarly interbred with yet another species of human\u2014but one of which no fossil record remains.\n There is an irony in all this. Xenophobia has probably existed for as long as people have. But racist attitudes were reinforced in the 19th century by an enthusiasm for physical anthropology and eugenics. The former attempted to classify human beings on the basis of visible characteristics, such as skin colour, head shape and facial features, that are genetically inherited. If this had been a neutral analysis, it would have been unexceptional. But often it was not neutral. It not only classified, but ranked. White-skinned Europeans put themselves at the top\u2014and black-skinned Africans at the bottom. Add eugenics to that mix and the result was toxic.\n The 3  project will not, alone, overthrow the legacy of these misadventures and the prejudices they reinforced. The thinking that gave rise to them is still too deeply ingrained in too many minds for it to do that by itself\u2014even, probably, for it to come close. But to those whose minds are open, a group of 21st-century African scientists revealing that the true, glorious genetic diversity of human beings lies in their own continent more abundantly than in any other will be a superb rebuttal to the doctrines of those misguided Victorian European gentlemen.  \u25a0\n This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline

how  Instant uses the ISO-8601 calendar. Listed the properties of some classes.\n  Date, JavaScript\u2019s current date time API is  infamously difficult to use.  The ECMAScript proposal \u201cTemporal\u201d is a new and better date time API and currently at stage 3. It was created by  Philipp Dunkel,  Maggie Johnson-Pint,  Matt Johnson-Pint,  Brian Terlson,  Shane Carr,  Ujjwal Sharma,  Philip Chimento,  Jason Williams, and  Justin Grant.\n   However, it is not an exhaustive documentation: For many details, you will have to consult  the (excellent) documentation for Temporal.\n       The Temporal date time API is accessible via the global variable  Temporal. It is a pleasure to use:\n All objects are immutable. Changing them produces new values, similarly to how strings work in JavaScript.\n  There are several specialized classes for Temporal values (date time values with time zones, date time values without time zones, date values without time zones, etc.). That has several benefits:\n  The post starts with background knowledge. That will help you with the remainder of the post, but you should be fine without it.\n Next, there is an overview of all the classes of the Temporal API and how they fit together.\n    Apparent solar time (local apparent time): One of the earliest ways of measuring time was to base the current time on the position of the sun. For example, noon is when the sun is directly overhead.\n Mean solar time (local mean time): This time representation corrects the variations of apparent solar time so that each day of the year has the same length.\n Standard time and time zones: Standard time specifies how the clocks within a geographical region are to be synchronized. It was established in the 19th century to support weather forecasting and train travel. In the 20th century, standard time was defined globally and geographical regions became  time zones.\n Wall-clock time is the current time within a time zone (as shown by a clock on the wall). Wall-clock time is also called  local time.\n  UTC, Z, and GMT are ways of specifying time that are similar, but subtly different:\n UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the time standard that all times zones are based on. They are specified relative to it. That is, no country or territory has UTC as its local time zone.\n Z (Zulu Time Zone) is a military time zone that is often used in aviation and the military as another name for UTC+0.\n GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) is a time zone used in some European and African countries. It is UTC plus zero hours and therefore has the same time as UTC.\n    Temporal\u2019s time zones are based on  the IANA Time Zone Database (short: tz database). IANA stands for Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. In that database, each time zone has an identifier and rules defining offsets for UTC times. If a time zone has standard time and daylight saving time, the offsets change during a year:\n const standardTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Europe/Zurich&#39;,  :  1995,  :  11,  :  30,  :  3,  :  24,});assert.equal( standardTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-11-30T03:24:00+01:00[Europe/Zurich]&#39;);  // (A) const daylightSavingTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Europe/Zurich&#39;,  :  1995,  :  5,  :  30,  :  3,  :  24,});assert.equal( daylightSavingTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-05-30T03:24:00+02:00[Europe/Zurich]&#39;);  // (B)\n In standard time, the time offset for the  Europe/Zurich time zone is +1:00 (line A). In daylight saving time, the time offset is +2:00 (line B).\n  \u201cTime Zone Database\u201d on the IANA website is a list of time zone names.\n \u201cList of tz database time zones\u201d on Wikipedia is another list of time zone names.\n \u201cTime Difference\u201d (\u201cZeitverschiebung\u201d) lists time zones for cities etc. \u2013 for example, the time zone for San Francisco is  America/Los_Angeles.\n  The calendars supported by Temporal are based on the standard  Unicode Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) \u2013 among  others:\n  iso8601 is used by most western countries and gets extra support in Temporal, via methods such as  Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO() (which returns the current date and wall-clock time in the system time zone and ISO-8601 calendar).\n  The standards ISO-8601 and RFC 3339 specify how to represent dates in strings. Currently, they are missing functionality that is needed and  added by Temporal:\n       The following code shows what a full date time string looks like. In practice, many of these parts will often be missing:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Africa/Nairobi&#39;,  :  2019,  :  11,  :  30,  :  8,  :  55,  :  0,  :  123,  :  456,  :  789,});assert.equal( zdt.toString({ :  &#39;always&#39;,  :  &#39;nanosecond&#39;}),  &#39;2019-11-30T08:55:00.123456789+03:00[Africa/Nairobi][u-ca=iso8601]&#39;);\n     This section gives an overview of the classes of the Temporal API. They can all be accessed via the global variable  Temporal ( Temporal.Instant,  Temporal.ZonedDateTime, etc.).\n    Wall-clock time (also called  local time or  clock time) varies globally, depending on the time zone of a clock.\n Epoch time is one way of representing exact time: It\u2019s a number counting time units (such as nanoseconds) before or since  Unix epoch (midnight UTC on January 1, 1970).\n   On one hand, we can create instances via the constructor. It accepts the minimal amount of data needed to fully specify the date time value. For example, in the case of the two classes for exact time,  Instant and  ZonedDateTime, the time itself is specified via epoch nanoseconds.\n const epochNanoseconds =  6046761644163000000n; const timeZone =  &#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;;  // San Francisco const zdt1 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime(epochNanoseconds, timeZone);assert.equal( zdt1.toString(),  &#39;2161-08-12T09:00:44.163-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);\n On the other hand, we can create instances via the static factory method  .from(). It is overloaded: Most classes support three kinds of values for its parameter.\n First, if the parameter is an instance of the same class, then that instance is cloned:\n   const zdt3 = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;America/Los_Angeles&#39;,  :  2161,  :  8,  :  12,  :  9,  :  0,  :  44,  :  163,  :  0,  :  0,});assert.equal( zdt3.toString(),  &#39;2161-08-12T09:00:44.163-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);\n   Note that we didn\u2019t need to specify the offset in line A, but it is shown in line B.\n    refIsoDay: reference ISO day, used for disambiguation when using calendars other than the ISO-8601 calendar\n refIsoYear: reference ISO year, used for disambiguation when using calendars other than the ISO-8601 calendar\n Instant uses UTC and an ISO-8601 calendar internally (e.g. for  .toString()), but they are not stored in instances.\n    The object  Temporal.now has several factory methods for creating Temporal values representing the current time:\n      We can use  Temporal.now to access the current time zone of the system. This time zone can change \u2013 for example, when the system travels:\n        Class  Instant represents global exact time. Its time standard is UTC. It is mostly a container for nanoseconds since epoch. That is also reflected by it not having properties such as  .year and  .hour (which  ZonedDateTime and  PlainDateTime have).\n For some operations (such as  .toString()),  Instant internally uses an ISO-8601 calendar, but that calendar is not stored in instances.\n            Time computations where daylight saving time may play a role (\u201cone hour later\u201d)\n // Current time in Melbourne, Australia (in ISO-8601 calendar) const zonedDateTime = Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO(  &#39;Australia/Melbourne&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179753181+10:00[Australia/Melbourne]&#39;);\n        If a class doesn\u2019t have a time zone, Temporal calls it \u201cplain\u201d. There are three timezone-less classes:  PlainDateTime,  PlainDate, and  PlainTime. They are abstract representations of time.\n  Time computations when the time zone doesn\u2019t matter (\u201cThe first Wednesday of May 1998\u201d).\n const zonedDateTime = Temporal.now.zonedDateTimeISO(  &#39;Asia/Novosibirsk&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179+07:00[Asia/Novosibirsk]&#39;); // Get the wall-clock time as a string const plainDateTime = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime()assert.equal( plainDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2021-06-27T10:46:31.179&#39;);\n                // Bastille Day const bastilleDay = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({ :  7,  :  14});assert.equal( bastilleDay.toString(),  &#39;07-14&#39;); // Bastille Day in 1989 in Paris const zonedDateTime = bastilleDay .toPlainDate({ :  1989}) .toZonedDateTime( &#39;Europe/Paris&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1989-07-14T00:00:00+02:00[Europe/Paris]&#39;);\n   All Temporal classes that contain full dates use calendars to help them with various computations. Most code will use the ISO-8601 calendar, but other calendar systems are supported, too.\n  const pd1 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24,  &#39;iso8601&#39;); const pd2 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24, { :  &#39;iso8601&#39;}); const pd3 =  new Temporal.PlainDate( 1992,  2,  24,  new Temporal.Calendar( &#39;iso8601&#39;));\n  Instances of  TimeZone represent time zones. They support IANA time zones, UTC, and UTC offsets. For most use cases, IANA time zones are the best choice because they enable proper handling of daylight saving time.\n  const zdt1 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n,  &#39;America/Lima&#39;); const zdt2 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n, { :  &#39;America/Lima&#39;}); const zdt3 =  new Temporal.ZonedDateTime( 0n,  new Temporal.TimeZone( &#39;America/Lima&#39;));\n  A duration represents a length of time \u2013 for example, 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n              However,  .toString() doesn\u2019t let you hide minutes in this case \u2013 you have to convert the  ZonedDateTime to a  PlainDate if that is what you want:\n   All Temporal date time values have a  .toJSON() method and can therefore be stringified to JSON:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Asia/Singapore]&#39;); // Stringifying a zoned date time directly:assert.equal(  JSON.stringify(zdt),  &#39;&#34;2019-12-01T12:00:00+08:00[Asia/Singapore]&#34;&#39;); // Stringifying a zoned date time inside an object: const obj = { : zdt};assert.equal(  JSON.stringify(obj),  &#39;{&#34;startTime&#34;:&#34;2019-12-01T12:00:00+08:00[Asia/Singapore]&#34;}&#39;);\n If you want to parse JSON with date time values, you need to set up  a JSON reviver.\n  Temporal\u2019s support for converting date time values to human readable strings is similar to   Intl.DateTimeFormat\u2019s:\n const zdt = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Europe/Berlin]&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString(),  &#39;12/1/2019, 12:00:00 PM GMT+1&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString( &#39;de-DE&#39;),  &#39;1.12.2019, 12:00:00 MEZ&#39;);assert.equal( zdt.toLocaleString( &#39;en-GB&#39;, {  :  &#39;long&#39;,  :  &#39;numeric&#39;,  :  &#39;long&#39;,  :  &#39;numeric&#39;, }),  &#39;Sunday, 1 December 2019&#39;);\n       On the other hand, one of the fields exposed by  Instant provides us with the epoch time in milliseconds \u2013 which we can use to create a date:\n    Most date time classes support a rich set of fields such as  .dayOfWeek,  .month, and  .calendar. The notable exception is  Instant, whose time zone and calendar is fixed and whose setup and state is based on epoch time.\n In all other date time classes, we can use the static factory function  .from() to configure instances:\n const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({  :  &#39;Africa/Lagos&#39;,  :  1995,  :  12,  :  7,  :  3,  :  24,  :  30,  :  0,  :  3,  :  500,});assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30.0000035+01:00[Africa/Lagos]&#39;);\n   If we want to change the fields, we need to create a new value via  .with():\n    const dates = [ Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2022-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;), Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2001-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;), Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from( &#39;2009-12-01T12:00[Asia/Tehran]&#39;),];dates.sort(Temporal.ZonedDateTime.compare);assert.deepEqual( dates.map(  d =&gt; d.toString()), [  &#39;2001-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;,  &#39;2009-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;,  &#39;2022-12-01T12:00:00+03:30[Asia/Tehran]&#39;, ]);\n   const instant = Temporal.Instant.from( &#39;1970-01-01T00:00:01Z&#39;); const zonedDateTime = instant.toZonedDateTimeISO( &#39;Europe/Madrid&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01+01:00[Europe/Madrid]&#39;); const plainDateTime1 = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime();assert.equal( plainDateTime1.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01&#39;); const timeZone = Temporal.TimeZone.from( &#39;Europe/Madrid&#39;); const plainDateTime2 = timeZone.getPlainDateTimeFor(instant);assert.equal( plainDateTime2.toString(),  &#39;1970-01-01T01:00:01&#39;);\n  const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00[Europe/Minsk]&#39;); const instant = zonedDateTime.toInstant();assert.equal( instant.toString(),  &#39;2019-12-01T09:00:00Z&#39;); const plainDateTime = zonedDateTime.toPlainDateTime();assert.equal( plainDateTime.toString(),  &#39;2019-12-01T12:00:00&#39;);\n  const plainDateTime = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from(  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30&#39;); const zonedDateTime = plainDateTime.toZonedDateTime( &#39;Europe/Berlin&#39;);assert.equal( zonedDateTime.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T03:24:30+01:00[Europe/Berlin]&#39;); const instant = zonedDateTime.toInstant();assert.equal( instant.toString(),  &#39;1995-12-07T02:24:30Z&#39;);\n     const departure = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2017-05-08T12:55[Europe/Berlin]&#39;);  // Munich const arrival = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from(  &#39;2017-05-08T17:10[America/Los_Angeles]&#39;);  // Seattle const flightTime = departure.until(arrival);assert.equal( flightTime.toString(),  &#39;PT13H15M&#39;);\n    To compute Labor Day (first Monday in September) for a given year, we need to figure out how many days to add to September 1 in order to get to weekday 1 (Monday).\n const mod =  ( a, b) =&gt; ((a % b) + b) % b;  function  ( year) {  const firstOfSeptember = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year,  :  9,  :  1, });  // How many days until Monday?  const MONDAY =  1;  const daysToAdd = mod(MONDAY - firstOfSeptember.dayOfWeek,  7);  return firstOfSeptember.add({ : daysToAdd});}assert.equal( getLaborDay( 2021).toString(),  &#39;2021-09-06&#39;);assert.equal( getLaborDay( 2022).toString(),  &#39;2022-09-05&#39;);\n   Although this proposal&#39;s API is not expected to change, implementers of this proposal MUST NOT ship unflagged Temporal implementations until IETF standardizes timezone/calendar string serialization formats. See  #1450 for updates.\n The proposal links to a polyfill.

", "note_en": "Recognizing that forest ecosystems, like societies, have elements of intelligence would help us leave behind the old notion that they are inert and predictable.\n   Suzanne Simard is a professor of forest ecology at the University of British Columbia. Her latest book is \u201cFinding the Mother Tree\u201d (May 2021). Simard\u2019s life and work were the primary inspiration for a central character in Richard Powers\u2019s 2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u201cThe Overstory.\u201d\n MOUNT ASSINIBOINE, British Columbia \u2014\u00a0November. Snow blanketed the Rocky Mountains. I was on a solo backcountry ski trip, pausing in the pristine cordillera of the Healy Pass. Subalpine firs were bent over in casts of snow and ice, and the whitebark pines were spread-eagled like bouquets of bones, dead from mountain pine beetle and blister rust caused by the stress of climate change.\n I was three months pregnant. In our year apart while my husband Don wrote his dissertation, perhaps because of our loneliness, there came a wordless dawning of the truth that I was 36 and he was 39, and the time for children had come. Skiing into Assiniboine was my celebration of this gift.\n The beetles were on a rampage in the couloir. Four years earlier, in 1992, the outbreak had started northwest of here, in Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Provincial Park; winter temperatures had increased by a few degrees and the coldest months stopped dropping below -30 Celsius, allowing the beetle larvae to thrive in the thick phloem of the aging pines.\n Lodgepole pine had coevolved with the beetles in this landscape, naturally succumbing, after about a century, to create space for the next generation. As the trees declined, fuel accumulated as a matter of course, and wildfires were ignited by lightning or people. Flames released pine seeds from resinous cones and stimulated aspens to sprout from thousand-year-old root systems, their moist leaves reducing the flammability of the young forest. As fire fingered through the landscape, it petered out in these aspen-clad glades, leaving a mosaic of different-aged forests that was itself resistant to future fires.\n But in the late 1800s, European settlers disrupted this balance by burning the forest montage to the ground in search of gold, creating a vast blanket of new pine stands whose uniformity was later enhanced by fire suppression and herbicide spraying that ensured the aspens wouldn\u2019t interfere with profits. As these pine trees turned 100 and the climate warmed, the beetle populations exploded, and the landscape ran red like blood flowing through water.\n The air rushed cleanly into my lungs as I glided among the dead whitebark pines, intoxicated to be following tracks and carving new turns around rockfalls and tree wells. Don was taking the afternoon to build a cradle. Contentment had enveloped us both. But in the heart of the saddle between peaks, I stopped to check some tracks in the fresh snow and felt a familiar rush of fear. The paw prints were as large as saucers, claw marks an inch deep.\n  I skied away, across the pass. Soon, though, I was lost. When I circled back to the center, I shuddered to be back to my original tracks, already frozen in the drifting snow. And covered with fresh prints.\n  I instinctively kept skiing down the pass. Naked alpine larch, clustered in bowls below the peaks, their golden needles already fallen, were behind me. Down here, the subalpine firs were knotted together in small groves, their numbers increasing as I descended. Telemarking with 30 pounds on my back strained my legs. My baby, no bigger than an ounce of gold, didn\u2019t throw off my balance. I cinched up the hip buckle to stabilize myself on the icy, broken terrain and turned slowly, one link at a time.\n I made a large traverse to the east to evade a ravine, avoiding a steep section before heading back. It was hard to see because the trees were tightly spaced. Younger lodgepole pines. There must have been a fire a few decades back. Soon I was off course again and checked my compass. If I didn\u2019t stay oriented and get back to the main route, this could get dire.\n My fear built on some background frustration about my research. I had growing evidence that forests have intelligence \u2014 that they are perceptive and communicative \u2014 but I didn\u2019t feel ready to take on the establishment. The fellows would ignore me or, worse, laugh at my talk of the sentience of plants.\n No, I was pregnant and needed to stay quiet to protect my child, the most precious thing in my life. A recent CBC radio interview had drawn some interest from local naturalists and environmentalists and even a few like-minded foresters, but it was met with silence from the provincial capital. Without even so much as an email from the policy guys, I wondered whether giving interviews was worth it. Or talks at conferences, for that matter. I couldn\u2019t go public more than I already had; there was too much at stake now.\n I skied back about 300 feet and found old tracks from earlier skiers. The wolf prints crossed them three times. It looked like at least five animals.\n I skied farther. The lodgepole pine trees grew sparser, and their puffy crowns reached closer to the ground. There should be a special word for the type of mourning you know is to come. In a decade, almost 45 million acres of mature pine forest would be dead, representing about a third of the forested area of British Columbia. The beetles would continue to chew their way through whitebark, western white and ponderosa pines, through the U.S. from Oregon to Yellowstone, and would start infesting the jack-pine hybrids across the boreal forest of Canada, producing a total epidemic across North America in an area roughly the size of California. It would surpass any insect outbreak in recorded history and provide fuel for devastating wildfires down the road.\n I passed a grove of bare aspens. The prints were melting in steaming urine. Dark orange-yellow. I kept to the main route out of the narrow valley, adrenaline making my pack lighter. The wolves stayed in front, just out of sight, leaving only traces.\n Their tracks headed straight for the main northbound trail, and I suddenly calmed. The wolves were not pursuing me; they were leading me out of the valley. As the vista widened, my trail converged with one from the south. I turned onto it, while the wolf tracks veered abruptly north. A gust of wind blew over them as they disappeared into the trees.\n  I lit a candle in the snow for my brother and for his spirit in those wolves. The lodgepole pines were tall and strong, and their lofty crowns shadowed me while they steadfastly watched over some sub-alpine firs. I needed to linger here where canyon rock and crystallized tree crowns and packs of wolves had come together. The sun climbed over the granite peaks, and I tilted my face toward it. I pulled out a sandwich, ready to stay forever. I felt welcomed, whole. Pure and clean and untroubled.\n As I ate, I wondered why trees \u2014 these aspens and pines \u2014 would support a mycorrhizal fungus that provides carbon (or nitrogen) to a neighboring tree. Sharing with individuals of its own species, especially its own genetic family, seemed like an obvious benefit. Trees disperse most of their seeds \u2014 by gravity or wind or the odd bird or squirrel \u2014 in their small local area, meaning that many individuals in an immediate neighborhood are related.\n The pines clustered at the edge of this meadow were probably relatives of the same family, their genes diversified by pollen drifting in from distant fathers. These parent trees shared some of the genes of the trees around them, and passing along carbon to each other to increase the survival of their seedlings, their own offspring, would help ensure those genes got passed to future generations. A later study would show that the roots of at least half the pines in a stand are grafted together, and the larger trees subsidize the smaller ones with carbon. Blood runs thicker than water. This makes perfect sense from an individual-selection perspective. It\u2019s Darwinian.\n But my work was showing that some carbon also moved to unrelated individuals, ones of an entirely different species. From birch to fir and back again. I looked at the white aspen, its bark basking in the sun, and wondered if it shuffled carbon to the firs under its crown. The other way around too: firs to aspens.\n Mycorrhizal fungi are generalists \u2014 they colonize plant root tissue, sometimes even intracellularly. They might invest in many tree species to hedge their bets for survival, and the off chance that some carbon would move to a stranger was simply part of the cost of moving it to relatives.\n But this was not what my trees were showing. They were offering me evidence that the pattern of carbon movement was not just by chance, an unfortunate consequence of the moveable feast. No, my trees were demonstrating that they had a lot of skin in the game. Over and over, the experiments showed that carbon moved from a source tree to a sink tree \u2014 from a rich to a poor one \u2014 and that the trees had some control over where and how much carbon moved.\n \u201cWhy would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals?\u201d\n A squirrel chattered in the branch of a knotty juniper, waiting for me to toss it scraps of my sandwich. It kept an eye on the Clark\u2019s nutcracker at the top of a pine, probably with a whitebark pine seed in its beak. A raven \u2014 a species that also coveted those energy-rich seeds \u2014 gurgled a song.\n Whitebark pine depends on all these species and more, including grizzly bears, to scatter its heavy seeds. Why would the old pines trust their reproductive success to these birds and animals, whose interest in the seeds was only as food? A few seeds needed to be left to germinate and grow into offspring to ensure the successful reproduction of the elders; why trust that enough would remain? If one of these seed dispersers disappeared, perhaps in a fire or during a particularly harsh winter, then others might deliver the goods. In the same vein, why would a tree pass carbon to a generalist networking fungus \u2014 a Suillus or Cortinarius \u2014 that could then pass the carbon to an unrelated tree? From the pine to the understory subalpine fir?\n I threw my crust toward the squirrel, and the raven and nutcracker swooped to jockey for the prize. Tail twitching, the squirrel launched off its stump. Just as the old whitebark pines were glad to feed their seeds to birds and squirrels, depending on more than one for dispersal, there must be a similar evolutionary advantage to a tree hosting many mycorrhizal fungal species making up the linking network, letting it benefit from a diverse suite as insurance in case one element got lost.\n Maybe even more important was the fungi\u2019s ability to reproduce rapidly. Their short life cycle would enable them to adapt to the rapidly changing environment \u2014 fire and wind and climate \u2014 much faster than the steadfast, long-lived trees could manage. The oldest Rocky Mountain juniper is about 1,500 years old and the oldest whitebark pine around 1,300, in Utah and Idaho, respectively. Meanwhile, the trees here would take decades to produce their first cones and seeds and then do so only sporadically thereafter, but their fungal network could spawn mushrooms and spores each time it rained, potentially enabling its genes to recombine several times a year.\n Maybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty. Instead of waiting for the next generation of trees to reproduce with more adaptive ways of coping with the soils warming and drying as the climate changes, the mycorrhizal fungi with which the trees are in symbiosis could evolve much faster to acquire increasingly tightly bound resources. Perhaps the Suillus and Boletus and Cortinarius fungi could respond more immediately to the warming winters that had spawned the mountain pine beetle outbreak and help the trees still gather nutrients and water to maintain a level of resistance.\n \u201cMaybe the fast-cycling fungi could provide a way for the trees to adjust swiftly to cope with change and uncertainty.\u201d\n The raven won the battle for my sandwich crust and spiraled past the Clark\u2019s nutcracker in a cloud of feathers and squawks. Not only was the squirrel too slow, it had no hope of wresting anything from the beak of a bird. It would have to unearth whitebark seeds instead, after the birds buried them. Or it could feast on a mushroom left drying in the branches of a pine. It wouldn\u2019t live long with neighbors like the raven and nutcracker if it had to rely only on whitebark pine seeds they\u2019d overlooked. Likewise, the fungus could hedge its bets, hitching its spores on legs or feathers, or catching an updraft to colonize new hosts.\n If the fungus acquires more carbon from one tree than it needs for its own growth and survival, then it could supply the excess to the other networked trees in need and, in so doing, diversify its carbon portfolio \u2014 insurance in acquiring essential resources. The fungus could shuttle carbon produced by a rich aspen to a poor pine in the middle of the summer to ensure it had two different healthy hosts \u2014 sources of photosynthetic carbon \u2014 in case there was a calamity and one died. Like investing in stocks along with bonds in case the market crashed.\n The fungus might not care what species the hosts were, as long as at least one of its carbon sources remained viable. Investing in diverse plant communities is a lower-risk strategy than investing in just one species. The more stressful the environment, the more successful those fungi are at associating with multiple tree species.\n \u201cMaybe birch and fir are in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma where the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives.\u201d\n  Though my puzzling elated me, something still didn\u2019t quite fit together. As I shouldered my pack and turned to the fork that led south along Bryant Creek, I thought about the greater group of interacting species: the whole community of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. Individual selection might explain how the fluorescent Pseudomonads interacted with the mycorrhizal fungi of birch to reduce Armillaria root disease in Douglas fir. Could selection also operate at the group level?\n Do cooperative guilds of species \u2014 like guilds of people in societies \u2014 exist? Where multiple tree species are linked by a network for mutual aid, in the way it takes a village to raise a child, despite a risk that there might be cheaters in such guilds? This sharing would work if our behavior was ruled by steadfast tit for tat, like the two-way transfer between birch and fir and their principle of reciprocity, changing the direction of net transfer over the course of the summer. Quid pro quo.\n But what about longer-term shifts in trade? Such as when firs eventually grow taller than birches. Would the quid pro quo rule of engagement change, and how might this compare to our human lives when they become more complex and our relationships transform with age? If someone helps me with childcare, how do I repay her if she moves far away? I wondered why two tree species would continue to trade carbon over the long term, given the uncertainty of the future.\n Maybe birch and fir, and Armillaria ostoyae fungus and fluorescent Pseudomonads, are in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma where, in the long run, the benefits of group cooperation outweigh the costs of individual prerogatives. Studies show time and again that cooperation is commonly chosen in groups, even when betrayal of others could lead to a better individual reward. Fir can\u2019t survive without birch due to a high risk of infection from Armillaria , and birch can\u2019t survive in the long run without fir because too much nitrogen would accumulate in the soil, causing the soil to acidify and birch to decline.\n \u201cEcosystems are similar to human societies \u2014 they\u2019re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system.\u201d\n In this scenario, the little fluorescent Pseudomonad bacteria serve two functions: They produce compounds that inhibit the spread of Armillaria root disease among the trees, ensuring there is still a source of carbon energy for the community, and they transform nitrogen using the carbon exuded by the mycorrhizal network. Was this still in line with selection at the individual species level, or was it at the level of the group?\n Distracted, I practically skied straight into a couple of biologists tracking the radio-collared wolves that had been guiding me earlier. They knew the pack well; the leader was an old mother wolf.\n I asked why they were tracking the wolves. As the shadows of the peaks grew longer, the lead tracker, a lean, windburned woman with a dark ponytail, told me about the pressure to cull wolves in the park to alleviate the decline of caribou. She pushed her sunglasses back on her head as she spoke, radiating a fierce intelligence.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the clear-cutting,\u201d I responded, meeting her gaze. The sprouting willows and alders were attractive browse for moose, so their populations were increasing and attracting wolves. The problem was that the wolves also hunted mountain caribou, which were in precipitous decline due to habitat loss and interactions with people.\n She nodded in agreement as she shifted on her skis and checked that her avalanche beacon was on.\n \u201cYes, the snow gets so deep in the clear-cuts, the caribou can\u2019t outrun the wolves,\u201d she said, looking toward the trail where the mother wolf had gone. And there were more and more clear-cuts as the beetle-killed pines were being salvaged.\n \u201cGotta go or we\u2019ll lose them,\u201d her assistant said, squinting at a tracking device and tightening the chest strap on his pack. The researcher\u2019s eyes narrowed toward the pass ahead.\n \u201cWe can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony.\u201d\n \u201cSee ya,\u201d she said, and I said goodbye too, appreciating her unwavering pursuit. They evaporated into the pines as seamlessly as they had appeared, reminding me that a person could easily disappear out here without a trace. It was past noon. I had to keep moving or I\u2019d be skiing the last miles in the dark.\n The trail along Bryant Creek was fast and gently downhill, and as I raced past swaying pines, the sun at my back and the avalanche tracks falling behind me, I was grateful the wolf biologists had packed down the trail with their skis. I reached my car as the sky\u2019s pink and purple stripes faded to black across the tilted sheets of sedimentary crust.\n Ecosystems are similar to human societies \u2014 they\u2019re built on relationships. The stronger those are, the more resilient the system. And since our world\u2019s systems are composed of individual organisms, they have the capacity to change. We creatures adapt, our genes evolve, we can learn from experience. A system is ever-changing because its parts \u2014 the trees and fungi and people \u2014 are constantly responding to one another and to the environment. Our success in coevolution \u2014 our success as a productive society \u2014 is only as good as the strength of the bonds with other individuals and species. Out of the resulting adaptation and evolution emerge behaviors that help us survive, grow and thrive.\n We can think of an ecosystem of wolves, caribou, trees and fungi creating biodiversity just as an orchestra of woodwind, brass, percussion and string musicians assemble into a symphony. Or how our brains, composed of neurons, axons and neurotransmitters, produce thought and compassion. Or the way brothers and sisters join to overcome a trauma like illness or death \u2014 the whole greater than the sum of the parts.\n The cohesion of biodiversity in a forest, the musicians in an orchestra, the members of a family growing through conversation and feedback, through memories and learning from the past, even \n......", "posttime": "2021-06-29 22:57:45", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u68ee\u6797,intelligent,\u6811\u6728", "title": "\u806a\u660e\u7684\u68ee\u6797 ", "title_en": "The Intelligent Forest", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.noemamag.com/the-intelligent-forest", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u68ee\u6797", "\u6811\u6728"]}]
