", "note_en": "Jump to navigation  Jump to search  Quake is a  first-person shooter  video game developed by  id Software and published by  GT Interactive in  1996. It is the first game in the   Quake series.  [5] In the game, players must find their way through various maze-like, medieval environments while battling a variety of monsters using an array of weaponry. The overall atmosphere is dark and gritty, with many stone  textures and a rusty, capitalized  font.\n The successor to id Software&#39;s   Doom series,  Quake built upon the technology and gameplay of its predecessor.  [6] Unlike the   Doom engine before it, the   Quake engine offered full  real-time 3D rendering and had early support for  3D acceleration through  OpenGL. After   Doom helped to popularize  multiplayer  deathmatches in 1993,  Quake added various multiplayer options.  Online multiplayer became increasingly common, with the  QuakeWorld update and software such as  QuakeSpy making the process of finding and playing against others on the Internet easier and more reliable.\n     In  Quake &#39;s single-player mode, players explore levels, facing monsters and finding secret areas before reaching an exit. Switches or keys open doors, and reaching the exit takes the player to the next level. Before accessing an episode, there is a set of three pathways with easy, medium, and hard skill levels. The fourth skill level, &#34;Nightmare&#34;, was &#34;so bad that it was hidden, so people won&#39;t wander in by accident&#34;;  [7] the player must drop through water before the episode four entrance and go into a secret passage to access it.\n Quake &#39;s single-player campaign is organized into four individual episodes with seven to eight levels in each (including one secret level per episode, one of which is a &#34;low gravity&#34; level that challenges the player&#39;s abilities in a different way). If the player&#39;s character dies, he must restart at the beginning of that level. The game may be saved at any time in the PC versions and between levels in the console versions. Upon completing an episode, the player is returned to the hub &#34;START&#34; level, where another episode can be chosen. Each episode starts the player from scratch, without any previously collected items. Episode one (which formed the shareware or downloadable demo version of  Quake) has the most traditional ideology of a  boss in the last level. The ultimate objective at the end of each episode is to recover a magic rune. After all of the runes are collected, the floor of the hub level opens up to reveal an entrance to the &#34;END&#34; level which contains a final puzzle.\n  In multiplayer mode, players on several computers connect to a server (which may be a dedicated machine or on one of the player&#39;s computers), where they can either play the single-player campaign together in  co-op (cooperative) mode, or play against each other in multiplayer. When players die in multiplayer mode, they can immediately  respawn, but will lose any items that were collected. Similarly, items that have been picked up previously respawn after some time, and may be picked up again. The most popular multiplayer modes are all forms of  deathmatch. Deathmatch modes typically consist of either  free-for-all (no organization or teams involved), one-on-one  duels, or organized  teamplay with two or more players per team (or  clan). Players frequently implement  mods during teamplay. Monsters are not normally present in teamplay, as they serve no purpose other than to get in the way and reveal the positions of the players.\n The gameplay in  Quake was considered unique for its time because of the different ways the player can maneuver through the game.  [8]  Bunny hopping or strafe jumping allow faster movement, while  rocket jumping enables the player to reach otherwise-inaccessible areas at the cost of some self-damage. The player can start and stop moving suddenly, jump unnaturally high, and change direction while moving through the air. Many of these non-realistic behaviors contribute to  Quake &#39;s appeal. Multiplayer  Quake was one of the first games singled out as a form of  electronic sport.  [9] A notable participant was  Dennis Fong, who won  John Carmack&#39;s  Ferrari 328 at the Microsoft-sponsored  Red Annihilation tournament in 1997.\n  In the single-player game, the player takes the role of the unnamed protagonist called Ranger in later games (voiced by  Trent Reznor)  [10] who was sent into a portal in order to stop an enemy  code-named &#34;Quake&#34;. The government had been experimenting with teleportation technology and developed a working prototype called a &#34;Slipgate&#34;; the mysterious Quake compromised the Slipgate by connecting it with its own teleportation system, using it to send death squads to the &#34;Human&#34; dimension in order to test the martial capabilities of humanity.\n The sole surviving protagonist in &#34;Operation Counterstrike&#34; is Ranger, who must advance, starting each of the four episodes from an overrun human military base, before fighting his way into other dimensions, reaching them via the Slipgate or their otherworld equivalent. After passing through the Slipgate, Ranger&#39;s main objective is to collect four magic runes from four dimensions of Quake; these are the key to stopping the enemy and ending the invasion of Earth.\n The single-player campaign consists of 30 separate levels, or &#34;maps&#34;, divided into four episodes (with a total of 26 regular maps and four secret ones), as well as a hub level to select a difficulty setting and episode, and the game&#39;s final boss level. Each episode represents individual dimensions that the player can access through magical portals (as opposed to the technological Slipgate) that are discovered over the course of the game. The various realms consist of a number of  gothic,  medieval, and lava-filled caves and dungeons, with a recurring theme of hellish and satanic imagery reminiscent of  Doom (such as pentagrams and images of demons on the walls). The game&#39;s setting is inspired by  dark fantasy influences, including  H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s  Cthulhu Mythos. Dimensional Shamblers appear as enemies, the &#34;Spawn&#34; enemies are called &#34;Formless Spawn of  Tsathoggua&#34; in the manual, the  boss of the first episode is named  Chthon, and the main villain is named Shub-Niggurath (though actually resembling a  Dark Young). Some levels have Lovecraftian names, such as the Vaults of Zin and  The Nameless City. In addition, six levels exclusively designed for multiplayer deathmatch are also included. Originally, the game was supposed to include more Lovecraftian bosses, but this concept was scrapped due to time constraints.\n    A preview included with  id&#39;s very first release, 1990&#39;s   Commander Keen, advertised a game entitled  The Fight for Justice as a follow-up to the  Commander Keen trilogy. It would feature a character named Quake, &#34;the strongest, most dangerous person on the continent&#34;, armed with thunderbolts and a &#34;Ring of Regeneration&#34;. Conceived as a  VGA full-color  side-scrolling  role-playing game,  The Fight for Justice was never released.\n Lead designer and director  John Romero later conceived of  Quake as an  action game taking place in a fully  3D world, inspired by  Sega AM2&#39;s 3D  fighting game   Virtua Fighter.  Quake was also intended to feature  Virtua Fighter influenced third-person  melee combat, but id Software considered it to be risky. Because the project was taking too long, the third-person melee was eventually dropped. This led to creative differences between Romero and id Software, and eventually his departure from the company after  Quake was released.  [11]  [12] Even though he led the project, Romero did not receive any money from  Quake.  [13] In 2000, Romero released   Daikatana, the game that he envisioned  Quake being, and despite its shaky development, and being considered one of the worst games of all time,  [14]  [15] he said  Daikatana was &#34;more fun to make than  Quake&#34; due to the lack of creative interference.  [16]\n Quake was given as a title to the game that  id Software was working on shortly after the release of   Doom II. The earliest information released described  Quake as focusing on a  Thor-like character who wields a giant hammer,  [17]  [18]  [19] and is able to knock away enemies by throwing the hammer (complete with real-time  inverse kinematics). [   citation needed] Initially, the levels were supposed to be designed in an  Aztec style, but the choice was dropped some months into the project. [   citation needed] Early screenshots then showed medieval environments and dragons. [   citation needed] The plan was for the game to have more  RPG-style elements. However, work was very slow on the engine, since  John Carmack, the main programmer of  Quake, was not only developing a fully 3D engine, but also a TCP/IP networking model (Carmack later said that he should have done two separate projects which developed those things). [   citation needed] Working with a game engine that was still in development presented difficulties for the designers.  [20]\n Eventually, the whole id Software team began to think that the original concept may not have been as wise a choice as they first believed.  [19] Thus, the final game was very stripped down from its original intentions, and instead featured gameplay similar to  Doom and its sequel, although the levels and enemies were closer to medieval RPG style rather than science-fiction. In a December 1, 1994 post to an online bulletin board, John Romero wrote, &#34;Okay, people. It seems that everyone is speculating on whether Quake is going to be a slow, RPG-style light-action game. Wrong! What does id do best and dominate at? Can you say &#34;action&#34;? I knew you could. Quake will be constant, hectic action throughout \u2013 probably more so than Doom&#34;.  [21]\n Quake was programmed by John Carmack,  Michael Abrash, and John Cash. The levels and scenarios were designed by  American McGee,  Sandy Petersen, John Romero, and  Tim Willits, and the graphics were designed by  Adrian Carmack,  Kevin Cloud and  Paul Steed. Cloud created the monster and player graphics using  Alias.  [22]\n The  game engine developed for  Quake, the   Quake engine, popularized several major advances in the first-person shooter genre: polygonal models instead of  prerendered  sprites; full 3D level design instead of a  2.5D map;  prerendered  lightmaps; and allowing end users to partially program the game (in this case with  QuakeC), which popularized fan-created  modifications (mods).\n Before the release of the full game or the shareware version of  Quake, id Software released  QTest on February 24, 1996. It was described as a technology demo and was limited to three multiplayer maps. There was no single-player support and some of the gameplay and graphics were unfinished or different from their final versions.  QTest gave gamers their first peek into the filesystem and modifiability of the  Quake engine, and many entity mods (that placed monsters in the otherwise empty multiplayer maps) and custom player skins began appearing online before the full game was even released.  [23]\n Initially, the game was designed so that when the player ran out of ammunition, the player character would hit enemies with a  gun-butt.  [19] Shortly before release this was replaced with an  axe.\n   Quake &#39;s music and sound design was done by  Trent Reznor and  Nine Inch Nails, using ambient soundscapes and synthesized  drones to create atmospheric tracks. In an interview, Reznor remarked that the  Quake soundtrack &#34;is not music, it&#39;s textures and ambiences and whirling machine noises and stuff. We tried to make the most sinister, depressive, scary, frightening kind of thing... It&#39;s been fun.&#34;  [24] The game also includes an homage to Reznor in the form of ammo boxes for the &#34;Nailgun&#34; and &#34;Super Nailgun&#34; decorated with the Nine Inch Nails logo.\n Digital re-releases of the game lack the CD soundtrack that came with the original  shareware release.\n  The first port to be completed was the Linux port Quake 0.91 by id Software employee Dave D. Taylor on July 5, 1996,  [3] followed by a SPARC Solaris port later that year also by Taylor. The first commercially released port was the port to Mac OS, done by MacSoft and Lion Entertainment, Inc. (the latter company ceased to exist just prior to the port&#39;s release,  [25] leading to MacSoft&#39;s involvement) in late August 1997.  [4] ClickBOOM announced version for  Amiga-computers in 1998.  [26] Finally in 1999, a retail version of the Linux port was distributed by  Macmillan Digital Publishing USA in a bundle with the three add-ons as  Quake: The Offering.  [27]  [28]  [29]\n Quake was also ported to home console systems. On December 2, 1997, the game was released for the  Sega Saturn. Initially GT Interactive was to publish this version itself,  [30] but it later cancelled the release and the Saturn rights were picked up by  Sega.  [31] Sega then took the project away from the original development team, who had been encountering difficulties getting the port to run at a decent  frame rate, and assigned it to  Lobotomy Software.  [32] The Sega Saturn port used Lobotomy Software&#39;s own 3D game engine,  SlaveDriver (the same game engine that powered the Sega Saturn versions of   PowerSlave and   Duke Nukem 3D), instead of the original  Quake engine.  [33] It is the only version of  Quake that is rated &#34;T&#34; for Teen instead of &#34;M&#34; for Mature.\n Quake had also been ported to the  Sony  PlayStation by Lobotomy Software, but the port was cancelled due to difficulties in finding a publisher. A port of  Quake for the  Atari Jaguar was also advertized as 30% complete in a May 1996 issue of   Ultimate Future Games magazine, but it was never released.  [34]  [35] Another port of  Quake was also slated for  Panasonic M2 but never occurred due to the cancellation of the system.  [36]\n On March 24, 1998, the game was released for the  Nintendo 64 by  Midway Games. This version was developed by the same programming team that worked on   Doom 64,  [37] at id Software&#39;s request.  [38] The Nintendo 64 version was originally slated to be released in 1997, but Midway delayed it until March 1998 to give the team time to implement the deathmatch modes.  [39]\n Both console ports required compromises because of the limited  CPU power and  ROM storage space for levels. For example, the levels were rebuilt in the Saturn version in order to simplify the architecture, thereby reducing demands on the CPU.  [40] The Sega Saturn version includes 28 of the 32 single-player levels from the original PC version of the game, though the secret levels, Ziggurat Vertigo (E1M8), The Underearth (E2M7), The Haunted Halls (E3M7), and The Nameless City (E4M8), were removed. Instead, it has four exclusive secret levels: Purgatorium, Hell&#39;s Aerie, The Coliseum, and Watery Grave. It also contains an exclusive unlockable, &#34;Dank &amp; Scuz&#34;, which is a story set in the Quake milieu and presented in the form of a  slide show with voice acting. There are no multiplayer modes in the Sega Saturn version; as a result of this, all of the deathmatch maps from the PC version were removed from the Sega Saturn port. The Nintendo 64 version includes 25 single-player levels from the PC version, though it is missing The Grisly Grotto (E1M4), The Installation (E2M1), The Ebon Fortress (E2M4), The Wind Tunnels (E3M5), The Sewage System (E4M1), and Hell&#39;s Atrium (E4M5) levels. It also does not use the hub &#34;START&#34; map where the player chooses a difficulty level and an episode; the difficulty level is chosen from a menu when starting the game, and all of the levels are played in sequential order from The Slipgate Complex (E1M1) to Shub Niggurath&#39;s Pit (END). The Nintendo 64 version, while lacking the cooperative multiplayer mode, includes two player deathmatch. All six of the deathmatch maps from the PC version are in the Nintendo 64 port, and an exclusive deathmatch level, The Court of Death, is also included.\n Two ports of  Quake for the Nintendo DS exist,  QuakeDS  [41] and  CQuake.  [42] Both run well, however, multiplayer does not work on  QuakeDS.  [41] Since the source code for  Quake was released, a number of unofficial ports have been made available for PDAs and mobile phones, such as PocketQuake, as well as versions for the Symbian S60 series of mobile phones and Android mobile phones.  [43]  [44]  [45] The  Rockbox project also distributes a version of  Quake that runs on some MP3 players.  [46]\n In 2005, id Software signed a deal with publisher Pulse Interactive to release a version of  Quake for mobile phones. The game was engineered by Californian company Bear Naked Productions.  [47] Initially due to be released on only two mobile phones, the Samsung Nexus (for which it was to be an embedded game) and the LG VX360.  [48]  Quake mobile was reviewed by  GameSpot on the Samsung Nexus and they cited its US release as October 2005; they also gave it a  Best Mobile Game&#34; in their E3 2005 Editor&#39;s Choice Awards.  [49] It is unclear as to whether the game actually did ship with the Samsung Nexus. The game is only available for the DELL x50v and x51v both of which are PDAs not mobile phones.  [49]  Quake Mobile does not feature the Nine Inch Nails soundtrack due to space constraints.  [48]  Quake Mobile runs the most recent version of GL Quake (Quake v.1.09 GL 1.00) at 800x600 resolution and 25 fps. The most recent version of  Quake Mobile is v.1.20 which has stylus support. There was an earlier version v.1.19 which lacked stylus support. The two  Quake expansion packs,  Scourge of Armagon and  Dissolution of Eternity, are also available for  Quake Mobile.\n A  Flash-based version of the game by Michael Rennie runs  Quake at full speed in any Flash-enabled web browser. Based on the shareware version of the game, it includes only the first episode and is available for free on the web.  [50]\n  Quake can be heavily modified by altering the graphics, audio, or scripting in  QuakeC, and has been the focus of many fan created &#34;mods&#34;. The first mods were small gameplay fixes and patches initiated by the community, usually enhancements to weapons or gameplay with new enemies. Later mods were more ambitious and resulted in  Quake fans creating versions of the game that were drastically different from id Software&#39;s original release.\n The first major  Quake mod was   Team Fortress. This mod consists of Capture the Flag gameplay with a class system for the players. Players choose a class, which creates various restrictions on weapons and armor types available to that player, and also grants special abilities. For example, the bread-and-butter  Soldier class has medium armor, medium speed, and a well-rounded selection of weapons and grenades, while the  Scout class is lightly armored, very fast, has a scanner that detects nearby enemies, but has very weak offensive weapons. One of the other differences with CTF is the fact that the flag is not returned automatically when a player drops it: running over one&#39;s flag in  Threewave CTF would return the flag to the base, and in  TF the flag remains in the same spot for preconfigured time and it has to be defended on remote locations. This caused a shift in defensive tactics compared to  Threewave CTF.  Team Fortress maintained its standing as the most-played online  Quake modification for many years. Team Fortress would go on to become   Team Fortress Classic and get a sequel,   Team Fortress 2.\n Another popular mod was   Threewave  Capture the Flag (CTF), primarily authored by Dave &#39;Zoid&#39; Kirsch.

But I was reminded of it this morning when I saw  a new report on electric vehicle accessibility. Compiled by the Consumer Choice Center (CCC), the report scores all 50 states based on how hard they make it to buy an EV, whether that&#39;s banning direct-to-consumer sales or requiring extra registration fees or  road charges. Unsurprisingly, the United States is a bit of a patchwork in this regard. But it&#39;s not quite as simple as red states making it hard and blue states making it easy to buy an EV.\n  Ten states score top marks with the CCC: Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. All these states will allow direct sales of cars to individuals, and none will make you pay more to register your new EV than you&#39;d pay for a new car with an internal combustion engine (ICE). (The District of Columbia would also go in this group if DC-based CCC had included it.)\n California is conspicuous by its absence in that top 10. The state is the leading market for EVs within the US, with  the highest adoption rate and the most public chargers.\u00a0 Nearly half of all US-registered EVs\u00a0are on its roads. But California also has an escalating EV license fee that&#39;s currently $100 but is now linked to the consumer price index.\n Because it&#39;s possible to register some gasoline-powered vehicles in California for less than $100, the state joins the &#34;somewhat accessible&#34; group, along with Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, and Wyoming. Most of those states, like California, lost points because they have extra EV registration fees, but Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania all have some restrictions on automakers selling cars directly to the public.\n The &#34;barely accessible&#34; states were Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. A few of these states prohibit direct auto sales but don&#39;t charge more to register an EV than an ICE vehicle, others allow Tesla (but no other automaker) to sell direct to the public, and some do both.\n  Finally, there are the inaccessible states: Alabama, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Each of these place plenty of roadblocks between their citizens and a new EV, banning any direct sales within their borders as well as making it more expensive to register an EV than an ICE vehicle.\n  In total, 28 states make it more expensive to register an EV, and 17 have completely banned Tesla and others from selling their cars straight to the public. Twelve other states have some restrictions on direct sales, including allowing Tesla (but no other automaker) to make them.\n &#34;It is clear that consumers want more access to electric vehicles. Therefore legislation should make the purchase and ownership of them as convenient as possible, and we urge legislators to put forth better policies that will reduce the significant barriers currently preventing consumers from fully\u00a0accessing EVs,&#34; said CCC&#39;s North American affairs manager David Clement, co-author of the study.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:37:54", "source_domain":

6/22\u00a0 10:55 am EDT: Prime Day has paradoxically rolled into its second day, so we&#39;ve given our mega-roundup another refresh. As expected, the pace of new discounts has slowed, but we&#39;ve still found good deals on  recommended indoor security cameras,  4K box sets of the   Lord of the Rings \u00a0and   The Hobbit trilogies, the  latest  Spider-Man game for the PS4/PS5, and more.\n Update 6/21 5:35 pm EDT: After another sweep of our Prime Day deals roundup, we have struck out a few expired offers, updated prices, and added a few new deals. Those bargains include premium OLED TVs from Sony, well-reviewed air purifiers from Blueair, Blue&#39;s popular Yeti microphone, and Samsung  SSDs we like, among other discounts you can find below.\n Update 6/21 12 pm EDT: We&#39;ve\u00a0added our first batch of new discounts, headlined by the return of  a deal we highlighted a couple weeks back: those who buy at least $40 in Amazon gift cards can  get an extra $10 in Amazon credit at no extra cost.\u00a0Elsewhere, Apple&#39;s  latest iPad Air is now down to a joint-low of $520, and we&#39;ve found new deals on Nvidia&#39;s Shield TV, recommended board games\u00a0  Dixit\u00a0and\u00a0  Mysterium, a good Anker battery pack, and more. Since this post first went live, we&#39;ve also put together roundups for those looking to  spend less than $50 and those  who don&#39;t subscribe to Prime but still want some savings.\n Original post 6/21 4:50 am EDT:\u00a0Amazon Prime Day has arrived, and  another avalanche of deals has come along with it. As ever, the vast majority of the gadget and gear discounts Amazon is advertising aren&#39;t that special: many of the products are mediocre, and many of the prices aren&#39;t much lower than usual.\n But there are still a few hidden gems\u2014and the Dealmaster team is here to help you find them. We&#39;ve spent the better part of the last week cutting through thousands of offers, looking through  price-history charts, and researching products we haven&#39;t used ourselves, all to bring you the very best Prime Day deals we can find.\n Below are the fruits of our labor, with a few special mentions for particularly notable deals. We&#39;ll update our mega-roundup over the course of Amazon&#39;s two-day event, adding good gadget deals as we see them with a &#34; NEW&#34; tag and  striking out expired ones.\n As a reminder,  Prime Day runs from June 21-22, and you&#39;ll need\u00a0 an Amazon Prime membership to access most deals. And yes, on one level, this whole thing is still a made-up holiday designed to gin up sales for an  increasingly massive\u00a0tech giant that has faced  fierce criticism of its  working conditions,  handling of customer data, and  allegedly anticompetitive practices, among other matters.\n Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through\u00a0 affiliate programs.\n      Sony WH-1000XM4 Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones for\u00a0$248 (normally $315): Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4 is the  best wireless noise-canceling headphone for most people, blending good comfort, highly effective ANC, customizable sound, great battery life, and several nifty bonus features. This deal  matches the lowest price we&#39;ve seen at a major retailer.\n Get\u00a0 $10 promotional credit\u00a0when you spend\u00a0$40 or more\u00a0on select Amazon gift cards: Amazon briefly  offered this promotion\u00a0in the lead-up to Prime Day. As before, you can get a bonus $10 in Amazon credit when you spend $40 or more on certain Amazon gift cards or an existing gift card balance, be it for yourself or others. Both digital and physical gift cards are eligible. If you use the checkout code &#34; GCPRIME2021&#34; or hit the &#34;Apply code to your account&#34; button in the deal link above, you should see a notification confirming the deal at checkout. There are still caveats: Amazon says it&#39;ll email the credit code to you within two days of your purchase, the credit will only be applicable to items sold by Amazon itself, and the $10 will expire if not used by August 7. You can only utilize the deal once per account. And in general, offers like these are a way for Amazon to keep customers locked into its storefront. But if you plan to buy something from the site in the near future anyway, it&#39;s hard to complain about what is effectively free Amazon money.\n Instant Pot Duo Plus (6qt) 9-in-1 electric pressure cooker for\u00a0$54.95 (normally $110): Another all-time low, this looks like Prime Day&#39;s best deal for those deciding to jump into the Instant Pot craze. This model is generally a  minor upgrade over  the Instant Pot Duo, with a sous vide setting and a nicer display, but again, it&#39;s an easier recommendation at this discounted price. If you&#39;re mainly cooking for one, the  3-quart Instant Pot Duo Nova is on sale for $50.\n Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (8GB, ads) ebook reader for\u00a0$79.99 (normally $125): Prime Day typically brings loads of deals on Amazon-made devices, and this year is no exception. This deal matches the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked on the Kindle Paperwhite, which we have long considered the  best e-reader for most people. A version without in-built ads is  on sale for $100.\n Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K HDR media streamer for\u00a0$24.99 (normally $45): Though we consider Google&#39;s Chromecast the  better streaming stick overall, the speedy Fire TV Stick 4K becomes a much better value proposition at this deal price, which ties the best we&#39;ve tracked.\n Samsung Evo Select (256GB) microSDXC card for $25.99\u00a0(normally $33): We&#39;ve  recommended this\u00a0Class 10,  U3-rated microSD card in the past: it&#39;s not the fastest option on the market, but it&#39;s still quick and reliable enough to comfortably hold Switch games or other media. This deal is a dollar off the all-time low. If you need more space,  a 512GB model is on sale for a new low of $62.\n Jabra Elite 75t true wireless earphones for\u00a0$99.99 (normally $140): Jabra&#39;s Elite 75t are almost a couple of years old now, but they remain a  nicely well-rounded pair of true wireless earbuds. They&#39;re light, comfortable, and easily portable, with a useful control scheme, good sound quality, and active noise cancelation. This is another new low price. If you&#39;re an iPhone user looking for a step up,  Apple&#39;s AirPods Pro are more modestly discounted to $190.\n Nintendo Switch Lite + 128GB SanDisk microSD Card for Nintendo Switch for\u00a0$199.99 (normally $225): The Nintendo Switch remains highly in demand, so Prime Day&#39;s main Switch deal is predictably modest, merely bundling the Lite version of the console with the 128GB version of SanDisk&#39;s officially licensed microSD card. The latter usually goes for about $25 on its own. Still, the\u00a0 Switch Lite is a good buy in its own right, and we recommended this particular microSD card in our  guide to the best Nintendo Switch accessories. Just be aware that for the past several weeks, Nintendo has been rumored to  launch a &#34;Pro&#34; version of the console and that the Lite version can still only be used in handheld mode, not docked to a TV.\n Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-month membership for\u00a0$29.99\u00a0(normally $45): For Xbox and PC players, Microsoft&#39;s Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still one of the\u00a0 better values in gaming, bundling  hundreds of genuinely worthwhile games\u00a0(with  several more to come) for one all-you-can-eat monthly fee. This deal takes $15 off the price of a 3-month subscription, which is $5 off the best price we&#39;ve tracked for existing members. If you&#39;ve never subscribed to the service, though, note that Microsoft is running a promotion that gives this  same membership plan for just $1.\n OnePlus 8 (128GB, Green) 6.55-inch unlocked smartphone for\u00a0$349\u00a0(normally $610): The OnePlus 8  is a year old at this point, but at $349 its 90Hz display, Snapdragon 865 chip, and clean software (with  security updates through mid-2023) are a good value. This deal is a new low, but it only appears to apply to the green model linked above. Just note that this variant is meant for GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile.\n Razer Viper Ultimate wireless gaming mouse for\u00a0$71.24 (normally $100): Razer&#39;s Viper Ultimate is our  favorite wireless gaming mouse thanks to its highly responsive sensor and comfortable, ultra-lightweight, and ambidextrous design. This deal marks the lowest price we&#39;ve tracked. A bundle that comes with Razer&#39;s RGB charging dock is  on sale for $90. If you&#39;d rather not pay this much,  Logitech&#39;s G305 Lightspeed, another recommendation of ours, is down to a new low of $30.\n   Get\u00a0 $10 promotional credit\u00a0when you spend\u00a0$40 or more\u00a0on select Amazon gift cards (use code:  GCPRIME2021 or hit &#34;Apply code to your account&#34; button).\n  Amazon Fire TV Cube 4K HDR media streamer + smart speaker for\u00a0 $79.99

led by specialist edtech investor Learn Capital, with other unnamed investors participating. It comes after Merlyn Mind spent about three years quietly building its first release and more recently piloting the service in 50+ classrooms in more than 20 schools.\n Co-founded by longtime IBM scientists Satya Nitta (the CEO), Ravi Kokku, and Sharad Sundararajan \u2014 all of whom spent several years leading education efforts in IBM\u2019s Watson AI research division \u2014 Merlyn Mind is coming to the market with a patented, vertically integrated solution to solve what Nitta told me in an interview he believes and has seen first-hand to be a fundamental pain point in the world of edtech.\n  In effect, education and technology may have now been merged into a single term as far as the tech world is concerned, but in terms of practical, on-the-ground application, many teachers are not making the most of the tools they have in the classroom. The majority are, he believes, facing \u201ccognitive overload\u201d (which is not to mention the kids, who themselves probably are facing the same: a problem for it to tackle down the road, I hope), and they need help.\n To be fair, this problem existed before the pandemic, with research from   McKinsey &amp; Co. published in 2020 (and gathered earlier) finding that teachers were already spending more than half of their time on administrative tasks, not teaching or thinking about how and what to teach or what help specific students might need. Other research from    Learn Platform found that teachers potentially have as many as 900 different applications that they can use in a classroom (in practice, Nitta told me a teacher will typically use between 20 and 30 applications, sites and tech services in a day, although even that is a huge amount).\n Post-Covid-19, there are other kinds of new complications to grapple with on top of all that. Not only are many educators now playing catch-up because of the months spent learning at home (it\u2019s been widely documented that in many cases, students have fallen behind), but overall, education is coming away from our year+ of remote learning with a much stronger mandate to use  more tech from now on, not less.\n The help that Merlyn Mind is proposing comes in the form of what the startup describes as an \u201cAI hub.\u201d This includes a personal assistant called Symphony Classroom, a kind of Alexa-style voice interface tailored to the educational environment and built on a fork of Android; a smart speaker that looks a bit like a soundbar; and a consumer-style remote that can be used also for navigation and commands.\n These then work with whatever screen the teacher opts to use, whether it is a TV, or an interactive whiteboard, or something else; along with any other connected devices that are used in the classroom, to open and navigate through different apps, including various Google apps, NearPod, Newsela, and so on. (That could potentially also include kids\u2019 individual screens if they are being used.)\n The idea is that if a teacher is in the middle of a lesson on a specific topic and a question comes up that can best be answered by illustrating a concept through another app, a teacher can trigger the system to navigate to a new screen to find that information and instantly show it to the students. The system can also be used to find a teacher\u2019s own materials on file. The demo I saw worked well enough, although I would love to see how an ordinary teacher \u2014 the kind they\u2019re hoping will use this \u2014 would fare.\n Everyone knows the expression \u201chardware is hard,\u201d so it\u2019s interesting to see Merlyn addressing its problem with a hardware-forward approach.\n  \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why we built our own hardware,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of AI processing that\u2019s happening on the device, for various reasons, including latency and security. So it\u2019s kind of an edge AI appliance. And the second thing is the microphones. They are designed for the classroom environment, and we wanted to have complete control over the tooling of these microphones for the processing, for the environment, and that is very hard to do. If you are taking a third-party microphone array off the shelf, it\u2019s impossible, actually, you simply cannot.\u201d\n The startup\u2019s early team is rounded out with alums from the likes of HP Education, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Broadcom and Roku to help build all of this, knowing the challenges they were tackling, but also the payoff once it would be finished if it all works.\n \u201cW e have a very, very talented team, and we basically said, right, this is going to be a lot of hard work that will take us three and a half years. We have to build our own piece of hardware\u2026 and  we ended up building the entire voice stack from from scratch ourselves, too,\u201d Nitta continued. \u201cIt means we have end to end control of everything from the hardware all the way to the language models.\u201d\n He did point out though that over time, there will be some elements that will be usable without all the hardware, in particular when a teacher may suddenly have to teach outside the classroom again in a remote learning environment.\n It\u2019s a very ambitious concept, but where would education and learning be if not for taking leaps once in a while? That\u2019s where investors stand on the startup, too.\n \u201cJust as we saw with the breakthrough edtech company Coursera which reached IPO this year and was started a decade ago by two machine learning professors, in today\u2019s hypercompetitive market the best edtech companies need to start with an advanced technological core,\u201d said Rob Hutter, founder and managing partner of Learn Capital. \u201c Merlyn\u00a0is one of the first\u00a0companies\u00a0to focus on the enhancement of live teaching in classrooms, and it is developing a solution that is so intuitive it allows teachers to leverage technology with mastery while using minimal effort.\u00a0 This is a very promising platform.\u201d\n The proof will be in how it gets adopted when it finally launches commercially later this year, with pricing to be announced later.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:36:23", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags":

", "note_en": "White Square move marks one of first closures of fund hit by surges in so-called meme stocks\n A London-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against US retailer GameStop during the first meme stock rally in January is shutting its doors.\n White Square Capital, run by former Paulson &amp; Co trader Florian Kronawitter, told investors that it would shut its main fund and return capital this month after a review of its business model, according to people familiar with the fund and a letter to investors.\n White Square, which at its peak managed about $440m in assets, had bet against GameStop, say people familiar with its positioning, and suffered double-digit per cent losses in January.\n  The move marks one of the first closures of a hedge fund hit by the huge surges in so-called meme stocks. Retail investors, often co-ordinating their actions on online forums such as Reddit\u2019s r/WallStreetBets and in some cases deliberately targeting hedge fund short sellers, drove up the price of stocks such as GameStop and cinema chain AMC Entertainment in January and again in recent weeks. GameStop, for instance, soared from less than $20 at the start of the year to more than $480 at its January peak.\n That led to  big losses for some funds, including US-based Melvin Capital, run by Steve Cohen prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Gabe Plotkin, and Light Street Capital, run by Glen Kacher, a former Tiger cub who worked at Julian Robertson\u2019s Tiger Management. However, the funds remain in operation, and shortly after its losses Melvin received a  $2.75bn investment from Cohen\u2019s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel.\n \u201cThe decision to close down is related to thinking the equity long-short model is challenged,\u201d said Kronawitter.\n \u201cThere are way too many fish in the pond with the same strategy of long-short,\u201d he added. \u201cThe traditional edge is being arbed away [eroded by other investors], there\u2019s an oversupply of capital.\u201d\n A person close to the fund said the decision to shut was unrelated to the meme stock rally. The fund quickly rebounded in the wake of January\u2019s turmoil and made back \u201ca fair share\u201d of the losses, the person added.\n Among other funds hit, Melvin was still  down about 44.7 per cent this year to the end of last month, while Light Street was down about 20.1 per cent.\n  Kronawitter, who previously worked at US billionaire John Paulson\u2019s hedge fund and Merrill Lynch, had made double-digit gains at White Square in 2015 and 2016, said a person who had seen the numbers, while last year it made about 19 per cent.\n In the investor letter announcing the fund\u2019s closure, White Square said that last year, despite that year\u2019s strong performance, two large investors had opted to withdraw their cash and put it in cheap passive funds or private equity. \u201cWe experienced first-hand the shift in trend away from hedge fund investing to cheaper alternatives,\u201d it added.\n According to the letter, White Square had been due to receive investor inflows again in May this year, but instead decided to shut the fund.\n \u201cThe arbitrage opportunities have diminished with both the onslaught of capital caused by central bank monetary interventions, as well as much improved dissemination of information, bringing up the question to what degree the same fees can be justified,\u201d it said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:29:13",

", "note_en": "Based out of Berlin,  Myos enables fast and flexible financing to prevent retailers from experiencing bottlenecks, allowing them to expand their assortment and grow significantly faster.\n  Recently, the company has secured \u20ac25M funding in Series A round led by Fasanara Capital and Xploration Capital, both funds with deep expertise in digital lending.\n - Partner content - Here are the ten top international startups shortlisted for the 2021 Future Hamburg Award  Show Less\n Further, Tomahawk.VC and a group of new and existing investors also participated in the round.\n  The company is planning to use the funding to grow its existing customer base in Europe, expand to the international market, and continue developing its AI-based lending platform.\n \u201cWe\u2019re a step ahead of traditional lenders because we look at the retail products, not the merchants\u201d, says Nikolaus Hilgenfeldt, Co-founder and CEO of Myos. \u201cWith Myos, merchants can quickly receive loans of up to a million Euros, without complex business plans or personal guarantees which are often not available in the start-up phase\u201d.\n   Myos  helps merchants in their startup phase, where they are usually considered unbankable by other financiers.\n The Berlin-based company also helps them in their growth phase, where merchants benefit from maximal flexibility due to its collateral-based dynamic repayment approach.\n Nikolaus Hilgenfeldt and Benjamin Schickert started Myos in 2018, bringing business experience from management positions at Morgan Stanley, Allianz, Roland Berger, Lendico/ING, and others.\n Talking about the idea behind founding Myos, Nikolaus Hilgenfeldt, CEO and Founder, tells Silicon Canals, \u201cWe knew each other from our studies at WHU in the 2000s and stayed in touch over the years. The initial idea for Myos was born out of discussions around the working capital need of online sellers as experienced firsthand by our founding partner Sebastian with his own Amazon FBA company. We asked ourselves why it was so hard to get adequate financing as a marketplace-focused online seller by traditional lenders \u2013 banks and non-banks alike \u2013 and figured out that these lenders largely ignored the cash-generating assets of the potential borrower (i.e. their trading products), and much more focused on lagging borrower-centric data sources like management accounts or bank transactions.\u201d\n \u201cThis data essentially does not tell you much about the future potential and inherent value of the business in the fast-paced world of marketplace e-commerce. Hence, we built a completely new risk model from scratch, which relies on publicly sourced data from e-commerce platforms and is built in an asset-centric and asset-based way. In a nutshell, you can think of it as a real estate loan or car loan, just for e-commerce products. Our co-founder Ben was initially involved as a potential business angel and risk advisor, but quickly identified the potential of the idea and decided to go all-in with his time \u2013 to our great delight,\u201d he further explains.\n  Myos\u2019 AI-based platform monitors the price of the product, its sales success, and the competition on common online marketplaces. It evaluates risk scores to determine the future sales potential and the value of the financed products to issue loans to merchants.\n In terms of challenges, Hilgenfeldt, shares \u201cIf you want to establish a risk model in a radically new way as we did, you have to use a lot of first principles thinking and can rely less on industry best practices and ready-made solutions. Hence, developing our credit risk engine and finding great partners to establish the model took a lot of time and effort, and trial and error, but will payout in the long run.\u201d\n  To date, the company has supported merchants with over \u20ac30M in over 1,000 loans. Further, Myos also enjoys a 70 per cent retention rate consistently.\n \u201cWhile still spending \u20ac0,- on marketing, we\u2019re growing our loan portfolio consistently 10-20 per cent monthly. In the last 12 months alone we were able to triple the paid-out loan volume from \u20ac10M to over \u20ac30M. This corresponds to over 1.000 loans paid out to a few hundred online sellers. We\u2019re especially proud of our retention rates of consistently over 70 per cent, meaning a large fraction of our customers stay with us and take a new loan after repayment of a loan. For many sellers, Myos enables growth rates they would not have dreamt of otherwise. They are heavily supply-constrained and require working capital to fulfil the massive demand on online marketplaces for their products,\u201d says Hilgenfeldt\n According to Hilgenfeldt, the company expects revenue growth of &gt;100% in 2021 year over year. In terms of revenue model, Hilgenfeldt notes, \u201cWe earn money on the interest margin, i.e. loan interest minus re-financing interest.\u201d\n   Hilgenfeldt shares, \u201cWe are currently a team of 30 and hiring in all functions, especially developers, risk managers, account managers, and portfolio managers. For an overview of open positions see also  https://www.myos.com/en/career .\u201d\n  \u201cOur first priority is further improving the scalability and degree of automation of our lending platform. Simultaneously, we\u2019re defining the roadmap for internationalisation. The Netherlands is a pretty attractive market for two reasons: An advanced e-commerce market and a favorable regulatory environment for FinTechs and SME lenders.

Suddenly, a snowflake moray eel named Qani heaves its muscled bucatini of a body out of the water and onto the ramp. It opens its mouth and bites the squid. The eel pauses a moment, opens its mouth again and, as if its tongue were a conveyor belt, sucks the squid even deeper into its mouth using a secret second set of jaws in its throat.\n  This particular eel mukbang, to Rita S. Mehta, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, was cinematic gold: footage that showed the bite, the prey transport with secondary jaws and the swallow. Her team had taped loads of footage of the eels feeding on the ramp, but none that showed the act from beginning to end.\n Dr. Mehta first described the moray eel\u2019s  second set of choppers, known as pharyngeal jaws, in 2007. When a moray hunts, it seizes its prey with the teeth of its outer jaw, and then  its pharyngeal jaws leap forward out of the throat and into the mouth to grasp the prey and drag it deeper into the eel\u2019s body.\n Now, Dr. Mehta has described how snowflake eels and other morays use their pharyngeal jaws to feed just as effectively on land as in water, according to a study  published this month in The Journal of Experimental Biology .\n Like many other fish, morays will eventually dry out if they leave water for too long. But Dr. Mehta and her colleagues cite a  study from 1979 that suggests a moray\u2019s outermost layer of skin contains certain mucus glands that may make these eels more resilient to time spent on land.\n And morays climbing out of water came as no surprise to some observers. Lana Sinapayen, an artificial life researcher who grew up in the Caribbean island of Martinique, said local fishermen often caught morays by placing squids on the shore and waiting for the eels to arrive. \u201cYou only need a solid stick to take your pick,\u201d she wrote in an email. Dr. Sinapayen was not involved in the research but wanted to emphasize that many local people have long known that morays can hunt on land.\n Such behavior has also long been reflected in scientific studies.  One paper from 1971 describes a moray that clambered into the same tide pool to hunt for five days straight.\n When Dani Rabaiotti, an environmental scientist based in London, volunteered at an aquarium as a teenager, she met a moray eel who knew how to slither onto a ledge and wait to be hand-fed. \u201cHe\u2019d learned it was easier than hanging out in the water with all the other hungry animals,\u201d she said.\n  Dr. Mehta had also seen morays hunting on land \u2014 snagging land crabs on a beach in Bali \u2014 but the real question of her research was what the eels did with their prey after they bit down. Did the eels have to return to the water? Or could they swallow on land?\n \u201cFish are mostly suction feeders and catch prey by sucking water in the mouth,\u201d said Peter Wainwright, a fish biomechanics expert at the University of California, Davis, who has previously worked with Dr. Mehta but was not involved with the new research. He added that \u201cmorays have evolved away from suction feeding.\u201d\n In 2014, Dr. Mehta decided to train a small cohort of eels to feed on land and to film them in the act. She sourced snowflake moray eels from an aquarium wholesaler, and two of her former graduate students, Benjamin Higgins and Jacob Harrison, designed and installed a sand-covered Plexiglas ramp in each eel tank.\n Over six years, Dr. Mehta and a rotating cast of students trained seven eels to feed on the ramp. By the end of the project, Kyle Donohoe, Dr. Mehta\u2019s former lab technician and a co-author on the study, had developed a rigid ramp regimen for the eels.\n Mr. Donohoe, who once worked in a lab where he trained seals and sea lions, proved a wildly effective trainer. As it turns out, training an eel is much like training a seal.\n \u201cConsistent feeding, increasing chances of reinforcement and patience,\u201d Mr. Donohoe said. He trained Qani to wiggle farther and farther up the ramp and feed from forceps in just three weeks \u2014 the fastest of any eel in the study.\n  Another eel, named Benjen, joined Dr. Mehta\u2019s lab early on. Benjen, who was nearly twice as long as Qani and the largest eel in the study, eventually refused to climb the ramp for the uniformly measured 1.1-inch pieces of squid that all of the other trained eels received. The mammoth moray would ascend the ramp only for  chunks of squid so large and disproportionate to the eel\u2019s body that one of the paper\u2019s reviewers requested Benjen be stricken from the statistical analysis of the paper.\n  In Dr. Mehta\u2019s eyes, one unexpected insight of the experiment was the resilience of eel memory. School breaks and holidays often interrupted eel training, but still, Benjen remembered the ramp. In the future, Dr. Mehta hopes a student will come along who wants to teach Benjen new tasks. He continues to live in the lab, where he still undulates, uninvited, onto the ramp, awaiting big squid.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 23:27:44", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name":

But it&#39;s a shift from decades ago, when Biden spearheaded efforts to pass the legislation that implemented the disparities in the first place.\n Critics have said the law which made the disparity, which has come to be known as the &#34;100 to 1 rule,&#34; has had a  disproportionate effect on Black Americans.\n It enforced a five-year minimum sentence for trafficking in 500 grams of powder cocaine, or five grams of crack.\n Driving the news: Regina LaBelle, acting director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, endorsed  the EQUAL Act during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday. The bill would give individuals convicted or sentenced for a federal cocaine offense a re-sentencing.\n  Between the lines: Biden&#39;s attitude toward drug laws has largely evolved over the course of his tenure in elected office.

Rather than relying on Wi-Fi, the leverages 5G. The company says it will be able to offer a similar \u201cultra-low latency\u201d that made the initial Wi-Fi product  so compelling.\n Mixhalo is working with a carrier to roll out the feature, but won\u2019t say which. It notes, however, that while it would work with LTE, for obvious reasons, 5G provides a greater opportunity to decrease latency.\n  Rodeo, meanwhile, is designed to work with existing venue wireless to circumvent the need to install an additional overlay system.\n \u201cThe Rodeo system actually reduces network strain since the existing access points are now aware of the Mixhalo traffic and can plan for and buffer network data accordingly,\u201d CEO John Vars tells TechCrunch. \u201cIf a venue has installed a wireless system post-2015, they are likely to have the necessary hardware to support Rodeo in their venue. We do need to install a server in the venue\u2019s server room, but that is the only hardware component of Rodeo.\u201d\n  Co-founded by Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger, Mixhalo launched its product onstage at Disrupt 2017 (with some help from Pharrell), promising to deliver live event sounds through its ultra-low latency streaming tech.\n Naturally, 2020 and the first half of this year have been a pretty major trial for a startup so tied to live events. Vars tells TechCrunch that the company was forced to reduce headcount at the beginning of the pandemic as contracts were ended, but adds that the company has managed to grow since, in part on the strength of a number of partnerships.\n  \u201cThe silver lining in all of this is that we got a chance to step back and laser-focus on improving our core product,\u201d says Vars. \u201cThese improvements include this announcement of Mixhalo Rodeo and Mixhalo over Cellular, as well as the capability to dynamically adjust latency based on physical position in the venue \u2014 we may not have had the time and opportunity to work on these improvements in the full swing of pre-pandemic business. With these new features, we\u2019ve seen piqued interest from partners in the sports world and are excited to see this use case of Mixhalo really take off.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:49:24", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u7528\u4e8e,reopen,mixhalo", "title": "\u4f5c\u4e3aReopen\u7684\u573a\u5730\uff0cMixhalo\u5ba3\u5e03\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5927\u578b\u6d3b\u52a8\u6d41\u5a92\u4f53 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tAs venues reopen, Mixhalo announces new tech for in-person live event streaming\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/as-venues-reopen-mixhalo-announces-new-technology-for-in-person-live-event-streaming/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7528\u4e8e", "reopen", "mixhalo"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "356b07b52af07c309512069b20b39e01.jpg", "infoid": 1067465, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u653f\u5e9c\u652f\u6301\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u51e0\u5341\u5e74\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u662f\u79fb\u6c11\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u6c47\u6b3e\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u5168\u7403\u6301\u7eed\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u3002\n \u73b0\u5728\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f01\u4e1a\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u5192\u9669\u4e2d\u594b\u6597\u4e86\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u7535\u8bdd\u5173\u7a0e\u6307\u63a7\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4eba\u4eec\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6253\u7535\u8bdd\uff0c\u76f8\u4fe1\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848 -

The financial round was led by Valar Ventures while Avid Ventures, Heartcore Capital and several prominent Nordic fintech unicorn founders participated in it.\n The two-year-old startup operates an eponymous mobile banking service. MAJORITY, whose name is a play on bringing financial inclusion to more people, runs a subscription service where it charges $5 a month to individuals and provides them with a range of financial services including an FDIC-insured bank account with early direct deposit at no overdraft fee, a debit card, mobile credit, and at-cost international phone calls.\n  Another reason why so many migrant communities are apprehensive of opening accounts with traditional banks, said Magnus Larsson (pictured above), founder and chief executive of MAJORITY, is that they don\u2019t feel welcome there.\n \u201cYou might not speak the language, or understand the cultural differences,\u201d he said. To tackle this, MAJORITY has hired customer and sales relation representatives from various communities to work with customers to understand their needs.\n Houston and Stockholm-headquartered MAJORITY also runs a community on its app to help individuals who have moved to the U.S. find familiar people and a \u201chome\u201d environment, he said. \u201cCustomers there find how to get a VISA as well as things like information about places to do local shopping,\u201d he said.\n \u201cAs veterans within the migrant tech sector, the team behind MAJORITY has already established themselves as builders of disruptive solutions for the world\u2019s immigrants,\u201d said James Fitzgerald, Founding Partner at Valar Ventures. \u201cBy supporting them for continued growth, we are confident that they will bring better and well-needed banking services to immigrants in the U.S.\u201d\n Starting today, the service is available in all 50 U.S. states and complies with local regulations, said Larsson, who previously served as the chief executive of Swedish technology firm Rebtel. Sutton Bank is MAJORITY\u2019s banking partner.\n The startup plans to deploy the new funding to expand its product offerings and broaden its team of about 80 people currently. \u201cSince we are a company of immigrants for immigrants, we also look forward to hiring diverse talent that exists within the different immigrant communities we serve. This is more important now than ever given that many have been hit hard by the pandemic,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:49:03", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u79fb\u6c11,mobile,\u94f6\u884c", "title": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u4e3a\u79fb\u6c11\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u94f6\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u7b79\u96c6\u4e861900\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tMAJORITY raises $19 million for its mobile banking service for migrants\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/majority-raises-19-million-for-its-mobile-banking-service-for-migrants/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u79fb\u6c11", "mobile", "\u94f6\u884c"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "38c4a5b57d7113083a0f30d582b8be46.jpg", "infoid": 1067464, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u8d44\u91d1\u5305\u62ec\u56de\u62a5\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u5e7f\u573aPEG\uff0cAPEX CAPITAL\u4f19\u4f34\u548c\u52a0\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06Zeller\u7684\u603b\u91cf\u7eb3\u5165\u4e00\u5e74\u5185\u76848100\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6570\u989d\u5305\u62ec\u7531Lee Fixel\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u548cSeed Funding\u7684\u5f15\u53d1\u7a0b\u5e8f\u9884\u5148\u53d1\u5c04\u7cfb\u5217A.\n  \u6cfd\u52d2\u4e8e\u53bb\u5e74\u7531Ben Pfisterer\uff0cSquare\u7684\u524d\u4e9a\u592a\u5730\u533a\u548c\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u8d1f\u8d23\u4eba\u548cDominic Yap\u6210\u7acb\uff0cFintech\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u6218\u7565\u548c\u589e\u957f\u94c5\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u4e8e5\u67084\u65e5\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea7\u54c1\u4e3a\u5c0f\u578b\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u5305\u62ecEFTPOS\uff08\u5728\u9500\u552e\u70b9\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u8d44\u91d1\u8f6c\u79fb\uff09\u7801\u5934\uff0c\u4e1a\u52a1\u8d26\u6237\u548c\u5361\u7247\u3002\n \u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u540e\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u6ce8\u518c\u4e861,500\u591a\u4e2a\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u4f01\u4e1a\uff0c\u6bcf\u5468\u652f\u4ed8\u91cf\u589e\u957f200\uff05\u3002\u5927\u7ea680\uff05\u7684\u4f01\u4e1a\u4ece\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6700\u5927\u94f6\u884c\u5f00\u59cb\u4f7f\u7528Zeller\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u7528\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u652f\u6301\u7684\u613f\u671b\u3002\n Zeller\u7684\u65b0\u8d44\u91d1\u5c06\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u5176\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u586b\u514518\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5c06\u652f\u6301Zeller\u8ba1\u5212\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u3002\n \u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u9648\u8ff0\u4e2d\uff0cSpark Capital Investor James Kuklinski\u8bf4\uff1a\u201c\u4ece\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u4e0eBen\u4f1a\u9762\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u6211\u4eec\u60f3\u6210\u4e3aZeller\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c\u666f\u89c2\u7531\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u73b0\u4efb\u8005\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u7684\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6280\u672f\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u65ad\u6210\u719f\u3002\u201c ", "note_en": "The funding included participation from returning investors Square Peg, Apex Capital Partners and Addition, and brings Zeller\u2019s total raised in under a year to $81 million AUD. This amount includes a pre-launch Series A led by Addition, the investment firm started by Lee Fixel, and seed funding.\n  Zeller was founded last year by Ben Pfisterer, Square\u2019s former Asia Pacific and Australia head, and Dominic Yap, the fintech\u2019s former strategy and growth lead. The company  launched its first products for small businesses on May 4, including EFTPOS (electronic funds transfer at point of sale) terminals, business accounts and cards.\n The company says more than 1,500 Australian businesses signed up in the month after its launch, and weekly payment volume has been growing 200%. About 80% of businesses who started using Zeller switched from Australia\u2019s four biggest banks, citing their desire for lower fees and better customer support.\n Zeller\u2019s new funding will be used to grow its research and engineering hub, including filling 18 new engineering roles that will support Zeller\u2019s plan to become a fully-regulated business bank.\n In a press statement, Spark Capital investor James Kuklinski said, \u201cFrom our first meeting with Ben, we knew we wanted to be a part of Zeller. Australia\u2019s business banking landscape is dominated by a small group of incumbents, and is ripe for disruption through simpler, more transparent pricing, best-in-class technology and better

", "note_en": "Today, the company is revealing this document to the world and \u201copen sourcing\u201d it with the goal of making the framework part of the conversation to address racial inequity in startup investing and in the broader world.\n Bannon, like many people, was looking for ways to better understand the impact of racism in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder last year. He began to think about it, much like climate change, as a huge, multi-dimensional set of problems. He wanted to understand the scope of these problems to use his investment capital to help address some of these issues.\n  \u201cSo we incubated the Racial Inequity Drawdown at 50 years and the reason we did is because we got excited about finding and funding companies that addressed racial inequity in the same way we do the climate crisis or disease or all these other things \u2014 and it\u2019s really hard because it\u2019s such a multi-dimensional issue,\u201d he said.\n As a starting point, he decided to create a document similar to the Climate Drawdown that looked at these issues in a single place to help him and his firm understand the scope of the problem, and to help them look at their investments through a racial equity lens.\n \u201cWe started to pull together resources just for ourselves, so that we could have racial equity be a lens that we use for our own investing and we were like, \u2018Oh my God, there\u2019s a lot here.&#39;\u201d\n That led to one of the company\u2019s fellows taking ownership of the project with the goal of fleshing out a comprehensive document. The resulting framework is built on three pillars or broad sets of categories including Health &amp; Wellbeing, Equality of Opportunity and Sustainable Systems with each pillar including different elements of the racial inequity problem that need to be addressed. And each sub-category includes a detailed definition of the problem, key terms, a set of companies and organizations currently working on the issue and what still needs to be done (perhaps openings for startup ideas).\n  To make it more than a document created in-house, Bannon and his team wanted to take it a step further, so he brought in a group of college students to begin reaching out to communities of color to participate in this initiative and bring it to life.\n One of those students is Elizabeth Poku, a rising Sophomore at Princeton, who said she was drawn to the project as a way to flip the script on racism. \u201cWhat I hope to do in the future is really hijack existing systems and structures that used to put down and oppress people and make sure we\u2019re changing those narratives, changing those systems to really work for those that they were putting down,\u201d she explained.\n She saw the Racial inequity Drawdown as a way to help to do this and joined the team, helping to write some sections of the document including the one on the impact of lack of access to healthcare on people of color. She says that the team then reached out to communities working on the problem and began to compile resources into a database including startups that have been working to solve the different elements documented in the framework.\n  Bannon says that investors, who want to build racial equity as a lens into their investment process can use this document as a guide, and it also acts as a signal that a firm cares about this as it allocates resources to different startups, certainly that\u2019s the case for Fifty Years.\n \u201cPart of this for us was just defining what that means, and now we have a really great start here. And then second is letting entrepreneurs know that we care about racial equity as a lens, and that if you are addressing racial equity, that\u2019s going to be a big plus in our book.\u201d\n He added, \u201cObviously, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re definitely going to be able to fund you, but that\u2019s going to be a big plus, and we\u2019re excited about that and attacking racial inequity through technology and entrepreneurship.\u201d\n The firm sees today\u2019s launch as a starting point, one that others can build on and add to the conversation, and build on this initial framework.

The startup and investor communities are beginning to realize that many founders can\u2019t go without pay for months.\n Founders of SaaS startups are at an advantage in this scenario as the sector now has many companies generating revenue almost from day one, sometimes without needing to raise any funding at all.\n However, the success still doesn\u2019t tell founders how much to pay themselves, or what others are doing. To help with this, we\u2019ve gathered insights from founders and VCs and narrowed down the most important factors and benchmarks to guide your decision.\n  Founder compensation is often referred to as a \u201cfounder salary,\u201d but anchoring the conversation around the salary framework can create the wrong expectation. For example, you could try to establish a correlation between what you plan to pay yourself and your past or current value on the job market. Instead, the data we gathered indicates that founders typically take a pay cut from their previous salaries.\n Chris Sosnowski is an interesting example: Before he \u201ctook the plunge\u201d at the beginning of 2020 to work full time on his water data management startup  Waterly, he used to earn \u201cwell over\u201d $100,000. But he says his previous salary wasn\u2019t a key factor when he set his compensation. \u201cI decided to pay myself based on what I thought it would take to keep the company running,\u201d he wrote to TechCrunch.\n That brings to mind deferred compensation, which will be familiar to anyone who owns equity. Having put his own money into the company and owning the majority of it, Sosnowski is set to be compensated for his efforts if all goes well. \u201cFor the record, I do hope to pay myself back [a] salary for the year or so [it is] reduced like this,\u201d he said.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:48:15", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u59cb\u4eba,saas", "title": "\u4f5c\u4e3aSaaS\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u591a\u5c11\u94b1 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tHow much to pay yourself as a SaaS founder\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/how-much-to-pay-yourself-as-a-saas-founder/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u59cb\u4eba", "saas"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "d62b916f02d63324e9623d36780b900e.jpg", "infoid": 1067461, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "6\u670822\u65e5\u7684\u5e03\u9c81\u585e\u5c14\uff08\u8def\u900f\u793e\uff09 - \u8c37\u6b4c\u5468\u4e8c\u518d\u6b21\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u805a\u5149\u706f\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u5bf9\u5176\u6570\u5b57\u5e7f\u544a\u4e1a\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5bf9\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u548c\u5e7f\u544a\u5546\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\n \u6b27\u76df\u7ade\u8d5b\u6267\u6cd5\u8005\uff06\uff0339;\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc780\u4ebf\u6b27\u5143\uff0895\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9635\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u5728\u7ebf\u8d2d\u7269\uff0cAndroid\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u3002\n \u6b27\u6d32\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8c03\u67e5\u8c37\u6b4c\u662f\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u8bbf\u95ee\u7f51\u7ad9\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8c03\u67e5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\u62c5\u5fc3\u8c37\u6b4c\u4f7f\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u5728\u7ebf\u5e7f\u544a\u670d\u52a1\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ade\u4e89\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u6280\u672f\u5806\u6808\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u6b27\u6d32\u7ade\u4e89\u4e13\u5458Margrethe Westager\u5728\u4e00\u4efd\u58f0\u660e\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u3002\n \u8c37\u6b4c\u53bb\u5e74\u4ece\u7f51\u4e0a\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e861470\u4ebf\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6536\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5e7f\u544a\u5305\u62ec\u641c\u7d22\uff0cYouTube\u548cGmail\u6838\u7b97\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u9500\u552e\u548c\u5229\u6da6\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n \u5927\u7ea616\uff05\u7684\u6536\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0339;

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.\n Google generated $147 billion in revenue from online ads last year, more than any other company in the world, with ads including search, YouTube and Gmail accounting for the bulk of its overall sales and profits.\n About 16% of its revenue came from the company&#39;s display or network business, in which other media companies use Google technology to sell ads on their website and apps.\n &#34;We will also be looking at Google&#39;s policies on user tracking to make sure they are in line with fair competition,&#34; Vestager added.\n  &#34;Thousands of European businesses use our advertising products to reach new customers and fund their websites every single day. They choose them because they&#39;re competitive and effective,&#34; a Google spokesperson said.\n The Commission said its investigation would span Google services, including Display &amp; Video 360 (DV360) and Google Ads to buy online display advertisements on YouTube, Google Ad Manager which is used by publishers to auction ad space, and AdX which is one of several marketplaces which can manage auctions.\n Google&#39;s plan to remove browser cookies and also to stop tracking Android users via a tool known as an advertising identifier will also be looked at.\n Reuters reported exclusively last week that the EU competition enforcer would investigate Google\u2019s digital advertising business before the end of the year.\n Google&#39;s adtech business is also under fire in the United States, with the Justice Department, joined by some states, suing last year for abusing its dominance in search ads. A group of states led by Texas in a later lawsuit focused on anti-competitive behaviour on the network side of the house.\n A new EU inquiry could end up targeting all of Google&#39;s ad empire. According to market researcher eMarketer, Google could control 27% of global online ad spending this year, including 57% for search ads and 10% of display.\n While the figures may not appear to represent a monopoly at first glance, advertisers and rivals contend that Google&#39;s various software play a role in so many facets of the market that the company is impossible to avoid.", "posttime": "2021-06-22 22:40:58", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u5e7f\u544a,google,\u8c37\u6b4c,rust,\u6b27\u76df", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u5728\u6b27\u76df\u5341\u5b57\u67b6\u518d\u6b21\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u53cd\u6258\u62c9\u65af\u67e5\u8be2 ", "title_en": "Google in EU Crosshairs Again With Advertising Antitrust Inquiry", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-antitrust-regulators-investigate-googles-adtech-business-2021-06-22/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u5e7f\u544a", "google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "rust", "\u6b27\u76df"]}]
