", "note_en": "Interestingly, those revenue figures have been adjusted to include fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets \u2014 it means that Revolut holds some crypto assets on its balance sheet. Revolut made $54 million (\u00a339 million) in fair value gains on cryptocurrency assets.\n Gross profit reached $170 million (\u00a3123 million) last year. At the same time, the company still reports operating losses. In particular, Q1 2020 was a particularly bad quarter with $76 million (\u00a355 million) in adjusted operating loss.\n  In 2020, total non-adjusted operating loss reached $277 million (\u00a3200.6 million). Like many tech companies, administrative expenses are responsible for this loss. With a staff of 2,200 people, the company spent $367 million (\u00a3266 million) on administrative costs alone. But things seem to be improving as you can see:\n  These trends aren\u2019t that surprising as I reported that fintech startups spent most of 2020  focusing on profitability and improving their margins. At the end 2020, Revolut had 14.5 million personal customers and 500,000 companies using Revolut Business.\n  \u201cAs the extraordinary circumstances of 2020 drove the trend towards digital financial management we continued to innovate for customers to make their financial lives easier and accelerate daily use. We launched 24 new retail and business products, expanded into the US, Japan and Australia and launched banking services in Lithuania, all while significantly improving our profitability,\u201d founder and CEO Nikolay Storonsky said in a statement. \u201cWe began 2021 with a more resilient and productive business that will enhance our trajectory towards rapid growth.\u201d\n When you compare Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, things are radically different for the fintech company. Revenue increased by 130% year-over-year and gross profit grew by 300% between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021.\n Revolut has been launching a ton of products to diversify its sources of revenue. It is increasingly becoming a financial super app with current accounts, debit cards, trading services, insurance products, premium subscriptions, cryptocurrency trading and more.\n Interestingly, interchange revenue from card transactions represents a good chunk of the company\u2019s revenue. In 2020, cards and interchange generated $131 million (\u00a395 million) in revenue. Every time a Revolut customer makes a card purchase, the card scheme (Visa or Mastercard) gives back some fees to Revolut. It\u2019s an incredibly small percentage-based fee, but it can add up when you generate millions of purchases.\n Foreign exchange and wealth generated $111 million (\u00a380 million) in revenue. That\u2019s another big one. And finally, subscriptions, such as Revolut Plus, Revolut Premium and Revolut Metal, accounted for $104 million (\u00a375 million) in revenue.\n Those are three strong pillars that all contribute to the company\u2019s bottom line. They all represent a bit less or a bit more than a third of the company\u2019s overall revenue.\n  While the company has expanded aggressively over the years, the U.K. is still by far its biggest market. In 2020, 88.4% of the company\u2019s (non-adjusted) revenue was related to its activities in the U.K. The European Economic Area without the U.K. represented 10.2% of revenue. The U.S., Japan, Australia and other markets were nearly negligible.\n Revolut has also raised a  mega round of funding in 2020 \u2014\u00a0a $500 million Series D round that was extended to $580 million in total. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the company launches an initial public offering within the next 12 months.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:36", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name":

out the company\u2019s Series A at $43.5 million, after the company  initially raised $18.5 million in April (some at the time reported this as its Series A, but it seems the round had yet to be completed). The full round includes Zeev Ventures, Vertex Ventures Israel, and Innovation Endeavors, with  Vintage Investment Partners added in this most recent tranche. DataRails is not disclosing its valuation, except to note that it has doubled in the last four months, with hundreds of customers and on target to cross 1,000 this year, with a focus on the North American market. It has raised $55 million in total.\n The challenge that DataRails has identified is that on one hand, SMBs have started to adopt a lot more apps, including software delivered as a service, to help them manage their businesses \u2014 a trend that has been accelerated in the last year with the pandemic and the knock-on effect that has had for remote working and bringing more virtual elements to replace face-to-face interactions. Those apps can include Salesforce, NetSuite, Sage, SAP, QuickBooks, Zuora, Xero, ADP and more.\n  But on the other hand, those in the business who manage its finances and financial reporting are lacking the tools to look at the data from these different apps in a holistic way. While Excel is a default application for many of them, they are simply reading lots of individual spreadsheets rather than integrated data analytics based on the numbers.\n DataRails has built a platform that can read the reported information, which typically already lives in Excel spreadsheets, and automatically translate it into a bigger picture view of the company.\n For SMEs, Excel is such a central piece of software, yet such a pain point for its lack of extensibility and function, that this predicament was actually the germination of starting DataRails in the first place,\n Didi Gurfinkel, the CEO who co-founded the company with Eyal Cohen (the CPO) said that DataRails\u2019 initially set out to create a more general purpose product that could help analyze and visualize anything from Excel.\n  \u201cWe started the company with a vision to save the world from Excel spreadsheets,\u201d he said, by taking them and helping to connect the data contained within them to a structured database. \u201cThe core of our technology knows how to take unstructured data and map that to a central database.\u201d Before 2020, DataRails (which was founded in 2015) applied this to a variety of areas with a focus on banks, insurance companies, compliance and data integrity.\n Over time, it could see a very specific application emerging, specifically for SMEs: providing a platform for FP&amp;A (financial planning and analytics), which didn\u2019t really have a solution to address it at the time. \u201cSo we enabled that to beat the market.\u201d\n \u201cThey\u2019re already investing so much time and money in their software, but they still don\u2019t have analytics and insight,\u201d said Gurfinkel.\n That turned out to be fortunate timing, since \u201cdigital transformation\u201d and getting more out of one\u2019s data was really starting to get traction in the world of business,  specifically in the world of SMEs, and CFOs and other people who oversaw finances were already looking for something like this.\n The typical DataRails customer might be as small as a business of 50 people, or as big as 1,000 employees, a size of business that is too small for enterprise solutions, \u201cwhich can cost tens of thousands of dollars to implement and use,\u201d added Cohen, among other challenges. But as with so many of the apps that are being built today to address those using Excel, the idea with DataRails is low-code or even more specifically no-code, which means \u201cno IT in the loop,\u201d he said.\n \u201cThat\u2019s why we are so successful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are crossing the barrier and making our solution easy to use.\u201d\n The company doesn\u2019t have a huge number of competitors today, either, although companies like  Cube (which also  recently raised some money) are among them. And others like Stripe, while currently not focussing on FP&amp;A, have most definitely been expanding the tools that it is providing to businesses as part of their bigger play to manage payments and subsequently other processes related to financial activity, so perhaps it, or others like it, might at some point become competitors in this space as well.\n In the meantime, Gurfinkel said that other areas that DataRails is likely to expand to cover alongside FP&amp;A are likely to include HR, inventory, and \u201cplanning for anything,\u201d any process that you have running in Excel. Another interesting turn would be how and if DataRails decides to look beyond Excel at other spreadsheets, or bypass spreadsheets altogether.\n The scope of the opportunity \u2014 in the U.S. alone there are more than 30 million small businesses \u2014 is what\u2019s attracting the investment here.\n \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to reinvest in DataRails and continue working with the team to help them navigate their recent explosive and rapid growth,\u201d said Yanai Oron, General Partner at  Vertex Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWith innovative yet accessible technology and a tremendous untapped market opportunity, DataRails is primed to scale and become the leading FP&amp;A solution for SMEs everywhere.\u201d\n \u201cBusinesses are constantly about to start, in the midst of, or have just finished a round of financial reporting\u2014it\u2019s a never-ending cycle,\u201d added Oren Zeev, founding partner at Zeev Ventures. \u201cBut with DataRails, FP&amp;A can be simple, streamlined, and effective, and that\u2019s a vision we\u2019ll back again and again.\u201d", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:52:18", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "datarails,financial", "title": "DataRails Books $ 25m\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e3aSMBS\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8d22\u52a1\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u5177 ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tDataRails books $25M more to build better financial reporting tools for SMBs\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/datarails-books-25m-more-to-build-better-financial-reporting-tools-for-smbs/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["datarails", "financial"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "2f767704e76e7b1a004f41d1a06bcc46.jpg", "infoid": 1067189, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u7845\u8c37\u79d1\u6280\u5de8\u5934\u5468\u4e00\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5b83\u5df2\u7ecf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\uff06\uff0334;\u5728\u4e1c\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u6821\u56ed\u88ab\u8feb\u5173\u95ed\u51a0\u72b6\u75c5\u6bd2\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u3002\n  \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4eec\uff06\uff0339;\u91cd\u65b0\u5173\u95ed\u6821\u56ed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6574\u4e2aU.K\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u3002\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u5168\u56fd\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002\n \u6821\u56ed\u4f26\u6566\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u51e0\u4e2a\u6821\u56ed\u7f51\u7ad9\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4e8e2012\u5e74\u7531\u4ee5\u8272\u5217\u6280\u672f\u8001\u5c06\u548c\u8c37\u6b4c\u5458\u5de5Eze Vidra\u5f00\u5e55\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f26\u6566\uff06\uff0339;\u542f\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5f00\u59cb\u8d77\u98de\u3002\n Vidra\u5468\u4e00\u544a\u8bc9CNBC\uff0c\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u662f\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u82e6\u4e50\u53c2\u534a\u3002 \uff06\uff0334;\u751c\u871c\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u82e6\u6da9\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5b83\u7684\uff06\uff0339;\u5b83\u7684\u4e00\u7aef\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n \uff06\uff0334;\u6211\u4e2a\u4eba\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u770b\u5230U.K.\u542f\u52a8\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u957f\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;

Campus in East London after it was forced to close by the coronavirus pandemic.\n  &#34;We&#39;re closing Campus to support start-ups throughout the U.K.,&#34; the company said, claiming that it can provide support for start-ups across the country without a physical space.\n Campus London, one of several Campus sites worldwide, was opened in 2012 by Israeli tech veteran and Google employee Eze Vidra as London&#39;s start-up scene began to take off.\n Vidra told CNBC on Monday that the closing of Campus is emotional and bittersweet. &#34;The sweet part is that it succeeded and the bitter part is that it&#39;s an end of an era,&#34; he said.\n &#34;I&#39;m personally very happy to see how the U.K. start-up ecosystem has grown,&#34; said Vidra, adding that it feels a bit like Campus is &#34;no longer needed as much&#34; now that London&#39;s start-up scene is established.\n  Located in the gentrified Shoreditch neighborhood \u2014 a few hundred meters from the Old Street gyratory system that became known as &#34;Silicon Roundabout&#34; \u2014 Campus was often thought of as being at the epicenter of London&#39;s Tech City, which some tech workers say  may never be the same again.\n  Campus contained co-working space, a cafe, and an event space. It was used by a variety of accelerators and start-up programs including Seedcamp, Entrepreneur First, Code First, and Silicon Drinkabout. There were thousands of events put on there over the years and Googlers used to come in and offer free mentoring to start-ups.\n Campus operated at a loss since its inception, Vidra said, adding that it was never meant to be revenue generating. &#34;It was quite a high investment,&#34; said Vidra, who is now a managing partner at Remagine Ventures.\n Google said the U.K. start-up community &#34;doesn&#39;t need access to a single shared physical space as much as it needs access to resources, mentors and programs available at scale, anywhere.&#34;\n &#34;When I first set foot in Campus London in 2012, it felt like magic,&#34; said Marta Krupinska, head of Google for Start-ups U.K., on Twitter. &#34;It&#39;s played a pivotal role in making London such a successful start-up ecosystem and after almost 10 years, a new chapter opens. So much to celebrate, and still so much work to do.&#34;\n  Sarah Drinkwater, who ran Campus from 2014 to 2018, said in  a blog on Monday: &#34;It&#39;s right that Campus won&#39;t re-open after the Covid closure. Scenes change, and you have to play it as it lays.&#34;\n Drinkwater, who worked on Google Maps before she joined Campus, said there are hundreds of coworking spaces in London and dozens and dozens of accelerators across the U.K. today.\n &#34;This one scrappy space on Bonhill Street provided the container for many different sub-communities to start or come together, and a way in for incredibly different profiles who wanted to find out what this &#39;tech&#39; thing was,&#34; wrote Drinkwater.\n &#34;Repeatedly, I&#39;d meet an uncertain early founder in the cafe trying to figure it out then bump into them, a year later, with a team and funding and a clear way forwards,&#34; said Drinkwater. &#34;Sometimes, those companies flew; sometimes they didn&#39;t and a great hire was back on the market.&#34;\n Tech entrepreneurs, developers and investors reminisced about their times at Campus on social media and in blog posts.\n &#34;So many great memories and good friends met there,&#34; wrote Amandine Flachs, the CEO and co-founder of Wild Meta AI, which aims to help video game developers create smarter and more human-like AIs with machine learning.\n Hannah Blake, CEO and co-founder of podcast app Entale, told CNBC it&#39;s a &#34;big loss&#34; and that it was &#34;the heart and soul of the London start-up scene.&#34;\n Andrew Eland, who worked at Google for over 11 years, leading teams in Silicon Valley working on Google Maps among other projects, said Campus broadened the people in the London technology scene, and the type of problems they worked on.\n &#34;I think the idea with all the Campus sites was to help incubate early tech communities, and London is obviously well beyond that stage now,&#34; Eland told CNBC.\n  With thousands of start-ups, London is now one of the main tech hubs in Europe, but the city is yet to spawn a tech behemoth on anything like Google&#39;s scale.\n &#34;While we still haven&#39;t produced a Google or a Facebook, we did 100 unicorns (businesses valued at $1 billion or more),&#34; said Vidra. &#34;Many of them had their first public pitch or appearance on the Campus stage including TransferWise and Revolut.&#34;\n Google operates other campuses in Madrid, Sao Paulo, Seoul, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Warsaw. Google did not immediately respond when CNBC asked if it plans to close any of the other campuses.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:45:26", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "google,\u8c37\u6b4c,\u6821\u56ed,forced", "title": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6d41\u884c\u8feb\u4f7f\u5b83\u5173\u95ed\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u6253\u5f00\u6821\u56ed\u7684\u4f26\u6566\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u7a7a\u95f4 ", "title_en": "Google says it has decided not to reopen Campus, its London-based startup space, after the pandemic forced it to close", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/21/google-campus-london-closes-to-start-ups-post-covid.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["google", "\u8c37\u6b4c", "\u6821\u56ed", "forced"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "36e8c23f1e5c0b5cfab1c198ca3d2cae.jpg", "infoid": 1067188, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5fb7\u56fd\uff06\uff0339;\u8054\u90a6\u5361\u7279\u5c14\u529e\u4e8b\u5904\uff0cBundeskartellamt\uff0c\u4eca\u5929\u542f\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9Apple\u5173\u4e8e\u4e0eApp Store\uff0c\u5176\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7d22\u8d54\u7684\u8bc9\u8bbc\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u3002\n \u4eca\u5929\u5ba3\u5e03\u7684\u82f9\u679c\u5ba3\u5e03\u5c06\u786e\u5b9aCupertino Tech Giant\u662f\u5426\u6301\u6709A\uff06\uff0334;\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff06\uff0334;\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u82f9\u679c\u5747\u62e5\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff06\uff0334;\u5176\u4ed6\u516c\u53f8\uff06\uff0334;\u6311\u6218\u5b83\u3002\n  \u6211\u4eec\u73b0\u5728\u5c06\u5ba1\u67e5\u5176\u4e13\u6709\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edfIOS\uff0cApple\u5728\u5176iPhone\u5468\u56f4\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u904d\u5e03\u591a\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u3002 Apple\u751f\u4ea7\u5e73\u677f\u7535\u8111\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u5236\u9020\u5404\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u4ea7\u54c1\u5916\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u516c\u53f8\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9bApp Store\uff0cIcloud\uff0cAppleCare\uff0cApple Music\uff0cApple Arcade\uff0cApple TV +\u4ee5\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u670d\u52a1\u4e1a\u52a1\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u9762\u5ba1\u89c6\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u5e02\u573a\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5176\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u5546\u5e97\u7684\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f7fApple\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cd\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u7684\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\n \u65b0\u95fb\u7a3f\u5bf9\u5176\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u70b9;\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u5bb6\u8de8\u5e02\u573a\u91cd\u89c6\u7684\u516c\u53f8\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u7981\u6b62\u8be5\u516c\u53f8\u6765\u81ea\uff06\uff0334;\u4ece\u4e8b\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002\uff06\uff0334;\n \u8be5\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u8868\u793a\u5df2\u6536\u5230\uff06\uff0334;\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53cd\u7ade\u4e89\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u5173\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\uff06\uff0334;\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4e0e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684ATT\u63a8\u51fa\u6216\u5e94\u7528\u8ddf\u8e2a\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u5173\u3002 4\u6708\u4efd\uff0c\u4e5d\u4e2a\u884c\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\u4ee3\u8868Facebook\u548c\u51fa\u7248\u5546Axel Springer\u7b49\u516c\u53f8\u5411\u8054\u90a6\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u63d0\u8d77\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u6295\u8bc9\uff0c\u58f0\u79f0Apper\uff06\uff0339;

", "note_en": "Germany&#39;s Federal Cartel Office, the Bundeskartellamt, today initiated proceedings against Apple on the claims of anti-competitive behavior related to the  App Store, its products, and other services, according to a  press release.\n The proceeding against Apple announced today will determine whether the Cupertino tech giant holds a &#34;paramount significance across markets&#34; and whether, through its ecosystem, Apple holds enough power to make it difficult for &#34;other companies&#34; to challenge it.\n  We will now examine whether with its proprietary operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem around its  iPhone that extends across several markets. Apple produces tablets, computers and wearables and provides a host of device-related services. In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers the \u200cApp Store\u200c,  iCloud,  AppleCare,  Apple Music,  Apple Arcade,  Apple TV+ as well as other services as part of its services business. Besides assessing the company\u2019s position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data. A main focus of the investigations will be on the operation of the \u200cApp Store\u200c as it enables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties.\n The press release is short on specifics on what the outcome of its investigation may lead to; however, the office says that if it determines a company to be of importance across markets, it may prohibit that company from &#34;engaging in anti-competitive practices.&#34;\n The office says it has received &#34;various complaints relating to potentially anti-competitive practices,&#34; particularly related to the recent rollout of ATT or the App Tracking Transparency framework. In April, nine industry associations representing companies like Facebook and publisher Axel Springer  filed an antitrust complaint to the federal office, claiming that Apple&#39;s ATT framework will severely hurt publishers and their bottom lines, deeming it a threat to their business.\n According to the press release, another complaint that the office received related to the pre-installation of Apple&#39;s own apps on its devices. The office directly references section 19a of the German Competition Act, which states &#34;the abuse of a dominant position by one or several undertakings is prohibited&#34; as a potential clause that Apple may be violating.\n Russia recently took the first major step against Apple for the pre-installation of its own apps, requiring the company to  show users a screen to download government-approved apps during initial device setup. Similar legislation being proposed in the U.S. Congress  would require Apple to give users the ability to delete all pre-installed Apple apps, instead of a select handful that users may currently delete.\n The Bundeskartellamt also lists ongoing disputes regarding Apple&#39;s in-app purchasing system, which gives the tech giant a 30% commission of all purchases made and the restriction that apps may only be distributed on Apple devices through the company&#39;s \u200cApp Store\u200c and not other third-party app marketplaces.\n Ummm, that\u2019s the main reason I buy Apple devices. It\u2019s all integrated, I can see all my stuff across multiple devices etc. I buy into Apple because it IS ring fenced and controlled!\n Why is this not a problem with cars? How come I can&#39;t install and sideload any apps inside my car system? Tesla doesn&#39;t allow me to install some kind of carplay app or even have perhaps a music streaming service of my choice.. Honestly, I&#39;m not sure this is all in the best interest of consumers.. Yes, the competition is good.. But if the cars get taken over by virus&#39;s and starting killing people, is that ok also? I continue to think the walled garden is a good choice.. Even if it limits dev&#39;s in some ways.. You know when they used to sell retail software in stores, the stores/wholesale pipeline took over 75% of the profits.. And was that not a problem before??\n Russia, Germany, who\u2019s next? ?  Don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t use it, android is that way ?\u200d\u2642\ufe0f?\n  Yup.  I think that&#39;s the most reasonable compromise. Add a setup screen where you get to pick default apps. Randomize those apps, and either have them curated (that comes with the problem: who does the curation?) or perhaps auto-generated based on App Store popularity.  Something like this, but for more types of apps:\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it ? if people want spyware and malware, android is over there ?\n  After a long wait, YouTube for iOS is officially gaining picture-in-picture support, allowing all users, non-premium and premium subscribers, to close the YouTube app and continue watching their video in a small pop-up window.\rIn a statement to MacRumors, YouTube says that picture-in-picture is currently rolling out to all premium subscribers on iOS and that a larger rollout to all US iOS...\n The Apple news cycle started to move beyond WWDC this week, but that doesn&#39;t mean there still wasn&#39;t a lot to talk about, led by the official debut of the much-leaked Beats Studio Buds that might give us a hint of what to expect for the second-generation AirPods Pro.\rWith no hardware announcements at WWDC, we also took a look at when we might finally see the long-rumored redesigned MacBook...\n A wireless network naming bug has been discovered in iOS that effectively disables an iPhone&#39;s ability to connect to Wi-Fi.\rSecurity researcher Carl Schou found that after joining a Wi-Fi network with the name &#34;%p%s%s%s%s%n&#34; his iPhone&#39;s Wi-Fi functionality was left &#34;permanently disabled.&#34; Changing a hotspot&#39;s SSID did nothing to correct the problem, with even a reboot failing to make a...\n With iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, Apple is adding several quality of life improvements, which are designed to address some of the complaints that people have had with these operating systems for years now.\rSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.

", "note_en": "Exclusive: Watch footage showing the &#39;destruction zone&#39; in Amazon&#39;s Dunfermline warehouse where millions of unsold items are destroyed every year\n  Online giant   Amazon is destroying millions of items of unsold stock every year, products that are often new and unused, ITV News can reveal.\n Footage gathered by ITV News shows waste on an astonishing level.   And this is from just one of 24 fulfilment centres they currently operate in the UK.  Undercover filming from inside Amazon&#39;s Dunfermline warehouse reveals the sheer scale of the waste: Smart TVs, laptops, drones, hairdryers, top of the range headphones, computer drives, books galore, thousands of sealed face masks \u2013 all sorted into boxes marked \u201cdestroy\u201d.\n  Products that were never sold, or returned by a customer. Almost all could have been redistributed to charities or those in need. Instead, they are thrown into vast bins, carried away by lorries (which we tracked), and dumped at either recycling centres or, worse, a landfill site.\n  An ex-employee, who asked for anonymity, told us: &#34;From a Friday to a Friday our target was to generally destroy 130,000 items a week.   &#34;I used to gasp. There&#39;s no rhyme or reason to what gets destroyed: Dyson fans, Hoovers, the occasional MacBook and iPad; the other day, 20,000 Covid (face) masks still in their wrappers.\n  &#34;Overall, 50 percent of all items are unopened and still in their shrink wrap. The other half are returns and in good condition. Staff have just become numb to what they are being asked to do.\u201d\n In one week in April, a leaked document from inside the Dunfermline warehouse showed more than 124,000 items marked &#39;destroy&#39;. To repeat, that&#39;s just for seven days. In contrast, just 28,000 items in the same period were labelled &#39;donate&#39;.   The same manager admitted to us that in some weeks, as many as 200,000 items could be marked &#39;destroy&#39;.\n  Why are hundreds of thousands of products being destroyed in this way? The answer is Amazon\u2019s hugely successful business model. Many vendors choose to house their products in Amazon\u2019s vast warehouses.   But the longer the goods remain unsold, the more a company is charged to store them. It is eventually cheaper to dispose of the goods, especially stock from overseas, than to continue storing the stock.\n Greenpeace&#39;s Sam Chetan Welsh told us: \u201cIt&#39;s an unimaginable amount of unnecessary waste, and just shocking to see a multi-billion pound company getting rid of stock in this way.\n  &#34;Stuff that\u2019s not even single use but not being used at all, straight off the production line and into the bin. As long as Amazon\u2019s business model relies on this kind of disposal culture, things are only going to get worse. The government must step in and bring in legislation immediately.\u201d  In an interview before he knew about our investigation, Amazon\u2019s UK boss John Boumphrey told ITV News the amount the company destroys is \u201cextremely small.\u201d\n What Amazon is doing is not illegal. In a response to the findings of our investigation, the company said: \u201cWe are working towards a goal of zero product disposal and our priority is to resell, donate to charitable organisations or recycle any unsold products. No items are sent to landfill in the UK. As a last resort, we will send items to energy recovery, but we&#39;re working hard to drive the number of times this happens down to zero.\u201d\n  Go forty miles southwest from Dunfermline and you\u2019ll arrive in Glasgow, where the UK will host the world\u2019s biggest ever climate conference in November. And yet, just up the road, Amazon is producing huge amounts of environmental waste.\n Leaders could do worse than begin by telling the world\u2019s biggest online retailer to set an example.\n   Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told ITV News he was &#34;very surprised&#34; about the findings of our investigation and said he wanted &#34;to get to the bottom of what is actually happening&#34;.\n &#34;I know that Amazon is committed to net zero, they\u2019ve committed huge amounts of investment to the rainforest, to keeping the rainforest going and I\u2019m surprised,&#34; Mr Kwarteng said.\n &#34;I haven\u2019t read the report so I need to look at the report to see what my response is. But I think Amazon should do the right thing and it would be very disappointing if this is true.&#34;", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:39:41", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a,\u80a1\u7968,amazon,\u552e\u51fa,destroying", "title": "\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a\u6bcf\u5e74\u5728\u5176\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u6467\u6bc1\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u672a\u552e\u51fa\u7684\u80a1\u7968 ", "title_en": "Amazon destroying millions of items of unsold stock in its warehouses every year", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u4e9a\u9a6c\u900a", "\u80a1\u7968", "amazon", "\u552e\u51fa"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "7fd6822deba2be1e049e03d463a24614.jpeg", "infoid": 1067184, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4e0a\u5468\u6211\u53c2\u52a0\u4e86.debug\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u4f1a\u8bae\uff0c\u6211\u516c\u53f8\u4e3e\u529e\u5c55\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u6539\u53d8\u6211\u7684\u601d\u60f3\u201d\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728\u90a3\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u4ee3\u8868\u7740\u4e00\u4e2a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u9080\u8bf7\u4eba\u4eec\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u544a\u8bc9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\n   \u9664\u4e86\u7b11\u8bdd\uff0c\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u7f8e\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u3002\u5b83\u5728Web\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u58f0\u660e\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u529f\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5f53\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7136\u540e\uff086\u62167\u5e74\u524d\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u5e94\u5b83\u5f88\u597d\u3002\n \u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fa7\u9762\uff0cember\u65e9\u4e9b\u65f6\u5019\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u540c\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u8868\u6f14\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u592a\u4e3a\u81ea\u4ee5\u4e3a\u662f\u8d76\u4e0a\u53cd\u5e94\u6240\u505a\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\n  \u5728\u53cd\u5e94\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\u4e4b\u540e\u53d1\u751f\u4e86\u4ec0\u4e48\u4e71\u4e03\u516b\u7cdf\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u793e\u533a\u4e2d\u5f00\u59cb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u56f4\u7ed5\u7740\u7092\u4f5c\uff0c\u65b0\u5947\uff0c\u521b\u9020\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u6bcf\u9694\u51e0\u4e2a\u6708\u90fd\u6709\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u5199React Web Apps\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u591a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898 -

The idea was to have a \u201cchange my mind\u201d kind of setup, where we represent a radical idea, invite people to debate with us, and show them that we\u2019re building some interesting stuff at   Productive .\n   Jokes aside, React is a fine library. It\u2019s important in web development because it introduced declarative and reactive templates, a paradigm shift that everyone needed at the time. There was a problem with rendering engines and reactivity back then (6 or 7 years ago) and React solved it pretty well.\n As a side note, Ember solved the same problem earlier. It wasn\u2019t as performant, though, and the framework was too opinionated to catch up with the way React had done it.\n  What happened after React gained popularity was a mess. It started a new trend in the community where everything revolves around hype, novelty, and creating new paradigm shifts. Every few months there were new libraries emerging, setting new standards of how we should write React web apps, yet solving problems that were, for the most part \u2014 already solved.\n Let\u2019s take \u201cstate management\u201d as an example. Since React is missing a traditional dependency injection system (DI is achieved through component composition), the community had to solve this problem on its own. And it did. Over and over and again. Each new year brought a new set of standards.\n  React is just a rendering engine, and in a typical web app, you need many libraries to build a framework for a project \u2014 e.g. data layers, state management, routing, asset bundlers, and more.\n The ecosystem behind React gave you too many choices of this sort, which fragmented the tech stack and caused the infamous \u201cJavascript fatigue\u201d.\n One of the trends that also emerged was \u201cframework comparison obsession\u201d. JS frameworks were constantly compared with properties like rendering speed and memory footprint. This is irrelevant most of the time because a slow app is not caused by a slow JS framework, it\u2019s caused by bad code.\n  As with every trend that is taking over the world \u2014 this one went too far, damaging new generations of web developers. I\u2019m wondering how it\u2019s possible for a library to be the most relevant skill on an average web developer\u2019s CV? Even worse, it\u2019s not even a library but a module inside that library. React hooks are more often mentioned as a \u201cskill\u201d as opposed to some actual skills like code refactoring or code review.\n    \u2026 not by mentioning the most starred library on Github, but by showing me one or two of your finest snippets.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning a popular state management library (preferably ending with \u201cX\u201d), but by telling me why \u201cdata should go down and actions should go up\u201d. Or why state should be modified where it was created and not deeper in the component hierarchy.\n  \u2026 not by telling me that you know Jest or QUnit, but by explaining why it\u2019s hard to automate end-to-end tests and why minimal meaningful rendering tests are 10% the effort and 90% the benefit.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning that you use CI/CD (as every other project today that has more than one person working on it), but by explaining that deployment and release should be separate so you should code new stuff in a way that doesn\u2019t mess with the old stuff and can be turned on remotely.\n  \u2026 not by mentioning that you\u2019re a \u201cteam player\u201d, but by telling me that code review is just as hard on the reviewer\u2019s side and that you know how to optimize your PRs for readability and clarity.\n  \u2026 because unless you\u2019re a one-man band, you\u2019ll hate your life if you don\u2019t follow strict standards and conventions in a project. You should tell me that naming is hard and the broader the scope of the variable, the more time you should invest in coming up with a good name for it.\n  \u2026 because code review ensures product quality, reduces bugs and technical debt, builds common team knowledge, and more \u2014 but only if done thoroughly. Code review shouldn\u2019t only be done top-down. It\u2019s a great learning mechanism for less experienced team members.\n  \u2026 because it\u2019s not about the GitHub stars, it\u2019s about common principles that most of today\u2019s JS frameworks share. Finding out about the pros and cons of other frameworks makes you understand your framework of choice better.\n  \u2026 because technology is only a tool for making products, not the process. Spending time on optimizing the process is always better than spending time on arguing about technology.\n    \u2026 because pair-programming is, like code review, the most important practice for knowledge sharing and building team cohesion. It\u2019s also fun!\n  \u2026 because every project has technical debt and you should stop whining about it and start refactoring. Every new feature should be preceded by a minor code refactoring. Big refactoring or rewrites never turn out well.\n  So yeah, that\u2019s why I think React ruined web development. People at the conference were intrigued by the claim and joined the debate eagerly. I had a great conversation with few experienced React developers. Nobody agrees with the title of this article, saying \u201cruined\u201d is too strong of a word.

So how it will operate in practice remains to be seen. So far the FCO is still in the process of determining (in each case) whether it can apply the law against GAFA.\n For the Apple proceeding, Mundt said in a statement today that its operation of the App Store will be a \u201cmain focus\u201d for the investigation because he said it \u201cenables Apple in many ways to influence the business activities of third parties\u201d.\n \u201cWe will now examine whether with its proprietary operating system iOS, Apple has created a digital ecosystem around its iPhone that extends across several markets,\u201d he added. \u201cApple produces tablets, computers and wearables and provides a host of device-related services. In addition to manufacturing various hardware products, the tech company also offers the App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV+ as well as other services as part of its services business. Besides assessing the company\u2019s position in these areas, we will, among other aspects, examine its extensive integration across several market levels, the magnitude of its technological and financial resources and its access to data.\u201d\n The  FCO also noted that it has received a number of complaints against Apple \u201crelating to potentially anti-competitive practices\u201d \u2014 such as one from the advertising and media industry against Apple restricting user tracking with the introduction of its iOS 14.5 operating system; and a complaint against the exclusive pre-installation of the company\u2019s own applications as a possible type of self-preferencing prohibited under Section 19a GWB.\n \u201cApp developers also criticise the mandatory use of Apple\u2019s own in-app purchase system (IAP) and the 30% commission rate associated with this,\u201d it added in a press release. \u201cIn this context, the marketing restrictions for app developers in Apple\u2019s App Store are also addressed. The latter complaint has much in common with the  European Commission\u2019s ongoing proceeding against Apple for imposing restrictions on the streaming service Spotify and accordingly preferencing its own services. Where necessary, the Bundeskartellamt will establish contact with the European Commission and other competition authorities in this regard. So far, no decision on initiating a further proceeding has been taken.\u201d\n Apple was contacted for comment on the FCO\u2019s proceeding and it sent us this statement, attributed to a spokesperson:\n \u201c Apple is proud to be an engine for innovation and job creation, with more than 250,000 jobs supported by the iOS app economy in Germany. The App Store\u2019s economic growth and activity have given German developers of all sizes the same opportunity to share their passion and creativity with users around the world while creating a secure and trusted place for customers to download the apps they love with the privacy protections they expect. Germany is also home to  Apple\u2019s largest engineering hub in Europe, and a new \u20ac1BN investment in our European Silicon Design Center in Munich. We look forward to discussing our approach with the FCO and having an open dialogue about any of their concerns.\u201d\n Once issued by the FCO, a \u2018paramount significance\u2019 finding lasts for five years \u2014 while any legal challenges to orders made under Section 19a are intentionally expedited, with appeals going direct to Germany\u2019s Federal Court of Justice (which is given exclusive competence). The goal being to avoid long drawn out litigations, as has occurred in the FCO\u2019s case against Facebook\u2019s superprofiling \u2014 which had legal questions referred to the CJEU  back in March, some five years after the  Bundeskartellamt began looking into Facebook\u2019s data practices.\n The coming months and years could be highly significant to how GAFA is able to operate in Europe\u2019s largest economy \u2014 and, likely by extension, further afield in Europe and beyond as a number of jurisdictions are now paying active attention to how to regulate Big Tech.\n Back in March, for example, the UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority opened its own probe into Apple\u2019s App Store. Simultaneously it\u2019s working on reforming national law to  create a \u2018pro-competition\u2019 for regulating tech giants.\n While, last December, European Union lawmakers proposed the  Digital Markets Act \u2014 also aiming to tackle the power market of so-called \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 platforms.\n The  FTC appointing Lina Khan as chair also appears to signify a change of direction on tech antitrust over in the US.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 19:02:55", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "apple,app,power", "title": "Apple\u7684App Store\u5728\u5fb7\u56fd\u9762\u5bf9\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aFCO\u6253\u5f00\u4e86\u201c\u5e02\u573a\u529b\u91cf\u201d ", "title_en": "\n\t\t\t\tApple\u2019s App Store to face scrutiny in Germany as FCO opens \u2018market power\u2019 proceeding\t\t\t", "transed": 1, "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/apples-app-store-to-face-scrutiny-in-germany-as-fco-opens-market-power-proceeding/", "via": "", "real_tags": ["apple", "app", "power"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "535439efbba9a390a62243579d9c2c8a.jpg", "infoid": 1067180, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8fde\u63a5\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7684WiFi\u70ed\u70b9\uff0c\u65b0\u7684iPhone Bug\u6765\u5230\u60a8\u7684iPhone\u548c\uff0339;

Neither rebooting nor changing SSID fixes it :~),&#34;  tweeted Schou.\n Schou told BleepingComputer that his experiment worked successfully on an iPhone XS, running iOS version\u00a014.4.2.\n Tests conducted by BleepingComputer on\u00a0an iPhone running iOS\u00a014.6 confirm an iPhone&#39;s wireless functionality would break after connecting to the strangely named wireless network.\n  In multiple tests attempting to connect to this strange SSID, our Wi-Fi settings would begin to function erratically, but all led to the same behavior - the breaking of our iPhone&#39;s wireless connectivity.\n In some tests, connecting to the SSID would fail, but we could no longer access\u00a0our regular\u00a0wireless network.\n Other tests led to the behavior described by\u00a0Schou, where the iPhones Wi-Fi setting would be disabled, and we could no longer enable it again, as shown below.\n  The only way to fix our iPhone&#39;s broken Wi-Fi feature was to reset the device&#39;s iPhone network settings, which we describe how to do at the end of the article.\n A bug like this is serious, considering\u00a0malicious actors could plant rogue WiFi hotspots (needing no password) in popular areas to bork\u00a0iPhone devices that connect to them.\n According to users, the issue is unique to iPhones and does not appear to be reproducible on Android devices:\n So I haven&#39;t done any homework on this bug / wouldn&#39;t even really know where to look but i&#39;m guessing this is just an ios bug?? Old ass android had no issue connecting to and saving it both open and with wpa2.  pic.twitter.com/ydegK7AR7x\n\u2014 MobCat (@MobCat99)  June 19, 2021\n  Other security researchers who saw Schou&#39;s tweet and analyzed the  crash report\u00a0believe that an input parsing issue likely causes this bug.\n When a string with &#34;%&#34; signs exists in WiFi hotspot names,\u00a0iOS may be mistakenly interpreting the letters following &#34;%&#34;\u00a0as\u00a0string-format specifiers when they are not.\n In C and C-style languages,  string format specifiers\u00a0have a special meaning and are\u00a0processed by the language compiler as a variable name or\u00a0a command rather than just text.\n For example, the following  printf\u00a0command does not actually print the &#34;%n&#34; character\u00a0but stores the number of characters (10) preceding %n into the variable &#34;c.&#34;\n The &#34;%n&#34; is merely a format specifier and not an actual text string. As such, the output of the following line will simply be\u00a0&#34;geeks for geeks,&#34; with no mention of &#34;%n.&#34;\n   Some users have  claimed previously inserting\u00a0the  relatively innocuous &#34;%x&#34; format specifiers in their WiFi SSID\u00a0to avoid causing major issues for unsuspecting WiFi users.\n When asked what was his motivation to name his WiFi hotspot with the funky string specifiers, the reverse engineer said:\n &#34;All my devices are named after format strings to f*** with poorly developed devices,&#34; Schou told BleepingComputer.\n  Although restarting your iPhone won&#39;t fix the issue, this bug is not permanent and can be fixed without resetting your entire device.\n Instead, you can follow these simple steps to reset your iOS network settings to resolve the issue:\n You will now be at the Reset screen, where you can reset various features of iOS or the device itself.\u00a0  \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAt this screen, select the &#39;Reset Network Settings&#39; option and confirm you would like to continue when asked.\n The device will now restart and reset all of your network settings back to factory default. Once it has restarted, enter your passcode, and you can reconfigure your Wi-Fi settings again.\n \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bBleepingComputer has reached out to Apple for comment before publishing, and we are awaiting their response.\n Update 20th Jun 11:13 AM: Linked to a researcher&#39;s analysis of the crash report\u00a0associated with this bug,\u00a0published after we first

", "note_en": "In the 1980s and 1990s a common piece of advice for people working in the professional managerial class was to \u2018dress for the job you want, not for the job you have.\u2019 Throughout these decades, folks dressed aspirationally\u2014a culture of power suits and padded shoulders. All this status-jockeying came at a high cost. Tailoring, dry cleaning, and the attendant rituals of maintaining everything to and from the office. Shoeshines, pressing services, taxi fees, and a general restriction of mobility.\n At the apotheosis of aspirational PMC office culture, Silicon Valley utopianism intervened. From the late 90s, a sort of casual revolution asserted itself. Billionaire tech CEOs wore cheap, comfortable and functional clothing, and the status hierarchy was undermined.\n Aspirational office attire persisted in conservative corners of the working world, as vestigial as barristers\u2019 wigs, but the mass-cultural sense was that we would heretofore be judged not by our clothing, but by our productive output.\n    2020 was the year of the great disruption. In a matter of days offices were abandoned, and work from home was entrenched.\n It took roughly a month before it started to happen. Senior execs across the tech industry, whether through a longstanding fascination with camera technology, or through access to AV support and personal assistants, emerged from the electronic ether with impeccable home studio setups.\n  Bill Gates faces off against a Bloomberg anchor in a traditional studio environment. The anchor\u2019s setup is acceptable but by no means impeccable. Her self-presentation is overawed by Gates\u2019 setup.\n  What\u2019s pernicious about this new organization: whereas the status of a double-breasted banker suit is transparently obvious, the technical arrangement that conspires to give an amazing streaming setup is altogether inscrutable to lay people.\n  1) Good lighting that can be precisely calibrated, both in brightness and in colour temperature\n     6) The technical expertise to understand how colour temperature, shutter speed, aperture, and ISO conspire together to form a beautiful picture.\n This line of reflection raises an adjacent question: how does fashion transition from the In Real Life domain to the virtual domain?\n  Fashion is equal parts Baudelaire\u2019s notion of the ephemeral, and a preoccupation of constructing identity and appearance in the domain of the social.\n When fashionistas enter the virtual social field of the screen, but waste all their efforts on their combination of garments within the space, my mind jumps immediately to the skeuomorphic designs of the early iPhone.\n    I want to see Gucci deliver a home studio build for their elite clients, that fully and completely \u2018guccifies\u2019 their space. Again, this is not reducible to the physical objects ordered in the visual field. It extends to the optics, to the lighting, maybe even the film grain of their digital feed, evoking 8mm film cameras, or anamorphic cinematograph.\n An elevated home studio will convincingly communicate that the subject is basking in a Kyoto bamboo forest. Lush projected backgrounds, ambient natural thrumming, organic shadow-cast.\n Put another way, fashion is mediated self-presentation. The domain of all possible self-presentations is infinite, and fashion exists in this arbitrary space, now playful, now historical, now futuristic, now mournful. Those who use their full field of expression to evoke these moods in a field of infinite possibility will be the determining forces of fashion.\n Of course a day will soon come when augmented and virtual realities will fully absorb these reflections, but that is not yet our world.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 18:55:05", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News",

Bloomberg and Elon Musk paid relatively little \u2014 and sometimes nothing \u2014 in federal income taxes between 2014 and 2018, according to an analysis from the news organization ProPublica that was based on a trove of IRS tax data.\n The analysis showed that the nation\u2019s richest executives paid just a fraction of their wealth in taxes \u2014 $13.6 billion in federal income taxes on $401 billion of their wealth, which was tabulated by Forbes.\n The documents reveal the stark inequity in the U.S. tax system, as plutocrats such as Bezos, Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and Musk were able to benefit from a complex web of loopholes in the tax code and the fact that the United States puts its emphasis on taxing labor income versus wealth. Much of the wealth that the rich accrue \u2014 like shares in companies they run, vacation homes, yachts and other investments \u2014 is not considered \u201ctaxable income\u201d unless those assets are sold and a gain is realized. Even then, there are loopholes in the tax code that can limit or erase all tax liability.\n The rare window into the tactics of the nation\u2019s top billionaires comes as  President Joe Biden is trying to overhaul the tax code so that corporations and the rich pay more. Biden has proposed raising the top marginal income tax rate to 39.6% from 37%, which would reverse the reduction ushered in by President Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts.\n But the documents and the conclusions of the analysis could renew calls for Biden to consider a wealth tax, given that a higher marginal tax rate would do little to raise the tax bills of the 25 richest Americans. From 2014 to 2018, the 25 wealthiest Americans paid an average of 15.8%, or $13.6 billion, in personal federal income taxes.\n Lawmakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have championed the idea of placing a 2% tax on an individual\u2019s net worth above $50 million \u2014 including the value of stocks, houses, boats and anything else a person owns, after subtracting any debts.\n Warren said on Twitter that the ProPublica report showed \u201cour tax system is rigged for billionaires who don\u2019t make their fortunes through income, like working families do.\u201d\n Biden and his advisers have deemed the idea of a wealth tax unworkable. Instead, he has sought $80 billion to beef up the IRS so it is better able to go after tax cheats. And he has proposed doubling the tax on capital gains \u2014 the proceeds of selling an asset like a stock or a boat \u2014 for people earning more than $1 million.\n   At a New York Times DealBook event in February, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that a wealth tax is \u201csomething that has very difficult implementation problems.\u201d She suggested that other changes that would increase taxes on wealth that is transferred at death could have a similar effect. In March, however, Yellen suggested that she remained open-minded about a wealth tax.\n \u201cWell, that\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t decided yet,\u201d Yellen said on ABC News, before pointing to other tax ideas that would also impact the rich.\n ProPublica did not reveal how it obtained the information, and it could not be independently verified by The New York Times. But the publication said the documents were provided to the outlet \u201cin raw form, with no conditions or conclusions\u201d and that it had run the information past every executive whose information was included in the article.\n \u201cEvery person whose tax information is described in this story was asked to comment,\u201d ProPublica said, adding that those who responded \u201call said they had paid the taxes they owed.\u201d\n In a separate editors\u2019 note, the outlet said it was publishing the information \u201cquite selectively and carefully \u2014 because we believe it serves the public interest in fundamental ways, allowing readers to see patterns that were until now hidden.\u201d\n The report highlights the techniques that the wealthy often use to reduce their tax bills, including taking advantage of a complex web of loopholes and deductions that are perfectly legal and can significantly minimize tax liability. That includes borrowing huge sums of money backed by enormous stock holdings. Loans are not taxed and the interest that the executives pay on the borrowed money can be deducted from their tax bills.\n In 2007, Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, paid nothing in federal income taxes even as his company\u2019s stock price doubled. Four years later, as his wealth swelled to $18 billion, Bezos reported losses and received a tax credit of $4,000 for his children, according to ProPublica.\n  Buffett, the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, who has long said publicly that the tax code should hit the rich harder, paid just $23.7 million in taxes from 2014 to 2018, when his wealth rose by $24.3 billion.\n In 2018, Bloomberg, who controls the media giant Bloomberg LP, reported income of $1.9 billion and paid $70.7 million in income tax. According to the report, Bloomberg was able to reduce his tax bill through deductions, charitable donations and \u201ccredits for having paid foreign taxes.\u201d\n In a statement to ProPublica, a spokesman for Bloomberg said they would \u201cuse all legal means at our disposal to determine which individual or government entity leaked these and ensure that they are held responsible.\u201d\n  The Treasury Department said that the federal government is working to determine how the tax records got released.\n \u201cThe unauthorized disclosure of confidential government information is illegal,\u201d said Lily Adams, a Treasury spokeswoman. \u201cThe matter is being referred to the Office of the Inspector General, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, all of whom have independent authority to investigate.\u201d\n  At a Senate Finance Committee hearing where he was testifying Tuesday, Charles Rettig, the IRS commissioner, said that he could not comment on the apparent breach at his agency but said that it was being scrutinized.\n \u201cI can confirm that there is an investigation with respect to the allegations that the source of the information in that article came from the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d Rettig said. \u201cThe investigators will investigate.\u201d\n  Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the chairman of the finance committee, told Rettig that he was concerned about the security of taxpayer data. He also emphasized that the disclosures made clear that the tax code needs to be rewritten.\n \u201cWhat this data reveals is that the country\u2019s wealthiest, who profited immensely during the pandemic, have not been paying their fair share,\u201d Wyden said, adding that he has proposals to fix that disparity.\n After the hearing, Wyden declined to offer specifics about his plan to address the issue, but emphasized his concern about unfairness in the tax code.\n \u201cThe people I represent are doing work, like treating COVID patients, they\u2019re paying taxes with every paycheck,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThe country\u2019s wealthiest, including during the pandemic, profited handsomely and then do not pay their fair share because they have figured out with good lawyers and accountants how to defer and delay and postpone and almost do it in perpetuity.\u201d\n Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the committee, said that the disclosures added to his concern about a Biden administration proposal to give the IRS more access to the financial information of taxpayers. He suggested that the agency could not be trusted to keep the data secure.\n The president said on Twitter on Tuesday that he was continuing to work with Republicans on infrastructure and jobs legislation and said that he would not seek a tax increase on anyone who earns less than $400,000.\n  \u201cIt\u2019s long past time the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share,\u201d Biden said.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 18:49:49", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u7f8e\u56fd,paid,\u7a0e\u6536", "title": "\u6700\u5bcc\u6709\u7684\u7f8e\u56fd\u9ad8\u7ba1\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u6240\u5f97\u7a0e\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5173\u6ce8 ", "title_en": "Wealthiest U.S. executives paid little to nothing in federal income taxes", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/us/2021/06/08/wealthiest-us-executives-paid-little-to-nothing-in-federal-income-taxes-report-says.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u7f8e\u56fd", "paid", "\u7a0e\u6536"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "f2552f957d62b30861903738d49ec3c0.jpg", "infoid": 1067176, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "Warning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\nWarning: Can only detect less than 5000 characters\n\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u521a\u521a\u4e5d\u5341\u5c81\uff0c\u751f\u6d3b\u5728\u6211\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6d3b\u8bbe\u65bd\u3002\u4ed6\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e00\u822c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u5c16\u9510\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u548c\u90a3\u91cc\u7684\u7a7a\u9699\u3002\u4ed6\u4e0e\u6211\u548c\u6211\u4e00\u8d77\u5206\u4eab\u4e86\u5947\u602a\u7684\u804c\u4e1a\u8f76\u4e8b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u5b66\u9662\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b14\u8bb0\uff1a\u4ed6\u7ad9\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u5c3c\u5c14\u65afBohr\u7684\u7535\u68af\u91cc\uff0c\u6bcf\u5f53\u4ed6\u6253\u5f00\u5634\u5df4\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u70df\u6597\u5c31\u4f1a\u5411\u5730\u677f\u4e0a\u6389\u5230\u5730\u677f\u4e0a;\u4ed6\u5728\u666e\u6797\u65af\u987f\u53c2\u52a0\u7684\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0coppenheimer\u4e32\u8d77\u4e86\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u6f14\u8bb2\u8005;\u5f53\u5929\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u666e\u6797\u65af\u987f\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u6240\u7684\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\u7b7e\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u672c\u4e66\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u552f\u4e00\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u624d\u80fd\u56de\u5bb6\u662fAlbert Einstein\uff0cJohn Von Neumann\u548cArnold Toynbee\u3002 \u201c\u6211\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u7559\u90a3\u5f20\u56fe\u4e66\u9986\uff01\u201d\u4ed6\u8bf4\u3002\n \u6545\u4e8b\u81ea\u7531\u6d41\u52a8\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7b11\u58f0\u6563\u53d1\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u6211\u7684\u7236\u4eb2\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u540e\u89c6\u955c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u90fd\u662f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5207\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u4fe9\u90fd\u5b89\u9759\u4e86\u3002\u8c08\u8bdd\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u626d\u8f6c\u5230\u5b9a\u7406\u3002\u5b9a\u7406\u5177\u6709\u76ee\u653f\u6027\u7684\u6f14\u5458;\u4e00\u4e2a\u60f3\u6cd5\u9075\u5faa\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e09\u6708\u671d\u7740\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002\u751f\u6d3b\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\u3002\u6211\u7236\u4eb2\u5728\u804c\u4e1a\u751f\u6daf\u548c\u4ed6\u4ece\u672a\u80fd\u9884\u671f\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u60ca\u53f9\u3002\u5b9a\u7406\u662f\u5c06\u4ed6\u4ece\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65e5\u5b50\u4e2d\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u6760\u6746\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4ed6\u7528\u8bfa\u8d1d\u5c14\u00b7\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u63c9\u6413\u80a9\u8180\u3002\u6211\u559c\u6b22\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5c0f\u5b9d\u77f3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4ed6\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u751f\u547d\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u4e00\u6837\u6709\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u5b66\u662f\u5728\u4ed6\u751f\u547d\u4e2d\u8ba2\u8d2d\u7684\u95e8\u6237\u3002\n \u201c\u5230\u6240\u6709\u8ba2\u5355\uff01\u201d\u6211\u7238\u7238\u8fd8\u8bf4\u3002 \u201c\u5176\u4ed6\u4eba\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6761\u6b3e - \u751a\u81f3\u9ed8\u91ccgell-mann\uff01 - \u4f46\u6211\u505a\u5230\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u8ba2\u5355\uff01\u201d\u4ed6\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\u3002\u4ed6\u505a\u5230\u4e86\u3002\u4ed6\u9996\u5148\u505a\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4ed6\u540d\u5b57\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u3002\n    \u6ce8\u518c\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u65f6\u4e8b\u901a\u8baf\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7ebd\u7ea6\u4eba\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6545\u4e8b\u3002 ", "note_en": "The Rockmore theorem made its first\u2014and perhaps only\u2014named appearance in print in 1977, in the journal  Physics Letters, Volume 72B, No. 4. A photocopy of the journal page hung on my father\u2019s office door, at Rutgers University, in New Jersey. The author of the article\u2014one B. L. Birbrair, of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.\u2014wrote that, in 1959, my dad had demonstrated that the \u201cinteraction between quasiparticles exactly compensates\u201d for \u201cthe difference between the effective and real mass\u201d of an \u201cinfinite non-superfluid fermi system.\u201d Since then, he went on, \u201cthe statement  J(\u0394 = 0) =  J rig\u201d has been known as \u201cthe Rockmore theorem.\u201d\n My dad had underlined those last three words in bold, black pen. Other professors on the same hallway displayed conference posters on their doors, in which they were featured as keynote speakers in exotic locales. My dad couldn\u2019t produce such a poster, but the photocopy, which hung amid  New Yorker cartoons, preprints, and departmental announcements, showed something arguably more valuable.\n Theorems are mathematical facts justified by proofs\u2014logical, airtight arguments made of other facts and deductions. Usually, a proof consists of statements taking the form \u201cif this, then that\u201d; this chain of \u201cifs\u201d is grounded in bedrock mathematical truths. In high-school geometry, you probably saw some simple proofs\u2014two-column accounting ledgers, with statements on one side and justifications on the other. Many proofs by professional mathematicians are baroque in comparison; they contain twists, turns, and surprise appearances, with intermediate steps, known as propositions, claims, or \u201clemmas,\u201d that require proofs of their own. A theorem is only published if it\u2019s been deemed interesting by journal editors and successfully \u201crefereed\u201d by external evaluators. Mathematicians prove thousands each year, but of the many published theorems only a few are named.\n The eponymous theorems are the most famous, but are they rightly named? There\u2019s Pythagoras\u2019 well-known beauty, a fact about the three sides of a right triangle: the sum of the squared lengths of its two shorter sides equals the squared length of its hypotenuse ( a 2 +  b 2 =  c 2). A proof for the Pythagorean Theorem can be found among Euclid\u2019s \u201cElements,\u201d the thirteen-volume treatise on geometry that many see as an exemplar of Greek mathematics. The Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero connected the theorem to Pythagoras some five centuries after his death, though the attribution is hardly a slam dunk. Part of the beauty of Pythagoras\u2019 theorem is that it admits revelation through a broad range of proofs. So far, there have been more than a hundred. Even Albert Einstein  set one down. It seems likely that some other early geometer could have been the first.\n You may have also heard of Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. It\u2019s a fact about other kinds of numerical \u201ctriples\u201d: it says that, if you make a small change to the Pythagorean equation, and replace the exponents with larger whole numbers, then there are no solutions where  a,  b, and  c are all whole numbers. \u201cIt is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, a fourth power into two fourth powers,\u201d the mathematician Pierre de Fermat explained, around 1635. Fermat, a jurist by day and a mathematician during his off-hours\u2014the mathematician and writer E. T. Bell called him the \u201cPrince of the Amateurs\u201d\u2014put down his theorem in the margin of a book, and added that he had \u201cdiscovered a truly marvellous demonstration\u201d of it, \u201cwhich this margin is too narrow to contain.\u201d He never explained himself elsewhere. It was arguably the most famous mathematical cliffhanger of all time.\n Fermat was a genius, and for years we mathematicians gave him the benefit of the doubt. But his theorem\u2019s proximity to the readily proved Pythagorean theorem, and the mathematicians\u2019 credo of \u201ctruth means proof,\u201d meant that its lack of resolution couldn\u2019t be ignored. Over the centuries, the failed proofs accumulated, and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem became the mathematician\u2019s version of \u201cwill they or won\u2019t they?\u201d The techniques developed to attempt its proof grew in scope and ingenuity, becoming a body of thought far beyond anything Fermat could have imagined.\n  Finally, in the mid-nineteen-eighties, progress on various aspects of algebraic geometry suggested a way forward to the mathematician Andrew Wiles. He devoted roughly seven years to proving Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. When he was pretty sure that he had a proof, he brought in a few close mathematician friends for some sanity checks, and rumors began to spread that he would soon make a historic announcement. During a lecture on June 23, 1993, before a standing-room-only audience, Wiles proved Fermat. Or did he? Whereas some proofs of the Pythagorean theorem can be understood by those with little or even no mathematical background, the adjudication of Wiles\u2019s proof required the convening of a group of absolute experts\u2014a Supreme Court of mathematics. A painstaking refereeing process revealed some holes in the proof, and Wiles went back to the blackboard, this time with the help of a friend and colleague, Richard Taylor. Together, they plugged the holes, making Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem into a real theorem. Three and a half centuries had passed. In a sense, the theorem was no longer Fermat\u2019s.\n Even the Rockmore theorem is subtly misnamed. My father\u2019s original family name was Rochmovich, or Rochemovitz, or one of any number of variations on that theme\u2014it depended on who was writing the name on a form, beginning with the clerk who processed my great-grandfather through Ellis Island, in 1881, when the name was Rochomovyitz, or possibly Rochomowitz. According to my father, my great-grandfather came from Ukraine. He might have been fleeing conscription or the frequent pogroms for which the region became well known. In 1908, the name became Rockmore\u2014at some point, I was told that it was chosen for its \u201cstrong American sound.\u201d The page that records the change in the records of the New York State Legislature is littered with a host of similar transformations, marking the first stages of American assimilation for many Jewish families.\n  Origins, whether of family names or ancient Greek theorems, can be tricky to uncover. Although the many variations on Rochomovich share a derivation from the Yiddish word for compassion (\u201c rachmones\u201d), Rockmore is culturally hard to place. (My father has never forgotten the department chair who told him, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you were Jewish when we hired you.\u201d) Rockmore is an uncommon name, and family lore has it, semi-ironically, that all Rockmores are related. I know for a fact that I\u2019m related to the painter Gladys Rockmore Davis and her painter son, Noel Rockmore, famous for his portraits of the Preservation Hall jazz greats; there are more distant connections to the theremin virtuoso Clara Rockmore, and to a war hero or two. Once, checking into a hotel, I shared a laugh with the African-American woman behind the desk, also a Rockmore, as we tried to find a common ancestor in one of my family\u2019s thoroughly assimilated Christian branches. But, in truth, I don\u2019t know much of my family tree; my father\u2019s father was one of at least twelve children, but there was a big family rift long ago, and my father\u2019s side has always seemed to begin and end with his parents and brother, now all gone.\n  My father\u2019s father was always moving from job to job, either flush or deep in the hole. For a while, the family lived in Oceanside, on the South Shore of Long Island, where my dad, a bookish kid, could nurture his interests in birds and stars. In 1925, ten thousand members of the Ku Klux Klan had rallied in Oceanside; in 1940, partly because of anti-Semitism, the family moved back to Brooklyn, where my grandmother worked as a bookkeeper in her brother\u2019s mirror-making business. My father spent two years at the yeshiva next door and two years in high school, and then won the New York City Latin competition. His \u201cplan,\u201d according to the caption of his high-school yearbook, was to go to Columbia University. He applied, and my grandmother told him that she had learned, from an admissions officer, that his application had been among those diverted owing to \u201cregional quotas\u201d\u2014systems used by Ivy League institutions to limit the number of Jewish students. He never did see the rejection letter; it may have just been the money.\n He attended Brooklyn College, majoring in mathematics and commuting by subway while living at home. After graduation, he was accepted to Columbia\u2019s doctoral program in physics. He started graduate school a little after the Second World War, during a golden age of research built on the momentum of the Manhattan Project. A steady succession of discoveries in quantum mechanics seemed to be moving relentlessly toward a grand unified theory; experimental physics was diving ever deeper into the atom to reveal a wild jungle of subatomic particles, whose interactions required models of ever-greater precision and sophistication. A small stipend as a teaching assistant supported him, and from time to time allowed him to send some money downtown to his parents and brother. (Their finances and support would always be a concern.) He took classes with the Nobel laureate I. I. Rabi, and his thesis adviser was Robert Serber, Oppenheimer\u2019s right-hand man on the Manhattan Project. From Ukraine to Columbia, an unlikely career as a scientist was emerging.\n The work that would become the Rockmore theorem was contained in a paper that my dad published a few years after he graduated. The theorem settles a conjecture about a version of a \u201cmany-body problem\u201d\u2014a scenario in which many things orbit one another in an intricate, hard-to-predict dance. In this case, the bodies are subatomic particles called fermions. It had been conjectured that, under certain conditions, when you accounted for all of the particles\u2019 mutual pushes and pulls, the total inertia of the system\u2014that is, its over-all tendency to continue to whirl about\u2014would add up to zero. \u201cVanishing to all orders,\u201d is how we say it. My father was able to reveal a previously unseen symmetry which manifested itself in a perfect accounting of contributions and withdrawals from the system\u2019s inertial bookkeeping. It\u2019s a dense piece of work, somewhere in the middle of the range of complexity bookended by the Pythagorean theorem on one side and Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem on the other; its six pages are mainly equations, with a little bit of interpolative and explanatory text.\n  For me, the symbols are mathematical madeleines. They remind me of the pads of paper that were scattered around our house, each full of my father\u2019s scribblings\u2014his version of the sandpiper tracks that had delighted him as a child. When I was a child myself, I would watch him on the couch, deep in thought, scratching away with a mechanical pencil. At some point, I thought that I might like to have a life like that.\n My dad loved his result, and the Rockmore theorem turned out to be a ticket to a tenured university position. He had job security in a profession he liked and could support his own small family and help his parents and brother, but he never felt that he received the notice he deserved. He didn\u2019t understand why he wasn\u2019t on those posters. I only learned this later. From my perspective, he\u2014and we\u2014had it all. He could spend all day trying to figure out how the world worked, writing beautiful equations; summers were generally spent travelling to conferences and visiting collaborators in wonderful places. But when my father retired, at seventy, that was the end of physics for him. I was shocked. How could he have devoted more than five decades to trying to understand the workings of the subatomic world and then quit cold turkey? But enough was enough. There was music to listen to, and an interest in painting and drawing to indulge. Clara, Gladys, and Noel were calling.\n Today, he is just past ninety, and lives in an assisted-living facility near me. His memory of the past is generally still sharp, with gaps here and there. He shares with me the odd career anecdote as we compare notes from the academy: the time he stood in an elevator with Niels Bohr, whose pipe dropped to the floor every time he opened his mouth to speak; the seminar he attended at Princeton where Oppenheimer skewered the young speaker; the day he checked out a book on Egyptology from the library at the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, and discovered that the only other people to ever take it home had been Albert Einstein, John von Neumann, and Arnold Toynbee. \u201cI should have kept that library card!\u201d he said.\n The stories flow freely, hopscotching over time and space and speckled with laughter. But there are also moments of reflection, when my father is looking deeply into the rearview mirror, trying to make sense of how it\u2019s all come to this point. We both get quiet then. Conversation can often wind back to the theorem. A theorem has a teleological cast; one idea follows another, in a steady march toward a concise conclusion. A life isn\u2019t necessarily like that. My dad still marvels at a career and a life that he never could have anticipated. The theorem was the lever that catapulted him from those early and complicated days in Crown Heights to a middle-class life, in which he rubbed shoulders with Nobel laureates. I like to think that, in this perfect little gem of a result, he found some of the order in chaos that he was looking for on a human scale. His life was hardly as orderly as math, but math was a gateway to order in his life.\n \u201cTo all orders!\u201d my dad still says. \u201cOthers computed a few terms\u2014even Murray Gell-Mann!\u2014but I did it to all orders!\u201d He\u2019s right. He did. And he did it first, and there\u2019s a theorem with his name on it to prove it.\n    Sign up for our daily  newsletter to receive the best stories from  The New Yorker.", "posttime": "2021-06-21

of this article is to introduce you to the top 5 serverless AWS services which I think every tech-founder or Indie Hacker should know. This is not a deep dive on these services and I want to explain them in a high level fashion and tell you why they are worth using and learning. With these services you are able to build almost every web- and mobile application you can think of. Almost all high level programming languages such as Python, TypeScript, JavaScript and Java can be used with these services. So, let\u2019s jump straight in.\n   I   start with the obvious one, Amplify. Important to note is, that there are two (almost three) \u201cservices\u201d called Amplify within AWS. We have to distinguish between:\n  We talk about  Amplify CLI here. With the Amplify CLI you are able to bootstrap your backend with a few commands within the Command Line Interface. Amplify has several categories you can add, for example these are:\n  With a few commands you are able to build fullstack applications with a guided CLI.\n The  main benefit in my eyes is the  graphql-tranform library. This library enables you to create your data schema with custom annotations like  model or  connection and the library transforms this schema to a valid GraphQL schema and at the same time creates CloudFormation templates for creating your backend resources such as DynamoDB tables, Cognito connections, etc.\n   It creates the type Holding. The  model annotation creates a table in DynamoDB with id as the primary key.  currentPrice will be resolved by the lambda function  priceResolver.\n The  main drawback in my eyes is that you are not as flexible as with building up your infrastructure with a typical IaC solution like CDK or Terraform. Since a lot of magic is happening with Amplify you will likely run into some issues, especially when you are working with several team environments and lambda layers.\n Nevertheless, it is a great tool, it has a great community and the team is still developing the services further. The backend of  deposur was completely bootstrapped with Amplify. If you want to learn one service, learn this one!\n   This brings us to the next service, AppSync. AppSync is a fully managed GraphQL API by AWS. GraphQL enables you as a developer to get exactly the data you need without worrying about fetching too much or too less data overfetching &amp; underfetching). In general you have three main functions within AppSync. These are  Queries, Mutations and  Subscriptions.\n With  Queries you can query data from different data sources. That means that you can have a type  Holding for example which gets data from different sources. Lets take our example schema again:\n  The attribute  ISIN   is a string which comes from DynamoDB, the  currentPrice gets resolved by a Lambda function called  priceResolver. Lambda resolvers give you the main flexibility here. In the lambda function you can have as much customised code as you need (request two different APIs, clean &amp; preprocess data, \u2026) and respond with exactly this data you need in your application. It doesn\u2019t matter where your data lives, AppSync gives you the opportunity of resolving it under one hood for the application. This is a great deal of flexibility.\n     With  Mutations you can change your data and update it.  Subscriptions give you the ability to live update your data.\n  Why should you learn AppSync as a founder? First of all you get the main benefit of using GraphQL which is working with type safety and giving the frontend developer the power of requesting exactly the data it needs. Secondly, you have so much flexibility by connecting every data source you need. Third, you let AWS doing most of the work. You have one single endpoint and no hassle with parsing requests and connecting different AWS services together. It will reduce your development time immensely.\n   Now let\u2019s go back to the roots, Lambda. Lambda is the most common known serverless service. When people talk about serverless many people just refer to lambda. The basic idea behind the lambda service is to run your code without ever thinking about infrastructure. AWS\u2019s promise is just that your code will be executed. Lambda supports several runtimes such as Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, Rust, Go and many more. One of the latest features is that custom docker containers can be used as a runtime and that pricing happens every millisecond instead of every 100 ms. The maximum runtime of lambda is 15 minutes, take that into consideration when building your application. The only infrastructure setting is the memory setting.\n Pricing: Lambda is  cheap. The first million requests per month are free. From that point on it will be calculated based on the minutes the lambda runs.\n  Always increase memory to about 4 GB, the faster it runs the cheaper it is. There is a great  library to test this assumption\n Declare all your static variables such as DynamoDb from boto3 outside of your handler function -&gt; Decreases cold starts\n Keep cold starts in mind when designing your application. If you need certain response times pre-heat your lambda or  provision concurrency before.\n  Lambda gives you the ability of executing code without ever worrying about infrastructure. The pricing is really awesome. Your whole application can be based on Lambda. It depends on the use case and the overall architecture (go event-driven!) but most of the applications I know can be easily adopted to several lambda functions. You just pay on-demand, you have small development cycles and the deployment is way easier.\n   Let\u2019s look at Authentication. Cognito is AWS\u2019s service for authentication and authorisation. You can use it for Sign-Up and Sign-In purposes, fine granular user group control and even federated logins such as Facebook, Google &amp; Apple Login. If you start your SaaS business you really want to give users a seamless authentication experience and offer social logins. This is easily possible with Cognito. Cognito differentiates  User Pools &amp; Identity Pools.\n  Identity Pools: Identity pools are for creating unique identities for users and giving them access to other AWS services. This is needed for example for generating temporary credentials for anonymous users.\n   Why? Give your users the seamless authentication experience they deserve. With Cognito you are able to do that at any scale. You can customise your Sign-Up and Sign-In pages however you want or you can even use pre-built ones by AWS. With federated logins you are able to offer on-click logins.\n   The last service I want to introduce is DynamoDB. DynamoDB is a fully-managed NoSQL database which is highly scalable and highly available. I build almost every use case and project now with DynamoDB and I am a huge fan of it.\n  Streams: You can have streams for triggering something (e.g. a lambda function) on every update on a table\n DynamoDB is basically a key, value database where you can store different datatypes as a value. A value can also be a nested list or nested list of objects (like JSON). A DynamoDB Item looks like that:\n  The key is the column name (ISIN) and the value is the data type (S: String) with the actual value. The item can also be shown with a typical JSON syntax:\n   DynamoDB has some great features for increasing the performance even more such as Global Tables, DynamoDB Accelerator, Point-In-Time recovery and many more. When designing DynamoDB tables it is always important to keep you access patterns in mind. Rick is doing a wonderful job explaining DynamoDB strategies in this  video.\n Pricing: Pricing is based on reading, writing and storing data. Again, if you just start out your SaaS product the price is so low that it won\u2019t cost you a Dollar.

We have a  big curated roundup of the best deals we can find, but I wanted to give special mention to a couple of particularly notable deals on headphones we&#39;ve reviewed positively:  Sony\u2019s noise-canceling WH-1000XM4 for $248\u00a0and  Jabra\u2019s true wireless Elite 75t earbuds for $100. Both deals match the lowest prices we\u2019ve tracked from major retailers. If you\u2019d rather not give more money to Amazon, the\u00a0 Sony deal is available at other stores as well. In Sony\u2019s case, the WH-1000XM4 have an MSRP of $350 but have recently averaged  closer to $315 on Amazon. The Elite 75t, meanwhile, retail for $150 but have had a few  dips to $130 over the last few months.\n  We\u2019ve  recommended the WH-1000XM4 in a few buying guides since  they launched last August, and they remain our preferred pick among wireless noise-canceling headphones. They aren\u2019t the absolute best of their kind in a vacuum:  Apple\u2019s AirPods Max are bit better in audio quality, noise-canceling strength, and build quality. But that pair costs $549; for $300 less, the WH-1000XM4 come more than close enough.\n  The design here is well-padded and relatively light on the head, which should keep the headphones comfortable to wear for hours at a time. They can fold up for easier storage, and Sony packs them with a sturdy little carrying case. Battery life sits at a strong 30-35 hours, depending on how loud you play, and the whole thing charges over USB-C. While they use touch controls instead of more predictable physical buttons, we haven\u2019t found changing tracks or adjusting volume to be overly finicky in long-term testing. They also let you connect to a couple of devices simultaneously. The main selling point here is Sony\u2019s active noise cancellation tech, which is excellent at muting out low-frequency sounds like a bus or plane engine and does better than most at countering higher-pitched noises like nearby voices. Alongside this is an effective \u201ctransparency\u201d mode, which blends outside noise with your music when you want to be better aware of your surroundings. Sony\u2019s companion app includes a number of useful bonus features beyond that, such as a \u201cspeak to chat\u201d setting that can automatically pause your music and let in ambient sound when you start speaking to somebody else.\n     In terms of audio quality, the WH-1000XM4 go heavy on the bass by default. It\u2019s a full, punchy sound that many will appreciate with hip-hop and pop music, but those looking for a more neutral profile can still get it through Sony\u2019s app, which has a customizable EQ tool with several preset audio profiles that genuinely affect the sound. You can also listen passively through a cable. There\u2019s no  aptX support, but you  can listen through Sony\u2019s higher-quality  LDAC codec if you\u2019re the type that can hear a difference in quality there. The WH-1000XM4\u2019s main drawback is microphone quality, which is  fine but makes voices sound more muffled than other wireless pairs in this price range. Bose\u2019s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which are  on sale for $229 today, do better there. That pair also has the nifty ability to customize the strength of its noise-canceling effect. If you don\u2019t want to pay more than $200, meanwhile, we  also like Anker\u2019s Soundcore Life Q30 as a budget pick; those are  on sale for $60.\n  Still, for those interested in a set of premium wireless headphones, the WH-1000XM4 are an excellent value at this price. They probably aren\u2019t worth the upgrade if you own the  older Sony XM3s, but given that there was a two-year gap between the launches of those two pairs, we wouldn\u2019t expect another upgrade in this line until sometime next year.  It\u2019s a similar story with the Elite 75t: higher-end alternatives like the  Sony WF-1000XM4 and  Apple AirPods Pro\u00a0(which is  on sale for $190) do many things better, but,  as we&#39;ve written before, Jabra\u2019s pair has the right blend of price and feature set for most people.\n  The ear pieces here are small and light, with soft silicon tips that helps the earphones remain comfortable for extended listening. The in-ear design creates a snug seal that stays secure while on the move and isolates a fair amount of outside noise naturally. It\u2019s also IP55 rated, so it can survive a bit of sweat or light rain. The one-button controls on each ear piece are straightforward enough for adjusting playback and volume. They&#39;re also difficult to press by accident. The earphones will automatically pause once one is removed from your ear, and you can listen with just the right earphone as well. Battery life is solid at about seven hours per charge with active noise cancellation off and a little over five hours with it on. The easily pocketable charging case adds another 20 or hours and recharges over USB-C.\n    While all true wireless earbuds are more susceptible to connection hiccups than a larger over-ear pair, we\u2019ve had few issues along those lines in long-term testing. The earbuds support multi-device pairing as well\u2014though this can be finicky with certain laptops, so it\u2019s worth confirming that you\u2019ll have no issues within the device\u2019s return window if you do take the plunge.\n  Like the Sony WF-1000XM4, the Elite 75t have an excited sound out of the box. It puts heavy emphasis on the bass and upper-mids by default, which some might find overwhelming but others might enjoy with popular music. Again, though, those who want a more restrained sound profile can get one without much effort through Jabra\u2019s app, which has an EQ tool and several effective sound presets. Any preferences you select are then saved the earbuds themselves, so you don\u2019t have to dig into the app repeatedly. Jabra  added active noise cancellation to the Elite 75t through a firmware update months after the earphones launched, so the effect isn\u2019t quite as strong as it\u2019d be on a device built for ANC from the ground up. It&#39;s definitely not on the level of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or AirPods Pro. That said, it\u2019s far from useless; low-frequency tones are cut down enough that it should satisfy people who don\u2019t constantly need ANC active. Likewise, there\u2019s a transparency mode that works well, and the built-in mics present voices clearly enough on calls.\n  Unlike the WH-1000XM4, the Elite 75t  do have an upgrade already on the market. Jabra\u2019s Elite 85t launched late last year with native noise-canceling support, a slightly stronger IPX4 water resistance rating, a wireless charging case, a more neutral default sound profile, and a slightly clearer mic setup. That pair is\u00a0 on sale for $170 during Prime Day. We don\u2019t think the upgrade is significant enough to be worth that price difference, though; if anything, the Elite 75t is still a bit better in terms of comfort and battery life. The  recently released Beats Studio Buds might be more convenient for iPhone owners, though. And for those willing to pay more, the aforementioned WF-1000XM4 and AirPods Pro perform better on the whole.

Mike Lynch, who is  fighting extradition to the U.S. on fraud claims after selling his software start-up Autonomy to HP for over $11 billion, was also in attendance.  Palantir co-founder and CEO Alex Karp was due to attend but had to drop out after the U.K. pushed back the date for its full lockdown easing.\n &#34;Everyone I want to meet in Europe is here,&#34; reads a quote from Schmidt on the event&#39;s website. &#34;Founders Forum has emerged as the go-to destination for tech in Europe.&#34;\n The founders and CEOs of apps like Monzo, Wise (formerly TransferWise), Citymapper, and many more also turned up to network and listen to talks on everything from existential risks that threaten to wipe humanity off the face of the Earth to hiring top talent in artificial intelligence.\n Elsewhere, venture capitalists from firms with billions of dollars at their disposal \u2014 such as Sequoia, Index Ventures, Atomico and Balderton \u2014 were also present, as were some of the U.K.&#39;s most active angel investors.\n  For many, it was the first in-person tech event they&#39;ve been able to attend in over a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n Throughout the day, people kept saying how &#34;weird&#34; it was to be there as they fist-bumped and elbow-bumped one another. Everyone had to record themselves taking a Covid-19 test and getting a negative result in an app developed by Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus before they were allowed to attend.\n   Branded as &#34; something like the Davos of tech&#34; by The Guardian newspaper, Founders Forum is put on by serial entrepreneur and investor Brent Hoberman.\n The former Eton and Oxford student, who co-founded Lastminute.com and the recently listed Made.com, is well-known for having one of the most impressive networks in the European tech scene. Many of his friends and investors are invited to Founders Forum each year.\n The organizers describe it as a private network of the world&#39;s top-tier entrepreneurs, CEOs and investors from technology, media and digital.\n Previous guests have included Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, former Apple design boss Jony Ive, broadcaster David Attenborough, and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer. Prince William, a member of the British royal family, has also attended.\n Normally held at the five-star Grove Hotel, this year marks the first time Founders Forum has been held at Soho Farmhouse. Aston Martins, Maseratis, Range Rovers and Teslas could all be spotted in the car park on the day of the event.\n &#34;To have an event there is crazy money,&#34; a member of Soho House, which owns Soho Farmhouse, told CNBC, asking to remain anonymous due to the sensitive nature of the discussion.\n For some, one of the highlights of the day was witnessing British jet suit inventor Richard Browning flying around a few feet above the ground.\n  After being fed throughout the day, guests were treated to grilled lobster and strawberries and cream in the evening. On their way home, they were given goodie bags containing products from the likes of Cowshed and Charlotte Tilbury.\n Timothy Armoo, CEO of Fanbytes, a company that helps brands advertise through social video, told CNBC he enjoyed the event.\n  &#34;With this being the first major event that people have been to in a while, there is the danger that it becomes more of a &#39;catch up&#39; session for friends, but that wasn&#39;t the case at all. Meaningful connections were fostered, and that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for when you go to these events. I also really admired how they handled social-distancing rules. People were respectful, and the pre-process of taking tests was quite comforting.&#34;\n Correction: This report was updated to delete an incorrect reference that Facebook&#39;s Nicola Mendelsohn was in attendance.", "posttime": "2021-06-21 18:06:05", "source_domain": "slashdot.org", "source_name": "slashdot", "tags": "\u521b\u59cb\u4eba,forum", "title": "\u770b\u770b\u521b\u59cb\u4eba\u8bba\u575b\uff0c\u6b27\u6d32\u9876\u7ea7\u9996\u5e2d\u6267\u884c\u5b98\u548c\u6765\u81ea\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5a92\u4f53\u6295\u8d44\u8005\u7684\u201c\u79d1\u6280\u8fbe\u6c83\u65af\u8fbe\u6c83\u65af\u201d ", "title_en": "A look at Founders Forum, the annual UK event branded as the \u201cDavos of tech\u201d attended by Europe's top CEOs and investors from technology and media", "transed": 1, "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/founders-forum-the-uk-tech-event-attended-by-the-rich-and-famous.html", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u521b\u59cb\u4eba", "forum"]}]
