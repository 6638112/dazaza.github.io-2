A few months later we sat down with  The New York Times to pitch our idea — an app that would let you listen to audio versions of magazine articles — in a meeting we thought we had hit out of the park. (We had not.) We toiled on, launching Audm to the public in August 2016 and eventually moving to Menlo Park to become part of Y Combinator’s S17 batch. In August 2018, we hired our first full-time employee. By the end of the year, we were a team of 9. And then, exactly four years after our first meeting with  The Times, we signed a term sheet with them that resulted in the sale of our company. On March 9, 2020 the transaction was made official. Eight months later, Christian was gone.</p><p>以下是大致的时间安排：2015年4月22日，我们30年代初期的两位技术企业家Christian Brink和I合并了公司，该公司将成为Audm。几个月后，我们在《纽约时报》上坐下来阐述了我们的想法-一个可以让您听杂志文章的音频版本的应用程序-在一次会议上我们认为我们已经离开了公园。 （我们没有。）我们一直努力工作，于2016年8月向公众推出了Audm，并最终搬到Menlo Park成为Y Combinator S17批次的一部分。 2018年8月，我们聘请了第一位全职员工。到今年年底，我们的团队由9人组成。然后，在我们第一次与《纽约时报》会面四年之后，我们与他们签署了一份条件说明书，从而出售了我们的公司。 2020年3月9日，交易正式进行。八个月后，克里斯蒂安走了。</p><p> In sitting down to write this, I’m confronted with the question of how I would characterize my relationship with him. Were we friends? Sure. Brothers? In a way. I think “cofounder,” an admittedly stilted-sounding word, is maybe what captures it best.</p><p> 在坐下来写这篇文章时，我遇到了一个问题，我该如何形容我与他的关系。我们是朋友吗？当然。兄弟？在某种方式。我认为“共同创始人”这个词听起来固若金汤，也许是最能体现这一点的人。</p><p> The cofounder relationship begins as a bond of forced intimacy. For the good of the company, openness and honesty are paramount. There are no personal days when there’s only two of you. Tension in the dynamic isn’t something you can ignore, bury, or avoid. You will experience some of your lowest lows and highest highs with this person. The strain can be considerable. Sometimes the bond breaks. Sometimes it only survives the lifespan of the company. And sometimes, as was the case for us, you emerge from it all with a person you love as family.</p><p> 联合创始人的关系始于强迫亲密关系。为了公司的利益，开放和诚实至关重要。没有个人的日子，只有你们两个。动态中的张力不是您可以忽略，掩盖或避免的东西。与这个人一起，您将遇到一些最低和最高点。应变可能很大。有时这种联系会破裂。有时，它只能在公司的生命周期中生存。有时，就像我们一样，您会与一个家人一起深爱的人一起摆脱困境。</p><p> In these six short years, Christian and I lived what felt like a lifetime together. Based on opposite ends of the country, we communicated constantly. Initially, our conversations were focused on planning — fantasizing about a future for a product that seemed like a pipe dream. Then all we talked about were the cold, hard practicalities of execution. Then surviving. The grind wore me down more than once. Every day we faced the very real prospect of failure, along with everything that would have entailed — explanations owed to investors, public embarrassment, the need for an abrupt career overhaul. The stress was unstinting. But I always had Christian, who was three thousand miles away and yet also right there alongside me. When I teetered, he steadied us. When he had his doubts, I allayed them. Somehow, we always managed to level out.</p><p> 在这短短的六年中，我和克里斯蒂安一起过了一辈子的生活。基于国家的相反立场，我们不断进行交流。最初，我们的讨论重点是计划-幻想着看似梦pipe以求的产品的未来。然后，我们谈论的只是执行过程的冷酷，艰苦的实践。然后生存。磨不止一次使我失望。每天，我们都面临着失败的真实可能性，以及随之而来的一切-欠投资者的解释，公众的尴尬以及对职业进行突然改革的需要。压力是持续的。但是我总是有克里斯蒂安，他在三千英里之外，但也和我在一起。当我颤抖时，他稳定了我们。当他有疑问时，我消除了它们。不知何故，我们总是设法保持稳定。</p><p> Ironically, death was a kind of specter that always hung over our heads. We gave life to Audm, and the anxiety that, some day, we would have to put it to rest was implied in every conversation we had about how to grow it. There was an inexorable logic to this: if the company wasn’t growing, it was already dying. The margin for error was that thin; the clock never stopped ticking. What a strange thing to confront now: Audm survives, but he does not.</p><p> 具有讽刺意味的是，死亡是一种总在我们头上笼罩的幽灵。我们为奥德姆献出了生命，而在关于如何种植它的每一次谈话中，都隐含着某天我们不得不休息的焦虑。这有一个不可阻挡的逻辑：如果公司没有成长，那就已经濒临死亡。错误的余地很小。时钟从未停止滴答作响。现在要面对的是一件奇怪的事情：Audm幸存下来，但他没有幸免。</p><p> A cofounder relationship can be a competitive one. The question of who is more “formidable” comes up a lot. Who will be the point of contact with investors? Who will represent the company to the outside world? Who will have the final say at an impasse? Navigating these questions can easily lay waste to your ego. The only reason he and I avoided this pitfall was because we addressed our insecurities to each other directly, rather than let them simmer beneath the surface. I soon came to learn that one of the most valuable opportunities of an experience like this was that your cofounder’s strengths could become your own.</p><p> 联合创始人关系可以是竞争关系。谁最适合“模范”的问题很多。谁将是与投资者的联系点？谁将代表公司代表外界？谁将在僵局中拥有最终决定权？浏览这些问题很容易浪费您的自我。他和我避免这种陷阱的唯一原因是因为我们直接解决了彼此的不安全感，而不是让他们them在表面之下。我很快得知，这种经历中最有价值的机会之一就是您的联合创始人的优势可以变成您自己的优势。</p><p> Christian and I went to the same college and graduated in the same year, but we never crossed paths. I met him about five years later, thanks to an introduction made by my future brother-in-law. We talked about working together for years until one day, Christian and his wife strolled into the lobby of a hotel, in New York, where my wife and I were visiting her family. It was this chance encounter that set Audm in motion. Finally, Christian and I were in the same place, at the same time, with a shared purpose. We sat down and began fleshing out an idea that, until then, had been amorphous and aspirational.</p><p> 克里斯蒂安和我上同一所大学并于同年毕业，但我们从未走过一条路。大约五年后，我认识了他，这要归功于我未来的姐夫的介绍。我们谈论了多年的合作，直到有一天，克里斯蒂安和他的妻子走进了纽约一家旅馆的大厅，我和妻子正在那里探望她的家人。正是这次偶然的相遇使奥德姆动起来了。最终，克里斯蒂安和我在同一时间，同一个地方，有着共同的目标。我们坐下来，开始充实一个想法，直到那时，这个想法是无定论的和有抱负的。</p><p> Christian had a deep, resonant voice, and he had the odd habit of snapping his fingers while he worked through a problem. He was tall, too, and his stature emphasized his philosophical, analytical spirit. He seemed, literally, to bear down on his work, to wrestle lofty questions to the ground. He built our iOS app from scratch, writing every single line of code until we made our first technical hire years later. He also helped develop our partnerships with other media outlets, refine our audio production process, and expand our user base. There was nothing he couldn’t do.</p><p>克里斯蒂安发出深沉而共鸣的声音，他习惯于解决问题时习惯抽动手指。他也很高，而且身材突出了他的哲学和分析精神。从字面上看，他似乎在坚持自己的工作，将崇高的问题摔倒在地。他从头开始构建我们的iOS应用程序，编写每一行代码，直到几年后我们进行首次技术聘用为止。他还帮助我们建立了与其他媒体渠道的合作伙伴关系，完善了我们的音频制作流程，并扩大了我们的用户群。他无能为力。</p><p> In late August 2017 we entered our final week at Y Combinator. Demo Day, the much-publicized biannual event during which we would present Audm to a prominent group of investors, was only a few days away. We were feeling confident, even cocky. Cultivating new relationships and networking was an arena where both of us shone, especially together. Which was why we entered a final practice pitch with one of the YC partners feeling little trepidation. What followed, though, could only be described as a complete thrashing. The number of questions he asked which we returned with blank stares was gutting. Looking back on it now it’s almost funny to recall how stunned we were at the time. In the moment, though, it was like the wind had been knocked out of us. I was silently despondent as we staggered to the parking lot afterwards.</p><p> 2017年8月下旬，我们进入了Y Combinator的最后一周。距演示日不远，这是每两年举行一次的活动，我们将向知名投资者介绍Audm，每两年一次。我们感到自信，甚至骄傲自大。培养新的关系和建立人际关系是我们俩共同发光的舞台，尤其是在一起。这就是为什么我们与一位YC合作伙伴一起进入最后练习场的原因，他对此感到不寒而栗。但是，只能将其描述为彻底的失败。他问的问题数量有限，我们以空白凝视返回。现在回首过去，回想起我们当时的震惊是非常有趣的。然而，在那一刻，好像风被我们吹走了。后来我们错步到停车场，我默默地沮丧。</p><p> But Christian was unfazed. When we got in the car, he asked me to open up my laptop. “Why?” I wondered aloud. He said we were just going to start writing things down. Anything. Everything. So I did, skeptically at first. And then suddenly, a jolt of energy sparked, and we had what were perhaps our most focused, productive days together. In our meeting, we couldn’t muster good answers about who our customers were, why certain people decided not to subscribe, and where in our signup process users appeared to be dropping off. So we started there, working methodically to piece together what had stumped us. We came to know every aspect of our user acquisition funnel intimately, and we implemented changes that doubled our conversion rates overnight. In seventy-two hours, we had a plan that, under other circumstances, might not have materialized for several months. My first impulse had been to brood; his was to roll up his sleeves. His strength became mine.</p><p> 但是克里斯蒂安丝毫不为所动。当我们上车时，他要我打开笔记本电脑。 “为什么？”我大声地想知道。他说我们只是要开始写下来。没事一切。因此，我一开始对此表示怀疑。然后突然间，能量激起，我们在一起也许是我们最专注，最富有成效的日子。在我们的会议中，我们无法就客户是谁，为什么某些人决定不订阅以及在我们的注册过程中用户似乎流失的位置提出了很好的答案。因此，我们从这里开始，有条不紊地努力，将困扰我们的东西拼凑在一起。我们非常了解用户获取渠道的方方面面，并且我们实施了一些更改，使转化率在一夜之间翻了一番。在72小时内，我们制定了一个计划，在其他情况下，该计划可能要几个月后才能实现。我的第一个冲动是沉迷。他要卷起袖子。他的力量成了我的。</p><p> In the few short days since he died, the fact of his absence jabs at me constantly. Writing these memories down is one immediate example. Christian would have been the first person I’d have asked to read through them. He was a brilliant writer, a natural; what it takes me 400 words to say, he could in 200, or less. I was never offended when he rewrote something I had asked him to proofread, because his version was always better. He thought about language deeply — it was one reason why he loved the world of longform journalism — and his emphasis on it endures as part of our company’s culture to this day. A single email to one of the publications we work with might get workshopped by the entire team — written, rewritten, reviewed again, relentlessly honed. We are more successful because of it.</p><p> 自他去世以来的短短几天里，他缺席的事实不断对我刺耳。写下这些记忆是一个直接的例子。克里斯蒂安本来是我要求阅读的第一个人。他是一位才华横溢的作家，自然而然。我要花400句话才能说，他可以写200个单词，甚至更少。当他改写我要求他校对的东西时，我从未感到冒犯，因为他的版本总是更好。他深深地思考了语言-这是他热爱长篇新闻世界的原因之一-直到今天，他对语言的重视一直是我们公司文化的一部分。给我们合作的出版物之一的一封电子邮件可能会在整个团队中得到处理-编写，重写，再次审阅，不懈地磨练。因此，我们更加成功。</p><p> And so now I know something that I wish I didn’t. When your cofounder is no longer here, what have you lost? It’s an even harsher reality than I would have guessed. He was the only one who could understand exactly what it was like day in and day out. The hardships, the wins, the losses. Now, these memories are mine alone. I sometimes think about the stories we might have reminisced about down the line, looking back over our work together. Most likely, we wouldn’t have talked about the obvious watershed moments like signing with  The New Yorker or  The Atlantic, making it into YC, or closing a round of financing. Instead, it would have been the idiosyncratic stuff, the small details — the kind of memories that you’d likely overlook without mutual prodding. So many of the things that I’ve probably already forgotten he would have reminded me of.</p><p> 所以现在我知道了一些我不希望的事情。当您的联合创始人不再在这里时，您失去了什么？这是比我想像的还要严酷的现实。他是唯一能够日复一日地确切了解情况的人。艰辛，胜利，失败。现在，这些记忆只属于我。有时我会想起我们可能会回忆起的故事，一起回顾我们的工作。最有可能的是，我们不会谈论明显的分水岭，例如与《纽约客》或《大西洋》签约，加入YC或完成一轮融资。相反，它本来就是特质，细小的细节，就是您可能会在没有相互刺激的情况下忽略的那种回忆。我可能已经忘记他的很多事情会让我想起。</p><p> I knew Christian during a short but defining period in both of our lives. We brought Audm into the world, but we also celebrated milestones together, such as welcoming our first children. Christian was fiercely intelligent. He was also unflinchingly devoted to what he cared most about in his life — his faith, his family, his marriage. He and I shared experiences of pure joy together. Yet none of it compares to the way his face lit up when his wife would bring their daughter into his office. It was palpable even over a video call between Los Angeles and Brooklyn. As his cofounder, trying to make sense of this unfathomable loss, I choose to remember Christian as he was in these moments, nowhere near the company we built together, when he was at his happiest. When he was at his very best.</p><p> 在我们短暂的但确定的时期里，我认识了基督徒。我们将Audm带入了世界，但我们也共同庆祝了里程碑，例如欢迎我们的第一个孩子。克里斯蒂安非常聪明。他还坚定不移地致力于自己一生中最关心的事情-他的信仰，他的家人，他的婚姻。我和他一起分享了纯粹的快乐经历。然而，这与他的妻子将女儿带到办公室时他脸上的光彩照人相比。甚至在洛杉矶和布鲁克林之间的视频通话中也很明显。作为他的联合创始人，我试图回想起克里斯汀·克里斯蒂安（Christian）在他那时最幸福的那一刻，尽管他离我们最近，但我们离他在一起的公司不远，我选择回忆起他那令人难以置信的损失。当他处于最佳状态时。</p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://ouegner.medium.com/on-the-loss-of-a-cofounder-73e1e8347b00">https://ouegner.medium.com/on-the-loss-of-a-cofounder-73e1e8347b00</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/创始人/">#创始人</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/loss/">#loss</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
