(Amber and Vinson have asked us to use their first names only.) She gave up a college scholarship and moved to Atlanta to be with him; he dropped out of college when she became pregnant. For more than a decade, he made sandwiches at Subway while she gave birth to two more kids and drifted through call center jobs. They were in love, but like most millennials they had little financial stability.</p><p> 这对夫妻于2006年在高中时在一家关于嘻哈的雅虎聊天室相识。 （安伯和文森要求我们只使用名字。）她放弃了大学奖学金，搬到亚特兰大和他在一起。她怀孕了，他辍学了。十多年来，他在Subway做三明治，而她又生了两个孩子，然后在呼叫中心工作。他们恋爱了，但像大多数千禧一代一样，他们的财务状况也很不稳定。</p><p> Then, in 2018, Amber landed a job at Public Storage. The gig involved overseeing auctions for the stuff left behind in unpaid storage units. Speculators could, if lucky, quadruple their money by flipping the contents. It got her thinking. As an employee, she wasn’t allowed to participate in the auctions, but since she and Vinson weren’t married, he was free to bid.</p><p> 然后，在2018年，Amber在Public Storage找到了一份工作。演出涉及监督拍卖未付费存储单元中遗留的物品。如果幸运的话，投机者可以通过翻转内容来使他们的钱翻两番。她想了。作为一名员工，她不允许参加拍卖，但是由于她和Vinson没有结婚，因此他可以自由竞标。</p><p>  The trick, the couple soon discovered, was to find the right buyer for each object you’d scored if you won an auction. Not everyone may see the value in film production lights or a particular brand of streetwear, but if you did some digging online, you might find someone who would pay a lot more than a pawn shop would. Amber and Vinson felt they’d found something they were good at. They talked about saving for a house—that is, until the  pandemic hit, their car broke down, the auctions got canceled, and schools went virtual, meaning all three of their sons were home, 24/7.</p><p>  这对夫妇很快发现了诀窍，那就是如果您赢得了拍卖，则为找到的每个物品找到合适的买家。并非每个人都可以在电影摄制灯或特定品牌的街头服装中看到价值，但是如果您在网上进行一些挖掘，您可能会发现某个人会付出比典当行高得多的价格。安伯（Amber）和文森（Vinson）觉得他们找到了自己擅长的东西。他们谈到要存钱，也就是说，直到大流行到来，他们的汽车抛锚了，拍卖被取消，学校变成虚拟了，这意味着他们的三个儿子全天候24/7回家。</p><p> Two months into lockdown, Vinson was combing through stuff he’d bought in previous auctions and hadn’t sold yet. He found an old Blackberry and fired it up. There, he saw photos of an engagement ring, then a funeral, and then, was that a naked woman? He looked closer. Yes, it was a naked woman; it was a  famous naked woman, strutting around, and giving a blow job to a famous naked man, in a series of short video clips.</p><p> 禁售两个月后，文森正在梳理他在以前的拍卖会上购买的，尚未售出的东西。他找到了一个旧的黑莓，并把它烧了。在那儿，他看到了订婚戒指，葬礼的照片，然后是一个裸体女人？他靠近了。是的，那是一个裸体女人；那是一个著名的裸体女人，在短短的视频剪辑中，到处走来走去，给著名的裸体男人一个吹牛。</p><p>  He showed the videos to Amber, and she wondered if they might be worth something. But where would they find the right buyer?</p><p>  他向Amber展示了这些视频，她想知道它们是否值得。但是他们会在哪里找到合适的买家？</p><p>  Amber thought for a moment. The biggest celebrity sex tape she could remember was Paris Hilton’s. Hadn’t that home video turbocharged the socialite’s career and made millions of dollars? Who was behind that, anyway? A few Googles later, she had her answer: a man named Kevin Blatt, who called himself a “celebrity sex tape broker.” She squinted at the avatar on his Instagram profile. He looked like a villain in an action flick, staring into the camera over the top of his black Ray-Bans.</p><p>  琥珀想了一会儿。她记得的最大的名人性爱录像带是帕丽斯·希尔顿（Paris Hilton）。那个家庭视频难道不是在加速这位名媛的职业并赚了数百万美元吗？到底是谁在后面？几个Google之后，她得到了答案：一个叫凯文·布拉特（Kevin Blatt）的男人，他自称为“名人性爱录像带经纪人”。她着眼睛看着他的Instagram个人资料上的头像。他看起来像个反派中的反派人物，凝视着镜头对准了他黑色雷朋的顶部。 </p><p>  “Hey Kevin I have a sex tape involving some celebrities who are no longer together but want some advice on making the most money.”</p><p>“嘿，凯文，我有一段性爱录像带，其中涉及一些不再在一起的名人，但他们希望获得一些有关赚钱最多的建议。”</p><p> As the couple went to sleep that night, Amber assumed they were wasting their time. A big shot like Kevin Blatt was never going to write back. Maybe that Instagram account wasn’t actually his. She noticed it didn’t even have a blue checkmark.</p><p> 当那对夫妇那天晚上睡觉时，Amber认为他们是在浪费时间。像凯文·布拉特（Kevin Blatt）这样的大人物永远不会回信。也许Instagram帐户实际上不是他的。她注意到它甚至没有蓝色的勾号。</p><p> That same afternoon, a reply appeared: “Can u send me a number to call you?”</p><p> 当天下午，出现了一个答复：“你能给我打个电话给你吗？”</p><p> A movie star’s agent will never take a call from a stranger, but Kevin Blatt reads every message and follows up on every tip. You never know who might have the goods. Over the past two decades, Blatt has become a one-man clearinghouse for everything seedy in Hollywood—the fixer you call when you want to see whether the thing you have that could humiliate a famous person is worth anything.</p><p> 电影明星的经纪人永远不会接听陌生人的电话，但凯文·布拉特（Kevin Blatt）会阅读每条消息并跟进每条提示。您永远不知道谁可能拥有这些商品。在过去的二十年中，布拉特已成为好莱坞所有繁琐事的单人票据交换所，当您想知道自己拥有的能羞辱一位名人的东西是否值得时，就可以称之为固定者。</p><p>  “If they have something really bad, enough to jeopardize a sponsorship or a new TV show, we try to turn it into money,” Blatt tells me. “Everybody gets paid if they come to me and we do it the right way.”</p><p>  “如果他们真的有不好的事情，足以损害赞助或新的电视节目，我们会尝试将其变成金钱，”布拉特告诉我。 “如果每个人都来找我，我们都会得到报酬，我们会以正确的方式来做。”</p><p>  Most of this content is never released; scandal is generally worth the most to a star trying to protect their reputation, so Blatt’s primary hustle is to offer it back to the person it might embarrass—in exchange for cash and silence. It’s often a video, but he has also facilitated arrangements for text-message screenshots, pill bottles, photographs, and even just access to a newsworthy person telling their story. He figures most of what people bring him, around 60 percent, is evidence of infidelity; 10 percent is about drug use; 10 percent exposes some closeted sexual behavior, a fetish, or a queer identity unknown to the public; and 20 percent is what Amber and Vinson had: images of prominent people naked or having sex.</p><p>  这些内容大部分都不会发布。通常，丑闻对于试图保护自己声誉的明星来说是最有价值的，因此布拉特的主要目的是将其提供给可能会让您尴尬的人，以换取金钱和沉默。它通常是一个视频，但他还帮助安排了文本屏幕截图，药丸瓶，照片，甚至只是让有新闻价值的人讲述他们的故事。他认为人们带给他的大部分东西（约60％）是不忠的证据； 10％是关于毒品的使用； 10％的人暴露了一些公众不为人知的封闭性行为，恋物癖或奇怪的身分；而Amber和Vinson所拥有的占20％：裸露或做爱的知名人物的图像。</p><p> Blatt is, in some ways, the Forrest Gump of 21st-century scandal, popping up over and over on the sidelines of new cultural lows and milestones in outrage.</p><p> 在某些方面，布拉特是21世纪丑闻中的阿甘正传，在新的文化低谷和愤怒中的里程碑之外不断出现。 </p><p> Dirt in hand, Blatt serves as a bridge between the lawyers, the tabloids, the celebrities, and the people with something to sell—pocketing a percentage or a consulting fee from as many of those parties as possible. Each deal is unique, and he is often surprised by how a situation plays out, but his goal is to capitalize on clickability, leveraging either the story or a star’s dread about its potential for virality to make as much money as he can.</p><p>布拉特手握污垢，在律师，小报，名人和有待出售产品的人们之间架起了一座桥梁-尽可能多地从这些当事方那里收取一定百分比或咨询费。每笔交易都是独一无二的，他常常会对情况如何感到惊讶，但他的目标是利用可点击性，利用故事或明星对其病毒式传播潜力的恐惧来尽可能赚钱。</p><p> Over the years, he’s helped suppress proof of a married rapper getting head at a club; a former boy-bander’s penchant for drugs and sex dungeons; an entertainer’s alphabetized collection of hardcore BDSM porn; and two professional athletes playing video games, staring at the screen, while one woman goes back and forth performing oral sex on both. Guitarist Dave Navarro once told  New York magazine that he was grateful to Blatt for helping him keep a bondage tape off the internet.</p><p> 多年来，他帮助压制了已婚说唱歌手进入俱乐部的证据；曾经是男孩绑带者的毒品和性爱地牢的嗜好者；艺人按字母顺序排列的性BDSM色情收藏；两名专业运动员正在玩电子游戏，盯着屏幕，而一名妇女则在两者上来回进行口交。吉他手戴夫·纳瓦罗（Dave Navarro）曾对纽约杂志表示，他感谢布拉特（Blatt）帮助他将束缚带与互联网隔离。</p><p> Blatt&#39;s sense of what will horrify and titillate the masses has allowed him to survive successive trends in technology and media, while both the stars and the moral standards we accuse them of violating have changed. He got his start in the scammy, spammy days of the ’90s, when pornography dominated the web, until the explosion of the Paris Hilton tape taught him how to manipulate a star’s pain for his gain. He is, in some ways, the Forrest Gump of 21st-century scandal, popping up over and over on the sidelines of new cultural lows and milestones in outrage. When reality TV was ascendant, he tricked Dr. Phil into letting him on air by claiming he was bankrolling a show where male virgins would compete to be the first to have sex. In the heydey of celebrity gossip sites, Blatt helped Tila Tequila’s ex leak a pornographic video to Radar Online. The early social media star promptly sued him. (The case was settled several months later.) In the wake of revelations about Harvey Weinstein, when many women were coming forward with #MeToo stories, Blatt represented a woman who said she’d felt pressured to give a mogul a blow job after a photo shoot.</p><p> 布拉特（Blatt）对将要惊吓和煽动群众的东西的意识使他得以幸免于技术和媒体的接连发展趋势，而我们指责他们违反的明星和道德标准都已改变。在色情风靡网络的90年代，他开始了一个肮脏的，垃圾邮件的日子，直到Paris Hilton录音带的爆炸教他如何操纵星星的痛苦来谋取收益。在某些方面，他是21世纪丑闻中的阿甘正传，在新的文化低谷和愤怒里程碑中不断出现。当真人秀电视风起云涌时，他以声称自己在资助一个电视节目中让男博士争夺第一个做爱的机会，欺骗了菲尔博士让他播出。在名人八卦网站的杂乱无章中，布拉特（Blatt）帮助蒂拉·拉奎拉（Tila Tequila）的前色情视频泄露给了Radar Online。这位早期的社交媒体明星迅速起诉了他。 （案件在几个月后解决了。）在有关哈维·温斯坦（Harvey Weinstein）的消息曝光之后，当许多女性向#MeToo故事挺身而出时，布拉特（Blatt）代表了一名女性，她说，在经历了一次大屠杀之后，她感到有压力要给大人物打口哨。照片拍摄。</p><p> When he isn’t screening clients or strategizing with lawyers, Blatt swans around Los Angeles in his white BMW, getting stoned, playing golf, and befriending bellhops who might one day prove useful. He dresses like a mafioso, or a cheesy dad: tracksuits, polo shirts, flat caps. Journalist Kurt Loder once described him as “flamboyantly unsavory.” He loves diners and hip hop and saying just the right thing to a celebrity when he spots one in public—even a minor one—to show he recognizes them, he appreciates them, and he remembers they were wearing that exact jacket on  Jimmy Kimmel last night, because it looked great then and it looks great now. He’s slick and ingratiating to everybody. It works. People like him. He’s friends with Oakland rapper Too $hort; they did  a podcast together.</p><p> 当布拉特（Blatt）不在与客户进行筛选或与律师进行战略合作时，他会乘坐白色宝马在洛杉矶四处游荡，getting之以鼻，打高尔夫球，与侍者交友，这也许有一天会有用。他穿得像黑手党士兵或俗气的爸爸：运动服，polo衫，平顶帽。记者库尔特·洛德（Kurt Loder）曾经将他描述为“极度不愉快”。他喜欢食客和嘻哈，当他在公共场合发现一个名人（甚至是未成年人）时，就对名人说了对的话，以表明他认识到他们，对他们表示赞赏，并且他记得他们最后一次在Jimmy Kimmel身上穿的正是这件夹克晚上，因为那时看起来很棒，现在看起来很好。他很滑，很恭喜大家。有用。人们喜欢他。他是奥克兰说唱歌手Too $ hort的朋友；他们一起做了一个播客。</p><p>  Some of Blatt’s clients are just strangers looking for money, but many come from a star’s entourage or past. In 2017 it was a friend of Kevin Hart’s who came to Blatt with some videoclips of the comedian  cheating on his wife. “This night he had over 10 women in his room,” Hart’s friend wrote in an email describing the tapes. “Of course his friends were there as well, but all 10 women wanted Kevin Hart.”</p><p>  Blatt的某些客户只是寻求金钱的陌生人，但许多来自明星的随行人员或过去。 2017年，是凯文·哈特（Kevin Hart）的一个朋友，他带着一些喜剧演员欺骗其妻子的录像带来到布拉特。哈特的朋友在一封描述磁带的电子邮件中写道：“今天晚上他的房间里有10多名妇女。” “当然，他的朋友们也在那里，但所有10位女性都想要凯文·哈特。”</p><p> When the economy slumps, as it did during the Great Recession or as it has now during the pandemic, Blatt attracts more business. People look for valuables to sell off. Blatt’s first step is to vet the content. Footage of famous people fornicating is a legally complex commodity, to say the least, and Blatt has to navigate several potential hazards to avoid liability. He once felt compelled to flee to Mexico to evade possible charges of child pornography, after someone told him a video he’d acquired, allegedly of  Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester, had been shot when she was a minor. (Eventually he figured out that the release date of a DVD in the background of the video proved the woman who appeared to be Meester was over 18.)</p><p> 当经济衰退时，如大萧条时期或大流行时期的情况一样，布拉特吸引了更多的生意。人们正在寻找可以出售的贵重物品。 Blatt的第一步是审核内容。至少可以说，有名无实的人倒影是一种法律上复杂的商品，而布拉特必须驾驭几种潜在的危险以避免责任。在有人告诉他自己录制的一段录像（据称是绯闻女孩的明星莱顿·梅斯特（Leighton Meester））在未成年时被枪杀之后，他曾经感到被迫逃到墨西哥逃避对儿童色情制品的指控。 （最终，他发现视频背景中的DVD发行日期证明了这位看上去是Meester的女人已经18岁了。）</p><p>  Last May he video-chatted with Amber, and she showed him what was on the Blackberry. Blatt thought the situation seemed promising. For starters, they had gotten the phone legally; if it had been stolen, or even found at a bar, the videos wouldn’t be worth as much. They might even bring charges of theft, especially if someone had filed a police report. It also helped that both celebrities in the Blackberry videos were visibly aware they were being recorded. If they had been shot with a hidden camera, use of the videos would violate their right to privacy—unless it was recorded in a public place.</p><p>  去年5月，他与Amber进行了视频聊天，她向他展示了黑莓手机上的内容。布拉特认为情况似乎很有希望。对于初学者来说，他们是合法获得电话的。如果这些视频被盗了，甚至在酒吧里发现，这些视频也就不值钱了。他们甚至可能提出盗窃罪，特别是如果有人提交了警方报告。这也有助于黑莓视频中的两个名人都清楚地知道他们正在被录制。如果使用隐藏的摄像机拍摄这些视频，则使用这些视频将侵犯他们的隐私权，除非在公共场所进行了录制。 </p><p>  Then Amber mentioned via DM that she’d been in contact with the famous man in the video, whose abandoned storage unit Vinson had acquired at auction—and she’d offered to sell the guy some of his stuff back.</p><p>然后，琥珀通过DM提到她在视频中一直与这位名男子保持联系，该名男子的遗弃存储单元Vinson在拍卖会上获得了，她提出要卖掉他的一些东西。</p><p> “We told him 20,000,” she wrote. “He said we were crazy.”</p><p> 她写道：“我们告诉他2万，”。 “他说我们疯了。”</p><p> Blatt balked. If he or a client names a price for a compromising video or image before the celeb does, asking for a specific amount in exchange for concealing the evidence, that’s extortion—a felony in both Georgia and California.</p><p> 布拉特退缩了。如果他或客户在名人面前说出有损视频或图像的价格，要求提供特定金额以换取隐瞒证据，那便是勒索–在乔治亚州和加利福尼亚州都是重罪。</p><p> “Ah. So he already knows u have his stuff,” Blatt replied. “Does he know u have the sexy tape?”</p><p> “啊。所以他已经知道你有自己的东西，”布拉特回答。 “他知道你有性感的录音带吗？”</p><p>  “OK, good,” Blatt wrote. “Let’s not talk to anyone.”</p><p>  “好的，好。”布拉特写道。 “我们不要和任何人说话。”</p><p> This is the moment in a case when Blatt aims to resolve things without his own attorney. So he heads for the celeb’s rep. This can get dicey, but it can also mean he gets a bigger cut. He once flew to meet a billionaire&#39;s lawyer and his head of security, he says, to talk about some photographs of the tycoon with two sex workers. The lawyer took out a yellow legal pad, wrote “$50,000 cash now, $2,000 a month for ten years,” and passed it across his desk. Blatt thought of the potential tax liability and wrote the name of a company he controls underneath the offer, asking if the money could be sent directly there.</p><p> 这是Blatt打算在没有自己的律师的情况下解决问题的时候。因此，他前往名人代表。这可能会引起麻烦，但也可能意味着他得到了更大的晋级。他说，他曾经飞过会见一位亿万富翁的律师和他的安全负责人，与两名性工作者谈论这名大亨的一些照片。律师拿出一张黄色的便笺簿，写下了“现在$ 50,000现金，十年每月每月$ 2,000”，然后划过办公桌。布拉特想到了潜在的税收责任，并在要约下写下了他所控制的公司的名称，询问这笔钱是否可以直接寄到那里。</p><p>   Next, Blatt was asked to remove all his clothes, so the head of security could ensure he wasn’t wearing a wire. Blatt then gave half the initial lump sum to the two sex workers and took the other half for himself. He flew back to Los Angeles that night with $25,000 in cash hidden in his shoes and his luggage. If he had brought in a lawyer to represent him on this deal, he might have gotten 10 percent or less of the eventual $290,000, instead of half.</p><p>   接下来，布拉特被要求脱掉他的所有衣服，以便安全负责人可以确保他没有穿电线。布拉特然后将最初的一次性款项的一半给了两名性工作者，而另一半则由他本人承担。那天晚上，他带着鞋子和行李中藏着的25,000美元现金回到了洛杉矶。如果他聘请了一名律师来代表他进行这笔交易，那么他可能会得到最终290,000美元中的10％或更少，而不是一半。 </p><p>  For Amber and Vinson’s videos, Blatt looked up the famous man’s manager on IMDBPro, gave him a call, and said something like, “I’m assuming your client might not want this out there.” The manager was appalled. He said he wasn’t interested.</p><p>对于Amber和Vinson的视频，Blatt在IMDBPro上查找了这位名人经理，打了个电话给他，然后说：“我想你的客户可能不想在那儿了。”经理感到震惊。他说他不感兴趣。</p><p> Next, Blatt sent several messages to the woman’s representatives. He thought he could get Amber and Vinson money for agreeing to destroy the Blackberry. But he wouldn’t advise them to upload the videos anywhere or charge for access.</p><p> 接下来，布拉特向这名女性代表发送了几封邮件。他以为他可以同意破坏黑莓而得到琥珀和文森的钱。但是他不建议他们将视频上传到任何地方或收取访问费用。</p><p> Contrary to what many people believe about celebrity sex tapes, it is not legal in most states, California included, to distribute pornographic content without the subjects’ consent. You need to have signatures on two key pieces of paperwork: a copyright release, generally from whoever held the camera, and a release from each person onscreen, affirming they are over 18.</p><p> 与许多人对名人色情录像带的看法相反，在包括加利福尼亚州在内的大多数州中，未经受试者同意而散布色情内容是不合法的。您需要在两个关键文件上签名：通常由持有相机的人提供的版权发布，以及每个人在屏幕上的发布，以确认他们已超过18岁。</p><p> At least that’s if you want to stay within the lines of the law. But, of course, the internet is an anarchic bazaar, filled with unmonitored corners. Even as the web has grown increasingly corporate over the past 25 years, there’s always a frontier— Silk Road to  subreddits to  Parler—where illicit nudes can spread. Blatt knows this. The stars know this. Call it the backdoor release threat.</p><p> 至少如果您想遵守法律规定。但是，当然，互联网是一个无政府的集市，到处都是不受监视的角落。即使在过去25年中网络公司的发展日渐重要，但始终存在着一个前沿-丝绸之路，通往帕勒（Parler）的隐秘之路，非法的裸体可能会在此蔓延。布拉特知道这一点。星星知道这一点。称其为后门释放威胁。</p><p> The front-door release threat would be to share a video with a media outlet, which then, as protected under the First Amendment, could report on its existence and describe what it depicts. There is a lot of content—say, a racist remark or evidence of an affair—that a celebrity wouldn’t want to see mentioned in the press, let alone circulating on 8chan.</p><p> 前门发布的威胁将是与媒体分享视频，然后，在第一修正案的保护下，该视频可以报告其存在并描述其描绘的内容。有很多内容（例如种族主义言论或婚外情的证据）表明名人不想在媒体上看到，更不用说在8chan上流传了。</p><p> This was what Blatt was hoping the woman in the Blackberry videos might fear. In the years since her relationship with the man in the video had ended, she had become more famous than he was. She had more to lose. For people like her, Blatt says, “You’re buying peace of mind.”</p><p> 这就是Blatt希望黑莓视频中的女人可能担心的事情。自从她与视频中的男人的关系结束以来的几年中，她变得比他更出名。她有更多的损失。对于像她这样的人，布拉特说：“您可以放心。”</p><p> Blatt grew up in Cleveland in the 1980s. It was there he honed his skills at getting what he wanted. To get a private tour of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame before it opened to the public, he affected a British accent and said he was George Clinton’s tour manager. When he and his younger brother Darren sold posters door to door, they told customers they were giving them a discount; they were in fact marking up the price.</p><p> 布拉特（Blatt）在1980年代在克利夫兰（Cleveland）长大。他在那里在那里磨练自己的技能，以得到自己想要的东西。进行摇滚之旅劳尔名人堂（Roll Hall）在向公众开放之前，就影响了英国的口音，并说他是乔治·克林顿（George Clinton）的旅游经理。当他和弟弟达伦（Darren）挨家挨户出售海报时，他们告诉顾客他们要给他们折扣。他们实际上是在标价。 </p><p>  In 1996 the Blatt brothers got in their Toyota Corolla, headed to Southern California, and vowed never to go back. To fit in, Blatt dyed his hair blond before a job interview. He got the gig: handling customer service for a teenager making $100,000 a month working out of his parents’ duplex selling server space where websites could store their files. “The kid paid me $50,000 a year, and I pretty much did nothing,” Blatt says.</p><p>1996年，布拉特兄弟（Blatt Brothers）坐上了丰田卡罗拉（Toyota Corolla），前往南加州，誓言永不回头。为了适应，布拉特在面试前把头发染成了金色。他的工作是：为一个十几岁的少年提供客户服务，这个少年每月从父母的双面销售服务器空间中赚取100,000美元，该网站可以用来存储文件。 “这个孩子一年付给我5万美元，而我几乎什么也没做，”布拉特说。</p><p> The Blatts soon found the online porn crowd. The adult industry was pioneering new tech like videostreaming and web credit-card processing. Blatt worked in marketing, helping dozens of clients promote each other’s sites through links that paid a commission for referring customers. The money was easy, and the rules were loose.</p><p> The Blatts很快找到了在线色情人群。成人行业正在开拓视频流和网络信用卡处理等新技术。 Blatt从事市场营销工作，通过链接支付了推荐客户佣金的链接，帮助数十个客户彼此宣传自己的网站。钱很容易，规则很宽松。</p><p> “People didn’t realize your credit card would get whacked,” Blatt says. In other words, the adult sites he worked for would rack up false charges in the hope that customers would be too embarrassed by their original purchase to report the fraud.</p><p> 布拉特说：“人们没有意识到您的信用卡会遭到破坏。”换句话说，他为之工作的成人网站会进行虚假指控，以期使客户对最初购买的商品过于尴尬而无法举报欺诈行为。</p><p>  Darren and Kevin Blatt began going by the monikers D-Money and K-Bizzle (or KB) and throwing parties in Vegas around the  Adult Video News awards. Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, and others flew in to perform and mingle with porn stars.</p><p>  达伦（Darren）和凯文·布拉特（Kevin Blatt）开始追随D-Money和K-Bizzle（或KB）的绰号，并在拉斯维加斯举行了成人视频新闻奖颁奖典礼。史努比·道格（Snoop Dogg），《冰立方》（Ice Cube）等人飞来表演并与色情明星混在一起。</p><p>  Blatt became the guy major newspapers would call for comment on X-rated news; when  The  New York Times wrote about penis enlargement pills and “ email hucksterism,” Blatt said, “Who is going to take a penis pill maker to court and go in front of a jury of their peers to say ‘I bought a bottle of pills to enlarge my penis, and they didn&#39;t work?’” It was 2003. Late that summer, when some Seattle-based adult industry entrepreneurs acquired a video of hotel-chain heiress Paris Hilton having sex with her ex-boyfriend, a serial starlet seducer and gambler named Rick Salomon, Blatt was the person they called to do publicity.</p><p>  布拉特成为主要报纸呼吁对X级新闻发表评论的人。当《纽约时报》撰写有关阴茎增大药丸和“电子邮件怪癖”的文章时，布拉特说：“谁将把阴茎丸制造商告上法庭，并在同行陪审团面前说'我买了一瓶药丸扩大我的阴茎，他们没有工作吗？'”那是2003年。那年夏末，一些西雅图的成年产业企业家获得了一段录像，记录了连锁酒店的女继承人帕丽斯·希尔顿与她的前男友发生性关系的经历，布拉特（Blatt）是名叫里克·所罗门（Rick Salomon）的连续小明星诱惑者和赌徒，是他们打电话进行宣传的人。</p><p> From a young age, Hilton had been widely despised for her family’s wealth and the party-hard lifestyle it allowed her. But she also understood that vitriol sells, so the 22-year-old socialite played along, signing up for a Fox reality show,  The Simple Life, that allowed her to emphasize her dumb-blonde persona.</p><p> 从很小的时候起，希尔顿就一直鄙视她的家人的财富和它允许参加派对的艰苦生活方式。但她也了解到硫酸是可以卖的，所以这位22岁的社交名流也参与其中，签约了Fox真人秀节目《简单生活》，这使她得以强调自己的笨拙的人物形象。</p><p> Her rising fame made her a target for paparazzi and anyone looking to hawk information about her personal life. Salomon says he began to consider selling a tape he and Hilton had made while having sex two years earlier after Hilton crashed his Escalade and didn’t apologize. He even met with porn magnate Larry Flynt. But before Salomon could complete a deal, one of his friends swiped the tape and sold it to the Seattle guys for $50,000. The Seattle guys created a new company called Marvad to handle the Hilton tape, a common practice for new ventures in the porn world. (Marvad&#39;s founders did not respond to requests for comment.)</p><p> 她的名气上升使她成为狗仔队以及任何想要了解有关她的个人生活信息的人的目标。所罗门（Salomon）说，两年前，在希尔顿撞毁自己的凯雷德（Escalade）并没有道歉之后，他开始考虑出售自己和希尔顿做爱时制作的磁带。他甚至会见了色情大亨拉里·弗林特（Larry Flynt）。但是在所罗门完成交易之前，他的一个朋友就刷了录音带，并以5万美元的价格卖给了西雅图的人们。西雅图的人创建了一家名为Marvad的新公司来处理希尔顿磁带，这是色情界新创企业的普遍做法。 （Marvad的创始人未回应置评请求。） </p><p>  Marvad never intended to stream the video or sell it to the public, because, again, without the permission of Hilton and Salomon, that would be illegal. Instead, as Marvad’s former attorney Derek Newman confirms, the idea was to announce to the media that the company intended to sell the tape as a ploy to bring traffic to Marvad&#39;s website, Sexbrat.com.</p><p>Marvad从未打算将视频流传输或出售给公众，因为同样，未经希尔顿和所罗门的许可，这将是非法的。相反，正如Marvad的前律师德里克·纽曼（Derek Newman）确认的那样，其想法是向媒体宣布，该公司打算出售该录像带，以此将流量吸引到Marvad的网站Sexbrat.com。</p><p> In order to get news coverage about the tape, Blatt needed to prove to journalists that the company did in fact have a raunchy recording of Paris Hilton. At the beginning of November 2003, a month before  The Simple Life was set to premiere, he emailed a three-minute clip of highlights to someone at  US Weekly and someone at  Entertainment Tonight.</p><p> 为了获得有关录像带的新闻报道，布拉特需要向记者证明，该公司确实录制了巴黎希尔顿的唱片。 2003年11月上旬，即《简单生活》（Simple Life）首映前一个月，他通过电子邮件将三分钟的精彩片段剪辑发送给了《美国周刊》和《今日娱乐》上的某个人。</p><p> What happened next was in part an accident, but it would lay the groundwork for the rest of Blatt&#39;s career. The journalists forwarded the video to their friends and coworkers, who in turn sent it to everyone they knew. News of the tape’s existence hit the tabloids, and soon people were crowding around to watch what Seattle alt-weekly  The Stranger described as Hilton’s “raging indifference to being porked; her face vacant, her eyes glowing eerily due to the night-vision equipment.”</p><p> 接下来发生的事情部分是偶然的，但这将为Blatt的其余职业打下基础。记者们将视频转发给了他们的朋友和同事，他们又将其发送给了他们认识的每个人。录音带存在的消息轰动了小报，不久人们就围观观看西雅图高调周刊《陌生人》对希尔顿的描述：“对猪肉的冷漠无情；夜视设备使她的脸空着，眼睛闪闪发光。”</p><p>  In a recent documentary, Hilton described the experience as “like being electronically raped.”</p><p>  在最近的纪录片中，希尔顿将这种经历描述为“就像被电子强奸一样”。</p><p> By mid-November, roughly two weeks after Blatt sent the clip out over email, Salomon was suing Marvad, Hilton, and her parents; Marvad and Salomon were each suing the guy who had stolen and sold the tape; and Hilton got Marvad to give her its copy in exchange for her agreeing not to sue. Blatt did interviews with  20/20 and the Associated Press. “Paris Hilton” became the most-searched term on Google and Lycos. And many people assumed the tape’s release had been orchestrated by Hilton herself to promote  The Simple Life. Hardly anyone cared whether Hilton’s or Salomon’s privacy had been violated. Even feminist writer Rebecca Traister, then a young culture critic, called the pair “narcissist strivers dying to get noticed” in  Salon, mocking Hilton’s thin body as looking “best” when the camera’s “graininess adds texture and contour.”</p><p> 到11月中旬，大约是布拉特通过电子邮件发送剪辑后的两周，所罗门（Salomon）起诉Marvad，Hilton及其父母。马尔瓦德（Marvad）和所罗门（Salomon）分别起诉偷窃和出售磁带的那个人。希尔顿让Marvad送给她副本，以换取她同意不起诉。布拉特接受了20/20和美联社的采访。 “巴黎希尔顿”成为Google和Lycos上搜索次数最多的术语。许多人认为，磁带的发行是希尔顿自己策划的，以宣传《简单生活》。几乎没人在乎希尔顿或所罗门的隐私是否遭到侵犯。甚至是当时年轻的文化批评家的女权主义者作家丽贝卡·特雷斯特（Rebecca Traister）在沙龙中也称其为“渴望受到关注的自恋狂”，嘲笑希尔顿的瘦身在相机的“颗粒感增加质感和轮廓”时看起来“最佳”。</p><p>  At one point, Blatt did a phone interview with Howard Stern. According to Blatt, the folks at Marvad said they’d give him $1,000 for every time he said the name of their website, Sexbrat.com, on air, and $2,000 for every time he got Stern to say it.</p><p>  有一次，布拉特对霍华德·斯特恩进行了电话采访。据布拉特说，马尔瓦德（Marvad）的人们说，每当他说出他们的网站Sexbrat.com的名字时，他们都会给他1,000美元，而每次让斯特恩说时，他们都会给他1,000美元。</p><p>    No matter. Blatt managed to say “Sexbrat.com” 13 times and got Stern to say it five times.</p><p>    不管。 Blatt设法说了13次“ Sexbrat.com”，然后让Stern说了5次。 </p><p> After the three-minute clip went viral, Salomon’s brother set up a website on servers based in the Czech Republic: Trustfundgirls.com. The site began selling the full tape without Hilton’s permission. It promised “THE ORIGINAL TRUST FUND GIRL IN HER RAREST, HOTTEST MOMENTS.” Fifty dollars got you five plays.</p><p>在三分钟的片段流行之后，所罗门的兄弟在捷克共和国的服务器上建立了一个网站：Trustfundgirls.com。该网站未经希尔顿许可开始出售完整的录像带。它承诺“原始的信托基金女孩在她最珍贵的时刻”。五十美元给你带来了五个机会。</p><p> As the lawsuits escalated, Salomon called around to people in the porn industry and found himself talking with D-Money, or Darren Blatt. Darren says he connected Salomon with people who could help him sell the tape legally and convinced him to hire Blatt to help do the publicity. All they needed was Hilton’s signature.</p><p> 随着诉讼升级，所罗门向色情行业的人们打来电话，发现自己正在与D-Money或Darren Blatt交谈。达伦说，他将所罗门与可以帮助他合法出售磁带的人联系起来，并说服他雇用布拉特来帮助进行宣传。他们所需要的只是希尔顿的签名。</p><p> Hilton’s lawyer called the suggestion that her client allow the tape to be sold legally “beneath contempt,” but by the spring of 2004 Hilton had agreed to settle. (Hilton declined to comment.) The sex tape, now branded as  1 Night in Paris, was then released commercially, both online and in adult video stores.</p><p> 希尔顿的律师提出了这样的建议，即她的客户允许“在鄙视之下”合法出售该录音带，但到2004年春季，希尔顿已同意和解。 （希尔顿拒绝置评。）该性爱录像带（现在在巴黎被称为1 Night）随后在网上和成人视频商店中商业发行。</p><p> After all,  The Simple Life was a hit. The fourth episode attracted almost a million more viewers than the live interview with President George W. Bush talking about the capture of Saddam Hussein that aired at the same time. Within a few months, Hilton had a book deal, a fragrance line, a second season, and a series of high-profile guest spots on TV.</p><p> 毕竟，《简单生活》很受欢迎。第四集吸引的观众人数比接受乔治·W·布什总统同时直播萨达姆·侯赛因被捕的现场采访时多了近一百万。在短短几个月内，希尔顿就完成了一笔交易，香水系列，第二季的演出，以及电视上一系列引人注目的嘉宾现场。</p><p>  For Blatt, the whole saga drew a blueprint he could follow time and again: generate as much press around a sex tape as necessary, thus pressuring the celebrity to eith</p><p>  对于Blatt来说，整个传奇故事都绘制了他可以一次又一次遵循的蓝图：在性爱录像带周围产生尽可能多的压力，从而使名人向</p><p>......</p><p>...... </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/story/sex-tapes-hush-money-hollywood-kevin-blatt/">https://www.wired.com/story/sex-tapes-hush-money-hollywood-kevin-blatt/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/秘密/">#秘密</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/economy/">#economy</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/分享/">#分享</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy; 2020 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
