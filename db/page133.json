I was always happy not to be them or be sitting with them.  I always kept the lively conversation flowing at my table.  I had good boundaries between my on- and offline lives. But now, restaurants around the world have nonconsensually turned us all into the people I used to judge. I hate it. And it\u2019s time for us to go back.\n    It all started when outdoor dining resumed after initial waves of mandated closures last spring. Wary of wayward coronaviruses lingering on physical menus, restaurants taped QR codes to their tables and outsourced the act of menu delivery to the diner and her smartphone. This might have made sense when it still seemed possible that the coronavirus was largely spreading through surface transmission. But we now know that the risk of infection via a contaminated surface  is low. In tons of communities across the U.S., vaccination rates are high and COVID-19 case rates are low. People are attending indoor concerts, grinding at dance clubs, and heading back to the office. And yet, even as we eat and slobber and sneeze in restaurants seated at full capacity, in many of those establishments, we\u2019re still obliged to use our own smartphones to figure out what we want to eat. Why? Why should we be scared to go back to touching a communal piece of paper when we\u2019re already breathing one another\u2019s theoretically more dangerous air?\n        The obvious pitfalls of the QR code menu were well worth the aggravation as a temporary public health measure, and I truly feel for restaurant owners and workers who\u2019ve been forced to redesign their businesses every few months in response to changing municipal regulations and public health findings. But the QR code\u2019s continued ubiquity well into the era of the low surface transmission consensus and the full reopening of public spaces has me worried that digital-only menus will be one pandemic modification that becomes a permanent element of public life. Maybe restaurant owners will welcome the demise of physical menus as a way to eliminate one small but constant expense. Maybe their employees will relish their newfound freedom from the hassle of reprinting menus every time there\u2019s a new seasonal entree on offer. Maybe it will free servers from patrons who always seem to want to order the one dish that\u2019s out of stock. (It can be easily deleted from a digital menu as soon as it runs out.) Maybe diners who already love scrolling on their phones at restaurants will be more than happy to check out the menu there, too. Other customers may be content to touch one less surface that might be stained with food or invisibly smeared with another person\u2019s snot.\n      Not I! I\u2019m tired of having to navigate a new digital platform every time I eat out. I despise spending the first 10 minutes of a social engagement on my phone. I never again want to encounter, as I did last week, a QR code that leads to a website where  each of the seven menu pages is a separate PDF that must be clicked, zoomed in on, and closed before moving on to the next.\n  If you think I\u2019m being overdramatic, let me ask you this: Have you gone to a restaurant with your boomer parents during the pandemic? If not, have you ever had to teach your boomer parents how to set up a Roku or connect their printer to Bluetooth? Same tedious, excruciating, relationship-straining thing. One of my family members is in his late 70s, loves dining out, and only owns a flip phone with no internet connectivity. He\u2019s already excluded from much of our increasingly digital society; before the pandemic, the American restaurant was one of the few places left where he was entirely comfortable with the mores and knew exactly what was expected of him when he walked through the door. Now, he never knows what to anticipate or what he\u2019ll be asked to do when he goes out for lunch.\n      Default-digital menus are alienating for other kinds of customers, too. Critics have rightly noted that the  cashless trend in food and retail is prohibitive for customers who don\u2019t have bank accounts. Likewise, for a customer who doesn\u2019t have a smartphone or robust data plan\u2014including about  one-quarter of adults with household incomes below $30,000 per year\u2014a QR code menu means having to ask for special accommodations she never used to need. Ditto foreign travelers, whose smartphones may not work on U.S. soil. QR codes also  open the door for easily executed scams, malware, and digital surveillance. There is no good reason to add an exclusionary, risky, socially deadening digital step to an analog system that was working just fine before the pandemic hit.\n    Some restaurants have taken it even further, digitizing not just the menu but the entire dining experience. Two months ago, I ate outdoors at a Basque restaurant that used to have fantastic service on its outdoor patio. This time, it required diners to page through an extensive website that held its menu options. We had to place food and drink orders on an online platform and punch in our credit card information on our tiny phone keyboards with our big, dumb fingers. Then, we had to wait for a notification on our phones to tell us our drinks were ready to pick up indoors. When we decided to order a second bottle of cider midway through the meal, we had to place a whole new order online. It felt more like ordering takeout or shopping on Amazon than dining out.\n      It is possible that I socialize in some kind of Luddite bubble, but I\u2019ve only ever heard from one person who loves the new QR code restaurant experience. My colleague, a single woman in her 30s in D.C., said she likes the restaurants that now require customers to view the menu, order,  and pay via QR code, fully eliminating most of a server\u2019s responsibilities. (This mode of operation may make sense for restaurants that have faced  staffing shortages since reopening. I will happily pay higher prices at an adequately staffed restaurant that pays a living wage.) Since each diner orders and pays on her own, my colleague said, it\u2019s made it easier to dine with groups of friends who might have otherwise struggled with splitting a check, and it\u2019s preempted awkward conversations with guys on dates about who\u2019s getting the bill.\n      I suppose I can see where she\u2019s coming from. During a bad date or a social interaction that\u2019s reached its natural end, the wait to receive and pay the check can feel interminable. But people don\u2019t visit sit-down restaurants because they want a meal marked by extreme convenience and speed. As several restaurant workers have told me during the pandemic,  diners come to restaurants for hospitality. For me, the pleasure of poring over a physical menu is so integral to the experience of dining out that I  made my friends mimic it during an early-pandemic dinner over Zoom. We\u2019ve all just had the most isolated, screen-mediated year of our lives. If there\u2019s an opportunity for us to make a familiar social interaction more tangible and human, and less coldly transactional, let\u2019s take it.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:23", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u83dc\u5355,menus,\u9910\u5385", "title": "\u5e26\u56de\u83dc\u5355\uff0cQR\u7801\u662f\u53ef\u6015\u7684 ", "title_en": "Bring back menus, QR codes are terrible", "transed": 1, "url": "https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/06/bring-back-menus-end-qr-codes.html?via=rss", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u83dc\u5355", "menus", "\u9910\u5385"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "4ac7b3fafb966aad80cfb00e4b0a8b41.png", "infoid": 1068511, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9Wioguard VPN\u96a7\u9053\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u5f7c\u6b64\u76f8\u4e92\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u5728\u5bb6\u91cc\uff0c\u529e\u516c\u5ba4\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u4efb\u4f55\u5730\u65b9\u3002\n  Wiretrustee\u4f7f\u7528\u5728PION / ICE\u5e93\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684WebRTC Ice\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u8bbe\u5907\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u8fde\u63a5\u5019\u9009\u8005\u3002\n  \u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u5bf9\u7b49\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d1\u9001\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u7528Wioguard\u952e\u52a0\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u67e5\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u4fe1\u4ee4\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e0a\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u8def\u7531\u57fa\u4e8e\u516c\u5171Wiguard\u952e\u3002\n \u5076\u5c14\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\u7684NAT\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u7ea7NAT\uff09\uff0cNAT-Traversal\u662f\u4e0d\u6210\u529f\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b64\u4e8b\u9879\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u56de\u9000\uff08\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5efa\u7acb\u5b89\u5168\u7684Wireguard\u96a7\u9053\u3002 Coturn\u662f\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u7528\u4e8e\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u7684\u4ee4\u4eba\u9707\u60ca\u548c\u7ffb\u8f6cWiretrustee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\n  Wioguard\u5bc6\u94a5\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u7b49\u952e\u5e76\u5728WireTrustee\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0a\u6307\u5b9a\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n \u5bf9\u7b49\u5730\u5740\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u914d\u7f6eWiretrustee\u65f6\uff0c\u60a8\u5fc5\u987b\u6307\u5b9a\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u5bf9\u7b49\u672c\u5730\u5730\u5740\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c10.30.30.1/24\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u529f\u80fd\u4f4d\u4e8e\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0a\u3002\n                      \u5bf9\u4e8eWindows Systems\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728PowerShell\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u670d\u52a1\u547d\u4ee4\u5c06WireTrustee\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\uff1a \nCD C\uff1a\\ path \\ to \\ wiretrustee \\ bin\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1--help\u3002 \\ wiretrustee.exe\u670d\u52a1\u5b89\u88c5\uff03\u8fd9\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u6743\u9650\u624d\u80fd\u5b89\u88c5\u65b0\u670d\u52a1\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunurls stun\uff1astun.wiretrustee.com\uff1a3468\uff0cstun\uff1astun.l.google.com\uff1a19302 \\ --turnurls\uff06lt;\u8f6c\u52a8\u7528\u6237\uff06gt ;:\uff06lt;\u6253\u5f00\u5bc6\u7801\uff06gt;

At home, the office, or anywhere else.\n  Wiretrustee uses WebRTC ICE implemented in  pion/ice library to discover connection candidates when establishing a peer-to-peer connection between devices.\n  Contents of the messages sent between peers through the signaling server are encrypted with Wireguard keys, making it impossible to inspect them.The routing of the messages on a Signalling server is based on public Wireguard keys.\n Occasionally, the NAT-traversal is unsuccessful due to strict NATs (e.g. mobile carrier-grade NAT).For that matter, there is support for a relay server fallback (TURN) and a secure Wireguard tunnel is established via TURN server. Coturn is the one that has been successfully used for STUN and TURN in Wiretrustee setups.\n  Wireguard key management. In consequence, you need to generate peer keys and specify them on Wiretrustee initialization step. This feature is on the roadmap.\n Peer address management. You have to specify a unique peer local address (e.g. 10.30.30.1/24) when configuring Wiretrustee. This feature is on the roadmap.\n                      For Windows systems, we can use the service command to configure Wiretrustee as a service by running the following commands in Powershell:\n cd C: \\path \\to \\wiretrustee \\bin. \\wiretrustee.exe service --help. \\wiretrustee.exe service install   # This will prompt for administrator permissions in order to install a new service\n       sudo wiretrustee init \\ --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302 \\ --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468 \\ --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000 \\ --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24 \\ --log-level info\n  . \\wiretrustee.exe init   `  --stunURLs stun:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468,stun:stun.l.google.com:19302  ` --turnURLs  &lt;TURN User &gt;: &lt;TURN password &gt;@turn:stun.wiretrustee.com:3468   `  --signalAddr signal.wiretrustee.com:10000  ` --wgLocalAddr 10.30.30.1/24   `  --log-level info\n It is important to mention that the  wgLocalAddr parameter has to be unique across your network.E.g. if you have Peer A with  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.1/24 then another Peer B can have  wgLocalAddr=10.30.30.2/24\n If for some reason, you already have a generated Wireguard key, you can specify it with the  --wgKey parameter.If not specified, then a new one will be generated, and its corresponding public key will be output to the log.A new config will be generated and stored under  /etc/wiretrustee/config.json\n       sudo wiretrustee up --log-level info   # orsudo wiretrustee up --log-level info  &amp;   # to run it in background\n         This will launch the Signal server on port 10000, in case you want to change the port, use the flag --port.\n  We have packed the Signal server into docker image.

If you don&#39;t already have an SSL certificate, you can follow  Certbot&#39;s official documentationto generate one from  Let\u2019s Encrypt, or, we found that the example provided by  BigBlueButton covers the basics to configure Coturn with Let&#39;s Encrypt certs.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:02:00", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "rust,\u7f51\u72b6,wireguard,wiretrustee", "title": "WireTrustee\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eWioguard\u7684\u7f51\u72b6\u7f51\u7edc ", "title_en": "Wiretrustee: WireGuard-Based Mesh Network", "transed": 1, "url": "https://github.com/wiretrustee/wiretrustee", "via": "", "real_tags": ["rust", "\u7f51\u72b6", "wireguard"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "", "infoid": 1068509, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u51e0\u5e74\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86javascript\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u542c\u5230\u4e86\u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd\uff06\uff0339;\u865a\u62dfDom\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u7684\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u793a\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u6bd4\u771f\u6b63\u7684dom\u3002\u5b83\uff06\uff0339;\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u6a21\u56e0 - \u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u95ee\u4e86\u5728\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62dfDOM\u65f6\u5982\u4f55\u5feb\u901f\u5feb\u901f\u3002\n    \u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u6e32\u67d3\uff08\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u6784\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u6b64\u7b80\u5355\u7684React\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\n    ...\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u76f8\u540c\u7684 - \u4ee3\u8868\u9875\u9762\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u770b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u5bf9\u8c61\u662f\u865a\u62dfDOM\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u60a8\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff06\uff0339;

It&#39;s a surprisingly resilient meme \u2014 for example people have asked how Svelte can be fast when it doesn&#39;t use a virtual DOM.\n    In many frameworks, you build an app by creating  render() functions, like this simple  React component:\n    ...but the result is the same \u2014 an object representing how the page should now look. That object is the virtual DOM. Every time your app&#39;s state updates (for example when the  name prop changes), you create a new one. The framework&#39;s job is to  reconcile the new one against the old one, to figure out what changes are necessary and apply them to the real DOM.\n   Misunderstood claims about virtual DOM performance date back to the launch of React. In  Rethinking Best Practices, a seminal 2013 talk by former React core team member Pete Hunt, we learned the following:\n This is actually extremely fast, primarily because most DOM operations tend to be slow. There&#39;s been a lot of performance work on the DOM, but most DOM operations tend to drop frames.\n  But hang on a minute! The virtual DOM operations are  in addition to the eventual operations on the real DOM. The only way it could be faster is if we were comparing it to a less efficient framework (there were plenty to go around back in 2013!), or arguing against a straw man \u2014 that the alternative is to do something no-one actually does:\n   React is not magic. Just like you can drop into assembler with C and beat the C compiler, you can drop into raw DOM operations and DOM API calls and beat React if you wanted to. However, using C or Java or JavaScript is an order of magnitude performance improvement because you don&#39;t have to worry...about the specifics of the platform. With React you can build applications without even thinking about performance and the default state is fast.\n    Not exactly. It&#39;s more like &#39;the virtual DOM is usually fast enough&#39;, but with certain caveats.\n The original promise of React was that you could re-render your entire app on every single state change without worrying about performance. In practice, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s turned out to be accurate. If it was, there&#39;d be no need for optimisations like  shouldComponentUpdate (which is a way of telling React when it can safely skip a component).\n Even with  shouldComponentUpdate, updating your entire app&#39;s virtual DOM in one go is a lot of work. A while back, the React team introduced something called React Fiber which allows the update to be broken into smaller chunks. This means (among other things) that updates don&#39;t block the main thread for long periods of time, though it doesn&#39;t reduce the total amount of work or the time an update takes.\n   Most obviously,  diffing isn&#39;t free. You can&#39;t apply changes to the real DOM without first comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous snapshot. To take the earlier  HelloMessage example, suppose the  name prop changed from &#39;world&#39; to &#39;everybody&#39;.\n Both snapshots contain a single element. In both cases it&#39;s a  &lt;div&gt;, which means we can keep the same DOM node\n We enumerate all the attributes on the old  &lt;div&gt; and the new one to see if any need to be changed, added or removed. In both cases we have a single attribute \u2014 a  className with a value of  &#34;greeting&#34;\n Descending into the element, we see that the text has changed, so we&#39;ll need to update the real DOM\n Of these three steps, only the third has value in this case, since \u2014 as is the case in the vast majority of updates \u2014 the basic structure of the app is unchanged. It would be much more efficient if we could skip straight to step 3:\n  (This is almost exactly the update code that Svelte generates. Unlike traditional UI frameworks, Svelte is a compiler that knows at  build time how things could change in your app, rather than waiting to do the work at  run time.)\n   The diffing algorithms used by React and other virtual DOM frameworks are fast. Arguably, the greater overhead is in the components themselves. You wouldn&#39;t write code like this...\n  ...because you&#39;d be carelessly recalculating  value on every update, regardless of whether  props.foo had changed. But it&#39;s extremely common to do unnecessary computation and allocation in ways that seem much more benign:\n function  MoreRealisticComponent ( props )  {  const  [selected , setSelected ]  =  useState ( null ) ;  return  (  &lt;div &gt;  &lt;p &gt;Selected  {selected  ? selected .name  :  &#39;nothing&#39; } &lt; /p &gt;  &lt;ul &gt;  {props .items . map ( item  =&gt;  &lt;li &gt;  &lt;button onClick = { ( )  =&gt;  setSelected (item ) } &gt;  {item .name }  &lt; /button &gt;  &lt; /li &gt;  ) }  &lt; /ul &gt;  &lt; /div &gt;  ) ; }\n Here, we&#39;re generating a new array of virtual  &lt;li&gt; elements \u2014 each with their own inline event handler \u2014 on every state change, regardless of whether  props.items has changed. Unless you&#39;re unhealthily obsessed with performance, you&#39;re not going to optimise that. There&#39;s no point. It&#39;s plenty fast enough. But you know what would be even faster?  Not doing that.\n  The danger of defaulting to doing unnecessary work, even if that work is trivial, is that your app will eventually succumb to &#39;death by a thousand cuts&#39; with no clear bottleneck to aim at once it&#39;s time to optimise.\n    It&#39;s important to understand that virtual DOM  isn&#39;t a feature. It&#39;s a means to an end, the end being declarative, state-driven UI development. Virtual DOM is valuable because it allows you to build apps without thinking about state transitions, with performance that is  generally good enough. That means less buggy code, and more time spent on creative tasks instead of tedious ones.\n But it turns out that we can achieve a similar programming model without using virtual DOM \u2014 and that&#39;s where Svelte comes in.", "posttime": "2021-06-29 23:01:13", "source_domain": "news.ycombinator.com", "source_name": "Hacker News", "tags": "\u865a\u62df,dom", "title": "\u865a\u62dfDOM\u662f\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff082018\uff09 ", "title_en": "Virtual DOM is pure overhead (2018)", "transed": 1, "url": "https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead", "via": "", "real_tags": ["\u865a\u62df", "dom"]}, {"category": "", "categoryclass": "", "imagename": "0cfce70aa621e219e9420dd61ad18913.png", "infoid": 1068508, "ip": "", "isanchordig": 1, "ischecked": 1, "isdelete": 0, "isneo": 1, "mark": "", "name": "", "note": "\u4eca\u5929\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u63a8\u51faGithub Copilot\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5458\uff0c\u53ef\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002 github copilot\u4ece\u6b63\u5728\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7ed8\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u6574\u884c\u6216\u6574\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0API\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u901f\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u4e0a\u5bfb\u627e\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5f53\u60a8\u952e\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u7b26\u5408\u60a8\u7f16\u5199\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f - \u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\n GitHub Copilot\u4e0eOpenai\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u7531Openai\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9b\u7535\u3002 Openai Codex\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e86\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684GPT-3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u539f\u56e0\u662f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u57f9\u8bad\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u66f4\u5927\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5171\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002 GitHub Copilot\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u5bf9\u4e8ePython\uff0cJavaScript\uff0cCyperscript\uff0cRuby\u548cGo\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u3002\n \u5728GitHub CopIlot\u9875\u9762\u4e0a\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6280\u672f\u9884\u89c8\u7684\u6591\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4eca\u5929\u6ce8\u518c\uff01 ", "note_en": "Today, we are launching a technical preview of  GitHub Copilot, a new AI pair programmer that helps you write better code.

There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. Andyet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when Iwas in school, the answer is definitely yes.  One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you&#39;llhave to work very hard. I wasn&#39;t sure of that as a kid. Schoolworkvaried in difficulty; one didn&#39;t always have to work super hard todo well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed todo almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hardwork through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question.There isn&#39;t.  The reason some subjects seemed easy was that my school had lowstandards. And the reason famous adults seemed to do thingseffortlessly was years of practice; they made it look easy.  Of course, those famous adults usually had a lot of natural abilitytoo. There are three ingredients in great work: natural ability,practice, and effort. You can do pretty well with just two, but todo the best work you need all three: you need great natural ability and to have practiced a lot  and to be trying very hard.  [  1]  Bill Gates, for example, was among the smartest people in businessin his era, but he was also among the hardest working. &#34;I nevertook a day off in my twenties,&#34; he said. &#34;Not one.&#34; It was similarwith Lionel Messi. He had great natural ability, but when his youthcoaches talk about him, what they remember is not his talent buthis dedication and his desire to win. P. G. Wodehouse would probablyget my vote for best English writer of the 20th century, if I hadto choose. Certainly no one ever made it look easier. But no oneever worked harder. At 74, he wrote with each new book of mine I have, as I say, the feeling that this time I have picked a lemon in the garden of literature. A good thing, really, I suppose. Keeps one up on one&#39;s toes and makes one rewrite every sentence ten times. Or in many cases twenty times.\nSounds a bit extreme, you think. And yet Bill Gates sounds evenmore extreme. Not one day off in ten years? These two had aboutas much natural ability as anyone could have, and yet they alsoworked about as hard as anyone could work. You need both.  That seems so obvious, and yet in practice we find it slightly hardto grasp. There&#39;s a faint xor between talent and hard work. It comespartly from popular culture, where it seems to run very deep, andpartly from the fact that the outliers are so rare. If great talentand great drive are both rare, then people with both are raresquared. Most people you meet who have a lot of one will have lessof the other. But you&#39;ll need both if you want to be an outlieryourself. And since you can&#39;t really change how much natural talentyou have, in practice doing great work, insofar as you can, reducesto working very hard.  It&#39;s straightforward to work hard if you have clearly defined,externally imposed goals, as you do in school. There is some techniqueto it: you have to learn not to lie to yourself, not to procrastinate(which is a form of lying to yourself), not to get distracted, andnot to give up when things go wrong. But this level of disciplineseems to be within the reach of quite young children, if they wantit.  What I&#39;ve learned since I was a kid is how to work toward goalsthat are neither clearly defined nor externally imposed. You&#39;llprobably have to learn both if you want to do really great things.  The most basic level of which is simply to feel you should be workingwithout anyone telling you to. Now, when I&#39;m not working hard, alarmbells go off. I can&#39;t be sure I&#39;m getting anywhere when I&#39;m workinghard, but I can be sure I&#39;m getting nowhere when I&#39;m not, and itfeels awful. [  2]  There wasn&#39;t a single point when I learned this. Like most littlekids, I enjoyed the feeling of achievement when I learned or didsomething new. As I grew older, this morphed into a feeling ofdisgust when I wasn&#39;t achieving anything. The one precisely dateablelandmark I have is when I stopped watching TV, at age\u00a013.  Several people I&#39;ve talked to remember getting serious about workaround this age. When I asked Patrick Collison when he started tofind idleness distasteful, he said I think around age 13 or 14. I have a clear memory from around then of sitting in the sitting room, staring outside, and wondering why I was wasting my summer holiday.\nPerhaps something changes at adolescence. That would make sense.  Strangely enough, the biggest obstacle to getting serious aboutwork was probably school, which made work (what they called work)seem boring and pointless. I had to learn what real work was beforeI could wholeheartedly desire to do it. That took a while, becauseeven in college a lot of the work is pointless; there are entiredepartments that are pointless. But as I learned the shape of realwork, I found that my desire to do it slotted into it as if they&#39;dbeen made for each another.  I suspect most people have to learn what work is before they canlove it. Hardy wrote eloquently about this in  A Mathematician&#39;sApology: I do not remember having felt, as a boy, any  passion for mathematics, and such notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble. I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships: I wanted to beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most decisively.\nHe didn&#39;t learn what math was really about till part way throughcollege, when he read Jordan&#39;s  Cours d&#39;analyse. I shall never forget the astonishment with which I read that remarkable work, the first inspiration for so many mathematicians of my generation, and learnt for the first time as I read it what mathematics really meant.\nThere are two separate kinds of fakeness you need to learn todiscount in order to understand what real work is. One is the kindHardy encountered in school. Subjects get distorted when they&#39;readapted to be taught to kids \u2014 often so distorted that they&#39;renothing like the work done by actual practitioners. [  3]The otherkind of fakeness is intrinsic to certain types of work. Some typesof work are inherently bogus, or at best mere busywork.  There&#39;s a kind of solidity to real work. It&#39;s not all writing the Principia, but it all feels necessary. That&#39;s a vague criterion,but it&#39;s deliberately vague, because it has to cover a lot ofdifferent types. [  4]  Once you know the shape of real work, you have to learn how manyhours a day to spend on it. You can&#39;t solve this problem by simplyworking every waking hour, because in many kinds of work there&#39;s apoint beyond which the quality of the result will start to decline.  That limit varies depending on the type of work and the person.I&#39;ve done several different kinds of work, and the limits weredifferent for each. My limit for the harder types of writing orprogramming is about five hours a day. Whereas when I was runninga startup, I couldwork all the time. At least for the three years I did it; if I&#39;dkept going much longer, I&#39;d probably have needed to take occasionalvacations. [  5]  The only way to find the limit is by crossing it. Cultivate asensitivity to the quality of the work you&#39;re doing, and then you&#39;llnotice if it decreases because you&#39;re working too hard. Honesty iscritical here, in both directions: you have to notice when you&#39;rebeing lazy, but also when you&#39;re working too hard. And if you thinkthere&#39;s something admirable about working too hard, get that ideaout of your head. You&#39;re not merely getting worse results, butgetting them because you&#39;re showing off \u2014 if not to other people,then to yourself. [  6]  Finding the limit of working hard is a constant, ongoing process,not something you do just once. Both the difficulty of the work andyour ability to do it can vary hour to hour, so you need to beconstantly judging both how hard you&#39;re trying and how well you&#39;redoing.  Trying hard doesn&#39;t mean constantly pushing yourself to work, though.There may be some people do who, but I think my experience is fairlytypical, and I only have to push myself occasionally when I&#39;mstarting a project or when I encounter some sort of check. That&#39;swhen I&#39;m in danger of procrastinating. But once I get rolling, Itend to keep going.  What keeps me going depends on the type of work. When I was workingon Viaweb, I was driven by fear of failure. I barely procrastinatedat all then, because there was always something that needed doing,and if I could put more distance between me and the pursuing beastby doing it, why wait?  [  7]Whereas what drives me now, writingessays, is the flaws in them. Between essays I fuss for a few days,like a dog circling while it decides exactly where to lie down. Butonce I get started on one, I don&#39;t have to push myself to work,because there&#39;s always some error or omission already pushing me.  I do make some amount of effort to focus on important topics. Manyproblems have a hard core at the center, surrounded by easier stuffat the edges. Working hard means aiming toward the center to theextent you can. Some days you may not be able to; some days you&#39;llonly be able to work on the easier, peripheral stuff. But you shouldalways be aiming as close to the center as you can without stalling.  The bigger question of what to do with your life is one of theseproblems with a hard core. There are important problems at thecenter, which tend to be hard, and less important, easier ones atthe edges. So as well as the small, daily adjustments involved inworking on a specific problem, you&#39;ll occasionally have to makebig, lifetime-scale adjustments about which type of work to do.And the rule is the same: working hard means aiming toward thecenter \u2014 toward the most ambitious problems.  By center, though, I mean the actual center, not merely the currentconsensus about the center. The consensus about which problems aremost important is often mistaken, both in general and within specificfields. If you disagree with it, and you&#39;re right, that couldrepresent a valuable opportunity to do something new.  The more ambitious types of work will usually be harder, but althoughyou should not be in denial about this, neither should you treatdifficulty as an infallible guide in deciding what to do. If youdiscover some ambitious type of work that&#39;s a bargain in the senseof being easier for you than other people, either because of theabilities you happen to have, or because of some new way you&#39;vefound to approach it, or simply because you&#39;re more excited aboutit, by all means work on that. Some of the best work is done bypeople who find an easy way to do something hard.  As well as learning the shape of real work, you need to figure outwhich kind you&#39;re suited for. And that doesn&#39;t just mean figuringout which kind your natural abilities match the best; it doesn&#39;tmean that if you&#39;re 7 feet tall, you have to play basketball. Whatyou&#39;re suited for depends not just on your talents but perhaps evenmore on your interests. A   deep interest in a topic makes peoplework harder than any amount of discipline can.  It can be harder to discover your interests than your talents.There are fewer types of talent than interest, and they start tobe judged early in childhood, whereas interest in a topic is asubtle thing that may not mature till your twenties, or even later.The topic may not even exist earlier. Plus there are some powerfulsources of error you need to learn to discount. Are you reallyinterested in x, or do you want to work on it because you&#39;ll makea lot of money, or because other people will be impressed with you,or because your parents want you to? [  8]  The difficulty of figuring out what to work on varies enormouslyfrom one person to another. That&#39;s one of the most important thingsI&#39;ve learned about work since I was a kid. As a kid, you get theimpression that everyone has a calling, and all they have to do isfigure out what it is. That&#39;s how it works in movies, and in thestreamlined biographies fed to kids. Sometimes it works that wayin real life. Some people figure out what to do as children andjust do it, like Mozart. But others, like Newton, turn restlesslyfrom one kind of work to another. Maybe in retrospect we can identifyone as their calling \u2014 we can wish Newton spent more time on mathand physics and less on alchemy and theology \u2014 but this is an  illusion induced by hindsight bias. There was no voice calling to him that he could have heard.  So while some people&#39;s lives converge fast, there will be otherswhose lives never converge. And for these people, figuring out whatto work on is not so much a prelude to working hard as an ongoingpart of it, like one of a set of simultaneous equations. For thesepeople, the process I described earlier has a third component: alongwith measuring both how hard you&#39;re working and how well you&#39;redoing, you have to think about whether you should keep working inthis field or switch to another. If you&#39;re working hard but notgetting good enough results, you should switch. It sounds simpleexpressed that way, but in practice it&#39;s very difficult. You shouldn&#39;tgive up on the first day just because you work hard and don&#39;t getanywhere. You need to give yourself time to get going. But how muchtime? And what should you do if work that was going well stops goingwell? How much time do you give yourself then? [  9]  What even counts as good results? That can be really hard to decide.If you&#39;re exploring an area few others have worked in, you may noteven know what good results look like. History is full of examplesof people who misjudged the importance of what they were workingon.  The best test of whether it&#39;s worthwhile to work on something iswhether you find it interesting. That may sound like a dangerouslysubjective measure, but it&#39;s probably the most accurate one you&#39;regoing to get. You&#39;re the one working on the stuff. Who&#39;s in a betterposition than you to judge whether it&#39;s important, and what&#39;s abetter predictor of its importance than whether it&#39;s interesting?  For this test to work, though, you have to be honest with yourself.Indeed, that&#39;s the most striking thing about the whole question ofworking hard: how at each point it depends on being honest withyourself.  Working hard is not just a dial you turn up to 11. It&#39;s a complicated,dynamic system that has to be tuned just right at each point. Youhave to understand the shape of real work, see clearly what kindyou&#39;re best suited for, aim as close to the true core of it as youcan, accurately judge at each moment both what you&#39;re capable ofand how you&#39;re doing, and put in as many hours each day as you canwithout harming the quality of the result. This network is toocomplicated to trick. But if you&#39;re consistently honest andclear-sighted, it will automatically assume an optimal shape, andyou&#39;ll be productive in a way few people are.             Notes  [  1]In &#34;The Bus Ticket Theory of Genius&#34; I said the three ingredientsin great work work were natural ability, determination, and interest.That&#39;s the formula in the preceding stage; determination and interestyield practice and effort.  [  2]I mean this at a resolution of days, not hours. You&#39;ll oftenget somewhere while not working in the sense that the solution toa problem comes to you while taking a   shower, or even in your sleep,but only because you were working hard on it the day before.  It&#39;s good to go on vacation occasionally, but when I go on vacation,I like to learn new things. I wouldn&#39;t like just sitting on a beach.  [  3]The thing kids do in school that&#39;s most like the real versionis sports. Admittedly because many sports originated as games playedin schools. But in this one area, at least, kids are doing exactlywhat adults do.  In the average American high school, you have a choice of pretendingto do something serious, or seriously doing something pretend.Arguably the latter is no worse.  [  4]Knowing what you want to work on doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll be ableto. Most people have to spend a lot of their time working on thingsthey don&#39;t want to, especially early on. But if you know what youwant to do, you at least know what direction to nudge your life in.  [  5]The lower time limits for intense work suggest a solution tothe problem of having less time to work after you have kids: switchto harder problems. In effect I did that, though not deliberately.  [  6]Some cultures have a tradition of performative hard work. Idon&#39;t love this idea, because (a) it makes a parody of somethingimportant and (b) it causes people to wear themselves out doingthings that don&#39;t matter. I don&#39;t know enough to say for sure whetherit&#39;s net good or bad, but my guess is bad.  [  7]One of the reasons people work so hard on startups is thatstartups can fail, and when they do, that failure tends to be bothdecisive and conspicuous.  [  8]It&#39;s ok to work on something to make a lot of money. You needto solve the money problem somehow, and there&#39;s nothing wrong withdoing that efficiently by trying to make a lot at once. I supposeit would even be ok to be interested in money for its own sake;whatever floats your boat. Just so long as you&#39;re conscious of yourmotivations. The thing to avoid is  unconsciously letting the needfor money warp your ideas about what kind of work you find mostinteresting.  [  9]Many people face this question on a smaller scale withindividual projects. But it&#39;s easier both to recognize and to accepta dead end in a single project than to abandon some type of workentirely. The more determined you are, the harder it gets. Like aSpanish Flu victim, you&#39;re fighting your own immune system: Insteadof giving up, you tell yourself, I should just try harder. And whocan say you&#39;re not right?
