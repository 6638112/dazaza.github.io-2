Atomwaffen, a neo-Nazi death squad with   five killings  to their name, is probably the deadliest fascist group to have arisen since 2016. One member of Atomwaffen,   Vasillios Pistolis , was an active duty U.S. marine when he marched at the first Unite the Right rally. Pistolis also   posted regularly  on a series of fascist and white supremacist Discord servers, prior to and after joining Atomwaffen.</p><p>美国的绝大多数家庭恐怖袭击是由White Supremacist组织进行的。 atomwaffen是一个新纳粹死亡小队，他们名称五个杀人，可能是自2016年以来最致命的法西斯群体。奥地利瓦德森（Vasillios Pistolis）的一名成员，当他在第一次联合起来时是一个活跃的美国海洋。集会。 Pistolis还定期在加入atomwaffen之前和之后定期发布在一系列法西斯和白色至高无上的Disdord服务器上。</p><p> The media collective Unicorn Riot has archived hundreds of thousands of posts from these Discord servers.   Their database  includes dozens of conversations where fascists discuss how they were converted to their extremist beliefs. In an effort to understand that process, Bellingcat collected “red-pilling” stories from seventy-five fascist activists. The analysis is below, details on the activists we studied can be found  here.</p><p> 媒体集体Unicorn骚乱已经归于这些不和谐服务器数十万个帖子。他们的数据库包括数十个对话，法西斯主义者讨论如何转换为他们的极端主义信仰。为了了解这个过程，Bellingcat从七十五法西斯活动家收集了“红丸”故事。分析如下，可以在这里找到我们研究的活动分子的详细信息。</p><p>  An online community develops its own lingo over time. Among fascist activists “red-pilling” means converting someone to fascist, racist and anti-Semitic beliefs. The term originates with “The Matrix,” a popular 1999 film. The protagonist is offered the choice between a red pill, which will open his eyes to the reality of a machine-dominated world, and a blue pill, which will return him to ignorance and safety. The definition of “red pill,” as used by fascists, is rather elastic.   Films  and   songs  are described as “red pilled” if they reinforce a far-right worldview. At least one poster referred to   amphetamines  as red-pilled.</p><p>  在线社区随着时间的推移开发自己的灵遍。在法西斯活动家中，“红丸”意味着将某人转变为法西斯，种族主义和反犹太主义信仰。该术语源于“矩阵”，是一部受欢迎的1999电影。主角提供了一种红色丸之间的选择，这将睁开眼睛睁开眼睛的机器主导的世界的现实，以及一个蓝色药丸，这将使他厌恶和安全。法西斯主义者使用的“红丸”的定义相当弹性。如果他们加强了远方世界观，电影和歌曲被描述为“红色丸”。至少一张海报称为安非胺作为红色丸。</p><p> There appears to be no agreed-upon standard for when a human being is red-pilled. Most fascist activists agree that acknowledgement of the Jewish Question, or JQ, is critical. This means believing that Jewish people are at the center of a vast global conspiracy. The end goal of this conspiracy is usually described as “white genocide”, but there are numerous variations.</p><p> 当人类是红色的鸡皮时，似乎没有商定的标准。大多数法西斯活动家都同意确认犹太问题或JQ至关重要。这意味着相信犹太人在巨大的全球阴谋中的中心。这种阴谋的最终目标通常被描述为“白色种族灭绝”，但存在许多变化。</p><p>   Red pilling is described as a gradual process. Individual people can be red-pilled on certain issues and not others. Stefan Molyneux, a popular author and far-right YouTube personality, is seen as being   red-pilled on race  and “the future of the west” even though he is not considered as a fascist. Prominent YouTuber PewPewDie is also often considered   red-pilled . It is accepted that media personalities need to hide their outright fascist beliefs, or “  power level ”, in order to have a chance at red-pilling the general population (usually called “normies”).</p><p>   红色丸被描述为渐进过程。个人可以在某些问题上是红色的，而不是其他人。斯蒂芬·莫利美兴，一个受欢迎的作者和右友友情的个性，被视为竞争中的红丸和“西方的未来”，即使他不被视为法西斯主义者。突出的Youtuber Pewpewdie通常也被认为是红丸。媒体个性需要隐藏他们的彻头彻尾的法西斯信念，或“权力水平”，以便有机会在红色派对（通常被称为“Normies”）。</p><p>   How to red-pill others is a constant topic of conversation. In   this thread  one user talks about how he “skirted the jew question” in order to red-pill a co-worker. Instead, he claims to have exploited his co-worker’s hatred of “SJW”s, a.k.a. social justice warriors. Other users advise   starting the red-pilling process  with the JQ. Disagreements mainly center around which techniques are most effective. The overall goal is quite clear.</p><p>   如何红丸，其他人是一个持续的谈话主题。在这个线程中，一个用户谈论他如何“介绍犹太问题”，以便为同事红丸。相反，他声称已经利用他的同事的仇恨“SJW”，A.K.A.社会正义勇士。其他用户建议使用JQ启动红丸过程。分歧主要是围绕哪种技术最有效的。整体目标非常明确。</p><p>    President Donald Trump  is seen as having red-pilled many Americans. A number of fascist activists credit his candidacy as the start of their awakening.   This conversation  between users Buddy Hobbs and ecce_lux is a useful breakdown of how that looks.</p><p>    唐纳德特朗普总统被视为红皮的许多美国人。一些法西斯主体活动家将他的候选人作为他们的觉醒开始。用户之间的对话伙伴霍布斯和eCCE_LUX是一种有用的崩溃。 </p><p>   “The great meme war” is a reference to time this user spent on 4chan and possibly 8chan, creating far-right memes in order to red-pill other people during the election. The whole exchange paints a picture of a man who was initially ensnared by candidate Trump’s rhetoric and then driven towards far-right media and, eventually, extremist communities on 4chan. There his commitment to fascist ideology crystalized.</p><p>“伟大的MEME WAR”是参考这位用户在4CHAN上花费的时间，可能是8CHAN，创造了远方的模因，以便在选举中进行红丸。整个交易所描绘了一个由候选人特朗普的言论最初被纳入的人的图片，然后在4千万的极端主义社区驱动。他对法西斯思想结晶的承诺。</p><p> The vast majority of fascist activists are male.   Some of these men  even doubt that women can be red-pilled. The   few   users  who identify themselves as female tend to be quite extreme in their beliefs. This is consistent with research into the demographics of the far-right done by the Institute for Family Studies. Fascist and white nationalist organizations are “  overwhelmingly male ,” yet women are more likely to identify with such beliefs.</p><p> 绝大多数法西斯活动家都是男性。其中一些男人甚至怀疑女性可以是红色的。少数识别自己作为女性的用户往往非常极端在他们的信仰中。这与对家庭研究所所做的大型人口统计学的研究一致。法西斯和白人民族主义组织是“绝大多数男性”，但女性更有可能认同这种信仰。</p><p> The American fascist movement has been male-dominated since at least the   aftermath of the Vietnam war . The role of veterans in founding many early far-right organizations may be one explanation as to why. It is also likely that the demographics of certain online communities plays a role.   70% of 4chan users  are male, and 4chan is the second most frequently credited website in red-pilling stories.</p><p> 由于至少在越南战争的后果之后，美国法西斯运动一直是男性主导的。退伍军人在建立许多早期右右翼组织中的作用可能是为什么的解释。某些在线社区的人口统计学也可能发挥作用。 40％的4chan用户是男性，4chan是红色派对故事中第二次最常用的网站。</p><p> Thirty-nine of the 75 fascist activists we studied credit the Internet with their red-pilling. YouTube seems to be the single most frequently discussed website. The specific videos credited, however, span a multitude of creators, from British YouTuber Sargon of Akkad (Carl Benjamin) to Infowars founder Alex Jones.</p><p> 我们研究了75个法西斯活动家的39人，我们将互联网与他们的红丸一起学会。 YouTube似乎是最常讨论的网站。然而，具体的视频贷方跨越了众多创造者，从英国Youtuber Sargon of Akkad（Carl Benjamin）到Infowars创始人Alex Jones。</p><p> Many fascist activists cite a multitude of red-pills which were all integral to them arriving at their current beliefs.  User barD’s   18 March, 2017  post is a great example of this. Here’s how he traces his journey:</p><p> 许多法西斯活动家都引用了众多的红丸，这对他们来说都是一体化的，他们到达目前的信仰。用户Bard's 2017年3月18日帖子是一个很好的例子。这是他如何追踪他的旅程：</p><p> “Get redpilled on Feminism after reading some crazy SJW posts about MLP [My Little Pony] being racist and sexist and anti-lesbian, get redpilled on islam after getting intruiged [sic] by some islamisists [sic] taking in a youtube comments section. Get redpilled on GG (Gamergate) from sargon.”</p><p> “在阅读一些疯狂的SJW帖子后，关于MLP [My Little Pony]是种族主义和性别歧视和反女性，在youtube评论部分中的伊斯兰主义者[sic]拍摄后，在伊斯兰主义评论部分拍摄伊斯兰教的伊斯兰教中，在伊斯兰教中拿出红奔人。从Sargon获得GG（Gamergate）的红斑。“</p><p>    We see a steady spiral, from arguments in comment sections to far-right YouTube personalities to “the_donald” subreddit to 4chan’s /pol/ board and eventually to fascist Discord servers. This user singles out Sargon of Akkad (British Youtuber Carl Benjamin) for special praise and considers him a major influence. One of Sargon’s most popular video series’ is, “Why Do Men Hate #Feminism?” (Episode #1 is titled “  Feminists Hate Women .”)</p><p>    我们看到一个稳定的螺旋，从评论部分到远方YouTube人物到“_donald”菲利特到4Chan's / Pol /董事会，最终向Fascist Discord服务器的争论。这位用户单挑了Akkad（英国Youtuber Carl Benjamin）的Sargon，以特别赞美，并认为他是一个重大影响力。 Sargon最受欢迎的视频系列之一是“为什么男人讨厌#Feminism？” （第1集第1名标题为“女权主义者讨厌女性”。） </p><p> In later posts barD claims the “  gradual red-pilling ” of Sargon’s videos stopped him from being a feminist. He also praises Sargon as an “  easier step ” away from liberal views than outright Nazism. Once he’d taken that step and gotten used to Sargon’s rhetoric, it was   easier  for him to get used to the more extreme atmosphere of /pol/.</p><p>在后期的帖子BARD声称Sargon视频的“渐进式红丸”阻止他成为女权主义者。他还赞扬Sargon，因为远离自由般的野蛮人的“更容易迈出”。一旦他被迈出了习惯于Sargon的言论，他就更容易习惯于更极端的/ POL /。</p><p> It’s not uncommon for white supremacist, fascist and anti-Semitic beliefs to arise initially as the result of humor. Four of the seventy-five activists we studied mentioned ironic memes as major red-pills. In this thread, a user recalls how his first red-pill came during an argument over   an anti-Semitic tweet  posted to Facebook.</p><p> 白色至高无上的师，法西斯和反犹太主义信仰最初是幽默的结果并不罕见。我们研究了七十五名活动分子中的四名中提到了讽刺的模因作为主要的红丸。在这个线程中，一个用户回顾他的第一个红丸在争论期间如何通过发布到Facebook的反犹太人推文。</p><p>  Another user asks FucknOathMate if he was “only doing it ironically at first,” and he replies: “Well sort of.” He says he knew Jewish people were “weird” and “ran everything,” but he wasn’t yet a Holocaust denier or a fascist. Again, we see someone sliding gradually into extremist beliefs. Ironic memes gave this individual a chance to get used to the temperature before diving in.</p><p>  另一个用户如果他“起初只是在讽刺地做讽刺意味”，他还会询问他妈的：“很好。”他说他知道犹太人是“奇怪的”，“跑了一切”，但他还没有大屠杀旦尼尔或法西斯主义者。再次，我们看到有人逐渐滑入极端主义的信仰。讽刺的模因让这个人有机会在潜水前习惯温度。</p><p> Thirty-six fascist activists traced the start of their red-pilling process to an event that occurred offline. Five of these people credited their families with red-pilling them. For the other thirty-one, methods ran a rather wide gamut.</p><p> 三十六个法西斯活动家追溯了他们的红丸过程开始到离线发生的事件。其中五个人将他们的家人归功于红色丸。对于其他三十一，方法运行了一个相当宽敞的赌场。</p><p> Four fascists say they were red-pilled while tripping on LSD. User Europa is a typical example of this trend. He claims his interest in Nazism started in childhood, with his dad watching Hitler documentaries “  every day .” Europa carried this interest into adulthood, watching Hitler documentaries and speeches while   taking LSD . This convinced him to start “researching” Nazism which, eventually, inspired him to become an activist.</p><p> 四个法西斯主义者说他们在绊倒LSD时是红色的。用户Europa是这一趋势的典型示例。他声称他对纳粹主义的兴趣开始于童年，他的父亲每天看着希特勒纪录片。“欧罗巴将这种兴趣带入成年，在服用LSD时观看希特勒纪录片和演讲。这使他开始“研究”纳粹主义，最终，激励他成为一个活动家。</p><p> Other activists cite   living in a diverse area , reading a copy of   Mein Kampf  ,  mass-shooter Anders Brevik’s manifesto  and numerous other factors as their first red-pills. Since our study of these activists is based on messages they exchanged with each other online, we can conclude that even when indoctrination begins offline new converts inevitably go online to deepen their beliefs.</p><p> 其他活动家们引用生活在不同的地区，阅读Mein Kampf，Mass-Shoper Anders Brevik的宣言以及许多其他因素作为他们的第一个红丸。由于我们对这些活动家的研究基于他们在线互相交换的消息，我们可以得出结论，即使灌输开始脱机新的皈依者不可避免地上网以加深他们的信仰。</p><p> Internet communities and social media services have been integral to the recent growth of the fascist right. The rest of this article will focus on the major online sources of fascist red-pilling.</p><p> 互联网社区和社交媒体服务一直是最近的法西斯权者的发展。本文的其余部分将重点关注法西斯红丸的主要在线来源。 </p><p>  Ten of our seventy-five fascists credited 4chan with red-pilling them. Many other activists have referenced it as a place that was critical in their radicalization. The /pol/ board is generally seen as a breeding ground for young fascists. Anticom founder   Haupsturmfuhrer Pepe  credits 4chan as the site that has “redpilled the most” people. For a number of activists, 4chan is the last “mainstream” website they frequent before getting involved with explicitly fascist media.</p><p>我们七十五的十五个法西斯中的十名被认为是红色的鸡肉。许多其他活动家已将其引用为一个在激进化中至关重要的地方。 / POL /董事会通常被视为年轻法西斯主义者的繁殖地。 Antimomed Forder Haupsturmfuhrer Pepe Credits 4Chan作为“红牌最多”的网站。对于许多活动家，4chan是他们常常在参与明确的法西斯媒体之前常用的最后一个“主流”网站。</p><p>  In this post, Auralevels claims that 4chan led him to The Right Stuff (referred to as “TRS”) and The Daily Stormer (“stormer”), two neo-Nazi news and culture sites (a recent Daily Stormer article was titled, “Disney’s Jew CEO Admits They Kiked the Goyim with Too Many Star Wars Movies,” to give an example of the kind of materials they publish).</p><p>  在这篇文章中，AuralEvels声称，4chan将他带到正确的东西（称为“TRS”）和日常监督者（“Stormer”），两个新纳粹新闻和文化网站（最近的日常监督者文章标题为“，”迪士尼的犹太人首席执行官承认他们带着太多星球战争电影koyim，“举例说明他们发布的材料的一个例子。</p><p> 4chan and its descendant 8chan make up a large chunk of what is commonly known as the alt-right. These places are considered fairly moderate by fascist activists in the Discord conversations presented. The alt-right is often referred to as the “alt-light.” The intent seems to be halfway between a term of endearment and an insult.  Fascist activists view the alt-right as silly, but also as a crucial recruiting ground.</p><p> 4Chan及其后代8chan构成了一大块俗称alt-over的东西。在讨论的谈话中，这些地方被法西斯活动家被认为相当温和。 alt-over通常被称为“Alt-Light”。意图似乎是一个昵称和侮辱之间的中途。法西斯活动家将Alt-Live视为愚蠢，也是一个关键的招聘地面。</p><p>   This view is common but not universal. Some activists accuse the so-called alt-light of “paralyzing the supply chain”. They accuse them of allowing “normies” to feel radical for reading sites like Breitbart, while meanwhile “[they] don’t realize that those are quite literally (((controlled op)))…” The use of parentheses here is meant to convey the belief that such websites are secretly run by Jewish elites in order to split the right.</p><p>   这种观点是常见的，但不是普遍的。一些活动人士指责所谓的“瘫痪供应链”的Alt-Light。他们指责他们允许“规范”感到自由基，以便阅读像Breitbart这样的网站，虽然同时“[他们]毫无意识到这些都是完全的（（（受控的OP）））......”这里的使用括号是意味着传达这种网站的信念暗中犹太精英才能拆除右侧。</p><p> Despite these doubts, it’s clear that 4chan’s /pol/ and other alt-right communities provided a great deal of the fascist right’s manpower. Three of the fascists we studied praised the so-called “  the Kekosphere .” “  kekism ” and “  kek ” with their red-pilling.</p><p> 尽管有这些疑虑，但很明显，4Chan的/ POL /和其他ALT-officity社区提供了大量的法西斯右派的人力。我们学习的三个法西斯主义者称赞所谓的“Kekophere”。 “kekism”和“kek”与他们的红色丸。</p><p> I should note that one of the more frustrating elements about covering the fascist right is that much of what they say sounds ridiculous and makes them appear less than serious. This is why it is important to remember that these groups have a body count and represent a real threat. Their absurdity does not negate their danger.</p><p> 我应该注意到，关于覆盖法西斯语权的更令人沮丧的元素之一是他们说的大部分声音荒谬，使它们显得不到严重。这就是为什么重要的是要记住这些群体的身体计数并代表真正的威胁。他们的荒谬并没有否定他们的危险。</p><p> Kek is a term that first appeared in the MMORPG World of Warcraft. The two sides in that game, Horde and Alliance, were not supposed to communicate with one another. So when a member of one side chatted at another, their words were run through a filter to make it sound like a foreign language. When Horde players would type “lol,” it was translated as “kek”. Over time “kek” became another way of expressing laughter online. On 4chan’s /pol/ board kek took on a grander meaning and came to embody the essence of the “meme magic” that first made the alt-right so prominent.  The cultural rock tumbler of /pol/ eventually transmuted kek into Kekistan, a fictional ethno-state for “  shitposters .”</p><p> Kek是一个首次出现在MMORPG世界魔兽世界中的术语。这次比赛中的双方，部落和联盟，不应该互相互动。因此，当一侧聊在另一侧的成员时，他们的话通过过滤器运行，使其听起来像外语。当部落玩家会键入“大声笑”时，它被翻译为“kek”。随着时间的推移“kek”成为另一种表达笑声的方式。在4chan的/ POL / Board Kek上迎接了一个更伟大的意义，并来体现了“Meme Magic”的本质，首先使Alt-over如此突出。 / POL /最终传播KEKISTAN的文化摇滚翻转器，是“施皮特斯人”的虚构的民族状态。 </p><p> Kekistan first became prominent with the enthusiastic endorsement of YouTuber Sargon of Akkad. And for many people, including Sargon, Kekistan is just a dumb Internet joke. In 2017 Sargon of Akkad announced that he would try to register “ Kekistani” as an official ethnic group for the 2020 U.K. census. This all unraveled into a parody of the refugee crisis.</p><p>凯克斯坦首先与Akkad的Youtuber Sargon的热情认可突出。对于包括Sargon，包括Sargon的人，Kekistan只是一个愚蠢的互联网笑话。 2017年，阿克卡的Sargon宣布，他会试图将“Kekistani”注册为2020年U.K.人口普查的官方族群。这一切都解开了难民危机的模仿。</p><p>   And over time Kekistan came to be used as something of a Trojan horse by the fascist right. One good example is the flag of Kekistan.</p><p>   随着时间的推移，Kekistan被Fascist权利用作特洛伊木马的东西。一个很好的例子是凯克斯坦的旗帜。</p><p>  This design of the flag, benign at first glance, is just a color-inverted variant of the German Kriegsflagge (battle flag) from the Nazi era.</p><p>  这种旗帜的设计，始终是良性的，只是来自纳粹时代的德国Kriegsflagge（战斗国旗）的颜色倒变种。</p><p>  Kekistan is a   common topic of discussion  on fascist Discord servers. Opinions vary from calling it a “forced meme” to expressing   serious devotion  to the idea. Kekistan flags and other regalia are often seen at   Patriot Prayer  rallies and other   far-right protests . Some fascists lament that many people who fly the flag   don’t understand the Nazi origins of its design . But many know exactly what they are signaling when they put one on a flagpole, or their helmet:</p><p>  Kekistan是对Fascist Discord服务器讨论的共同主题。意见因将其称为“强迫模因”而致力于对这个想法的严重奉献。 Kekistan旗帜和其他Regalia经常在爱国者祷告集团和其他远方抗议活动中看到。一些Fascists哀叹着许多飞旗的人不了解其设计的纳粹起源。但是，当他们把一个放在旗杆上时，许多人确切地知道他们是发信号通知的</p><p>  You can see the whole USAF video   here . It’s frustratingly light on details. The contractor wearing this flag may just be a channer who finds Kekistan funny. He may be a committed fascist signaling to his comrades. Or he may be somewhere in between, finding himself pulled further and further towards extremism as time goes on. When this footage went viral, the contractor   was fired  by his employer, MAG Aerospace.</p><p>  您可以在此处看到整个USAF视频。细节令人沮丧。穿着这个旗帜的承包商可能只是一个发现Kekistan有趣的Channer。他可能是他同志的忠诚法西斯语。或者他之间可能在某个地方，发现自己进一步拉动并进一步走向极端主义，随着时间的推移。当这种镜头去了病毒时，承包商被他的雇主，Mag Aeropach解雇。</p><p> While 4chan’s /pol/ board is the most common source of Internet-based red-pills, a close second appears to be the Infowars media network of famed American conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.</p><p> 虽然4Chan的/ POL /董事会是基于互联网的红丸最常见的来源，但一个近的第二个似乎是着名美国阴谋理论家亚历克斯琼斯的Infowars媒体网络。</p><p>  Six of our fascist activists credit Alex Jones with red-pilling them. Jones has been a prominent radio and Internet conspiracy theorist since the mid-1990s and is the founder of the media organization Infowars. Jones first rose to prominence when he served as executive producer  on   Loose Change,  a series of films that began in 2005 and which  helped ignite the “9/11 Truther” movement.</p><p>  我们的六名法西斯活动家信用亚历克斯琼斯用红丸。琼斯自20世纪90年代中期以来一直是一个着名的广播和互联网阴谋理论家，是媒体组织Infowars的创始人。当琼斯担任行政制作人的宽松变化时，琼斯首先崛起，这是一系列始于2005的电影，这有助于点燃“9/11特工人”运动。 </p><p> Two more activists on our list credit Infowars editor   Paul Joseph Watson  with their red-pilling. Conspiracy theories appear to be one of the more well-trodden roads into fascist nationalism. This may have something to do with the fact that   lack of interpersonal trust and employment insecurity  are heavily correlated with belief in conspiracy theories. In 1995 Umberto Eco   wrote that  at the center of fascist psychology was, “ …the   obsession with a plot , possibly an international one.” He believed that this was because fascist believers needed to feel “besieged”.</p><p>我们列表中的两名活动家在我们的列表中编辑Paul Joseph Watson及其红丸。阴谋理论似乎是更良好的备案到法西斯民族主义的道路之一。这可能与人际信任和就业不安全缺乏与阴谋理论的信仰密切相关。 1995年，Umberto Eco写道，在法西斯心理学的中心是，“......对情节的痴迷，可能是一个国际的情节。”他相信这是因为法西斯信徒需要感受到“围困”。</p><p> Whatever the “why,” numerous Discord posts reveal the “how.”  User Harleen Kekzel claims to have identified as a “  polyamorous genderqueer masculine leaning pansexual ” at age 16. She claims her red-pilling process started with Alex Jones.</p><p> 无论“为什么，”众多不合解的帖子揭示了“如何。”用户哈雷肯克克尔声称已被确定为16岁时被确定为“多元化的性别阳性脑脑倾斜胰岛素”。她声称她的红丸过程始于亚历克斯琼斯。</p><p>  She explains later that she was “was conspiracy pilled,”  but also says she and her husband weren’t red-pilled until the Pulse nightclub massacre. A number of other fascist activists say their journey to the far right started   with conspiracy theories . Kombat-Unit, one of the most prominent posters in these Discord conversations, at one point notes his approval of this source of new converts; “  if you can get some guys through UFO stuff I’m not complaining .” In response, another user says:</p><p>  她稍后解释说，她“是阴谋劫持”，但也说她和她的丈夫直到脉冲夜总会大屠杀直到盗窃。一些其他法西斯主义者的活动家表示，他们走向最右侧的旅程始于阴谋理论。 Kombat-units是这些不和谐对话中最突出的海报之一，一方面指出他对这一新转换来源的批准; “如果你可以通过不明飞行物的东西，我不能抱怨。”作为回应，另一个用户说：</p><p>   Alex Jones and Infowars are also viewed with skepticism by many fascist activists. Some disregard them as “  controlled opposition .” The general opinion seems to be that Jones is useful, but far too milquetoast for people who cheerfully support National Socialism.</p><p>   亚历克斯琼斯和婴儿用品也被许多法西斯活动家怀疑。有些人忽视了他们作为“受控反对”。一般意见似乎是琼斯很有用，但对于高兴地支持国家社会主义的人来说，甚至太迷住了。</p><p>   Most episodes of Alex Jones’s popular streaming and radio shows center on him exposing aspects of a grand “globalist” conspiracy to take over the world. Everything from mass shootings to terrorist attacks is accused of being staged at the behest of these globalists.   A number  of fascist activists use the term “  globalist ” as a synonym for “  Jewish .” It is not hard to find people who have interpreted Jones’ work this way:</p><p>   大多数亚历克斯·琼斯的流行流媒体和广播节目显示了他的中心，暴露了一个盛大的“全球会”阴谋来接管世界的方面。从大规模枪击事件到恐怖主义袭击的一切都被指控在这些全球运动员的截止日期。许多法西斯活动家使用术语“全球会”作为“犹太人”的同义词。找到这种解释琼斯的人的工作并不难：</p><p>   Infowars reached the height of its influence as a result of sites like Facebook and YouTube.   By the time   they were kicked off of YouTube, Infowars had more than 2.4 million followers and 1.6 billion page views across 36,000 videos. It is likely that banning Infowars will reduce the flow of recruits to far right groups. But even without Infowars, YouTube still provides a pathway for those interested in the American fascist movement.</p><p>   由于Facebook和YouTube等网站，Infowars达到了其影响力的高度。当他们被禁止YouTube时，Infowars横跨36,000个视频有超过240万追随者和16亿页浏览景观。禁止禁止的Infowars将减少新兵流程到远方的群体。但即使没有Infowars，YouTube仍然为那些对美国法西斯运动感兴趣的人提供了一种途径。</p><p>  15 out of 75 fascist activists we studied credited YouTube videos with their red-pilling.   In this thread , a group of white supremacists debate with a “civic nationalist” who says he won’t judge an entire race by the actions of a few. It is suggested that he watch a video by American Renaissance, a white supremacist publication. The video, “  What the Founders Really Thought About Race ,” is essentially a history lesson about why the U.S. founding fathers thought race-mixing was bad. It endorses genocide, via the bearded face of James Garfield:</p><p>  在75个法西斯活动家中有15名，我们研究了用他们的红色杀菌剂归功于YouTube视频。在这个帖子中，一群白人上级主义者与“公民民族主义者”辩论，他说他不会通过一些人的行动来判断整个种族。有人建议他观看美国文艺复兴的视频，这是一个白色至上的出版物。视频，“创始人真正想到的比赛是什么”，基本上是一个关于美国为什么的历史课程，为什么创始的父亲认为比赛混合很糟糕。它通过James Garfield的胡子脸赞同种族灭绝： </p><p>  Fascists who become red-pilled through YouTube often start with comparatively less extreme right-wing personalities, like   Ben Shapiro  or Milo Yiannopolous.</p><p>通过youtube成为红丸的法西斯主义者经常从比较不那么极端的右翼人物，就像Ben Shahiro或Milo Yiannopous一样。</p><p>   One user  explained that he was a “moderate republican” before “Steven Crowder, Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopolos, Black Pidgeon Speaks,” and other far-right YouTubers slowly red-pilled him. Over time he “moved further and further right until [he] could no longer stand them. That’s why [he likes] those groups even still, because if we just had the Fascists, we’d never convert anyone.”</p><p>   一个用户解释说，他是“史蒂文·众群，保罗约瑟夫·沃森，米洛·义诺，黑皮脊柱说话，”和其他远方的友好慢慢夺取他。随着时间的推移，他“进一步搬到了，直到[他]再也无法忍受了。这就是为什么[他喜欢这些群体甚至还在，因为如果我们刚刚拥有法西斯主义者，我们永远不会转换任何人。“</p><p> Other YouTubers like   JonTron  also come up in red-pilling discussions. At least three fascists credit Sargon of Akkad with starting their journey. An equal number credit Milo Yiannopoulos. Steven Crowder is referenced as a   great red-piller . The users who talk about these creators appear to have watched a great number of their videos. Creators are referenced more often than specific videos.</p><p> 其他YouTubers这样的YouTubers也会出现在红丸讨论中。至少有三个法西斯主义者的拿回圣人信用纱，开始他们的旅程。平等的数字信用Milo Yiannopoulos。史蒂文队员被称为一个伟大的红丸。谈论这些创造者的用户似乎观看了大量的视频。创建者比特定视频更频繁地引用。</p><p> There is, however, one single video that is mentioned repeatedly.   Four   separate   activists   all  identified 2013’S   The Greatest Story Never Told  as their red-pill.</p><p> 然而，有一个单独的视频重复提到。四名独立的活动家全部确定2013年最伟大的故事从未被告知过他们的红丸。</p><p>  Producer Dennis Wise intended   The Greatest Story Never Told  to present a “  more balanced and truthful ” depiction of World War II. The documentary is almost six hours long and clunkily edited. It completely leaves out the Holocaust. It is a surprising candidate for the most influential single piece of modern fascist propaganda, but it   may in fact  be that. Or it may just be the most memorable piece of propaganda consumed by several young men on their long and twisted  roads to radicalization.</p><p>  制片人Dennis明智的意图最伟大的故事从未被告知过上关于第二次世界大战的“更加平衡和真实”的描述。纪录片近六个小时长，笨拙地编辑。它完全留下了大屠杀。这是一个令人惊讶的候选人，最具影响力的单曲现代法西斯宣传，但实际上可能是这样的。或者它可能只是几名年轻男性在他们的长期和扭曲的道路上消耗的最令人难忘的宣传。</p><p> Human beings are not simple creatures, and so no person’s journey to such an extremist belief system can be boiled down to just “YouTube did it” or “4chan did it.” Millions of people have been exposed to ironic racism and /pol/ without going on to don a swastika armband. Radicalization is a process, and the goal of this study is to reveal several of the factors that can act to prime and nudge a young mind from laughing at Holocaust jokes to truly believing that Hitler did nothing wrong.</p><p> 人类不是简单的生物，所以没有人对这样一个极端主义者的信仰系统的旅程可以逐渐煮到“youtube做到了”或“4chan做到了”。数百万人被暴露于讽刺的种族主义和/ pol /而没有继续唐鹬臂章。激进化是一个过程，这项研究的目标是揭示几个可以采取行动，从嘲笑大屠杀笑话来真正相信希特勒没有错的因素。 </p></div><div id="story_share_this"><div class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons"></div></div><div class="text-break sotry_link page_narrow"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/">https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/</a></div><div class="story_tags page_narrow"><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/activists/">#activists</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-light my_tag"><a href="/tag/法西斯/">#法西斯</a></button></div></div><div class="my_movie_list_item shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web2.0/">#web2.0</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/google/">#google</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/设计/">#设计</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/创意/">#创意</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/摄影/">#摄影</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/游戏/">#游戏</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/图片/">#图片</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/软件/">#软件</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/视频/">#视频</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/手机/">#手机</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/广告/">#广告</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/apple/">#apple</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/iphone/">#iphone</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/网站/">#网站</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/免费/">#免费</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/下载/">#下载</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/windows/">#windows</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/微软/">#微软</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/firefox/">#firefox</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/苹果/">#苹果</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/blog/">#blog</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/音乐/">#音乐</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/博客/">#博客</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/wordpress/">#wordpress</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/恶搞/">#恶搞</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/艺术/">#艺术</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/qq/">#qq</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/web/">#web</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/谷歌/">#谷歌</a></button><button type="button" class="btn btn-link my_tag"><a href="/tag/工具/">#工具</a></button></div></div></div><div id="my_footer"><div class=""><a href="/tags/">tags</a> <a href="/users/">users</a></div>&copy;2012-2021 diglog.com </div></div></body></html>
